We used specialized instruments on a vessel to measure water temperature and saltiness along a repeated route, covering four major sea basins. This unique, long-term record is now publicly available and crucial for improving sea models and monitoring the health and dynamics of this important European Sea. 
 The data set presented here consists of Conductivity–Temperature–Depth (CTD) observations collected during 96 research cruises of R/V Oceania across the southern Baltic Sea between 1997 and 2024. The collection comprises towed and vertical station profiles acquired along a repeat transect spanning the Arkona Basin, Bornholm Basin, Słupsk Furrow, and Gdańsk Basin. Acquisition and post-processing procedures include standardized parsing of CNV/TXT files, robust time/position handling, pressure-binning to 1 dbar, median filtering, automated geolocation quality control, and pruning of incomplete profiles. The dataset enables analyses of seasonal to decadal variability in temperature and salinity, inflow propagation, ventilation events, and model validation. Manufacturer specifications for the principal instruments (Guildline 87104, Idronaut OS316/OS316Plus, Sea-Bird SBE49, Sea-Bird SBE19plus) are summarized to inform uncertainty assessment."

It integrates structural components and presents a fault classification by importance, amount of documentation and seismogenic potential. This last parameter is assessed by analysing the amount of observed seismicity near the faults, amount of surface deformation estimated from GNSS velocities, and the age of the last known rupture on the fault. 
 The South-East of France has been structured by numerous tectonic episodes resulting in a complex compound of crustal deformations. This fallouts in a large network of faults which have evolved throughout subsequent tectonic events. Nevertheless, the present-day tectonic deformation is slow and of debated origin, giving place to a low to moderate seismicity. This seismotectonic context is a challenge for seismic hazard analysis, specifically for the identification and characterisation of potentially active faults. In this study we present a fault-related data compilation, named South-East France Potentially Active Faults (SEFPAF, Mowbray et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17235395), which integrates structural components from geological maps, previous neotectonic databases and fault-specific studies. Our objective is to provide a new, well documented, and modular fault database. Multiple structural representations per fault are presented, allowing the end-user to choose from the various parameter value options. With an end purpose of identifying the most relevant faults for seismic hazard assessment, we build a series of indices which allow fault prioritization: the Importance index (I), the Documentation index (D) and, the Seismogenic Potential index (SP). The first classifies faults into major, secondary and minor based on the source's description of the structure; the second analyses the quantity of information known for each fault; the last intends to decipher seismically active faults by integrating the age of the last documented rupture, the spatial correlation with seismic flux and, the spatial correlation with geodetic strain. SEFPAF may have various applications, amongst them we illustrate the first step towards the development of a fault model for seismic hazard analysis: we identify relevant faults to model by adjusting the index criteria and, propose idealized geometries for a set of 20 faults which can subsequently be used as composite seismogenic sources."

The data underwent rigorous, basin-adapted quality control to remove systematic biases, unifying four decades of fragmented data, delivering two complementary products: the aggregated original cruise data product and the bias-adjusted data synthesis product. 
 The Mediterranean Sea (MedSea) is highly sensitive to climate-driven changes in temperature, oxygen, and pH, among other variables. To better assess these long-term trends, we developed CARIMED (CARbon, tracers, and ancillary data In the MEDiterranean Sea), the first comprehensive, harmonised data synthesis product for the MedSea. CARIMED integrates hydrographic, inorganic carbon, transient tracer, and ancillary measurements from 46 research cruises spanning the period from 1976 to 2018, containing observations for the entire water column across all MedSea sub-basins. A substantial component of the data was retrieved from fragmented or locally archived historical records, thus consolidating previously inaccessible measurements. Following global synthesis approaches, CARIMED applies a quality-controlled, and bias-adjusted framework. A key adaptation was the secondary quality control (2QC) procedure, specifically tailored to the MedSea's unique hydrography, utilising sub-basin divisions and supplementary checks (including statistical consistency assessments) to resolve complex, often contradictory, inter-cruise offsets. This rigorous process minimised systematic biases, yielding a dataset with improved consistency, and highlights the urgent need for adapted standard operating procedures and reference materials to address the MedSea biogeochemical particularities. CARIMED delivers two complementary, freely available products: the aggregated original cruise data product (https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/17785; García-Ibáñez et al., 2025) and the final bias-adjusted data synthesis product (https://doi.org/10.25921/cp5b-zq67; Álvarez et al., 2025). This essential resource establishes a new benchmark for assessing long-term biogeochemical trends, validating regional ocean models, and supporting climate-change mitigation and adaptation strategies in this rapidly changing semi-enclosed basin."
10.5194/essd-2025-427,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用多卫星融合技术（包括静止轨道和极轨卫星的FRP数据）构建了中国开放生物质燃烧排放清单（COBBEI），并提出了基于FRP特征的过滤规则来校正火灾点。这些数据对于空气质量监测、环境政策制定和火灾应急响应具有重要意义。,"['air quality', 'satellite observations', 'Fengyun-4A', 'FRP', 'biomass burning']",﻿Jingwen Shi;Yaqin Ji;Wenju Xu;Ruixing Shen;Jiaofan Ma;Yuexin Zhao;Xingchen Zhou;Yushang Ma;Yinchang Feng,China Open Biomass Burning Emissions Inventory (COBBEI) from 2020 to 2023: Multi-Satellite Fusion via FRP-Based Filtering Rules,"In this study, we constructed China's Open Biomass Combustion Emission Inventory (COBBEI) for the years 2020–2023. This was the first fusion of Fire radiation power (FRP) data from the Fengyun-4A geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites. We further proposed 5 filtering rules based on FRP characteristics. COBBEI could fill data gaps in China's open biomass burning emission inventories and provide key data for air quality models, environmental policy development, and fire emergency response. 
 Pollutants released from open biomass burning (OBB) considerably impact air quality, human health, and ecosystems. Only a few studies have used geostationary satellites to monitor OBB emissions in China. Therefore, we construct the China Open Biomass Burning Emissions Inventory (COBBEI) from 2020 to 2023. This dataset included eight pollutants with a temporal resolution of 1 hour and a spatial resolution of 2 km. The COBBEI integrated multi-satellite data, including MODIS, NPP, and Fengyun-4A (FY-4A). The Fire Radiation Power (FRP) data were reconstructed to the FRP cycle, and we integrated the curves to obtain the hourly biomass burned. We also developed five filtering rules based on FRP, considering fire point frequency, radiation values, timing, and variation. These rules were applied to correct the land cover maps, and their validity was verified. The annual average emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, K, and LG were 46530, 2262, 132, 82, 25, 247, 11, and 12 Gg, respectively. The spatial distribution characteristics of all eight pollutants were generally consistent. Northeast China served as a major center of pollutant emissions. Different types of fires exhibited various spatial distributions. By validating the method and comparing it with other databases, it was confirmed that COBBEI reduced uncertainty in the OBB emission inventory by providing more information on fire points and effectively screening out fires that were not from OBB. The dataset could offer essential data for air quality modeling, environmental policy development, and fire emergency response strategies.

Plastics, recognized as reservoirs of numerous chemical additives with documented but rarely investigated PFAS usage, represent a potential unidentified source. Here, 105 plastic products representing 11 types of polymers were analyzed, with 20 PFAS from 6 classes identified (confidence levels of 3 or better). Polycarbonate (PC) exhibited the highest average total PFAS concentration (713 ng/g), primarily dominated by PFBS (97%), reaching up to 6130 ng/g. PFBS, commonly co-occurred with a monohydrogen-substituted PFBS (H-PFBS), particularly enriched in PC components from electronic products, indicating intentional use as flame retardants. Consistent PFBS to H-PFBS peak area ratios observed in PC samples (∼4%) and industrial PFBS products (0.07−3%), along with patent records, suggest H-PFBS as a manufacturing impurity. Simulated leaching experiments in a realistic scenario showed rapid migration of PFBS and H-PFBS into both freshwater and seawater, achieving equilibrium releases up to 39% within 14 days. Annual PFBS emissions from PC plastics to landfill leachates in China were estimated at ∼40 kg, contributing ∼10% of the total landfill-derived PFAS flux. These findings identify that PC plastics may represent a previously underrecognized contributor to PFBS contamination in landfill leachates, emphasizing the urgent need for safer plastic additives and enhanced waste management."

To address this, we developed GP-BT, a Gaussian Process Bayesian Tuning framework that systematically optimizes kernel selection and hyperparameters by directly minimizing cross-validation loss, explicitly prioritizing generalization over training set fitting. Comprehensive evaluation across three environmental data sets demonstrated GP-BT’s superior robustness compared to conventional algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost) and standard GP models. The GP-BT’s practical value was confirmed through 52 independent laboratory experiments, achieving lower prediction errors on unseen conditions. The method’s conservative learning strategy─avoiding aggressive fitting of sparse, noisy data points─proved crucial for reliable real-world performance. Applied to combined sewer overflows treatment optimization, GP-BT uncovered experimental conditions achieving 98% removal efficiency, compared to 89% predicted by the overfitted Random Forest model. Experimental validation confirmed these predictions, revealing substantial process potential masked by traditional modeling approaches. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that GP-BT’s interpretations better aligned with established physicochemical mechanisms, properly emphasizing reagent importance over less controllable factors. Beyond specific applications, this work provides environmental researchers with a ready-to-use, rigorously validated framework for extracting reliable insights from costly, small-scale experimental data sets. To maximize impact, we provide an open-source Python package (pip install bayesian-gp-cvloss) and interactive web platform (www.ai4env.world), enabling widespread adoption of robust ML practices that can accelerate discovery of hidden performance potential in environmental technologies."

This study used a mouse model with gut dysbiosis induced by cefoperazone to explore As bioaccumulation, transformation, and excretion. By integrating absolute quantification methods, this study monitored the responses of gut microbiota, As biotransformation genes (ABGs), and gut metabolites in mice exposed to 1 and 10 mg/L As. Arsenic accumulation in the liver, spleen, heart, ileum, and blood was markedly decreased in gut dysbiosis mice exposed to 10 mg/L As. These mice also exhibited lower proportions of DMA(V) and As(V) in the liver compared with normal mice. A total of 17 ABGs were detected in the mouse gut, with a significant reduction in their absolute abundance in gut dysbiosis mice (e.g., arsC, arsH, and arsB genes). Consistently, gut dysbiosis mice had lower bacterial loads, particularly for Alloprevotella and Bacteroides, accompanied by the upregulation of “amino acids” and “fatty acid esters.” Association analysis predicted several specific bacteria carrying ABGs, exemplified by Bacteroides carrying the arsC gene. Our findings provided further insights into As metabolism mediated by gut microbiota, for better understanding As-induced toxicity and disease risk."

Although iron‐bound organic carbon (OC‐FeR) critically modulates permafrost carbon‐climate feedbacks, its decadal‐scale variability and response to this regime shift remain poorly constrained. Focusing on the East Siberian Arctic, a hotspot of land‐to‐ocean permafrost carbon transfer, we established critical linkages between marine sedimentary OC‐FeR burial records and terrestrial permafrost‐climate dynamics. Results revealed that coastal OC‐FeR reservoirs exhibited temporally‐distinct responses to permafrost thawing dynamics. During the pre‐2000s, the progressive decline in OC‐FeR coincided with watershed‐scale soil moisture redistribution driven by gradual active‐layer deepening, which preferentially retained OC‐FeR in permafrost, attenuating its land‐to‐ocean fluxes. Since 2000s, although abrupt thaw has rapidly mobilized OC, ∼19% of sedimentary OC remained stabilized as OC‐FeR, thus partially decoupling abrupt thaw from immediate permafrost carbon‐climate feedbacks. Therefore, this mineralogical buffering mechanism can attenuate the net climate impact of accelerating abrupt thaw across the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere."

We report herein high‐frequency field observations of wind‐blown sand processes over the Gobi surface under extremely high winds in eastern Xinjiang, China. The results reveal that the power‐law exponent of the scaling relationship between Qm and friction wind velocity (uτ) in the extremely high winds with high gravel coverage Gobi area can reach 15.51, significantly exceeding that on sandy surfaces. Meanwhile, there is a favorable power‐law between Qm and the fluctuation intensity of the vertical wind velocity (Iw), whereas the correlation between Qm and the streamwise fluctuation intensity (Iu) is weak. Therefore, Iw has a significant application in constructing the prediction model for Qm over such Gobi surfaces. This study provides a new insight into the quantitative analysis of the aeolian transport over the windy Gobi areas."

However, their efficiency in transferring solar wind energy into the upper atmosphere remains a fundamental and not well‐understood question. This is due to their global presence, which cannot be fully quantified by spatially limited observations, and the need for self‐consistent global modeling to account for their dependence on dynamic, inhomogeneous magnetic fields and plasma densities. In this study we use a purely global magnetohydrodynamic model to investigate energy inputs to the ionosphere in the form of Poynting flux. Oscillations in solar wind dynamic pressure excite field line resonances in the magnetosphere. The total Alfvénic Poynting flux entering the ionosphere can be comparable to the total quasi‐steady Poynting flux under northward interplanetary magnetic field. The efficiency of this energy transfer via ULF waves depends on the driving frequency of the solar wind and the ionospheric Pedersen conductance."

Twelve years of balloon‐borne simultaneous measurements of upper tropospheric humidity and optical particle backscatter during the Asian summer monsoon are used to consolidate our understanding of cirrus. Thin cirrus are typically supersaturated with respect to ice (median RHi ≳ 100%) in their upper parts, have a median RHi ≈ 100% toward their center, and RHi < 100% below. Most RHi remain below 120%, suggesting that these clouds form predominantly by heterogeneous ice nucleation. In rare cases, RHi > 140% enables homogeneous nucleation. Thicker cirrus show higher backscatter, indicating numerous particles that likely nucleated homogeneously in deep convection. These clouds slowly evaporate, as evidenced by slight subsaturation (RHi ≲ 100%) throughout their vertical extent. Cloud‐base RHi ≈ 70% suggest rapid crystal settling and evaporation.

The other reason is TCs' less tornado‐conducive environments in China. TC environments in China are more dynamically favorable but less thermodynamically conducive to tornadogenesis relative to the U.S. The composite impact is that the regions with the most favorable thermodynamic and kinematic conditions mismatch in China, with the former in the southwest quadrant and the latter in the northeast quadrant of TCs, whereas they overlap in the northeast quadrant in the U.S. and thus lead to a larger composite parameter. This mismatch in China primarily stems from tornadic TCs in southern China."

Column‐mean POC covaries tightly with surface POC (R > 0.9) in both the euphotic zone and the upper 100 m. From 2003 to 2023, POC in the upper 100 m showed a basin‐wide decline (−0.1 mg·m−3·y−1). For euphotic‐zone POC stock, vertical structure accounts for only ∼30% of its variability, whereas euphotic depth exerts dominant control, driving a summertime maximum and a positive changing rate (3.68 mg·m−2·y−1) in 2003–2023.

Here, we show the importance of two‐dimensional flow induced by seasonal freeze‐thaw processes based on a validated numerical model. Under horizontally uniform boundary conditions, cryosuction and salt exclusion during freezing concentrate salts near the freezing front. During thawing, the recovery of permeability and presence of high salinity gradients promote gravitational instabilities, inducing convective fingering after thawing. This process facilitates downward salt transport, preventing long‐term salt accumulation in the shallow soil layer. Further quantitative analysis showed that deeper frost depths or lower water tables favor fingering formation. Based on these results, a new hypothesis regarding salt redistribution in seasonally frozen soils is proposed. It has important implications for understanding salinity dynamics and contaminant migration in cold‐region environments."

The global‐mean darkening is primarily driven by clouds, while the global‐mean atmospheric clear‐sky signal is near zero due to offsetting trends in the two hemispheres. Northern Hemisphere clear‐sky darkening is dominated by reduced anthropogenic aerosol emissions over population centers. The Southern Hemisphere (SH), in contrast, exhibits an unexpected widespread atmospheric clear‐sky brightening, particularly over the remote Southern Ocean (SO). We ascribe this brightening to an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD). Based on observed correlations between monthly‐mean wind speed and AOD over the SO, we conclude the trends in AOD come from enhanced wind‐driven sea spray aerosol emissions driven by increasing near‐surface winds. We discuss the implications of SO brightening for deviations away from the observed hemispheric albedo symmetry and more generally as a potential negative Earth system feedback."

We find for a given effective forcing magnitude, higher‐altitude forcing causes a smaller global warming, owing to more negative cloud feedback. We present novel evidence relating this altitude dependence to sea‐surface temperature patterns and tropospheric static stability. The imposed instantaneous forcings are horizontally uniform, but higher‐altitude forcings more effectively suppress convection in the tropical warm pool, producing a more positive effective (adjusted) surface forcing in that region. This gives rise, during the subsequent climate change, to greater warming contrast between the warm pool and rest of the globe, and hence to increase in low cloud amount. Our results show that to achieve accurate climate projections under anthropogenic forcings, it is important to correctly represent the vertical structures of the applied radiative forcing."

Here, we show laboratory experiments and quantum calculations, which demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that highly oxygenated organosulfates (OOS) formed in the gas phase contribute to aerosol nucleation independently of sulfuric acid and oxygenated organic molecules. More than 200 different gas‐phase OOS were detected with the nitrate CI‐APi‐TOF from a mixture of α‐pinene, ozone, and SO2. The gas‐phase OOS concentrations were strongly correlated with sulfuric acid. Quantum chemical modeling simulations showed that OOS forms in the gas phase from α‐pinene diols and SO3 via a barrierless process.

This study enhances mechanistic understanding of this coupling by comparing two long‐term simulations (1991–2014) using the new Regional Integrated Earth Model System (RIEMS) with air‐sea coupling and its standalone atmospheric model (WRF). Results show both RIEMS and WRF demonstrate advantages and added values in reproducing summer air temperature (T2mean and T2max) and precipitation compared to the ensemble mean of global climate models (ENS). Meanwhile, RIEMS better reproduces T2mean and T2max compared to WRF, particularly over East China. RIEMS reduces the T2max warm bias in WRF by 0.7°C on average over land. Additionally, RIEMS offers more accurate simulations of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes while WRF overestimates sensible heat flux by nearly 7.0 W m−2 over land. Mechanistic analyses indicate that WRF reproduces less cloud cover and increased incoming shortwave radiation, resulting in higher sensible heat flux and warmer air temperature. The climatological decrease in cloud cover in WRF can be attributed to its warmer air temperature. Meanwhile, WRF simulated less outgoing shortwave radiation and trapped more longwave radiation, leading to warmer surface air temperature. Furthermore, without air‐sea coupling, WRF strengthened water and energy transportation from ocean to land through a stronger southwesterly airflow, which is more conducive to simulating higher surface air temperatures in WRF over a large area. These findings provide mechanistic evidence that regional air‐sea coupling is essential for credible climate simulations and projections over East Asia."

Wilcox,Correlated Modes of Spatiotemporal Variations Between Biomass Burning Aerosols and Tropospheric Temperature Over the Indian Region,"Biomass burning aerosols influence atmospheric temperatures by absorbing solar radiation, thereby altering the contrast between day and night temperatures. This study investigates the correlation between these aerosols and day‐night (D‐N) temperature changes over India by applying principal component analysis (PCA) in long‐term (2003–2021) satellite observations (MODIS AOD, AIRS D‐N temperature at 850 hPa, MOPITT CO) and MERRA‐2 reanalysis data. Mode analysis for the premonsoon period identifies biomass burning in northeast India as the dominant source of the second mode of AOD, BC AOD, and CO, with strong covariations between BC AOD and AOD (R = 0.90) and between CO and AOD (R > 0.79). PCA of satellite observations shows that long‐term variation of AOD and D‐N temperature at 850 hPa in the second mode is strongly correlated (R = 0.83), highlighting the sensitivity of diurnal temperature variations to light‐absorbing aerosols. This strong relationship is further confirmed with MERRA‐2 reanalysis data. Moreover, high correlations (R > 0.85) between BC AOD and D‐N temperature in the second mode validate the role of biomass burning in driving long‐term diurnal temperature contrast. Reconstruction analysis over northeast India indicates that the BC AOD fraction accounts for approximately 42% of the D‐N temperature variability during the 19‐year study period. These findings not only quantify the critical role of biomass burning aerosols in modulating diurnal temperature variations across the Indian region but also provide satellite observation‐based insights that have the potential to constrain the aerosol radiative effects on the atmospheric temperature profile in climate models."

To estimate their impacts on future SMB, we study Antarctic ARs in an ensemble of 21st‐century simulations of the IPSL‐CM6 model. Although the number of detected ARs continuously increases when using a constant detection threshold based on recent moisture fluxes, it remains stable with an adaptive threshold evolving with the rising background moisture. In addition, ARs penetrate further into Antarctica following a wave‐number 3 pattern. The severity of Antarctic ARs, measured by moisture fluxes, is projected to increase following the moisture content given by the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. The corresponding SMB impacts all become larger with both increasing snowfall and coastal surface melt and rainfall. However, their overall influence on the SMB is dominated by the increased snow accumulation related to ARs, which is rising by 17% at the scale of the continent. This is much larger than the overall increase in snow accumulation from all events combined, which is 9%, and is more closely related to the rise in total humidity in relation with temperature—that is, linked to the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation."

The δ18O values, supported by petrographic analyses, indicate extreme events in the ISM behavior. Our data report a distinctly wet phase between ∼722 and 775 CE, followed by a marked decline in precipitation from ∼775 to 850 CE. Subsequently, a prolonged drought‐like condition prevailed between ∼850 and 890 CE. From ∼890 to 980 CE, the northeastern Himalaya witnessed return of wetter conditions, whereas from ∼1140 to 1250 CE the monsoon was relatively stable, analogous to modern ISM patterns in a non‐El Niño scenario. Multidecadal ISM variability in the MCA appears to have been primarily modulated by solar activity, and consequent latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In contrast, subdecadal ISM variability was closely linked to changes in the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation. The pronounced wet conditions from the eighth to thirteenth centuries are believed to have promoted agricultural expansion and crop diversification across India. However, these climatic conditions may also have influenced patterns of cultural and political change, particularly in the eastern regions of the subcontinent."

Despite the growing recognition of NOCs as key components of atmospheric organic matter, their formation through aqueous‐phase processes and potential environmental impacts have long been underestimated. This review begins by summarizing the major classes of NOC molecules, then synthesizes observational evidence on their formation in the aqueous‐phase, particularly highlighting its critical role in generating nitroaromatic and N‐heterocyclic compounds. Built on the observational evidence, we further discuss the related evaluation of the multi‐faceted environmental impacts arising from the aqueous‐phase NOC formation. The evidence demonstrates that aqueous‐phase NOC chemistry exerts significant influence on atmospheric compositions, contributes up to 90% of brown carbon's radiative effects, enhances oxidative capacity and secondary organic aerosol production, and influences nitrogen speciation in wet deposition. However, most current model assessments exhibit considerable limitations in quantifying these effects, stemming primarily from oversimplified parameterizations of aqueous‐phase chemistry that fail to adequately represent the full complexity of atmospheric multiphase systems. Furthermore, existing observational data sets remain insufficient, severely constraining efforts to optimize model parameters and validate simulation outputs. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose an integrated research framework that combines long‐term monitoring of key NOC and various precursors and advanced simulations of aqueous‐phase chemistry at the micrometer‐scale reaction environments, which would constrain the parameterization of future models for the aqueous‐phase chemistry and impacts of NOCs."

However, the carbon footprint of its energy (72% coal‐based) requirement is also equally alarming. Under such scenarios, the Farm Power Subsidy (FPS) policy for groundwater irrigation, one of India's costliest public support systems, needs a relook, keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although aimed at bridging social disparities, it is observed that FPS encourages simplification and intensification of the food production system, leading to inter‐state and district scale inequality in income. States implementing FPS, even if experiencing physical water scarcity, are growing water guzzling crops for economic benefits. Conversely, without adequate access to energy, states reeling from economic water scarcity are witnessing low farm incomes. India consumes about a quarter of the world's groundwater for irrigation, and also leads the energy use. Notably, since the mid‐2000s large‐scale implementation of the FPS policy, the CO2 emission (equivalent) has been rising by 5.77 million tons annually, now surpassing 100 million tons. These outcomes bear testimony to the globally accepted view that those least responsible for causing greenhouse gas emissions are the hardest hit. We suggest repurposing of agricultural policies, without compromising farmers' income, for efficient management of energy and water."

Remotely sensed (RS) inundation extents can help identify regions with expected heightened flood‐related health risks, but variations across inundation data sets and their integration into health risk assessments may affect intervention targeting. We examined if the association between census tract (CT) flooding and intestinal infectious disease related emergency department (IID‐ED) visits differed by RS‐based exposure estimation methods. Two Hurricane Harvey Inundation data sets with different spatiotemporal resolutions were used to estimate CT‐level exposure as percent land flooded and percent population flooded, yielding four exposure variables. These were linked to ED visits by residential CT, and the effect estimates for association between IID‐ED visits and flooding were derived. A 10% increase in land flooded was associated with a 6% (1%–10%) higher risk of IID‐ED visits, while percent population flooded was not significantly associated with IID‐ED visits. No statistically significant differences were found in the effect estimates between the inundation data sets or the exposure representation methods. Combining data sets to identify flooded CTs improved model fitness compared to using either alone, indicating a 1.30 (1.16–1.45) times greater risk of IID‐ED visits in flooded CTs compared to non‐flooded CTs. CTs where the data sets disagreed also showed a 25% (8%–10%) higher risk of IID‐ED visits compared to the mutually agreed non‐flooded CTs. Combining remotely sensed inundation data sets of different specifications can address limitations of individual products and improve identifying intervention areas to mitigate flood‐related health risks."

 Proteolysis targeting chimeric small molecules (PROTACs) offer a strategy for degrading disease-associated proteins or controlling engineered protein tags fused to therapeutic proteins, like chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). New approaches are needed that allow spatiotemporal control of PROTAC activity, restricting degrader activity to targeted cells. Photopharmacology offers a solution by enabling light-mediated spatial control of drug action. Here, we synthesize photocaged and photoswitchable PROTAC molecules and test their regulation of proteins tagged with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) in tumor and CAR-T cells. Several of the molecules are derived from triazole-linked trimethoprim-PROTACs (TMP-TACtz), that degrade eDHFR fused proteins at picomolar concentrations, show degradation in cells with low cereblon E3 ligase levels, and have little off-target effects. The photocleavable compound, TMP-TAC-PC yields the best light-mediated regulation of CAR T cell cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion.

 Space cooling and lighting together consume 25% of global electricity, yet existing daytime radiative coolers are mostly limited to porous planar coatings that block visible light and lack durability. Here, we introduce rheology-optics coupling as a design principle that links polymer viscoelasticity to particle dispersion and optical scattering. Guided by this principle, we develop printable polydimethylsiloxane-zirconium oxide composites that achieve solar reflectance ( ~ 97.3%) and mid-infrared emissivity ( ~ 96.9%) comparable to the best reported values, despite a low filler loading of only ~4.5 vol.%.

Beyond planar coatings, the rheology-tunable polydimethylsiloxane-zirconium oxide ink enables direct ink writing of daylight-regulating architectures that deliver sub-ambient radiative cooling while admitting diffuse daylight for illumination, reducing both cooling and lighting demand.

 Iron(Fe)-water reactions in a magma ocean can influence water storage and density of planets. These reactions can form Fe-O-H phases, whose density, melting, and electronic properties at planetary interior conditions are important for informing planetary models. Here, we study natural goethite (α-FeOOH) that is shock-compressed along its principal Hugoniot. Analysis of our velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR) results extends the equation of state to over 800 GPa. X-ray diffraction and VISAR reflectivity results indicate the onset of melting occurs at ~95 GPa with complete melting by 166 GPa, which may be relevant to low seismic velocity anomalies observed above the core-mantle boundary. Analysis of X-ray emission spectroscopy results up to 285 GPa shows the spin crossover of Fe, with dominantly low spin Fe above ~265 GPa in the melt, supporting formation of dense basal magma oceans in terrestrial planets. Using our measured FeOOH densities, we model planetary interiors up to 10 Earth masses. Assuming FeOOH forms via iron-water reactions, the radius decreases by up to 28%, while the density increases by up to 165% compared to the unreacted case, providing an avenue to investigate water storage and evolution in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes.

 The dominant bacteria enriched in the Fusarium wilt plants’ rhizosphere are of increasing interest, as they adapt well to the diseased rhizosphere. However, general information about these bacteria is still lacking. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of Fusarium wilt plants rhizosphere and comprehensive studies to obtain information about the robust variation in the rhizosphere microbiome of Fusarium wilt plants. We demonstrate that Fusarium infection reproducibly changes the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. The rhizosphere microbiomes of Fusarium wilt plants are characterized by the enrichment of Flavobacterium, gene cassettes involved in antioxidant functions related to sulfur metabolism and the root secreted tocopherol acetate. We further isolate antagonistic Flavobacterium anhuiense from the diseased tomato rhizosphere, and reveal that the growth of F. anhuiense and the expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in this strain are significantly stimulated by tocopherol acetate. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of F. anhuiense against F. oxysporum and F. anhuiense population enhancement by tocopherol acetate are confirmed in planta.

 Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of organ dysfunction. Preventing fibrosis in tissue pathological condition remains a significant clinical challenge. Here we investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) in mitigating fibrosis and promoting regeneration of load-bearing tendons. Fgf7 knockout mice exhibit impaired motor function and disordered matrix assembly in tendons. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals an enrichment of a pro-fibrotic cell subpopulation in Fgf7-deficient tendons, which is also predominant in human tendinopathy. Using ProTracer technology, we find that FGF7 deficiency drives proliferating cells toward this pro-fibrotic lineage. Furthermore, we find that FGF7 promotes the tenogenic differentiation of tendon stem/progenitor cells while suppressing their fibrotic differentiation. Importantly, a hydrogel loaded with recombinant FGF7 effectively reduces fibrosis and significantly promotes functional tendon regeneration in vivo. These findings elucidate FGF7’s dual role in driving tenogenesis and inhibiting fibrosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy.

 Electrochemical acetamide synthesis under ambient conditions offers a sustainable route for converting waste nitrate into valuable chemicals. Conventional methods, limited to standalone reduction or oxidation processes, typically achieve low Faradaic efficiencies (<40%) and yields (<0.2 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²). Here, we present a tandem reaction system coupling cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation in a full-cell electrolyzer to enhance acetamide production. At the cathode, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite, which subsequently oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. This acetaldehyde reacts in situ with electrogenerated ammonia to form α-aminoethanol. The intermediate is then transported to the anode, where it undergoes oxidation to yield acetamide. The reaction pathway is confirmed through proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing efficient acetamide synthesis with a yield of 7.2 ± 0.3 mmol h⁻¹ (0.45 ± 0.02 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²) at a cell voltage of 2.4 V. Furthermore, the strategy extends to other amides, such as formamide and butyramide, underscoring its versatility. Techno-economic analysis highlights the viability of this route, with estimated production costs competitive against conventional thermal processes.

 Hydrogen extraction from liquid hydrogen carriers is a promising strategy to address hydrogen storage and transportation challenges for a hydrogen economy. We report a novel heterogeneous catalytic architecture, Ni(Mn)-O-P/GaN nanowires, for efficient, selective, and ultra-stable hydrogen evolution from formic acid (FA). The catalyst achieves a high activity of 29.92 mol H2·gcat−1·h−1 with nearly 100% selectivity and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 31,019.2 h−1 at 150 °C. It exhibits exceptional stability over 4000 hours under fluctuated temperatures (55-75 °C) with a turnover numbers (TONs) of 5,023,060, integrable with low-grade industrial waste heat. In-situ characterizations, isotope experiments, and density functional theory calculations collectively reveal that the synergy between Ni(Mn)-O-P and GaN are favorable for the O-H dissociation of FA with an interesting H-exchange mechanism with H2O while inhibiting the undesired FA dehydration and coking formation.

Here, we propose a surface halogenation strategy that transforms the native amorphous SiO2 passivation layer on silicon particles into a functional Al(Si)OCl composite surface via controlled reaction with AlCl3. This artificial interphase reconciles interfacial incompatibility and enables fast ionic/electronic transport, suppressing irreversible lithium loss. The optimized negative electrode achieves a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.3% in half-cells and 85.6% initial Coulombic efficiency (86.6% with pre-lithiation) in full cells paired with LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2. Enhanced reversibility further delivers long-term cyclability. The optimized negative electrode delivers 86% capacity retention and 99.998% average Coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles. Even at high-loading ( > 10 mAh cm-2, and no adhesives/conductive carbon/electrolyte), it retains 72% capacity after 500 cycles. The full cells maintain 80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1 C, with an average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.95%. The versatility of this halogenation strategy underscores halide chemistry’s broad potential in advancing high-performance, reversible silicon-based solid-state batteries. Silicon negative electrodes in solid-state batteries exhibit poor reversibility. Here, the authors demonstrate surface halogenation engineering that suppresses irreversible lithium loss, achieving 94.3% initial Coulombic efficiency and 72% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 25°C."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) have intensified more rapidly in recent decades, with both the frequency and magnitude of rapid intensification (RI) events increasing. While rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are widely recognized as the primary driver behind the intensification trend, the contribution of TC-induced cold wakes—localized ocean surface cooling generated by storms—remains poorly quantified. Using 42 years of global data (1982–2023), we identify a robust decline in cold wake size (~7% per decade), driven mainly by enhanced upper ocean stratification. This reduction weakens the oceanic negative feedback on TC intensification and explains about 13% of the observed global trend in intensification rates. The effect extends to RI events and is particularly pronounced in the western Pacific. These findings reveal a previously underappreciated oceanic process that accelerates TC intensification and facilitates more RI events under climate change."

 Data-driven deep learning (DL) models often underestimate the intensity of extreme weather and climate events due to the scarcity of extreme samples in training datasets and the smoothing effects of gradient-based optimization. While ensemble prediction methods based on initial condition (IC) perturbations in traditional numerical models have improved extreme event predictions, they often fail in DL frameworks. This is primarily due to limited error growth characteristics and the implicit regularization in DL models, which dampens the amplification of IC perturbations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel IC perturbation scheme based on orthogonal conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (O-CNOP), integrated into a DL-based ensemble prediction system. The O-CNOP-derived perturbations are obtained through an iterative selection and optimization process, beginning with candidate samples from model simulations under uniform energy constraints. Perturbations are then selected to maximize forecast error growth, guided by ensemble averaging and convergence criteria. We evaluate this method based on four major El Niño events (1982/83, 1997/98, 2015/16, and 2023/24). Results show significant improvements in DL model predictions when initialized in spring, with over a 30% reduction in prediction error for Niño3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies. This AI-enabled O-CNOP framework offers a robust and generalizable approach to ensemble predicting, potentially improving the prediction skill of DL-based weather and climate models for extreme events."

 Arctic cyclones play a crucial role in regional climate and have important linkages to mid-latitude processes. However, their future changes and driving mechanisms remain uncertain. By applying Lagrangian tracking to CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, this study projects future Arctic cyclone activity changes and quantitatively investigates the relative contributions of local cyclogenesis and externally migrating systems. By the late 21st century, Arctic cyclone activity is projected to decline, with distinct seasonal and regional differences. Winter reductions stem from weakened local cyclogenesis, especially in the subpolar North Atlantic, while increased external migration intensifies cyclone activity in the Bering Sea and northeast Siberia. Summer declines result largely from reduced poleward intrusion of mid-latitude cyclones, particularly along continental margins. Yet increased cyclones around Greenland are driven by enhanced local cyclogenesis. These changes in local cyclogenesis and external migration are closely tied to variations in baroclinic instability and large-scale atmospheric flow patterns, respectively."

 Live forest biomass is essential in sequestering carbon and supporting ecosystem services. How much of the synthesized biomass ultimately stays in live plant biomass remain elusive. Here we propose a new proxy, biomass retention efficiency (BRE), to measure the efficiency of biosynthesized carbohydrates remained in live plant biomass in forests. Based on satellite measurements and terrestrial ecosystem models, we estimated that globally the median of BRE goes from 0.21% to 2.60%, much smaller than carbon use efficiency and biomass production efficiency (ca. 50%). Across forest types, BREs derived from different datasets exhibit inconsistent patterns. This large differences mainly stems from the inconsistency in quantifying biomass changes across different approaches. This small BRE highlights the importance of tracking the fate of nonliving biomass carbon for better understanding forest carbon sequestration, and the uncertainties emphasize the needs for coordinated effort for future improvements in high-quality large-scale biomass estimation and model-data integration. Only 0.2–2.6% of synthesized biomass stays in live plants at the global scale, as revealed by biomass retention efficiency, a newly developed metric based on satellite data and ecosystem models."

 Oceanic mesoscale eddies represent the most energetic component of the ocean circulation; however, their decay routes remain elusive, leaving a key gap in our understanding of the oceanic energy cascade. Here we combine satellite data with mooring measurements from the South China Sea in 2014 to reveal a rapid decay of oceanic eddies following the passage of typhoons. This decay is accompanied by a substantial generation of internal waves with near-inertial frequency in the ocean interior. The temporal correspondence and quantitatively commensurate energy changes indicate a direct energy transfer from eddy to internal wave field. We propose that typhoon-induced perturbations trigger an adjustment process within the eddy, resulting in energy loss through the radiation of near-inertial waves. Quantitatively supported by numerical model simulations, this mechanism plays a crucial role in the evolution of mesoscale eddies and points to a previously overlooked interior source of oceanic internal waves. Mesoscale eddies’ decay is accompanied by subsurface near-inertial wave generation, indicating direct energy transfer, according to remote sensing and in situ measurements."

 Timely crop mapping is crucial for field management, policy formulation, phenological monitoring, and yield forecasting. However, acquiring sufficient labeled samples in the current year presents a formidable challenge for in-season mapping. Previously proposed solutions mainly include classifier transfer and sample transfer strategies. The classifier transfer strategy trains classifiers with historical samples associated with historical-year features and then transfers the trained historical sample classifiers (HSC) to classify remote sensing data in the current year; the sample transfer strategy generates trusted samples associated with current-year remote sensing features by predicting labels of the current-year sample based on some prior knowledge (e.g., crop rotation pattern) and then trains trusted sample classifiers (TSC) for current-year classification. However, the performance of the classifier-transfer strategy may degrade when there is large interannual feature variation, while the performance of the sample-transfer strategy depends on the reliability of the generated trusted samples. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates the above two strategies for in-season mapping through a sample weighting technique. Firstly, two sample sets, trusted samples and classified samples associated with current-year features, are generated by crop rotation prediction and HSC, respectively. Subsequently, based on an independent assumption between the rotational prediction errors and the current-year remote sensing features, the optimal weights of these two sample sets are derived based on the Bayesian principle. Finally, an optimal weighted sample classifier (OWSC) is trained using the weighted samples for in-season classification. To illustrate the robustness of the proposed OWSC, we compared it with different methods combined with various classification models across four regions with different interannual feature variation and crop rotation stability. Results demonstrated that OWSC maintained its advantages across various regions and different available lengths of historical crop-type sequences. Owing to its independence from specific classifiers, the proposed sample weighting method can be seamlessly applied to any classification model and thus continues to benefit from advances in classification algorithms. Additionally, sensitivity experiments regarding the uncertainty in trusted samples and historical crop-type sequences showed that OWSC performed stably across different scenarios. Therefore, OWSC provides a promising solution for in-season crop mapping without current-year samples."

 The water surface elevation (WSE) of rivers serves as fundamental data for various hydrological research and applications. The recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite offers a revolutionary altimetry approach by providing wide-swath elevation mapping using a SAR Interferometer (InSAR) operating at Ka-band. While SWOT provides unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage of WSE, it has not been systematically compared with reference water stage databases. Currently, due to difficulties in accessing recent and globally homogenous gauge station records, established WSE derived from radar altimetry (RA) missions is the most suitable dataset to perform global validation of WSE. This study presents the first global-scale intercomparison of the two altimetry systems, the wide-swath InSAR technique used for the first time by SWOT and the classical along-track RA using the SAR technique, and identifies several representative factors influencing their consistency. SWOT WSE are compared with virtual stations derived from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 missions, across five different node quality categories (“good”, “suspect”, “degraded”, “bad” and a combined “all” group without “bad” data). The analysis further examines the potential influences from river width, river ice, backscattering coefficients (sigma0), and dark water fraction in modulating data consistency. The root mean square error (and correlation coefficient) between WSE from SWOT and RA in “good” and “suspect” data are 0.80 m (0.85) and 1.62 m (0.78), respectively, while those for “degraded” and “bad” data rise significantly to 8.80 m (0.60) and 16.91 m (0.50). The combined “all” category yields an overall RMSE (CC) of 5.15 m (0.65). For rivers wider than 160 m, SWOT measurements with “good” and “suspect” quality demonstrate notably improved consistency with RA compared to narrower rivers. Under frozen conditions, the reduced consistency between SWOT and RA is most evident in the “degraded” and “bad” quality data, with average reductions in CC of 0.17 and 0.21, respectively. In addition, radar backscatter strongly impacts the quality of SWOT-based WSE, as both extremely low values (dark water) and very high values (specular ringing) can lead to unrealistic estimates. Overall, this study offers important insights into the global performance of SWOT-based WSE estimation and informs the future refinement and application of SWOT data in hydrological research."

 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a key parameter for characterizing the radiative forcing of atmospheric aerosols, yet some inconsistencies remain among different satellite products. In this study, Level-2 (L2) instantaneous and Level-3 (L3) monthly AOD products from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) were evaluated using observations from eight AERONET sites across East Asia for the period 2012–2023. We further analyzed the spatial distribution patterns and long-term climatological characteristics of AOD in this region. The results show that VIIRS generally exhibits the best overall performance for both L2 and L3 AOD products relative to AERONET, characterized by high correlation coefficients (R = 0.853 and 0.881), large fractions of retrievals within the expected error (75.34 % and 70.27 %), and comparatively low root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE). Nevertheless, the retrieval accuracy still exhibits pronounced regional variations among these satellite products. In desert regions, MISR performs the best with the highest fractions of retrievals within the expected error (65.14 % and 72.86 %), followed by MODIS, while the VIIRS L3 product shows notable overestimation. The consistency between L2 instantaneous retrievals and L3 monthly aggregates also varies considerably across surface types and among the three sensors. Despite these differences, the three satellite products display broadly consistent spatial patterns and temporal evolutions, commonly identifying similar high-AOD regions. On the interannual scale, all products reveal a persistent decline in AOD from central to eastern China (VIIRS: −0.021 a−1, MODIS: −0.023 a−1, MISR: −0.013 a−1) and an increasing trend over the Indian subcontinent (VIIRS: 0.006 a−1, MODIS: 0.008 a−1, MISR: 0.004 a−1). To further elucidate the climatological behavior of AOD and identify the meteorological factors most strongly associated with its long-term variations, a method combining principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) is applied. The results indicate that over land, the AOD climatology and its interannual variability are most strongly associated with boundary layer height, whereas over ocean, AOD is influenced by a more complex combination of meteorological factors."

 PM1 and PM10 samples were collected at a downtown site in Elche, Spain, for one year. The oxidative potential (OP) of the samples was determined by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, along with the chemical composition, in order to identify the key components affecting OP of fine and coarse PM. The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) content, which comprises many constituents identified as redox-active species in previous works, was measured for the first time at the sampling site. More than 70 % of WSOC was associated with submicron particles since it came mainly from biomass burning during winter and was formed by atmospheric photochemical reactions during the summer season. Average volume-normalised OP was very similar in the submicron and coarse fractions (0.21 and 0.17 nmol min−1 m−3, respectively), with values twice as high in winter than in summer. However, the intrinsic OP (OP of PM per unit mass) was notably higher in PM1 than in PM10–1 (28 and 14 pmol min−1 μg−1), indicating that submicron particles have a higher potential to generate reactive oxygen species and are potentially more hazardous. During winter PM1 OP was strongly associated with biomass burning species, including WSOC, due to the emissions of redox-active organic components from this source, and also with traffic tracers related to both exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. In contrast, during the warm season, the results of the correlation analysis point to relevant contributions from secondary organic aerosols and road dust resuspension. On the other hand, the DTT activity measured in PM10–1 was related to chemical species derived from exhaust and non-exhaust traffic emissions during winter and to marine species during the summer months."

 Summer precipitation in Central China (CC) is typically influenced by ocean-atmosphere coupling processes. However, the mechanisms through which land surface processes in surrounding regions affect CC precipitation, particularly those over the Indochina Peninsula (ICP), remain poorly understood. We propose that extreme heat events (TX90P) over the ICP during March–April-May (MAM) enhance June–July-August (JJA) precipitation in CC. ICP MAM TX90P establishes a self-reinforcing feedback loop through energy and moisture exchange processes at the land-atmosphere (L-A) interface, thereby amplifying the intensity of extreme heat events. Extreme heat events are accompanied by high-pressure systems with anomalous subsidence of airflow that suppress precipitation and reduce soil moisture (SM). The resulting dry soil establishes a positive feedback mechanism with precipitation, enabling the anomalous SM reduction to persist into JJA. This soil moisture memory effect-induced drought leads to weakened vertical motion over the ICP, promoting the formation of an anticyclonic circulation pattern spanning the ICP and Western Pacific (WP), which subsequently strengthens southwesterly winds that transport moisture toward CC, resulting in enhanced precipitation. Simulations using a Linear Baroclinic Model (LBM) confirm that ICP extreme heat events generate southwesterly wind anomalies, facilitating northeastward moisture transport to CC. A multiple linear regression model incorporating MAM TX90P, preceding winter El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and preceding winter Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) effectively reproduces observed JJA CC precipitation (r = 0.62). This result demonstrates that incorporating extreme heat-related land surface processes significantly improves precipitation prediction skill compared to models relying solely on oceanic variability."

 The mesoscale eddies present in many dynamic regions of the world ocean are known to modulate wind and precipitation in their vicinity. This study investigates the observed association between eddy activity in the western Bay of Bengal and seasonal rainfall over the monsoon core region during the boreal summer. A novel method is employed to characterise eddy variability in the Bay of Bengal using the Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter. The anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddy activity in the western Bay correlates with increased (decreased) monsoon rainfall and westerly (easterly) wind anomalies across the monsoon core zone. During years when BoB is dominated by anticyclonic eddies, the seasonal Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) in this region exceeds the climatological mean by up to 35 % of its standard deviation. A mechanism linking the anticyclonic eddies and the ISMR is proposed here based on the observational data for the 1993–2022 period. The presence of anticyclonic eddies appears to mitigate the detrimental effects of El Niño on east-central Indian rainfall by fostering atmospheric conditions favourable for monsoon low-pressure system formation. Furthermore, years dominated by anticyclonic eddies exhibit a stronger, narrow coastal SST gradient in the northwestern Bay of Bengal, which may further enhance LPS development.Methodically structured model sensitivity experiments using a standalone atmospheric model substantiate the impact of mesoscale SST structures and the coastal gradient in the BoB on rainfall, thus providing potential evidence regarding the interplay between eddies and the Indian monsoon system."

 This study investigates the microphysical processes of lightning-producing convective clouds over Northeast India during September 2009, using unique in-situ measurements from an instrumented aircraft in conjunction with near-simultaneous Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite overpass observations. TRMM measurements revealed isolated convective cells with reflectivity up to 45 dBZ, storm tops near 14 km, and frequent lightning flashes (2–250 s−1), indicative of mature mixed-phase cumulonimbus systems. Aircraft-based droplet size distribution (DSD) measurements showed progressive spectral broadening with altitude and drizzle onset near the 0 °C isotherm level. Large values of liquid water content (LWC) near it promote the formation of supercooled water in colder regimes. The coexistence of supercooled droplets, ice, and graupel at sub-zero temperatures creates favorable conditions for charge separation. The hydrometeor axis ratio and diameter relationship is evaluated.Vertical profiles of droplet concentration, LWC, ice water content, effective radius (re), and autoconversion rates further highlight active droplet growth through collision–coalescence processes. The autoconversion rate was modulated by updraft transport and feedbacks from droplet depletion on drizzle formation. Scatter plot and normalized DSD analyses revealed distinct microphysical regimes: cloud-only (positive μ, high Nw, where μ is the shape parameter and Nw, the intercept parameter of normalized Gamma DSD) and cloud–drizzle (negative μ, reduced Nw). In warm, droplet-dominated clouds (2 <D<50μm, T>0°C), the relationships between re–LWC and μ–LWC become more pronounced. When both cloud droplets and drizzle are included (2 <D<50μm), these relationships weaken. In cold clouds (T<0°C), a strong coupling between μ and λ emerges. Considering only larger hydrometeors (50 <D<1550μm) in the cold regime further strengthens the μ–re, λ–μ, and μ–IWC relationships. Here, IWC denotes the ice water content. New empirical autoconversion relationships were derived from the DSDs and compared with published schemes. These results provide region-specific constraints for bulk microphysical parameterizations and highlight the need for further evaluation of the proposed schemes within modeling frameworks."
