 Accurate classification of methane source infrastructure across sectors is critical for building comprehensive emission inventories and tracing emission sources. Existing approaches predominantly rely on high-resolution remote sensing imagery to capture discriminative features, but their scalability is limited by high costs and restricted availability. In contrast, medium-resolution imagery offers scalable alternatives with enhanced spectral signatures, while its lower spatial resolution challenges precise characterization and facility differentiation. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal fusion method on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, with the aim of exploiting the complementary characteristics of optical, infrared, and SAR imagery to improve classification accuracy. We present a multimodal dynamic fusion network (DMFNet), which incorporates a gating module and multimodal attention fusion modules (MAFM) to adaptively address sample variability and multimodal heterogeneity. Additionally, DMFNet enables tracking and interpreting the fusion process by analyzing data-driven weights, providing deep insights into modality combinations and fusion strategies for specific facility. Experiments on the METER-ML dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a precision of 0.740 and a recall of 0.757, outperforming existing single-modal and static fusion methods. Transferability experiments further confirm the practical applicability of the proposed method and its complementarity with existing open-source data in improving methane emission inventories."

Ozone and temperature profiles provide evidence that stratospheric ozone depletion may induce cooling. •The seismic distribution in Sheveluch volcanic area is mainly shallow-source (0–70 km) and small-earthquake (ML 3.5–4.0). Shallow (0-70 km), small (ML 3.5-4.0) quakes dominate Sheveluch's seismic activity. 
 Based on the two Sheveluch eruption events on April 10, 2023 and August 17, 2024, the comprehensive phenomenon of the two volcanic eruption events is described from the analysis of the seismic activity sequence of the lithosphere to the distribution of atmospheric materials and heat. The seismic distribution in Sheveluch volcanic area is mainly shallow-source (0–70 km) and small-earthquake (ML 3.5–4.0). The April 2023 volcanic eruption released 3692.8 kt SO2 (vs. 26.21 kt in August 2024), with broader dispersion (100°W) and extended atmospheric retention, reflecting fundamental differences in eruption dynamics and atmospheric transport patterns. Based on the time series analysis, SO2 and UV aerosol index exhibit significant responses to the volcano eruption events. Vertical trajectory modeling and aerosol layer height (ALH) results indicate eruption column heights of 10 km and 8–9 km for the April 10, 2023 and August 17, 2024 volcanic events, respectively. Notably, positive temperature anomalies observed in the lower stratosphere show potential correlations with volcanic eruption. Comparing the ozone profile with the temperature profile, the ozone depletion may result in a decrease in stratospheric temperature. Volcanic eruption heights at the tropopause level may have an amplifying impact effect on the lower stratosphere. The description of the horizontal and vertical migration processes of atmospheric materials during volcanic eruption is of great significance for the study of multi-layer coupling mechanism."

 In compliance with European air quality regulations and the Italian “Reti Speciali” agreement, a dedicated network of three strategically positioned monitoring stations was established in 2012. Designed to account for geographical variability, this network enabled the first coordinated sampling campaigns for atmospheric mercury (Hg) data in ambient air and deposition. The resulting representative nationwide data, collected from 2020 to 2023, enabled the detection of seasonal, temporal, and spatial variations, which are analyzed in this study. Throughout the observational period, atmospheric Hg levels varied among the stations, exhibiting annual mean values between 1.22 ± 0.25 and 2.01 ±0.42ng/m3. A notable decrease in concentrations was evident in the northern and central regions. Conversely, the southern station maintained relatively stable levels, likely attributable to the predominant influence of natural sources. Ambient air Hg concentrations were examined for the impact of potential sources, with analysis conducted at both synoptic and local scales. Long-range transport pathways were identified using Potential Source Contributing Function (PSCF) analysis, while local investigations incorporated meteorological parameters, ozone measurements, and nearby fire hot-spot data. Analysis of samples from Hg deposition monitoring campaigns (2021 - 2023) revealed total mercury deposition values below 20 ng/m2d. These efforts, which involved four sampling sessions per year at each station, showed that seasonal variations were primarily influenced by rainfall patterns."

 Dusty weather (including dust storms, blowing dust and floating dust) represents a catastrophic weather phenomenon with extensive adverse environmental impacts. However, its natural variability and underlying mechanisms at the global scale remain insufficiently explored in prior research. This study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and driving mechanism of global dusty weather using long-term station observations and reanalysis data. Our findings reveal a significant declining trend in dusty weather over the Taklimakan Desert and southwestern Sahara Desert from 1979 to 2023, whereas an increasing trend is observed over the northern Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert and Gobi Desert during the same period. Temporally, global dusty weather activity exhibits a decline from 1979 to 1999, followed by an interdecadal-scale oscillation with cycles of 10–14 years after 1999. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that Atlantic climate modes—particularly the South Atlantic Subtropical Dipole (SASD) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)—play a dominant role in modulating the interdecadal variability of dust storms, with correlation coefficients of −0.44 (SASD) and 0.37 (NAO), respectively. Consequently, energy convergence over dust source regions, modulated by the SASD and NAO, stimulates low-pressure troughs and intensified westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere, alongside warm high-pressure systems in the Southern Hemisphere, both of which enhance dust storms. Our results advance the understanding of global dusty weather dynamics and offer valuable insights for future dust storms prediction."

 Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is known for its substantial isoprene emissions, which can contribute to air pollution and climate change. As oil palm plantations expand across Southeast Asia, developing effective mitigation strategies such as propagating low-isoprene-emitting variants of this species is essential. To this end, we measured the isoprene emissions from oil palm saplings grown from seeds and clonally propagated under controlled environmental conditions in an E. guineensis nursery in Sessang, Malaysia. The effects of the leaf position, time of day, root conditions, and growth stage were examined for further data quality control. The first set of results showed that isoprene emissions varied more widely in seed-derived saplings (mean: 13.6 ± 5.2 nmol m−2 s−1) than in clonal saplings (mean: 18.6 ± 2.9 nmol m−2 s−1), with the latter exhibiting consistently higher emissions. Further investigation of the potential influencing factors revealed that isoprene emission rates varied with leaf position, with the upper and middle fronds producing more isoprene than lower fronds. Additionally, the emissions exhibited clear peaks in the morning or midday. Older trees exhibited significantly higher isoprene emission rates (26.32 ± 6.49 nmol m−2 s−1) than saplings, suggesting that the emissions change with growth stage. Based on these findings, we recommended that isoprene emission measurements be taken from the middle or upper leaves in the morning or at midday to ensure a reliable comparison. The substantial intraspecific variability in isoprene emission among E. guineensis saplings from crossbreeding highlights the potential for identifying and selecting low-emission variants."

 Identifying the roles of specific atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is crucial for effective ozone (O3) control. The maximum reactivity incremental (MIR) value is a widely used reactivity scale for calculating ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs. In this study, we determined localized MIR values for 44 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) using a box model based on seven observation datasets from five cities in three regions of China. We then examined the variability of these MIR values, identified potential influencing factors, and discussed their implications for O3 control strategies. The MIR values exhibited strong correlations across all seven observations (r = 0.98–0.99), with C4–C5 internal alkenes showing the highest MIR values (22.5–87.1 μg O3 μg−1). Nonetheless, substantial variability of MIR values existed across different observations, as ratios relative to the Beijing 2016 observation of 0.6–1.45. Potential causes for the observed MIR variability included variations in photolysis rate and the fraction of reactive NMHCs across different observations, as well as the treatment of carbonyls in MIR calculations. Compared to values derived under U.S. atmospheric conditions, our calculated MIR values for internal alkenes were higher, while those for low-reactivity species were lower, suggesting a broader range of MIR values for various NMHCs in this study. While OFP values calculated with our localized MIR values generally correlated well with those using U.S. MIR values in six observations, applying U.S. MIR values to assess OFP in China might overestimate alkane contributions and underestimate those of alkenes (especially isoprene and C4–C5 anthropogenic alkenes) to O3 formation. These findings underscore the importance of utilizing region-specific MIR values for the accurate identification of key O3 precursors and the implementation of effective regulatory measures."

From 1980 to 2000, ozone–climate interactions raise AST in early winter by promoting upward wave propagation and Brewer–Dobson circulation, whereas they decrease AST in late winter and spring by reducing ozone shortwave heating. Our results highlight the impact of ozone–climate interactions on the intraseasonal reversal of AST trends. 
 Using reanalysis datasets and the Community Earth System Model (CESM), this study investigates the effects of ozone–climate interactions on the Arctic stratospheric temperature (AST) changes during winter and early spring. Before 2000, the AST increased significantly in early winter (November and December), which is contributed to by ozone–climate interactions. Specifically, ozone–climate interactions lead to a stratospheric state that enhances upward wave propagation and the downwelling branch of  Brewer–Dobson circulation. This leads to an adiabatic warming that significantly raises the AST. This dynamical heating overwhelmingly offsets the longwave radiative cooling effect associated with  increased ozone during early winter. In contrast, during late winter and spring, cooling trends in the Arctic stratosphere are predominantly driven by  reduced shortwave radiation heating associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. This study highlights the effects of ozone–climate interactions on the long-term trend in the AST."

Nicknish;Kane Stone;Susan Solomon;Simon A. Carn,Quantifying the decay timescale of volcanic sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere,"Large volcanic eruptions can inject teragrams of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere, influencing stratospheric chemistry and Earth's climate. This work calculates decay timescales of volcanic gas-phase SO2 in the stratosphere using data from three satellite products. SO2 decay timescales vary significantly between the different products, and this uncertainty limits our ability to attribute an observed SO2 decay following an eruption to a specific chemical process. 
 The injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere and its subsequent oxidation to form sulfate aerosols after large volcanic eruptions can have profound effects on Earth's climate.  The removal of volcanic SO2 in the stratosphere is thought to be driven by its gas-phase oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH); once oxidized, it goes on to form sulfate aerosols. However, it has also been suggested that heterogeneous oxidation on ash could also be important or even dominant, which would imply the faster removal of SO2 and thus the faster formation of aerosols, at least in ash-rich plumes. Additionally, recent work uses an assumed exponential fit to determine the total SO2 mass loading following large eruptions; the quality of this fit translates directly to the accuracy of the mass loading estimate. It is therefore of interest to examine how accurately the SO2 decay timescale can be determined from observations and to compare observations to models. Here we evaluate the SO2 decay timescale and its uncertainties following several significant eruptions using three different sets of satellite observations and compare these to the CESM2-WACCM6 model. We show that defining an accurate baseline against which a volcanic injection can be quantified increases the variability and uncertainty in the estimated decay timescale for some satellite datasets.  While the typical decay timescale for SO2 is on the order of a few weeks to a month, we find that uncertainties across different altitudes and eruptions result in timescales that can vary by more than a factor of 2. This makes it difficult to attribute variations in the decay timescale to specific SO2-removal processes for the events examined."

By investigating variations in the lifespan of end-use products, end-of-life handling practices, and emission factors, we partially reconcile the discrepancies between bottom-up inventories and top-down observational data. 
 An unexpected rise of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emissions has undermined the efforts behind the Montreal Protocol. However, the sources of these increased emissions, from CFC-11 banks to unreported production, remain contentious. Here, we enhanced the bottom-up dynamic material flow analysis model to characterize the stocks and flows of CFC-11, retrospectively and prospectively from 1950 to 2100. We find that dynamic changes in bank-related emissions could have led to an increased CFC-11 emissions from 2014 to 2018, implying an overestimation of unreported production. Under Scenario 2 (mid-range unreported production levels), long-term emission of banked CFC-11 will accumulate to 980 (600–1500) kilotons (kt), equivalent to 4.7 (2.9–7.1) gigatons (Gt) CO2, between 2025 and 2100. Scenario analysis highlights the potential to reduce up to 50 % of emissions through optimized end-of-life (EoL) management strategies. Our results call for further investigation into the lifespan and EoL processes of products containing ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) to reconcile emission estimates derived from bottom-up and top-down modeling approaches. The modeling approach could also be applied to estimate and project the bank-related emissions and impacts of other ODSs."

Our study compared five satellite products that use ground-based PM10 data. Most products agreed on the daily dust distribution, with absorbing aerosol index (AAI) performing best under cloud cover. Overall, the Sentinel-5P AAI has the highest probability of correct detection (POCD) in dust events but is unstable and has a high probability of false detection (POFD). The FY4A/B infrared difference dust index (IDDI) has the lowest POCD, but it is relatively stable, and its POFD is low. 
 Satellite remote sensing provides a rich data source for the real-time and accurate acquisition of dust weather information in East Asia. However, there are few studies to evaluate whether these data can effectively and accurately reflect the dynamic process of dust weather. This study evaluates and compares the continuity, accuracy, and stability of five commonly used remote sensing products for monitoring dust weather in East Asia, based on recorded dust events (DEs) from 2019 to April 2025. The products evaluated are the Fengyun-4A/B (FY-4A/B) dust score (DST), infrared difference dust index (IDDI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD), Sentinel-5P absorbing aerosol index (AAI), and Himawari-8/9 AOD, using ground station PM10 concentration data. The results show that the daily spatial distribution of atmospheric dust presented by the five remote sensing products has good consistency. Notably, the AAI not only offers better continuity in depicting the spatial distribution of atmospheric dust compared to other aerosol products but also compensates for the shortcomings of other products that cannot detect UV-absorbing aerosols mixed with clouds. Based on the evaluation using ground station PM10 data, the mean probability of correct detection (POCD) for atmospheric dust during multiple DEs for Sentinel-5P AAI, MODIS AOD, Himawari-8/9 AOD, FY-4A/B DST, and IDDI products were 57.16 %, 45.18 %, 31.25 %, 22.78 %, and 12.41 %, respectively. The mean probability of false detection (POFD) values were 88.66 %, 88.61 %, 92.04 %, 69.9 %, and 67.69 %, respectively. Overall, the Sentinel-5P AAI has the highest POCD in DEs but is unstable.

They are useful in both fixed stations and mobile monitoring. Yet the performance faces great challenges due to environmental impacts and long-term drifts. Here, we conducted 30 months of co-located observations using such sensors with a reference instrument. After corrections of environmental impacts and drifts, the accuracy reached 1–3 ppm. We recommend standard gas calibration within 3–6 months. 
 Low-cost, medium-precision sensor (LCS) networks have emerged as a promising approach for CO2 monitoring under complex urban emission conditions. However, the field performance of these LCSs faces significant challenges from environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) and long-term drifts caused by sensor degradation (e.g., light source aging). In this study, we performed 30 months of co-located observations using LCS units (named SENSE-IAP) alongside a Picarro reference analyzer to evaluate long-term field performance, which is essential for the correction and validation of mid–low-cost CO2 observation networks. The environmental correction system we developed effectively corrected the impact of daily environmental changes, which reduced the root mean square errors (RMSEs) from 5.9 ± 1.2 to 1.6 ± 0.5 ppm for SENSE-IAP. The corrections remained robust against seasonal environmental changes, maintaining daily RMSE typically within 1–3 ppm throughout the 30 months of observation. Long-term drifts, commonly occurred in LCS, produced biases of up to 27.9 ppm over 2 years. Furthermore, seasonal drift cycle contributed up to 25 ppm RMSE after 6 months of deployment. Although the environmental correction system could not address these errors, linear interpolation effectively calibrated the long-term drift, reducing the 30-month RMSE to 2.4 ± 0.2 ppm. To improve the accuracy of high-density CO2 networks using such LCSs, we recommend maintaining a calibration frequency preferably within 3 months and not exceeding 6 months, with optimal calibration performed during both winter and summer to ensure accuracy within 5 ppm. These findings indicate that SENSE-IAP instruments can operate long-term without requiring a return to the laboratory for re-calibration or frequent field standard gas calibration, thereby substantially reducing time, labor, and financial costs."

Previous laboratory and modeling studies have suggested that chemical aging of OA slows at lower temperatures due to increased particle viscosity, which hampers the diffusion of oxidants within the particle phase. However, evidence from field measurements has been lacking. For tackling the issue, we conducted atmospheric measurements of the molecular‐level chemical composition of OA using an online instrument in Beijing during wintertime. Unsaturated fatty acids from cooking such as oleic acid were detected. Apparent second‐order reaction rate constants (k2) of oleic acid with O3 were retrieved from the data, especially focusing on oleic acid emitted during dinnertime. The k2 values measured at cold winter nights in Beijing were found to be lower by an order of magnitude than those observed from residential cooking experiments at room temperature. The difference is quantitatively consistent with the temperature dependence of k2 for simulated cooking aerosol in previous laboratory studies. This result suggests that the chemical aging of ambient OA is influenced by temperature‐induced changes in viscosity, underscoring the need to account for temperature effects when estimating the fate of OA across the broad atmospheric temperature range."

Here, we present an observing system simulation experiment framework to quantitatively evaluate a potential measurement network that combines column and surface observations for estimating urban CH4 emissions. We evaluate the observing systems from multiple perspectives, focusing on their ability to estimate monthly and interannual variability, and to attribute emissions to specific sectors. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify the sources of uncertainties in the posterior fluxes. A 10% annual rise in CH4 emissions from 2021 to 2023 was assumed to evaluate the capability of the observing system to capture interannual variability and trends. We found that MUCCnet, the world's first permanent urban ground‐based column greenhouse gas network with 5 stations, was able to capture the monthly and interannual variability and trends of CH4 emissions. The significant uncertainties in emission estimates from MUCCnet‐only inversions can be attributed to strong emissions from the Agriculture sector, which are far from the network deployment sites, or to limited observation coverage due to meteorological conditions. Surface in situ observations within the joint network can effectively reduce these uncertainties. The uncertainties in total CH4 emission estimates can be reduced by using observations from MUCCnet and a surface in situ network, leveraging the complementarity between the two platforms. Using the joint network configuration, the interannual variability and trend of CH4 emissions can be detected with low uncertainties."

The impact of this process on several climate variables is studied, showing, in particular, significant changes in long-wave radiation and daily surface minimum temperature. Other changes in atmospheric fields are also simulated. The findings of this study highlight the importance of incorporating aerosol scattering in the long-wave spectrum in climate models. 
 The few studies that considered aerosol scattering in the long-wave (LW) typically relied on using simple corrective factors instead of including it in the radiative code. To analyse the climatic effects of physically accounting for this process, simulations have been performed with the ARPEGE-Climat atmospheric global climate model over the 1985–2014 period using the ecRad radiation scheme and updated optical properties of coarse aerosols, particularly dust. The evaluation of the model coarse-aerosol optical depth (AOD) against AERONET data over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula shows the ability of ARPEGE-Climat to capture spatio-temporal variations in coarse AOD despite regional biases. The comparison of simulations with and without LW aerosol scattering shows that this process leads to a significant increase in downwelling surface LW radiation in dust-emitting regions (+5 W m−2 on average) between March and September, correlated with the largest coarse AOD. This increase results in a rise in minimum near-surface temperatures of up to +1 °C. It is also associated with an outgoing LW radiation decrease at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). However, during certain months and in certain regions, near-surface temperatures can be significantly reduced due to short-wave surface radiation decreases related to increases in low-level clouds. A precipitation increase over Sahel during September, linked to wetter atmospheric layers, is also simulated. Neglecting LW aerosol scattering in climate simulations therefore has significant impacts on climate, notably in dust-emitting regions. Globally, the LW aerosol-scattering contribution to radiation is 0.4 W m−2 at both the surface and TOA."

This paper presents the most comprehensive observational review of ozone distributions and evolution over East Asia and Southeast Asia across different spatiotemporal scales in the past two decades, which will have important implications for assessing ozone impacts on public health and crop yields and for developing future ozone control strategies. 
 The high level of ozone throughout the troposphere is an emerging concern for East Asia and Southeast Asia. Here, we analyze available surface ozone measurements from the past two decades (2005–2021) over eight countries, with 10 ozonesonde and aircraft measurements within this region. At the surface, the seasonal mean ozone over 2017–2021 varies from 30 nmol mol−1 (i.e., 30 ppb) in Southeast Asia to 75 nmol mol−1 in summer in northern China. The metric of seasonal 95th percentile ozone can identify the multiple hot spots of ozone pollution of over 85 nmol mol−1 in Southeast Asia. The new World Health Organization (WHO) peak-season ozone standard indicates that both East Asia and Southeast Asia face a widespread risk of long-term exposure. The surface ozone increase in South Korea and Southeast Asia from 2005 was leveling off or even decreasing in the past decade, while the ozone increase in the 2000s over China has amplified since 2013. Surface ozone trends in Japan and Mongolia were flat in the past decade. In the troposphere, the available measurements show an overall increasing tendency at different altitudes from a three-decade perspective, although the trend in the past decade remains unclear due to data availability. The difference in the tropospheric ozone level between East Asia and Southeast Asia is likely due to the high background ozone from the stratospheric intrusion over Northeast Asia. In terms of ozone controls, our results suggest that anthropogenic emissions determine the occurrence of high ozone levels, but the underappreciated strong ozone climate penalty, particularly over Southeast Asia, will make ozone controls harder under a warmer climate."

The results indicate that photochemical aging induces distinct changes in the optical and molecular properties of WSOM. More pronounced alterations were observed during OH photooxidation than direct photolysis. Our results also demonstrate that atmospheric photooxidation may represent a significant source of black-carbon-like substances. 
 Biomass and coal combustion represent substantial contributors to atmospheric water-soluble organic matter (WSOM). This was exposed to intense photochemical oxidation once it entered the atmospheric environment, but the resulting changes in WSOM are largely unclear. This study examines the changes in the optical properties, fluorophores, and molecular composition of WSOM derived from the combustion of biomass, specifically rice straw (RS) and coal from Yulin (YL) during aqueous photolysis and hydroxyl radical (•OH) photooxidation. The results indicate that photochemical aging induces distinct changes in the light-absorbing properties of RS and YL WSOM, characterized by pronounced photobleaching in RS WSOM and photoenhancement in YL WSOM. Additionally, more pronounced alterations were observed during •OH photooxidation than direct photolysis, for both RS and YL WSOM. Furthermore, a greater proportion of molecules in both RS (61.6 %) and YL (65.0 %) WSOM was degraded during •OH photooxidation compared to photolysis (14.9 % and 23.1 %, respectively), resulting in products with a larger molecular weight and higher oxidation levels, including tannin-like substances and newly formed compounds that are similar to black carbon, whereas the products of photolysis were characterized by a relatively minor alteration. These findings provide new insights into the photochemical evolution of combustion-derived WSOM and help to predict its effects in environmental and climatic changes."

Westervelt,An uncertain future for the climate and health impacts of anthropogenic aerosols in Africa,"We analyze various projections of African aerosol emissions and their potential impacts on climate and public health. We find that future emissions vary widely across emission projections, with differences in sectoral emission distributions. Using the Oslo chemical transport model, we show that air pollution exposure in some regions of Africa could increase significantly by 2050, increasing pollution-related deaths, with most scenarios projecting aerosol-induced warming over sub-Saharan Africa. 
 Limited data availability and distinct regional characteristics of sources lead to a wide range of future aerosol emission projections for Africa. Here, we quantify and explore the implications of this spread for climate and health impact assessments. Using the Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSE), the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) emission projections, we find high scenario diversity and regional heterogeneity in projected air pollution emissions across Africa. Baseline emissions also vary in their sectoral split. Using 10 different emission pathways as input to the Oslo chemical transport model version 3 (OsloCTM3), we find that regionally averaged annual mean population-weighted fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations exhibit divergent trends depending on scenario stringency, with the eastern Africa PM2.5 concentrations increasing by up to 6 µg m−3 (37 %, SD ± 2.7 µg m−3) by 2050 under the UNEP Baseline, SSP370, and ECLIPSE current legislation scenarios. In almost all cases, excess deaths increase substantially, with increases of up to more than 2.5 times compared to the baseline. We also find a net positive aerosol-induced radiative forcing across Africa in all scenarios by 2050, except two high-sulfur emission UNEP scenarios, with values ranging from 0.03 W m−2 in SSP119 to 0.27 W m−2 in SSP585. The wide spread in projected emissions and differences in sectoral distributions across scenarios highlight the critical need for accurate activity data and harmonization efforts in preparation for upcoming assessments such as the 7th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."

 Solar radiation management is a method in the field of geoengineering that aims to modify the Earth's shortwave radiation budget. One idea is to inject sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, where sulfate aerosols are then formed. Such experiments can probably be observed, for example, with satellite occultation instruments like SAGE III/ISS. The aim of the current study is to analyse, using MAECHAM-HAM simulations and retrievals with the radiative transfer program SCIATRAN, whether it is possible to detect the formed stratospheric aerosols from emissions of 1 and 2 Tg S yr−1 (sulfur per year) with the currently active satellite occultation instruments, taking into account an error estimate that is as realistic as possible. If these smaller amounts of sulfur are detectable, larger amounts will also be detectable.

However, knowledge of the actual distribution of humidity concentrations is sparse – mainly due to technological limitations. With the lidar presented herein, it is possible to measure humidity concentrations and their vertical fluxes up to altitudes of > 3 km with high spatiotemporal resolution, opening new possibilities for detailed process understanding and, ultimately, better model representation. 
 High-resolution measurements of water vapor concentrations and their transport throughout the turbulent planetary boundary layer (PBL) and beyond are key for an enhanced understanding of atmospheric processes. This study presents data from the mobile Atmospheric Monitoring System (ATMONSYS) Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL), operated with a novel titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser concept, for the first time. The ATMONSYS DIAL aims to resolve turbulence throughout the PBL with a sampling frequency of 10 s and vertical resolutions of less than 200 m. General measuring capabilities during high-noon, clear-sky, summer conditions with a maximum vertical measurement range of >3 km and statistical uncertainties of <5 % are demonstrated. The analysis of turbulence spectra shows good agreement with Kolmogorov's law, demonstrating the system's capability to resolve turbulence. However, deviations from Kolmogorov behavior are observed at certain frequency ranges. By combining the ATMONSYS DIAL with an adjacent high-quality Doppler wind lidar, some of these deviations are mitigated in the co-spectra due to independent noise from both instruments. However, intermediate deviations from Kolmogorov behavior persist, likely due to surrounding surface heterogeneities. The agreement of the co-spectra with Kolmogorov's law at the highest frequencies demonstrates that the ATMONSYS DIAL is capable of resolving turbulent latent energy fluxes down to the measurement's Nyquist frequency of 5×10-2Hz. A system cross-intercomparison of the ATMONSYS DIAL with two adjacent water vapor Raman lidars and radiosondes shows overall good agreement between the sensors, despite minor DIAL deficiencies under certain conditions with broken clouds passing over the lidar. The observed profile-to-profile DIAL fluctuations and sensor-to-sensor deviations, in combination with low statistical uncertainty, highlight the advantage of humidity lidars, such as the ATMONSYS DIAL, in capturing both short-term and small-scale dynamics of the lowermost atmosphere."

By combining advanced modeling with real-world observations, it captures fine-scale wind patterns near the surface, especially in urban and mountainous areas. This dataset supports improved weather forecasts, air quality studies, and planning for wind energy and aviation in rapidly developing regions. 
 High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) wind field data are critical for a wide range of applications, including wind energy assessment, low-altitude aviation, air quality modeling, and extreme weather forecasting. Although ERA5 reanalysis remains widely used, its relatively coarse spatial resolution (~31 km) limits its ability to capture local-scale atmospheric processes. To address this, this study develops an hourly 3D dynamic wind field dataset with 1 km horizontal resolution covering the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region during the summer months (June–August) from 2021 to 2023, namely YRD1km, generated through advanced dynamical downscaling of ERA5 using a customized Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model configuration. The methodology integrates multi-source observational nudging with high-resolution land use parameterization to enhance near-surface wind accuracy and terrain-induced flow representation, particularly in urban clusters and mountainous areas. Validation against ground-based observations confirms the superior performance of YRD1km over ERA5 for hourly 10-m wind components, with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduced by approximately 22 % for U and 26 % for V, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduced by 18 % for U and 23 % for V, and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) improved by 33 % and 40 %, respectively. On a daily mean basis, both MAE and RMSE are reduced to below 0.4 m/s, and NSE reaches approximately 0.88. Spatially, YRD1km captures finer spatial wind speed gradients and localized terrain-induced circulations that are not captured by ERA5. Temporally, consistent accuracy improvements with approximately 20 % lower hourly error variability are seen when compared to ERA5. Vertically, 42.2 % accuracy gains are observed in the near-surface layer when compared with radiosonde profiles. Moreover, in a representative convective storm case, YRD1km captures multi-level wind structures that are closely linked to the initiation and continuous development of deep convection, highlighting its diagnostic advantage in high-impact weather events. Overall, the YRD1km 3D wind field dataset and its integrated methodological framework provide a robust foundation for regional meteorological applications, including high-resolution AI-based forecasting, renewable energy planning, and weather risk management in rapidly developing regions such as the YRD.

An atmospheric VOC monitoring campaign was performed for different altitudes in TP in this study. High concentrations of active carbonyls (up to 17.00 ppbv, 79% of the sum of VOCs measured) and terpenoids (up to 2.87 ppbv, 17% of the sum of VOCs measured) were observed in the alpine forest. Compositions of carbonyls and terpenoids varied synchronously among different tree species across the altitude gradient, and the potential sources of carbonyls and terpenoids in southeast Tibet were mainly distributed on the pathway of Asia monsoon in alpine forest, which imply that local air‐ground exchange is the major contributing factor for the ambient VOCs.

Prerequisite are ground‐based lidar and cloud radar observations from two sites with contrasting aerosol conditions: Limassol (34.67° ${}^{\circ}$N, 33.04° ${}^{\circ}$E), Cyprus, dominated by desert dust and continental aerosols, and Punta Arenas (53.13° ${}^{\circ}$S, 70.88° ${}^{\circ}$W), Chile, where marine aerosol and a so far unquantified fraction of aerosol from other sources prevails. For each MPC case, cloud‐level INPC is derived from lidar observations of the cloud‐free surroundings. The ICNC nucleated within the MPC is derived 180 m below the liquid‐dominated cloud‐top layer based on the synergetic observations from lidar and radar. At Limassol, both ICNC and INPC in dust‐embedded MPC range from 0.05 to 3 L−1 and show good correlation. At similar temperatures, INPC derived in the free troposphere above Punta Arenas are at least one order of magnitude lower than at Limassol. In contrast, an agreement between ICNC (0.02–2 L−1) and INPC (0.01–0.1 L−1) at temperatures below −27 ${-}27$ ° ${}^{\circ}$C is not observed at Punta Arenas. Given the previously demonstrated reliability of the ICNC retrieval, we suggest that current parameterizations of free‐tropospheric INPC at temperatures below −28 ${-}28$ ° ${}^{\circ}$C in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes might lack relevant components, due to scarcity of long‐term in situ data sets of INPC at these conditions. Despite the identified discrepancies for Punta Arenas, our study highlights the crucial role of ice‐nucleating particles in the primary ice formation of shallow stratiform MPCs."

This study conducted a series of source emission experiments using a quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) to characterize mass spectra of OA from crop residue burning (CRBOA), wood burning (WBOA), cooking (COA), coal combustion (CCOA), and vehicle exhaust (VEOA). The extracted marker fragments and diagnostic ratios from mass spectra were investigated, revealing their representativeness and effectiveness in distinguishing OA sources. Distinct differences were generally found between OA mass spectra from various anthropogenic sources. Additionally, subtypes of COA and CCOA mass spectra showed notable differences, allowing for finer OA source apportionment. Cluster analysis of existing 57 OA mass spectra further demonstrated their efficacy in identifying OA sources, and revealed certain sources were grouped into distinct clusters.

 Urban aerosol pollution is evolving rapidly with global change and poses significant risks to public health. Measurements and machine learning-enabled chemical analysis of aerosol from a suburb of New York City in 2023 reveal emerging sources and drivers in a modern megacity. Regional wildfire smoke averaged 25% of organic aerosol (OA) mass and drove variability via enhancements of biogenic OA formation within smoke plumes. This biogenic OA contributed 40% of aerosol mass. Urban heatwaves enhanced both biogenic and anthropogenic sources, with ~20% of OA mass exhibiting significant heatwave sensitivity. For the first time, volatile chemical product (VCP) compounds were directly observed, speciated, and characterized in urban aerosol. Contributions to total OA averaged 15%, double the contribution from traffic. Together, this work identifies wildfire smoke, biogenic emissions, heat, and emerging anthropogenic emissions as critical global change vulnerabilities for North American urban aerosol pollution that pose unique challenges for control strategies."

 Understanding the mechanisms controlling hydrocarbon seepage in marine environments is crucial due to the toxicity of liquid components and the contribution of the gaseous fraction to carbon budgets. While natural seepage is common, the role of earthquakes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that major earthquakes along the East Anatolian Fault in 2023 triggered hydrocarbon expulsion hundreds of kilometers away. Satellite monitoring revealed that nine days after the 7.8 moment magnitude mainshock, oil seepage began at a new site, leading to a 71% increase in the emitted oil volume over six months. Four events had energy densities and dynamic strains similar to known cases of earthquake-triggered hydrological responses. Our results suggest that low-frequency waves and high dynamic strains likely extended pathways and mobilized fluids in three-phase systems (oil, gas, water). Earthquake-driven hydrocarbon seepage should be monitored near active seismic zones to better account for greenhouse gas emissions in carbon budgets. Observations using satellite imagery suggest a new hydrocarbon seepage site was activated along the Cyprus Arc following the magnitude 7.8 Kahramanmaraş earthquake in Turkey, resulting in a 71% increase in the emitted oil volume over the following six months."

 Atmospheric iron (Fe)-bearing particles are crucial in human health and climate systems. In this study, we investigated the elemental concentrations and morphological characteristics of Fe-bearing particles during a non-dust period and two dust periods in the spring of 2023. Analyses were conducted using an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and a scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The results showed that the mass concentrations of Fe in PM2.5 were 0.74 μg m−3 during non-dust period and 8.17 μg m−3 during the dust periods, indicating a substantial contribution of dust storms to Fe transport toward downstream regions. Fe-bearing particles accounted for 65.6 % and 91.1 % (by number) of total analyzed non-carbonaceous particles during the non-dust and dust periods, respectively. Notably, the proportion of Fe-rich particles, likely composed of iron oxides, was higher in the non-dust period (8.6 %) compared to the dust periods (1.4 %). Individual particle analysis further revealed that Fe-bearing particles contained a higher sulfur (S) content during the non-dust period than the dust periods. Moreover, within the dust periods, the relative abundance of S-containing Fe-bearing particles increased in the later stages compared to the initial stages, suggesting progressive atmospheric aging. These findings highlight significant differences in the mineralogical composition and aging processes of Fe-bearing particles between dust and non-dust conditions, with implications for iron solubility and its subsequent effects on human health and climate feedbacks. This study underscores the necessity for further experimental investigations into iron dissolution under varying atmospheric conditions."

 In December 2022, Japan experienced its first rare winter sand and dust storm (SDS) in 10 years. In this study, the structure and mechanism of dust generation in December 2022 were clarified based on the dust prediction model, ground-based dust observations, satellite data, and atmospheric reanalysis data. The winter SDS was caused by strong surface winds associated with an extratropical cyclone passing over the Gobi Desert on December 11, 2022; the meteorological mechanism was the same as that for spring SDSs. The negative snow cover anomaly over the source region and the synoptic factors causing the unusual winter SDS were identified by using the satellite data and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts fifth-generation global climate reanalysis (ERA5). Usually, the strong wind frequency in the Gobi Desert in December is low because of a stable cold winter high, whereas in 2022, the frequency was clearly increased. Based on the anomaly and composite analysis of the geopotential height at 500 hPa, the characteristics of the winter SDS years were identified as westward displacement of the Siberian High and the weakening of Aleutian Low over the North Pacific Ocean. The negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation corresponded well with winter SDS years, especially since 2000, suggesting that favorable synoptic conditions for winter SDSs were formed during this negative phase."

 Atmospheric aerosols serve as critical drivers of haze pollution formation through bidirectional feedback mechanisms with planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure. Here, ground and aircraft observations from a severe haze pollution event in the North China Plain (NCP) in 2016 were analyzed to study the spatial and temporal distribution, as well as the vertical distribution and evolutionary characteristics of aerosols. Results suggested that PM2.5 in the haze pollution gradually accumulated through three outbreak phases (OB) and three maintenance phases (MT). A unimodal distribution was observed from ground-based observations of aerosol number concentration (Na), revealing the different formation and evolution characteristics of haze pollution across different pollution phases. Notably, NO3− drove the accumulation of pollution while SO42− drove the maintenance. The aircraft observations data showed that the influence height of haze pollution varied at different phase, which were 850 m (OB1), 1450 m (OB2), 2200 m (early MT2) and 1500 m (late MT2). The proportion of NO3− decreased above influence height during OB1 and OB2, whereas that of SO42− exhibited the opposite trend. Compared with OB phases, the contributions of NO3− and SO42− significantly increased below influence height during MT2, whereas the contribution of Org decreased. Na of OB phases initially increased and then decreased with height below influence height, while during the MT phase, it exhibited a significant decreasing trend with height. The spectra distribution of Na was similar at different altitudes and phases, but the differences increased gradually with altitude. A narrow spectral width was found during late MT2 at 2000 m, the backward trajectory analysis showed that air masses from long-distance transport over Mongolia may be a main cause."

 Eastern China has suffered from severe photochemical O3 (ozone) pollution in recent years. In this coastal region, the atmospheric environment can be influenced by sea spray aerosols (SSAs) from marine emissions. However, the extent and mechanisms by which SSA affects O3 formation remain incompletely understood. Here, using the WRF-CMAQ model, this study investigates the comprehensive effect of SSA on radical chemistry and O3 formation in the lower troposphere across four seasons. SSA (over 50 % of which is particulate chlorine) can reach further inland through an atmospheric “bridge” aloft, interacting with the nitrogen-containing gases from continental anthropogenic emissions to reduce NOx levels and release Cl radicals. The NOx reduction increases O3 in volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regions while decreasing it in NOx-limited zones. Elevated Cl radicals enhance VOC degradation and O3 formation during morning hours. Meanwhile, the scattering properties of SSA reduce daytime O3 formation by diminishing photolysis rates. Due to the contrasting effect of SSA via different mechanisms, the response of O3 varies seasonally and geographically. In winter, SSA increases O3 in eastern China due to the dominant effect of NOx reduction in VOC-limited regions. In spring and autumn, similar effects occur in the North China Plain, whereas southern China sees a decrease due to NOx reduction in the NOx-limited region and reduced photolysis rates. In summer, O3 increases are observed only around Bohai, with reductions elsewhere driven by NOx reductions in NOx-limited regions and decreased  photolysis. This study highlights the important, varying, but previously unreported role of SSAs in shaping tropospheric photochemistry over eastern China."

Using a neural network and observations from satellite-based sensors, we analyzed the direct radiative forcing of smoke particles on the Arctic climate and estimated long-term forcing trends. Strong negative trends in aerosol direct radiative forcing were found in northern Russia and Canada, with positive trends found over parts of the Arctic Ocean. Overall, smoke plumes may act to counter future Arctic warming. 
 Using co-located satellite observations from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Aqua Cloud and the Earth Radiant Energy System, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder, and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, we investigated changes in absorbing aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) in the spring through fall Arctic from 2005–2020 through an observation-based method, assisted by a neural network for estimating aerosol-free sky top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes, and an innovative, Monte Carlo-based method for estimating uncertainties in derived ADRF values. This study suggests that Arctic ADRF is a strong function of observing conditions, and changes in Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and cloud properties introduce a complex scenario for estimating ADRF. For example, the TOA ADRF reverses sign from negative (cooling) to positive (warming) for SIC above 60 % for a region with a relatively cloud-free scene. ADRF trends over Arctic land surfaces are primarily negative. Strong negative ADRF trends of up to −4 W m−2 were found over northern Russia and northern Canada in the summer months. Both positive and negative ADRF trends were found over the Arctic Ocean in the boreal summer, though these trends are much weaker than the over-land trends. Positive ADRF trends in the Arctic Ocean north of northeastern Russia and northern Canada are as high as +1.0 W m−2 per study period. The trend results suggest that increasing amounts of absorbing aerosols in the Arctic have a cooling effect from TOA that could act to counter Arctic warming."

Molina,Fertilization-driven pulses of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide complicate air pollution in early spring over the North China Plain,"The impacts of agricultural fertilization on nitrogen oxide and air quality are becoming more pronounced with continuous reductions in fossil fuel sources in China. We report that atmospheric nitrogen dioxide pulses driven by agricultural fertilization largely complicate air pollution in the North China Plain, highlighting the necessity of agricultural emission control. 
 Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has shown periodic conspicuous pulses in the tropospheric column in March over the North China Plain during the past two decades. However, these repetitive pulses have never been reported, and their underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present robust evidence to demonstrate that agricultural fertilization drives the early spring NO2 column increase. The fertilization-driven soil NOx (= NO+NO2) emissions, comparable to anthropogenic sources, exert complicated influences on regional air quality. They significantly reduce nocturnal and diurnal O3 concentrations in agricultural areas in early spring, distinct from the scenarios in summer, but increase fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations via strongly enhancing nitrate aerosol formation. The impact also extends to urban areas, approximately half that of agricultural areas. These findings have increasing implications for coordinated control of PM2.5 and O3 under global warming. We thus suggest that reducing NOx emissions in croplands is essential to achieve better air quality in agricultural countries and regions."

Using satellite measurements, we observed a global decrease in tropospheric ozone, particularly in tropical and European regions. The drop became more noticeable around 2020, partly due to reduced emissions during the pandemic. The study highlights the need for better data processing and integration to more accurately monitor ozone changes over time. 
 Assessing tropospheric ozone (O3) variability is essential for understanding its impact on air quality, health, and climate change. The Infrared (IR) Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) mission onboard the Metop platforms has been providing global measurements of O3 concentrations since 2007. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the 16-year O3 Climate Data Record (CDR) from IASI/Metop (2008–2023), a homogeneous dataset offering valuable insights into the variability and long-term trends of tropospheric O3. The IASI-CDR ozone product is evaluated against TROPESS (TRopospheric Ozone and its Precursors from Earth System Sounding) O3 retrievals from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The comparison shows excellent agreement for total ozone (biases <1.2 %, correlations >0.97) and good agreement for tropospheric ozone (biases 10 %–12 %, correlations 0.77–0.91). Comparisons with ozonesonde data indicate that IASI underestimates tropospheric ozone by 2 % in the tropics and by up to 10 % in mid and high latitudes. Drift analysis indicates the long-term temporal stability of IASI tropospheric ozone, with values below 3 % per decade globally and regionally, satisfying the stability criterion requirement. IASI data reveal a global decline in tropospheric O3 (−0.08 ± 0.05 DU yr−1, p=0.01), strongest in the tropics and Europe. The comparison with ozonesonde data, shows high-certainty decreases consistently observed in the tropics across all datasets (IASI, smoothed sonde, and raw sonde), supporting the robustness of the findings in this region. Vertical analysis reveals that negative trends dominate in the lower troposphere, while positive trends in the upper troposphere align with ultraviolet (UV) satellite observations. This vertical contrast highlights the importance of separating lower and upper tropospheric layers when comparing IR and UV datasets. Although discrepancies remain when considering the full tropospheric column, both UV and IR satellite instruments show a significant drop in tropospheric ozone starting in 2020, partly due to pandemic-related emission reductions. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term, consistent datasets for tracking ozone trends and the need for improved data retrieval and integration to address regional and temporal discrepancies."

It impacts air quality and climate through physical processes like gas transfer barriers and modulation of sea spray aerosol production. Chemically, it is a volatile organic compound source, driven by light irradiation and gaseous oxidant deposition. This review highlights advances in understanding the SML's role in ocean–atmosphere interactions and offers insights for future research. 
 The atmosphere is the fast component of the climate which determines the meteorology, i.e., everyday whether. The ocean, on the other hand, is the slow component which regulates the climate in the long term. Detailed knowledge of the interactions between these two components is crucial in order to understand  global climate phenomena.The ocean–atmosphere interface is the largest one on our planet, occupying about 70 % of the Earth's surface. Hence, the physicochemical processes occurring at the interface can largely affect the chemical content of the ocean waters and the composition of the atmosphere.Here, we briefly discuss the chemical composition of the sea surface microlayer (SML), emphasizing the role of surface-active compounds concentrated in the SML that influence gas exchange and modulate the production of the largest natural primary aerosols (i.e., sea spray aerosols, SSAs) across the ocean–atmosphere interface. We summarize recent research focused on multiphase and heterogeneous chemical processes, including photochemical reactions within the SML, and their impact on the formation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as subsequent effects on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production.Comprehensive understanding of the ocean–atmosphere physicochemical interactions is of paramount importance in order to properly address air quality and climate issues."

In this paper, we explore a new way to resolve excess mixing ratios in turbulent plumes, which allows aggregation of unbiased ensemble averages of air pollutant ratios that can be compared with emission models. The approach is tested in an urban environment and used to resolve emission patterns of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. 
 In this study, we introduce the turbulent enhancement ratio (TER) as an experimental approach for characterizing local emission sources in complex urban environments, with a focus on the city of Innsbruck, Austria. The idea behind the approach is to take advantage of highly time-resolved trace gas observations that allow for identifying turbulent air motions, from which a turbulent enhancement ratio can be constructed. Spectral analysis helps in determining the most relevant temporal scales that need to be resolved for the TER at a location. We use a comprehensive measurement setup at the Innsbruck Atmospheric Observatory, utilizing advanced instruments to test the approach. Our dataset, spanning mid-2018 to early 2022, includes periods affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to assess the impact of reduced traffic and changes in domestic fuel use on NOx / CO2 emission ratios. We test the method by comparing it with direct eddy covariance flux measurements of these tracers. The results show a statistically significant linear relationship between TER and the flux ratio of NOx over CO2, with regression slopes ranging between 0.96 and 1.1. Weekday TER values are generally higher due to increased traffic, while weekend values are lower, reflecting reduced commuter activity. Seasonal analysis shows that winter TER is influenced significantly by domestic heating, while in summer, traffic is the predominant source of NOx and CO2 emissions within the measurement footprint. The diurnal cycle of TER also highlights the role of valley wind systems in modulating local emissions through changes in the footprint, with up-valley winds bringing higher traffic-related emissions to the site during the day. Our findings demonstrate that by resolving the most relevant turbulent timescales for a location, TER is a robust predictor for emission ratios in urban settings, offering insights into the dynamics of local emissions. The method's ability to capture turbulent fluctuations provides a more nuanced understanding of source contributions, particularly in environments with complex and mixed emission sources."

The two IAGOS-instruments showed good agreement with the OPM within 5–6 %. The observed differences are small but systematic and reproducible during the intercomparison. 
 As part of the Quality Assurance (QA) plan of the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observation System (IAGOS), IAGOS-CORE and IAGOS-CARIBIC UV-photometer instruments have been compared with the dual-beam UV- Ozone (O3) PhotoMeter (OPM) of the World Calibration Center of Ozone Sondes (WCCOS) at the Forschungszentrum Jülich in an environmental simulation chamber. The WCCOS is established since about 30 years ago as part of the WMO-GAW measurement quality program of the global ozonesonde network, in which the OPM instrument serves as the ozone reference standard. In the simulation chamber, pressure, temperature, and ozone concentration can be controlled at quasi-realistic flight conditions between the Earth surface (∼ 1000 hPa) and ∼ 35 km altitude (5 hPa). During the intercomparison, different ascent/descent and cruise altitude profiles of ozone, pressure and temperature have been simulated between the surface and ∼ 12.5 km altitude (200 hPa).In general, the two O3 instruments P1-O3 (IAGOS-CORE) and CAR-O3 (IAGOS-CARIBIC) showed good agreement with the OPM reference standard within 5 %–6 %. At a pressure of 400–500 hPa the agreement was even within 2 %. The observed differences are small but systematic and reproducible during this experiment. CAR-O3 showed a small, pressure-independent deviation of −2 ± 1.5 % compared to the OPM. P1-O3 revealed O3 deviation to the OPM which changes with pressure of about +2 % at 1000 hPa to −3 % at 400 hPa, which might be an artefact on the experimental set-up and subject for further investigations. This intercomparison is a first step of the long-term goal to make the global ozone sonde data (GAW-NDACC-SHADOZ-GRUAN) and IAGOS-O3 (CORE: P1-O3, CARIBIC: CAR-O3) data traceable to one common reference, the OPM instrument of WCCOS. Recommendations are made for further regular (every two to three years) intercomparison of the operational instruments to ensure external consistency in general and specifically towards the synergy of IAGOS-O3 and ozonesonde data. An important gap in such intercomparison studies is the lack of a reference ozone instrument operated at reduced pressures at any National Metrological Institute in the world. For observation networks measuring vertical ozone profiles, it is essential to close this gap to enable the traceability of ozone measurements from different platforms to one reference standard. This is crucial to harmonize long-term ozone records to detect any changes of ozone in the free atmosphere."

 This study investigates aerosol hygroscopicity by reconciling volume-based (κᵥ) and mass-based (κm) hygroscopicity parameters through a dual-system approach combining a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (H-TDMA) and a Hygroscopic Differential Mobility Analyzer–Aerosol Particle Mass Analyzer (H-DMA-APM). The integrated system enables simultaneous measurement of size and mass growth factors for pure and internally mixed sub-100 nm NaCl and (NH4)2SO4 particles under varying relative humidities (RH). Results show that κᵥ exhibits strong size dependence, declining by over 25 % as particle diameter decreases from 51.4 nm to 20.2 nm, attributed to curvature effects and morphology-induced artifacts. In contrast, κm shows a more stable trend across sizes, varying by less than 15 %, reflecting its robustness against morphological and curvature influences. However, κm did not consistently outperform κᵥ in predictive accuracy, likely due to the broader classification resolution of the APM system. While κm remains a theoretically superior parameter, κᵥ, when derived from high-resolution HTDMA systems, remains an effective predictor of hygroscopic growth. These findings highlight the importance of particle size, morphology, and instrumentation in characterizing aerosol hygroscopicity and advocate for the complementary use of κᵥ and κm in climate-relevant aerosol studies."

 Different aerosol types influence cloud properties in distinct ways due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics. While many studies have examined aerosol–cloud interactions, comparative analysis of how specific aerosol types affect warm clouds over land and ocean remain limited. Using MODIS cloud products and MERRA-2 aerosol data from 2014, this study reveals that warm clouds over the ocean exhibit greater sensitivity to increases in aerosol optical depth (AOD) compared to those over land. Specifically, with increasing total AOD, cloud fraction (CF) increases at a rate 3 times greater, while cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud droplet effective radius (CER) decrease 2.5 and 6.5 times faster, respectively. Liquid water path (LWP) shows contrasting trends: over land, it initially increases and then decreases with rising AOD, whereas over the ocean, it shows a consistent negative correlation with AOD. Under fixed LWP, CF over land is more sensitive to AOD under low LWP conditions, while oceanic CF responds more strongly under high LWP. Under the influence of dust aerosols over land, cloud properties initially change significantly and then tend to stabilize. Over the ocean, particularly under high LWP conditions, cloud properties exhibit a stronger response to sea salt aerosols. Fine aerosols show similar effects to total aerosols in both land and ocean environments. These findings highlight the necessity of distinguishing different aerosol types, which contributes to a better understanding of the aerosol-cloud interactions."

 Understanding the variability of global land aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its teleconnection with sea surface temperature (SST) is essential for assessing aerosol–climate interactions. This study developed a high-resolution (0.05°), gap-free daily AOD dataset for 2000–2023 by integrating MAIAC AOD retrievals with meteorological, reanalysis, and geographical predictors using a CatBoost model. Validation against independent AERONET observations shows good agreement (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.09), with significantly improved spatial completeness compared to reanalysis products. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis indicates that the leading mode exhibits predominantly positive loadings over most global land areas, with the strongest signals in Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes. The associated temporal evolution shows a shift from above-average AOD in the early 2000s to below-average levels after the mid-2010s, consistent with widespread AOD declines reported since the early 2000s and most pronounced in high-loading regions. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis between monthly land AOD and SST reveals that the leading coupled mode (36.28 % covariance) is characterized by persistent SST warming and a marked reduction in AOD over major emission regions since the early 2010s, while subsequent modes capture interannual signals related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as well as decadal-scale patterns. These findings provide new evidence of large-scale SST–AOD covariability and offer a basis for exploring potential physical linkages, contributing to improved representation of aerosol–climate interactions in coupled models."

However, the atmosphere's chaotic nature makes it hard to separate true aerosol impacts from chaotic effects. Our ensemble experiments show that while large-scale aerosol effects are consistent, regional aerosol impacts vary significantly among experiments. We give a formula showing the relationship between chaotic effects and ensemble sizes, emphasizing the necessity of adequate ensemble members to capture reliable aerosol impacts. 
 Aerosols have significant impacts on regional climate, which has been widely investigated with numerical experiments. However, the uncertainties of simulated aerosol impact due to the long-standing chaotic effect remain unclear. Here we propose a diagnostic method based on large ensemble simulations and a random sampling algorithm to unveil the chaos-induced uncertainties in simulated aerosol climatic impacts that have been overlooked in previous studies. Taking the dust impacts on the Indian summer monsoon system as a demonstration, our findings reveal that, while dust generally enhances the large-scale summer monsoon circulation consistently among ensemble members, its impacts on regional systems, such as monsoon depressions, exhibit significant chaotic effect: the simulated aerosol impacts on precipitation from individual ensemble members differ substantially, even inversely. Through quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that the magnitude of these chaotic effects diminishes following a N−½ relationship with ensemble size N. Furthermore, our results indicate that statistical significance testing alone may be insufficient for the robust attribution of dust impacts, as even small ensembles can yield statistically significant yet contradictory results. This study emphasizes the necessity of employing adequate ensemble sizes to capture reliable physical impacts of aerosol on the regional climate."

We found the partitioning coefficients (Fp) of water-soluble organic compounds in the dust storm period (DS) were comparable to those during a haze episode (HE), and aerosol liquid water content primarily drove Fp variation in HE, while pH was the dominant factor in DS. Moreover, an enhanced light absorption of Asian dust by brown carbon, mainly in coarse mode, formation was revealed. 
 To better understand the physicochemical evolution of Asian dust particles during long-range transport, water-soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) in gas- (WSOCg) and particle-phase (WSOCp) in the spring atmosphere of Shanghai during the 2023 dust storm period (DS) and haze events (HE) were simultaneously measured with a 3 h time resolution, and characterized for their optical properties and size distribution. Our results showed that gas-to-particle-phase partitioning coefficients (Fp) of WSOCs in DS (0.30 ± 0.06) was comparable to that in HE (0.32 ± 0.06), although both temperature and relative humidity in DS were not favorable for the partitioning, indicating a promoting role of dust particles in the transformation process of WSOCg from gas to particle phase. Fp variation was largely driven by aerosol liquid water content in HE but by aerosol acidity in DS. WSOCp and its light absorption at λ365 nm dominated at the fine mode (< 2.1 µm) in non-DS period and the coarse mode (> 2.1 µm) in DS, respectively. Mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of the coarse mode of WSOCp at λ365 nm in DS was 0.8 m2 g−1, which is four times that (0.20 ± 0.09 m2 g−1) in the source region of Tengger Desert, suggesting a remarkably increase in light absorbing ability of Asian dust during long-range transport. Sharp co-increases of nitroaromatics, imidazoles, and water-soluble organic nitrogen at the coarse mode in the DS period further revealed that such an increasing MAC is mainly caused by adsorption and heterogeneous formation of light absorbing nitrogen-containing organics on the dust surface during long-range transport."

Emission reduction policies were effective with respect to reducing the AOD until 2018. Thereafter, the overall reduction until the end of the study was very small due to unfavorable meteorological factors cancelling favorable anthropogenic effects and resulting in an AOD increase during extended periods. The variations over different areas in China are discussed. 
 Time series of Collection 6.1 of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MODIS/MAIAC C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and model-simulated AOD were used to determine the contributions of meteorological and anthropogenic effects to spatiotemporal AOD variations over five representative areas in China during the period from January 2010 to September 2024. The time series confirm the effective reduction in AOD between 2010 and 2018, with an additional but smaller reduction thereafter. The overall AOD reduction is mainly attributable to emission reduction policies, although with substantial meteorological effects. The respective total reduction and meteorological contributions during the whole study period and the meteorological contributions before and after 2018 over the five regions were as follows (all in %): 68, 12, 16, and 52 for the North China Plain (NCP); 62, 17, 28, and 14 for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD); 70, 33, 31, and 43 for the Pearl River Delta (PRD);  55, 16, 25, and 21 for Hunan and Hubei (HNB);  and 57, 10, 14, and 38 for the Sichuan Basin (SCB). Meteorological effects for each of these periods and each region are discussed in detail. As an example, the above data show that the meteorological effects over the YRD and HNB after 2018 are smaller than before 2018; this can be explained by the occurrence of strong effects in the earlier period and the choice of the period over which effects were calculated. Monthly mean AOD patterns were distinctly different before and after 2016, suggesting that aerosol properties changed in response to the emission reduction policies. In summary, this study highlights the complex interplay between meteorological and anthropogenic factors in shaping AOD variations across China and demonstrates the increasing significance of meteorological conditions in modulating China's AOD."

In order to elucidate stratospheric δ13CO2 variations and their governing mechanisms, we have collected stratospheric air samples using balloon-borne cryogenic samplers over Japan since 1985 and analyzed them for δ13CO2. To obtain precise δ13CO2 values, we incorporated the mass-independent fractionation of 17O and 18O in the δ13CO2 calculation. δ13CO2 has decreased through time in the mid-stratosphere with an average rate of change of −0.026 ± 0.001 ‰ yr−1 for the period 1985–2020, consistent with that in the troposphere. However, mid-stratospheric δ13CO2 values did not show a time delay compared to the tropical tropospheric values. This could be explained by the production of CO2 by CH4 oxidation and the gravitational separation of 13CO2 and 12CO2. To confirm this hypothesis, we used a two-dimensional model to simulate the stratospheric δ13CO2 values while accounting for these processes. The results indicate that these two effects strongly impact the vertical distribution of δ13CO2. We newly defined “stratospheric potential δ13C” (δ13CP) as a quasi-conservative parameter incorporating the kinetic isotope effect of CH4 oxidation and gravitational separation, and we found that δ13CP in the mid-latitude mid-stratosphere decreases over time with about a 5 yr lag relative to the tropical upper troposphere. This fact strongly supports that stratospheric δ13CO2 variations are governed by the airborne production of 13C-depleted CO2 by CH4 oxidation, the gravitational separation, and the propagation of the decreasing tropospheric δ13CO2 trend into the stratosphere."

Sowlat,Tracing ammonia emission sources in California's Salton Sea region: insights from airborne longwave-infrared hyperspectral imaging and ground monitoring,"Ammonia (NH3) is a key air pollutant linked to fine particle pollution, yet its sources remain poorly understood. Using airborne infrared imaging and ground sensors, we mapped NH3 emissions in California’s Salton Sea region with unprecedented detail. We found high emissions from farms, geothermal plants, and waste sites, including sources missing from inventories. These findings highlight the need for better NH3 monitoring to improve air quality models and guide pollution reduction strategies. 
 Ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry and air quality, but its emissions remain poorly constrained due to its short atmospheric lifetime, high spatial heterogeneity, and limited coverage of existing monitoring resources. This study integrates airborne longwave-infrared (LWIR) hyperspectral imaging at ∼2 m spatial resolution with ground-based stationary and mobile in situ measurements to map and characterize NH3 emissions in two regions near the Salton Sea in southern California: Mecca in the northwest and Imperial in the southeast. Airborne surveys conducted in March and September 2023 with a wide-swath LWIR spectral imager revealed pronounced spatial and seasonal variability. Average NH3 levels in Imperial were 2.5–8 times higher than those in Mecca, linked primarily to large, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), geothermal power plants, fumaroles, and intensive agricultural activities. Ground-based mobile monitoring corroborated these findings, showing elevated NH3 levels near these sources and especially high NH3 concentrations downwind of CAFOs with large cattle populations. The results underscore the utility of airborne LWIR hyperspectral imaging in detecting and mapping NH3 at hyperlocal scales, including sources absent from existing inventories. They further highlight the need for routine airborne campaigns and the development of next-generation satellite missions with higher spatial resolution to achieve comprehensive, large-area monitoring. These findings inform air quality management strategies and emphasize the importance of improving emission inventories for effective mitigation of NH3-driven air pollution."

Hua, China","Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA), as an important atmospheric component, is prevalent within the boundary layer and can influence air quality and human health. Our observations demonstrate that anthropogenic NOx and the enhanced aerosol water driven by sulfate inhibit BSOA formation in lifting air masses, leading to a moderate reduction in the SOA burden in the upper boundary layer. 
 Anthropogenic effects on biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) formation in the upper boundary layer are still not fully understood. Here, a synchronized 4-hourly monitoring of three typical BSOA tracers from isoprene, monoterpenes, β-caryophyllene, and other particulate pollutants was conducted at the mountain foot (MF, 400 m above sea level (m a.s.l.)) and mountainside (MS, 1120 m a.s.l.) of Mt. Hua, China, to investigate the chemical evolution of BSOA in air mass lifting. Our findings revealed that BSOA was the predominant source of organic matter (OM) at the MS site, with an average fraction of ∼43 % being ∼7-fold  that at the MF site. As the prevalent BSOA tracer, the isoprene-derived SOA tracers (BSOAI) stayed at a comparable level at the MF site (183±81ngm-3) and MS site (197±127ngm-3) yet exhibited an inverse diurnal pattern between the two sites. And the BSOAI fraction in OM aloft moderately decreased during the daytime and correlated positively with the 2-methyltetrol/2-methylglyceric acid ratio but negatively with NOx transported from ground level, indicating that anthropogenic NOx significantly affected the daytime BSOA formation aloft by inhibiting the HO2•-pathway products. Additionally, the further formation of sulfate in a lifting air mass significantly enhanced aerosol water content aloft, which suppressed the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiol and ultimately diminished the BSOAI yields during the daytime. These findings provide more insight into the intricate anthropogenic–biogenic interactions affecting BSOA formation in the upper boundary layer."

The validation against homogenized ozone sondes reveals an overall good agreement with slight biases (3 %–6 %) in tropospheric ozone and a possible temporal drift, but this is difficult to assess due to the limited number of sites. No specific trends are estimated for the tropospheric ozone column for the period 2008–2022, but persistent negative trends are observed in the lower troposphere. 
 The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) has been monitoring the atmosphere for operational meteorology and atmospheric composition studies since 2007 with a succession of three instruments aboard the Metop-A (2006–2021), Metop-B (2012–Present), and Metop-C (2018–Present) missions. One of the key species monitored is ozone (O3). This study assesses the quality of the regional IASI-O3 KOPRA (Karlsruhe Optimized and Precise Radiative transfer Algorithm) product, version 3.0, and the consistency of the three IASI instruments, IASI-A, IASI-B, and IASI-C, for time series and trend analyses. The IASI-O3 KOPRA products of the three instruments show a very good agreement and consistency, better than 1 %, for the tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) and several partial columns (surface–450 hPa, surface–300 hPa) across the three study domains: Europe, North America, and East Asia. For the quality assessment and trend analyses, we combine the ozone products derived from IASI-A (2008–2018) and IASI-B (2019–2022). The comparison with homogenized ozone sondes for six northern midlatitude stations reveals a small negative bias of about 3 %–6 % in the IASI-O3 KOPRA products in the troposphere for both profiles and columns. A rather good correlation between 0.7 and 0.9 is observed, and an error of about 15 %–17 % (compared to sondes smoothed with averaging kernels, AKs) is estimated. The ozone variability is also well reproduced for all the partial columns with a slight underestimation of about 10 % for the TrOC. Based on the comparison with the ozone sondes, we identified a temporal drift (of about −0.06 ± 0.02 DU yr−1 on average) for three different ozone columns (TrOC, surface–450 hPa, surface–300 hPa). This drift can be more pronounced in summer. However, a significant variability of the estimated drifts depending on the sample of ozone sonde sites is remarked, that does not allow its use for correcting the IASI ozone product time series data over broad domains. While the upper tropospheric ozone trends are mainly positive or undefined, the lower tropospheric ozone trends are mainly systematically negative. The regions most affected by negative trends are the Mediterranean, Western North America, Eastern North America, and East Asia. Compensations between lower and upper tropospheric trends prevent the identification of any specific long-term behavior for TrOCs over the three domains. The negative tropospheric ozone column anomalies observed during the period 2020–2022 (the post-COVID-19 period) only slightly impact the trends already ongoing for the period 2008–2019."

 A new design for a simple and very low-cost instrument for measuring total column ozone is described and its performance evaluated by comparison to a co-located MK III Brewer spectrophotometer for approximately 6 months. The ozone retrieval is based on the “Global Irradiance” method used to derive total column ozone from the Norwegian GUV radiometer network. While the total cost of components of the instrument was less than EUR 3000, total ozone values were found to agree with Direct Sun Brewer values with a standard deviation of 1.8 %, comparable to the agreement between DS and ZS Brewer data. The most significant limitations of the retrieval method were found to be the dependence on temperature and cloud-amount. As well as being low-cost, the instrument appears robust and easy to operate. As the instrument covers fully the UV-A/B spectrum it is fully possible to further develop the analyses software to include other data products related to UV-radiation."

This study shows that the oblique angle of incidence will be advantageous compared to standard nadir-looking radars due to substantial clutter suppression over the ocean surface. This feature will enable the detection and quantification of light and moderate precipitation, with improved proximity to the surface. 
 The Earth's strong radar surface return limits the detection of clouds and precipitation in the lowest part of the atmosphere by nadir-pointing spaceborne radars such as CloudSat and EarthCARE. The strength of the Earth's surface radar return is significantly reduced at non-zero incidence angles. The WIVERN (WInd Velocity Radar Nephoscope) 94 GHz radar, currently undergoing Phase-A studies by ESA, employs a 3 m antenna and conical radar sampling at high incidence angles. Here, the benefits of the narrow field of view and the reduction in the Earth's surface return for studying clouds and precipitation in the lowest kilometres of the atmosphere are quantified. The WIVERN radar is expected to improve the ratio of signal (hydrometeors) to clutter (surface return) over ice-free ocean surfaces and marginally worsen it over land and sea ice. The impact of these findings on the detection of light rainfall and snowfall near the Earth's surface is discussed."

Using models and satellite data, we mapped the emissions of isoprene from plants across Europe and found that droughts can reduce leaf growth, leading to lower emissions. This shows that to understand and predict air quality, we must also understand how drought impacts vegetation. Our findings highlight the value of linking extreme weather, plant health, and pollution in models of the Earth system as a whole. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from vegetation represent a major source of volatile compounds globally and play an important role as precursors for tropospheric ozone. Understanding their emissions is therefore crucial for quantifying the impact of ozone on air quality. We present two datasets of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions that cover the European modelling domain of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° to support the study of European scale air quality. The compounds included in the dataset follow the VOCs included in the regional atmospheric chemistry model mechanism (RACM). The datasets were produced within the framework of the EU's SEEDS project. We produced each dataset by coupling modelling output variables from the SURFEX land surface model with the MEGAN3.0 BVOC emission model. In one instance, the SURFEX model was run in free-running mode, which we term the open-loop (OL) and in the other case we assimilated satellite observations of leaf area index (LAI), which we term the analysis. The OL and analysis land surface model outputs form the basis for each emission dataset that are called SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 OL and SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 analysis, respectively. The OL dataset is available over a five-year period from 2018–2022 and the analysis dataset is available over the three-year period 2018–2020. SURFEX was run for both the OL and analysis simulations in a configuration that allowed simulated vegetation to respond to variations in meteorology over time to more realistically track vegetation phenology. Evaluation of the land surface model output LAI and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) showed that the OL and analysis simulations had good skill at tracking temporal changes in both variables, with the analysis performing better in each instance. We perform a variety of evaluations on the isoprene emissions specifically given the importance of this compound for atmospheric chemistry. We evaluated the temporal variability of isoprene emissions in both datasets and found that the majority of the interannual and monthly variability was linked to variability in LAI that in specific cases, like the summer of 2019, could be linked to drought impacts on vegetation growth simulated by SURFEX. We evaluated the daily temporal variability of the OL and analysis isoprene emission datasets against in-situ online observations of isoprene concentrations at 8 sites in western Europe and found moderate to strong correlation between the emissions and observations in almost all location-year pairings. We also evaluated the OL and analysis emission datasets against other published bottom-up isoprene emission datasets over the same European domain used in this study. We found that the SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 OL and analysis isoprene emission datasets lie between the minimum (CAMS-GLOB-BIOv3.1) and maximum (MEGAN-MACC) published emission datasets based on bottom-up approaches. Furthermore, we were able to attribute differences in seasonality between SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 and other emission inventories to differences in the temporal variability of the underlying LAI dataset used to compile them. Overall, our findings show the importance of variability in LAI in controlling isoprene emissions on monthly to annual timescales. Combining this with the demonstrated skill of the emissions in evaluation with independent data, this points towards the value of an Earth-system approach to BVOC emission modelling."

Understanding and predicting it is crucial. Various models have been developed to model air pollution. However, the consistency exhibited by a model in different areas is commonly neglected. Our study accounts for this and shows lower accuracy near busy roads but higher accuracy in less populated areas. Considering location characteristics in air pollution predictions is important in comparing statistical models and understanding the health–society–space relationship. 
 Air pollution leads to various health and societal issues. Modeling and predicting air pollution over space have important implications in health studies, urban planning, and policy-making. Many statistical models have been developed to understand the relationships between geospatial data and air pollution sources. An important aspect often neglected is spatial heterogeneity; however, the relationships between geographically distributed variables and air pollutants commonly vary over space. This study aims to evaluate and compare various spatial and non-spatial statistical modeling (including machine learning) methods within different spatial groups. The spatial groups are defined by traffic- and population-related variables. Models are classified into local and global models. Local models use air pollution measurements from the Amsterdam area. Global models use ground station observations in Germany and in the Netherlands. We found that prediction accuracy differs substantially in different spatial groups. Predictions for places near roads with high populations show poor prediction accuracy, while prediction accuracy increases in low-population-density areas for both local and global models. The prediction accuracy is further increased in places far from roads for global models. Modeling of air pollution in different spatial groups shows that nonlinear methods can have higher prediction accuracy than linear methods. The spatial prediction patterns of global models show that nonlinear methods generally are less sensitive to extreme values compared to linear methods. Additionally, clusters of predicted air pollution differ between models within cities despite similar prediction accuracy. Also, the influence of predictors on NO2 concentrations varies across different cities. Using the local dataset of our study and explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the universal and ordinary kriging models does not improve accuracy; however, analyzing prediction performance across spatial groups provides valuable insights. Comparing local and global prediction patterns reveals that local models capture regional clusters of high air pollution, which are not detected by global models. These findings highlight the fact that solely relying on overall prediction accuracy can be insufficient and potentially misleading, underscoring the importance of considering spatial variability and model performance within different spatial groups."

A custom grid of ~7 km was created over Michigan. A sector-based diurnal cycle for anthropogenic nitric oxide was included in the model. This work shows that grid resolution plays a more important role in relation to O3 precursors and that the diurnal cycle significantly impacts nighttime O3 formation. 
 Surface ozone (O3) in Southeast Michigan (SEMI) often exceeds US National Ambient Air Quality Standards, posing risks to human health and agroecosystems. SEMI, a relatively small region in the state of Michigan, contains most of the state's anthropogenic emission sources and more than half of the state's population and is also prone to long-range and transboundary pollutant transport. Here, we explore the distribution of O3 and its precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds, over SEMI during the summer of 2021 using the chemistry–climate model MUSICAv0 (Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols Version 0). Using the regional refinement capabilities of MUSICAv0, we create a custom grid over the state of Michigan of 1/16° (∼ 7 km) to better understand the local-scale impacts of chemical and dynamic complexity in SEMI and compare it with a grid with 1/8° (∼ 14 km) resolution over the contiguous United States. Model simulations are evaluated using a comprehensive suite of observations from Phase I of the Michigan–Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE) field campaign. MUSICAv0, with its higher horizontal grid resolution, showed excellent skill in capturing peak O3 concentrations but showed larger variation in the simulation of O3 precursors (e.g., NOx, HCHO, isoprene). In addition, we implement a diurnal cycle for anthropogenic nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which is generally not included in global models. As a result, modeled nighttime O3 is improved because of lower NOx concentrations during the night. This work shows that when conceptualizing models in urban regions, it is important to consider a combination of high horizontal resolution and the diurnal cycle of emissions, as they can have important implications for the simulation of secondary air pollutants."

All revisions significantly reduce the overestimation of surface fine dust from 94 % to 35 % while retaining comparable skill in representing columnar abundance. 
 Accurate representation of mineral dust remains a challenge for global air quality or climate models due to inadequate parametrization of the emission scheme, removal mechanisms, and size distribution. While various studies have constrained aspects of dust emission fluxes and/or dust optical depth, annual mean surface dust concentrations still vary by factors of 5–10 among models. In this study, we focus on improving the annual simulation of fine dust in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, leveraging recent mechanistic understanding of dust source and removal, and reconciling the size differences between models and ground-based measurements. Specifically, we conduct sensitivity simulations using GEOS-Chem in its high performance configuration (GCHP) version 14.4.1 to investigate the effects of mechanism or parameter updates on annual mean concentrations. The results are evaluated by comparisons versus Deep Blue satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground-based AOD for total column abundance, and versus the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN) for novel measurements of surface PM2.5 dust concentrations. Reconciling modelled geometric diameter versus measured aerodynamic diameter is important for consistent comparison. The two-fold overestimation of surface fine dust in the standard model is alleviated by 39 % without degradation of total column abundance by implementing a new physics-based dust emission scheme with better spatial distribution. Further reduction by 20 % of the overestimation of surface PM2.5 dust is achieved through reducing the mass fraction of emitted fine dust based on the brittle fragmentation theory, and explicit tracking of three additional fine mineral dust size bins with updated parametrization for below-cloud scavenging. Overall, these developments reduce the normalized mean difference against surface fine dust measurements from SPARTAN from 94 % to 35 %, while retaining comparable skill of total column abundance against satellite and ground-based AOD."

This scoping review investigates topics, methods, and technologies in the application of LCS networks in recent years that are gaining momentum, focusing on LCS networks (LCSN) operation, drone-based and mobile monitoring, data fusion/assimilation, and community engagement. We identify several key challenges remaining. A major limitation is the absence of unified performance metrics and cross-validation methods to compare different LCSN calibration and imputation techniques and meta-analyses. LCSN still face challenges in effectively sharing and interpreting data due to a lack of common protocols and standardized definitions, which can hinder collaboration and data integration across different systems. In mobile monitoring, LCS siting, orientation, and platform speed are challenges to data consistency of different LCS types and limit the transferability of static calibration models to mobile settings. For drone-based monitoring, rotor downwash, LCS placement, flight pattern, and environmental variability complicate accurate measurements. In integrating LCS data with air quality models or data assimilation, realistic uncertainty quantification, ideally at the individual measurement level, remains a major obstacle. Finally, citizen science initiatives often encounter motivational, technological, economic, societal, and regulatory barriers that hinder their scalability and long-term impact."

 A rare event of sand/dust weather in Hong Kong occurred in the evening of April 12, 2025 and lasted till April 17, 2025. It is very uncommon because the sand/dust, originating from Mongolia, managed to climb over the mountains at Nanling in central-southern China with heights reaching about 2000 m above sea level, and reached the coast of southern China. Analysis of local observations confirming the occurrence sand/dust weather, namely, PM10, PM2.5/PM10 ratio, AERONET observations and chemical speciation analysis, are presented in this paper. The trajectory and thickness of the sand/dust is also studied using synoptic weather observations and geostationary meteorological satellite aerosol products. Finally, the forecasting aspect of the sand/dust weather is discussed, from the forecasting by a few days ahead to possibly at the sub-seasonal scale. It turns out that the forecast aerosol concentrations serve as a useful product to hint the occurrence of sand/dust weather in Hong Kong, even though there are still discrepancies between the observed and the forecast values. There is also signature of conditions favourable for sand/dust transport to southern China in model sub-seasonal forecast outputs, and the recurrence of similar synoptic patterns in middle and lower troposhere in late spring (April) in the future may hint the potential of sand/dust weather over Hong Kong again."

However, attributing inferred CH4 fluxes to specific source sectors often relies heavily on prior information and assumptions, introducing uncertainties. Incorporating co-emitted species into top–down analyzes can provide additional observational constraints for more accurate source attribution. In this study, we examine the 2010–2018 emission trends of CH4 and ammonia (NH3), both of which are emitted from the livestock sector, using satellite observations of these two gases. Our analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between CH4 and NH3 emission trends at the continental scale, mainly driven by increases in Pan-Tropical regions including South Asia, East and West Africa, North Latin America, and Brazil. This observation-derived correlation is generally consistent with changes in livestock populations. In contrast, widely used bottom–up emission inventories fail to capture this correlation, likely due to inconsistencies in the activity data used for compiling greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. These findings support the attribution of substantial increases in CH4 emissions to the livestock sector, identifying it as one of the major drivers for recent rises in tropical CH4 emissions."

Analysis of cloud properties from Himawari‐8 is combined with data from IMERG and ERA5 to explore new results about changes in cloud properties relating to heavy rainfall and intraseasonal variability. This study brings a fresh angle to the challenge of understanding the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) modulation of cloud and precipitation over Sumatra by examining changes in the total cloud area and, more importantly, changes in the cold cloud tops that indicate the deepest convection. Although widespread cold clouds are likely regardless of MJO phase, the enhanced prevalence of cold tops requires the support of the large‐scale convective envelope. These results provide insight about how the MJO influences the nature as well as the amount of convection. Heavy rainfall is shown to make a larger percentage contribution to the total rainfall during the MJO‐enhanced convection phases (2‐3‐4) over Sumatra. This contribution is suggested to be related to a higher prevalence of cold cloud core areas in phases 2 and 4. In phase 3, there is a remarkable increase in the percentage contribution of heavy rainfall in the cold cloud area but a relatively lower prevalence of the coldest cloud core area, suggesting large‐scale environmental support for heavy rainfall but not necessarily the most intense convection. These results exemplify the role of mesoscale processes and cloud microphysics in modulating the MJO‐scale modulation of rainfall."

 Recent studies have highlighted the need to identify oil and gas (O&G) facilities to connect anonymous aerial or satellite emissions surveys to specific facilities in the production basin. This study proposes a novel deep learning architecture that processes high-resolution (30 cm GSD) 3-band, pansharpened, visible-spectrum (RGB) satellite imagery from Maxar to identify facility outlines and key on-site equipment. The architecture utilizes a dual-branch model paradigm that combines few convolutional layers and Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) within a Transformer-based structure. One branch focuses on detecting two major equipment types at the site, while the other branch identifies overall facility boundaries. Comparison to test data indicates our architecture achieves 93% accuracy for facility identification with as few as 260 positive training samples. Comparing resulting facility data to regulatory reporting indicates that satellite deep-learning–based detection identifies more facilities, with greater detail and specificity than current reporting programs. To implement widespread anonymous aerial or satellite sampling, this type of facility recognition is likely required to attribute emission detections to O&G facilities."

 Spatio-temporal analysis of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) plays a critical role in modulating climate, air quality, and ecosystem health. This study systematically examines the 40-year spatial-temporal characteristics and recent trends of AOD over four main continents represented by China, Germany, America, and South Africa from 1985 to 2024, using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Deep Blue (MODIS DB). The long-term annual mean AODs were found to be 0.27, 0.18, 0.13, and 0.10 for China, Germany, America, and South Africa, respectively, with peak values observed in 1992 across all regions likely linked to volcanic activities. During recent period from 2019 to 2024, the seasonality of AOD was characterized by minima in autumn over South Africa, moderate levels in summer over America and Germany, and maxima in spring over China. Meanwhile, recent monthly variations of AOD show diverse patterns, with AOD peaks in March, July, June, and September for China, America, Germany and South Africa, respectively. Furthermore, recent trends showed declining AOD rates of −3.1 × 10−3 and −1.0 × 10−2 per year over China and America, respectively, likely attributable to stringent environmental regulations and clean energy transitions. In contrast, increasing trends of AOD were observed in South Africa (1.3 × 10−3 per year) and Germany (1.1 × 10−3 per year), probably suggesting more aerosol emissions. Spatially, recent reductions of AOD derived using the Mann-Kendall test were concentrated in densely populated and industrialized areas of China and parts of America, while increases were widespread across Germany and South Africa. The research underscores the need for sustained monitoring and targeted mitigation strategies to control aerosol emissions, and is benefit for the studies of environment and climate change."

 Smoke aerosols from biomass burning (BB) in the Indochina Peninsula (ICP) constitute a globally significant source of absorptive aerosols, substantially impacting regional climate and air quality. Over the past four decades, the second dominant mode of spring smoke aerosol distribution over the ICP has exhibited a characteristic north-south dipole pattern. To investigate its driving mechanisms, this study analyzes smoke aerosols and meteorological variables using climate statistics (1980–2024), with a focus on interactions among sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric circulation, and smoke absorptive aerosol optical depth (SAAOD). Results demonstrate high sensitivity of the SAAOD dipole to meteorological conditions: positive SAAOD anomalies in the northern ICP correspond to decreased humidity, elevated temperatures, and reduced precipitation, while negative anomalies in the southern ICP correlate with increased humidity, enhanced upward motion, and greater precipitation. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis reveals a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.41) between the interannual variability of the SAAOD dipole and preceding winter SST anomalies in the Arabian Sea (AS), Bay of Bengal (BOB), and South China Sea (SCS). Mechanistically, warm SST anomalies in these regions drive anomalously strong equatorial westerlies, triggering a coupled cyclone system spanning the BOB and SCS. Convergence of BOB-derived westerly moisture and SCS-derived easterly moisture over the southern ICP fuels intense convection and high precipitation, suppressing BB. Moreover, warm SST anomalies induce a meridional overturning circulation, causing downdrafts over the northern ICP. The anomalous cyclone over the SCS enhances transport of dry continental northeasterlies to the northern ICP. These winds warm the leeward slopes of the Yungui Plateau, generating localized hot, dry conditions conducive to BB."

 Satellite observations offer a unique way of monitoring the spatial distribution, vertical structure and temporal variation of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) plumes. In this study, we use observations from the Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) constellation on board China's FengYun-3 (FY-3) meteorological satellites flying in three different sun-synchronous orbits, including dawn-dusk, mid-morning, and afternoon orbits. The constellation provides six global coverages (roughly every 4-h) each day, with equatorial overpass times at 5:30 am/pm for FY-3E, 10:00 am/pm for FY-3F, and 2:00 am/pm for FY-3D. We retrieve SO2 total column and layer height from the Ruang volcanic eruptions in April 2024. The retrievals show consistency among the different HIRAS and are highly correlated with IASI and TROPOMI observations. The e-folding time of the volcanic SO2 mass is estimated to be 9.0 ± 2.8 days, which is representative of a plume in the Upper Troposphere-Lower Stratosphere (UTLS). Lastly, we apply the methods to the eruptions of the Russia's Sheveluch volcano in November 2024 at high latitudes and show the effectiveness and high consistency among the HIRAS sensors in detecting the SO2 signal.

WALL-E provides molecular-level insights into aerosol composition, quantification, and volatility distributions. 
 Organic aerosols (OAs) play a critical role in the atmosphere by directly altering human health and the climate. Understanding the formation and evolution of OAs as well as their physicochemical properties requires a detailed characterization of their chemical composition. Despite advanced analytical techniques developed within the last decades, the real-time online measurement of atmospheric particles remains challenging and is affected by different artifacts (i.e., thermal decomposition, fragmentation, wall loss). In this work, we introduce the newly designed wall-free particle evaporator (WALL-E) coupled with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS), using bromide (Br−) as the reagent ion. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of the WALL-E system, demonstrating its ability to evaporate particles while maintaining the integrity of the compounds composing the particles (i.e., minimal thermal decomposition). To demonstrate WALL-E's performance, the composition of aerosol particles formed from α-pinene ozonolysis in the presence of SO2 is characterized. In addition, by applying the scan declustering method, we can now provide a quantification of the different species present in the condensed phase, e.g., C10H16O4 84 ng m−3, C19H28O7 7 ng m−3 for a total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass of 1 µg m−3. While dimers exhibit higher sensitivities, they account for only 14 %–18 % of the total particle mass, which is considerably lower than their signal fractions (23 %–29 %). This suggests a potential overestimation of the dimer contributions when relying solely on signal fractions. In addition, a volatility analysis using thermograms reveals a clear relationship between T50 and compound saturation vapor pressure (C∗), with lower-volatility species desorbing at higher temperatures. In addition, the measured T50 (the temperature at which 50 % of a compound evaporates) for α-pinene-derived SOA products agree well with theoretical volatility estimation models (e.g., SIMPOL). Overall, this study demonstrates that the WALL-E system coupled with a CIMS is a promising technique for real-time particle characterization (i.e., composition, quantification, and volatility) of atmospheric aerosols."

 Solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) plays a fundamental role in the Earth’s energy balance, influencing a wide range of processes, including material degradation, biophysical reactions, ecological dynamics, or public health. In this context, the first high-resolution (10×10 km) hourly dataset of surface solar UV under clear-sky conditions over mainland China from 1981 to 2023 is introduced, derived from ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalysis data and a reconstruction based on the SMARTS (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) spectral model. Leveraging the SMARTS model’s accuracy and capabilities, this dataset provides UV data at 0.5 nm intervals between 280 nm and 400 nm, offering enhanced granularity for wavelength-specific analysis, thus filling a key gap in high-resolution hourly UV data for China.

Compared with the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) UV product, this dataset offers higher spatial and temporal resolution as well as higher accuracy in comparison with observations, thus enhancing data quality for a wide range of applications. The spatial and temporal distribution of clear-sky UV radiation exhibits distinct regional and seasonal variations, with higher values in the west and south, and lower values in the east and north. Over the past 43 years, the annual mean clear-sky broadband UV radiation averaged over China was 20.05 W m⁻², showing a slightly increasing trend (+0.0237 W m⁻²yr⁻¹). This dataset is now available at https://cjgeodata.cug.edu.cn/#/pageDetail?id=110 or https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28234298, offering a valuable resource for addressing regional challenges related to UV radiation."

In response to this challenge, our new 2003–2023 dataset integrates top-down and bottom-up methods with multi-source data. This provides a plausible emissions range to quantify uncertainty, revealing that the greatest uncertainty is not in traditional hotspots but in regions with infrequent, extreme fires. This work offers vital data for more robust climate models. 
 Against the backdrop of global climate change, the spatiotemporal patterns of biomass burning are undergoing significant changes. However, large discrepancies among different emission inventories hinder a consensus on the true magnitude and long-term trends of global emissions. This study constructs a framework for estimating biomass burning emissions by integrating bottom-up and top-down approaches with various combinations of multi-source data inputs, resulting in the development of the Multi-ensemble Biomass-burning Emissions Inventory (MBEI). Leveraging this framework, we develop the MBEI global emission dataset covering the period 2003–2023, which comprises eight sub-inventories and provides emission estimates for 11 representative greenhouse gases, aerosols, and atmospheric pollutants, including CO2, PM2.5, BC, NO2, and others. A unique feature of MBEI is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in biomass burning emission estimates across various spatial scales, achieved by calculating the average emissions and their Max-Min band at a 0.1° grid scale from these sub-inventories. The analysis reveals that the global annual CO2 emissions from biomass burning are approximately 7304 (4400–9657) Tg, with the maximum value being more than double the minimum. Furthermore, the uncertainty in global biomass burning emissions exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity: in low-emission regions such as Australia and the Middle East, the ratio of maximum to minimum emission estimates can reach 6–7 fold, whereas in traditional hotspots like Africa and South America, this ratio is lower, around 1.9 fold. In terms of temporal trends, global emissions showed a decreasing trend from 2003 to 2013, primarily driven by a reduction in burning activities in tropical regions. This trend, however, reversed to an increase from 2013 to 2023, with the primary drivers being intensified burning in northern high-latitude regions and the frequent occurrence of extreme events. Finally, a comparison with existing inventories confirms the reliability of the MBEI dataset. At both global and regional scales, the average of our inventory is centrally positioned among other inventory estimates in most years, offering a more robust central estimate for assessing biomass burning emission intensity during extreme event years. Moreover, its maximum-minimum range encompasses the estimates of other inventories across most regions and time periods. This capability to characterize uncertainty enables the integration of the new datasets MBEI into analytical frameworks, such as atmospheric chemistry models and exposure risk assessments, thereby enhancing the reliability of global biomass burning dynamics analyses and the robustness of the conclusions.

Combining high‐resolution satellite observations and statistical modeling, this study reveals distinct outflow dynamics and cloud properties differentiating RI from slow‐intensifying (SI‐1/SI‐2) TCs. A novel vortex flow ratio, defined as the ratio of tangential to radial wind, demonstrates RI TCs maintain a distinctly larger mean vortex flow ratio of 0.7, which is 1.8 (2.5) times higher than SI‐1 (SI‐2) TCs, correlating with deeper vortices and energy accumulation in the upper troposphere. RI TCs further exhibit a 10.8% (36.4%) greater radial decrease in ice cloud cover than SI‐1 (SI‐2) TCs, accompanied by a 4.9% (24.4%) greater radial increase in high cloud cover than SI‐1 (SI‐2) TCs, indicative of enhanced vortex contraction and outflow transporting hydrometeors. These findings identify the upper‐level vortex flow ratio and associated cloud radial variation as key intensification regime indicators."

This study presents the first two high‐resolution CH4 profiles (0–25 km) over southeastern China, an economically developed region, using AirCore measurements.

While trends align with observations in northwest China, concentrations were higher. Wind patterns and balloon trajectories influenced the profiles, with long‐range air mass transport from coastal megacities elevating upper‐atmosphere CH4. Comparisons with TCCON, TROPOMI, and GOSAT‐2 revealed 26–39 ppb discrepancies in column‐averaged CH4, exposing resolution limitations and retrieval uncertainties.

Meyer;Jonathan E. Franklin;Colin Harkins;Brian C. McDonald;John C. Lin,Total Column GHG Ratios From Ground‐Based Measurements Inform Emissions Inventories,"Accurately characterizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential for improving inventories and evaluating mitigation efforts. However, this remains particularly challenging in urban environments with heterogeneous emissions and complex meteorological conditions. One effective approach which addresses these challenges uses trace gas ratios of atmospheric measurements to evaluate emissions. This study leverages total column concentration (Xgas ${X}_{\text{gas}}$) measurements from a single EM27/SUN spectrometer in Utah's Salt Lake Valley (SLV) to analyze XCH4:XCO2 ${X}_{\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}}:{X}_{\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}$ and XCO:XCO2 ${X}_{\text{CO}}:{X}_{\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}$ ratios across multiple spatiotemporal scales. By applying a rolling ratio method on sub‐day time windows, we identify periods of strongly covarying concentration enhancements throughout the multi‐year data set. This method reveals seasonal trends that are obscured using approaches from previous literature. We also examine how ratio variations correspond to changing wind conditions, facilitating more granular spatial emissions attribution. Comparisons with CO and CO2 from the publicly available GRA2PES inventory reveal that the CO:CO2 inventory ratios align well with observations, supporting the inventory's methodology. In contrast, comparisons with the GRA2PES CH4 inventory beta, which is still under development, indicate that it does not adequately capture the spatial distribution of CH4 sources in the SLV, highlighting areas for improvement. These findings demonstrate that a single sun‐tracking spectrometer can provide valuable emissions insights and inventory constraints, without requiring multiple instruments or computationally intensive inversion models."

This study examines a 19‐year mean of cloud properties and top‐of‐the‐atmosphere (TOA) cloud radiative effects (CREs) by cloud type, with a focus on regional variations across convectively active tropical regions. Forty‐two cloud types are classified based on effective cloud‐top pressure and cloud optical depth. The analysis reveals distinct regional differences in cloud occurrence and properties, with oceanic regions dominated by convective anvils and boundary‐layer clouds, which have higher liquid/ice water contents, while land regions feature higher fractions of mid‐level clouds with lower liquid/ice water contents. The study further explores shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and net CREs, decomposing the contributions of individual cloud types to total CRE differences between two regions into three components: CRE deviations within a cloud type, cloud fraction (CF) deviations, and their combined effect. Results show that CF deviations have the largest impact, enhancing LW warming and SW cooling for mid‐ and high‐level clouds while reducing SW and net cooling for low‐level clouds. Although the effects of CRE deviations are smaller than those of CF deviations for individual cloud types, its collective contribution to total regional CRE differences, particularly for net CRE, is more comparable, because the former exhibits consistent regional differences across all cloud types while the latter is influenced by opposing effects between low‐ and high‐level clouds. The decomposition analysis also highlights significant regional variations driven by land‐ocean contrasts and meteorological forcings."

 Variability in Arctic stratospheric ozone (ASO) has significant implications for surface climate. Using observational reanalysis datasets and Ozone Monitoring Instrument data, we found that the springtime ASO variations since the 2000s can serve as a precursor to El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the subsequent winter. Springtime ASO variability has become pronounced, particularly over Eurasia, due to the asymmetric structure of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex. With the return of solar radiation to the Arctic in spring, elevated ASO increases solar absorption over Eurasia, contributing to localized stratospheric heating. This heating induces an upper-tropospheric cyclonic circulation over Siberia, facilitating wave energy propagation toward the tropical Pacific. Consequently, upper-level easterly and low-level westerly wind anomalies emerge over the equatorial Pacific, favoring El Niño development (cf. La Niña for decreased ASO). These results highlight the importance of chemical–radiative–dynamical processes in the Arctic stratosphere for understanding tropospheric climate variability."

The original aerosol module in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model v2 (E3SMv2) has problems simulating volcanic aerosols. We alter the aerosol module to simulate the 1991 Pinatubo eruption and implement a more complex chemistry scheme, producing results that better agree with observations. Process analyses of the volcanic aerosols help explain how they grow in the stratosphere. 
 Stratospheric sulfate aerosol produced by volcanic eruptions plays important roles in atmospheric chemistry and the global radiative balance of the atmosphere. The simulation of stratospheric sulfate concentrations and optical properties is highly dependent on the chemistry scheme and microphysical treatment. In this work, we implemented a sophisticated gas-phase chemistry scheme (full chemistry, FC) and a 5-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module with Prognostic Stratospheric Aerosol (MAM5-PSA) for the interactive treatment of stratospheric sulfate aerosol in the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) model to better simulate the chemistry-aerosol feedback following the Pinatubo eruption, and to compare it against a simulation using simplified chemistry (SC) and the default 4-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4). MAM5-PSA experiments were found to better capture the stratospheric sulfate burden from the eruption of the volcano to the end of 1992 as compared to the High-resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) observations, and the formation of sulfate in MAM5-PSA with FC (with an additional OH replenishment reaction) was significantly faster than in MAM4 with FC. Analyses of microphysical processes indicate that more sulfate aerosol mass was generated in total in FC experiments than in SC experiments. MAM5-PSA performs better than MAM4 in simulation of aerosol optical depth (AOD); AOD anomalies from the MAM5-PSA experiment have better agreement with observations. The simulated largest changes in global mean net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere following the eruption were about −3 W m−2 in MAM5-PSA experiments and roughly −1.5 W m−2 in MAM4 experiments."

This study explores how nitrogen oxide emissions from African soils, especially in dry regions, contribute to atmospheric pollution. By using a climate-chemistry model, we show that considering these emissions improves predictions of nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid and ozone, although some discrepancies remain compared to observations. 
 In the context of climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures in Africa, understanding the interactions between atmospheric chemistry, regional climate, and biogeochemical cycles is critical. This study investigates the potential role of biogenic nitric oxide emissions from African soils (BioNO), particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, as major contributors to atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and regional atmospheric chemistry. To this end, we rely on a modelling approach based on the RegCM5 regional climate model, including an updated atmospheric chemistry module and, amongst other, a specific parametrization for BioNO emissions. Throughout the paper, the performances of the model are evaluated  against various datasets, including in-situ observations from the INDAAF network and chemical reanalyses. Sensitivity studies  demonstrate that integrating BioNO emissions into the model enhances the accuracy of simulated NO2, nitric acid (HNO3), and ozone (O3) seasonal cycles and surface concentrations, and reduces simulated biases compared to ground based observations. Despite these improvements, notable discrepancies still exist, in particular between simulated surface ozone concentrations and in-situ measurements. Similar biases are also observed in a chemical reanalysis model and in a state-of-the-art chemistry transport model used for comparison. In addition to highlighting the impact and added value of including BioNO fluxes in regional atmospheric chemistry models, our findings also highlight the suitability of the RegCM5 coupled system for studying regional climate, chemistry and nitrogen cycle interactions over Africa."

We found cooling trends in the TTL from 1980 to 2001, followed by warming from 2002 to 2023. These shifts are linked to changes in atmospheric circulation and impact water vapour transport into the stratosphere. 
 The tropical tropopause layer is the transition region between the well-mixed convective troposphere and the radiatively controlled stratosphere and plays a crucial role in air mass transport between these layers. In this paper, we present updated trends of tropopause and lower stratospheric temperature from radiosondes, GNSS-RO data, and the reanalyses ERA5, JRA-3Q and MERRA-2. Given its importance in determining the concentration of water vapour entering the stratosphere, we focus on temperature trends at the cold-point tropopause (CPT), which we determined from radiosonde observations after correcting for time-varying biases.Radiosonde and GNSS-RO data show a significant shift from strong cold-point cooling for 1980–2001 to warming for 2002–2023. Reanalysis datasets reproduce the robust change in the tropical tropopause temperature trends and furthermore show opposite trends in tropical upwelling for 1980–2001 compared to 2002–2023, consistent with the cold-point and lower stratosphere temperature changes. The shift in cold-point temperature trends around 2000 suggests a regime shift in the dominant mechanism controlling CPT temperatures, from ozone-depleting substance-induced dynamical changes before 2000 to greenhouse-gas-induced radiative warming with some dynamical contributions after 2000. While the role of dynamical changes after 2000 is not completely clear, this regime shift suggests that in the absence of strong dynamically induced cooling trends, radiative warming could dominate the cold-point temperature trends and thus stratospheric water vapour entry values."

We found that criteria using fixed thresholds or monthly average-based thresholds were more suitable for identifying ODEs than the others. Applying a threshold that varies with the monthly average or stricter fixed thresholds also indicated a more significant reduction in ODE occurrences. 
 Tropospheric ozone depletion events (ODEs) occurring in the Arctic spring are a unique photochemical phenomenon in which the boundary layer ozone drops rapidly to near-zero levels. However, the criterion for identifying ODEs remains inconsistent among different studies, which may influence conclusions regarding the characteristics of ODEs. To address this issue, in this study, we applied various criteria used in previous studies to identify springtime ODEs at Utqiaġvik, Arctic (the BRW Station), based on observational data spanning 23 years (2000–2022), and investigated the influence of implementing different criteria. We compared three types of criteria: traditional methods (fixed thresholds), variability-based methods (considering the mean value and standard deviation), and machine learning methods (Isolation Forest), and we found that criteria using fixed thresholds (e.g., 10 ppbv) and relative thresholds based on monthly averaged ozone levels (0.42 times the monthly average) are more suitable for capturing ODEs at BRW compared to other criteria. Results applying these appropriate criteria reveal a significant decline in ODE occurrence frequency over the investigated 23 years, particularly in April, suggesting potential links to climate change and Arctic sea ice melting. However, implementing relative thresholds or more stringent fixed thresholds (5 and 4 ppbv) instead of the 10 ppbv threshold reveals a more significant decline in the number of ODE hours across these 23 years.  Further investigation of meteorological conditions indicates that ODEs at BRW are more prevalent under northerly and northeasterly winds with moderate wind speeds (3–6 m s−1), at lower temperatures and higher pressures, while severe ODEs are more associated with lower wind speeds and temperatures below 256 K. This research highlights the importance of selecting appropriate criteria to accurately identify ODEs and contributes to a better understanding of the complex processes driving the Arctic ODEs."

 In this study, we present a fully automated aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) that is operated during regular passenger aircraft flights in the CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) module of the European Research Infrastructure IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System – https://www.iagos.org/, last access: 20 September 2025). The instrument, termed CARIBIC-AMS, is able to measure the mass concentration of non-refractory aerosol species, namely sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics, in a particle diameter range of approximately 50–800 nm. The main challenge was the mechanical and electrical redesign of a commercial instrument in order to comply with the operating and safety requirements in the IAGOS-CARIBIC container-laboratory before and during flight. In the container-laboratory, the instrument has to operate fully autonomously, typically during four consecutive long-haul flights of 10 h. The CARIBIC-AMS weighs 74 kg, has a volume of 0.16 m3, and consumes 360 W of electrical power during regular operation. Due to the short time for evacuation of the vacuum chamber to sufficiently low pressures before measurement, detection limits are higher during regular flights than during ground operation and were determined to be 0.035 µg m−3 for sulfate, 0.055 µg m−3 for nitrate, 0.69 µg m−3 for organics, 0.38 µg m−3 for ammonium, and 0.022 µg m−3 for chloride (all at STP), for a time resolution of 30 s. These values represent typical averages under flight conditions and refer to a collection efficiency of 0.5. Since the IAGOS-CARIBIC project aims for climatological, regular, long-term data, longer data averaging times are possible, thereby lowering the detection limits by the square root of the number of averaged data points. Data validation, calibration, and instrument characterization were conducted by means of laboratory-based comparisons with existing established aerosol mass spectrometers. Here we report on the details of the automation and the instrument characterization, as well as first in-flight data measured in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere during two IAGOS-CARIBIC flights and during the TPEx (Tropopause Composition Gradients and Small-scale Mixing Experiment) field campaign, conducted in 2024 using a Learjet as research aircraft over northern Europe."

Due to complex physical and optical properties, BC remains poorly constrained. We combined satellite observations with physical models to build a daily, high-resolution, decadal global dataset of BC mass, number, size, and mixing details. The data contains both known sources and new hotspots. These results can support climate models, satellite products, and pollution mitigation. 
 Black carbon, a major absorbing component of atmospheric aerosols, plays an important role in climate regulation, air quality, and human health, yet its column concentration and microphysical properties at regional and global scales remains highly uncertain. In this study, we implement an integrated approach that combines multi-angle, multi-band observations from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer with a Mie scattering framework to estimate black carbon column properties including size and mixing state globally on a daily basis. By constraining particle size distributions with absorption aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo across all four bands, the method simultaneously retrieves number and mass concentrations. Long-term simulations from 2005 to 2020 reveal distinct spatial and temporal patterns, with particularly high levels over biomass burning regions in Africa and South America as well as industrial and urban centers in Asia. Comparisons with ground-based sun photometer measurements and reanalysis data confirm the robustness and accuracy of the estimates. The resulting dataset provides a consistent global record of black carbon column concentrations, offering valuable support for constraining climate models, improving assessments of aerosol radiative forcing, and informing targeted mitigation strategies."

A dedicated parameterization of the deep injection of the plume into the stratosphere ensures a realistic representation when compared to Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer satellite observations. During the first 12 hr of the eruption, on 22 April 2015, SO2 mixing ratio reached 29 ppmv between 15 and 18 km for the first eruption pulse, and 38 ppmv between 12 and 16 km for the second. Most SO2 was injected directly into the stratosphere, with a stratospheric load reaching 308 ktS (kilotons of atomic sulfur, i.e. 616 kilotons of SO2) after the eruption. After 1 month, both stratospheric and tropospheric SO2 loads returned to near‐background levels. During analysis, the chemical conversion of SO2 into H2SO4 removed a part of SO2 from the stratosphere. During the long‐range advection, the co‐location between the subtropical jet stream and the Calbuco plume led to three significant stratospheric intrusions on 24, 26 and 28 April 2015. These events transferred stratospheric SO2 into the troposphere, SO2 mixing ratios in the upper troposphere reaching 15 ppmv, 26 and 15 ppbv, respectively. SO2 is gradually oxidized into H2SO4, with up to 5 ktS of gaseous H2SO4 in the stratosphere on 30 April, but dynamical processes dominate the SO2 atmospheric budget over chemical transformations. This study demonstrates that stratospheric intrusions can play a critical role in the removal of volcanic material from the stratosphere following a major eruption."

One of the goals of TRANS2Am was to study the evolution of ammonia (NH3) in plumes from large animal feeding operations. This work investigates the nearfield deposition of NH3 in four plumes from large animal husbandry facilities observed during TRANS2Am using a mass balance approach with methane (CH4) as a conservative tracer in the timescales of plume transport. Since the plumes in TRANS2Am were not sampled in a pseudo‐Lagrangian manner, an empirical model is developed to correct for variations in summertime NH3 emissions as a function of time of day. The mass balance approach results show that the average summertime NH3 decay time to 80% and 60% against deposition in plumes from large animal sources is 43 (+11/−7) and 85 (+19/−14) min, respectively. Additionally, we present estimates of net fluxes every 5 km downwind of the plume. Under the hot, dry summertime midday conditions sampled during TRANS2Am, we found that within 10–15 km of the large emission sources studied, NH3 undergoes net deposition. Beyond this distance, the complex environmental exchange of NH3 between the atmosphere and the surface suggests that fresh NH3 emissions from smaller nearby sources could switch the direction of the net flux to emission."

Building upon the Global Scene‐Dependent Atmospheric Retrieval Testbed (GSDART), this study develops an enhanced one‐dimensional variational (1DVAR) precipitation retrieval algorithm specifically tailored for monitoring TCs based on Chinese FengYun‐3E (FY‐3E) passive microwave observations over the northwestern Pacific. The algorithm introduces a precipitation‐type differentiation module into the 1DVAR framework (1DVARDPT), employs the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) as the forward operator, and utilizes observations from the FY‐3E microwave humidity and temperature sounders (MWTHS). A comprehensive comparative analysis from 19 TCs reveals that considering precipitation types significantly improves retrieval performances—reducing relative bias from −9.89% to 2.02% and mean absolute error (MAE) from 0.38 mm/hr to 0.32 mm/hr—while enhancing the detection of both light/moderate and heavy precipitation. Furthermore, using ARMS instead of the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) as the forward operator markedly reduces the systematic underestimation seen in conventional retrievals (bias improved from −23.50% to −9.89%), demonstrating ARMS's superiority in precipitation‐sensitive radiative transfer modeling. The findings from this study underscore the importance of accounting for precipitation‐type variability in 1DVAR retrievals and highlight the strong potential of FY‐3E observations and ARMS for advancing microwave‐based precipitation estimation."

COA reacts with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone, as it contains unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid. Laboratory studies during the last decades suggested that the atmospheric chemical lifetime of oleic acid ranges from minutes, whereas atmospheric observations demonstrated that the corresponding value is several hours to half a day. To account for the disagreement, the phase state of COA particles has been hypothesized as (semi‐)solid based on experimental studies for synthetic mixtures at room temperature. However, most of these studies employed substrate, which cannot fully represent the phase state of suspending aerosol particles. The phase state of suspending COA particles has rarely been measured, especially for the whole range of urban‐environment relevant temperatures. By measuring the bounce behavior of suspending particles as a function of temperature, we examined the phase state of major fatty acids in COA (oleic, linoleic, pimelic, and stearic acids), in addition to laboratory‐generated COA produced by heating canola oil, lard, and hotpot soup base. All types of fresh COA particles were liquid for the temperature range above −15°C. Comparison with recent laboratory kinetic study suggested that the phase transition may partially, but not fully, account for the reduced chemical reactivity at lower temperatures. As the temperature of most cities in the world is higher than −15°C, we suggest that fresh COA particles are mostly liquid on a global scale, though observational verification would still be needed."

In the CMA‐MESO model, this study proposes an optimized reflectance scheme based on the Ross‐Li bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. Over land, the Ross‐Li the BRDF model is coupled with the ARMS model using a method based on Fourier transform and Gaussian quadrature decomposition. Over ocean, a static reflectance lookup table is employed. For cloudy sky simulation, an effective cloud particle radius parameterization scheme consistent with cloud microphysical assumptions is introduced. For FY‐4B AGRI data at visible and near‐infrared bands, all‐sky observation errors are analyzed for a dynamic update in the 3DVAR data assimilation system. Five assimilation experiments are conducted, including three single‐channel experiments assimilating FY‐4B AGRI channels 2, 4, and 5 individually, and two combined‐channel experiments assimilating channels 2 + 4 and 4 + 5. Among the single‐channel cases, channel 4 assimilation shows the greatest improvement in the representation of ice cloud coverage. In contrast, assimilating channel 2 or channel 5 alone led to confusion between liquid and ice cloud increments. The combined‐channel assimilation experiments outperformed the single‐channel ones, yielding a significant reduction in the standard deviation (STD) of the simulated reflectance. In summary, assimilating FY‐4B AGRI observations holds a great potential for improving the accuracy of cloud cover representation."

 Understanding size-resolved physicochemical characteristics of atmospheric aerosols is pivotal for elucidating their formation mechanisms, behavior, and atmospheric fate. However, most aerosol studies rely on mass-based methods, which often underestimate the contribution of ultrafine and submicron particles due to their low mass fractions. Despite their small mass, these particles dominate the aerosol number concentrations and play a critical role in atmospheric chemical processes. Herein, we investigate the size-resolved characteristics of submicron aerosols, focusing on three major components: carbon, nitrate, and sulfate, using an integrated analytical approach that combines particle size distribution (PSD) and chemical composition analytical analysis. Online PSD measurements and offline size-segregated aerosol sampling were simultaneously performed using an electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI+), covering aerodynamic diameters from 6 nm to 1.64 μm. Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the chemical composition of size-resolved samples. This integrated approach was applied during a winter haze event. Our results indicate that ultrafine carbonaceous particles, primarily from local traffic emissions, dominated the concentration of submicron aerosols. In contrast, secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfate and nitrate) were prominent in the accumulation mode, forming heterogeneously on pre-existing particles’ surfaces. Nitrate concentrations were particularly elevated during daytime haze periods and coexisted with highly oxidized carbonaceous particles. The observed evolution in carbonaceous aerosol oxidation states and mixing characteristics contributed to enhanced atmospheric reactions, light absorption and scattering modification, and reduced visibility, which are key drivers of haze formation. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated analytical approach for advancing our understanding of submicron aerosol behavior and their role in air pollution and climate."

 During May 2022, the Middle East region (MER) experienced four prolonged and severe atmospheric pollution episodes (APEs), resulting in severe fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in the region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was employed to simulate meteorological fields, while the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to simulate PM2.5 during the APEs. Using ground-based observations, the performance of the models was evaluated, and the spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 and meteorological influences during the APEs were elucidated. The WRF model adequately reproduced the observed meteorological variables, while the CMAQ model quantitatively captured the temporal trends of observed PM2.5 concentrations, and the models' performance metrics met their suggested benchmarks. The results show that APE1 peaked on May 11 with its highest PM2.5 concentrations in Iran, the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. On May 17, APE2 peaked as the pollution spread across the region with elevated PM2.5 concentrations (250 ≤ PM2.5 ≤ 400 μg/m3) in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the UAE, and Oman. APE3 was the most severe episode, peaking during May 18–20 with clusters of elevated PM2.5 concentrations (150 ≤ PM2.5 ≤ 600 μg/m3), especially in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Oman, and the UAE. APE4 was also severe but less compared to APE2 and APE3 in most areas. Furthermore, unfavorable meteorological conditions enhanced the formation of these episodes. The results demonstrate the CMAQ model's capability in reproducing elevated PM2.5 concentrations during severe APEs and can be further used to elucidate source attributions and processes contributing to PM2.5 in the MER."

Hostetler;Simone Tanelli,"Observed impacts of aerosol concentration on maritime tropical convection within constrained environments using airborne radiometer, radar, lidar, and dropsondes","Decoupling aerosol and environmental impacts on convection is challenging. Using airborne data, we correlated convective metrics with aerosol concentrations in several different environments. Results were mixed, but some comparisons suggest that medium-to-high aerosol concentrations were occasionally strongly correlated with convective intensity and prevalence, especially when the atmosphere was relatively unstable. It is important to consider storm environment when evaluating aerosol effects. 
 Aerosol modulation of atmospheric convection remains an important topic in ongoing research. A key challenge in evaluating aerosol impacts on cumulus convection is isolating their effects from environmental influences.  This work investigates aerosol effects on maritime tropical convection using airborne observations from NASA's Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex). Eight environmental parameters with known physical connections to cloud and storm formation were identified from dropsonde data, and 92 dropsondes were matched with corresponding CAMP2Ex flight “scenes.” To constrain environmental conditions, scenes were binned based on their association with “low,” “medium,” or “high” values for each dropsonde-derived parameter. In each scene and environmental bin, eight radar- and radiometer-based parameters with physical implications for convective intensity and/or prevalence were correlated with lidar-derived aerosol concentrations to examine trends in convective characteristics under different aerosol conditions. Threshold values used to stratify the environments were varied across four sensitivity tests to examine how the convective–aerosol correlations within each environmental bin responded. The results were generally inconclusive, with relatively weak correlations observed with limited statistical significance in many cases. Some interesting and potentially impactful comparisons identified in the convective–aerosol analyses support the idea of warm-phase convective invigoration trends and suggest that higher aerosol concentrations were correlated with stronger and/or more-prevalent convection in some cases, while other cases saw a “Goldilocks” zone of medium aerosol concentration favoring enhanced convection. Our results also stress the importance of considering environmental conditions when evaluating aerosol impacts."

We show that their interactions modify, in a definitive way, the concentrations of the gas phase and the surface properties of the dust, which could have important implications for the atmospheric composition and the Earth's climate. 
 The uptake of glyoxal on realistic submicron mineral dust aerosol particles from a natural soil (Gobi Desert) is investigated during experiments in a large simulation chamber, under variable experimental conditions of relative humidity (RH), irradiation, and ozone concentrations. The uptake of glyoxal on the dust particles starts as soon as the glyoxal is injected into the chamber. At 80 % RH, the measured uptake coefficient of glyoxal on mineral dust is γ = (9±5) × 10−3. The totality of the mass of reacting glyoxal is transformed into organic matter on the surface of the dust particles. The uptake of glyoxal is accompanied by the appearance of marker peaks in the organic mass spectra and a persistent growth in the volume concentration of the dust particles. While the mass of the organic matter on the dust rapidly reverts to values prior to uptake, the organic composition of the dust is modified irreversibly. Glycolic and other organic acids, but also oligomers, are detected on the dust. At 80 % RH, compounds ranging from C4 to C10 are observed as oligomerization products of glyoxal mono- and di-hydrate forms. The study suggests that dust aerosols could play a very substantial role in the formation of organic aerosols at high RH, but also that the reaction could have potentially important implications for the dust optical and hygroscopic properties, including their pH."

Diallo;Cosme Alexandre Oliveira Barros Figueiredo;Diego Barros;Ligia Alves da Silva;Patrick Essien;Anderson Vestena Bilibio,Modulation of tropical stratospheric gravity wave activity and the ITCZ position by modes of climate variability using radio occultation and reanalysis data,"We studied how the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) interacts with atmospheric gravity waves high in the sky and how global climate patterns like El Niño affect them. Using RO, ERA5, and NCEP reanalysis data, we found that the ITCZ shifts with season but stays strong year-round, influencing weather and energy flow. Our findings show how climate patterns shape weather systems and help predict changes, improving understanding of the atmosphere and its effects on global climate. 
 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a dominant feature of tropical climate characterized by intense convection that influences global atmospheric circulation and serves as a primary source of stratospheric gravity waves (GWs), which transport energy and momentum vertically through the atmosphere. This study investigates the modulation of the tropical ITCZ position and stratospheric gravity wave activity by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) using 11 years (2011–2021) of radio occultation and reanalysis data. ITCZ latitude (from 850 hPa refractivity) and gravity wave potential energy maxima (from stratospheric temperatures) were identified via Gaussian fitting. Both ITCZ and gravity wave potential energy maxima exhibit coherent seasonal migration (∼10 and ∼5° latitudinal shifts, respectively), with potential energy maxima typically equatorward of the ITCZ. ENSO is the primary modulator: El Niño conditions shift the ITCZ northward in the American sector but southward in the African and Asian sectors. For gravity wave potential energy maxima, El Niño induces southward shifts in the American sector but northward shifts in the Asian sector, while enhancing overall GW activity. The MJO prompts regionally complex southward shifts in the ITCZ/potential energy maxima. The QBO predominantly influences gravity wave potential energy, with westerly phases associated with southward shifts in the potential energy maxima in the African and Asian sectors. While long-term latitudinal trends are weak, climate modes significantly impact ITCZ/GW peak values. The radio occultation data captured finer-scale features than reanalysis products, highlighting the importance of observational constraints in understanding troposphere–stratosphere coupling mechanisms."

The average global NH3 emissions over the period are ~97 Tg NH3 yr-1, which is significantly higher than three reference inventories. The analysis provides confidence in the seasonal variability and regional budgets and provides new insights into NH3 emissions at global and regional scales. 
 Ammonia (NH3) emissions have been on a continuous rise due to extensive fertilizer usage in agriculture and increasing production of manure and livestock. However, the current global-to-national NH3 emission inventories exhibit large uncertainties. We provide atmospheric inversion estimates of the global NH3 emissions over 2019–2022 at 1.27° × 2.5° horizontal and daily (at 10 d scale) resolution. We use IASI-ANNI-NH3-v4 satellite observations, simulations of NH3 concentrations with the chemistry transport model LMDZ-INCA, and the finite difference mass-balance approach for inversions of global NH3 emissions. We take advantage of the averaging kernels provided in the IASI-ANNI-NH3-v4 dataset by applying them consistently to the LMDZ-INCA NH3 simulations for comparison to the observations and then to invert emissions. The average global anthropogenic NH3 emissions over 2019–2022 are estimated as ∼97 (94–100) Tg yr−1, which is ∼61 % (∼55 %–65 %) higher than the prior Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory's anthropogenic NH3 emissions and significantly higher than two other global inventories: CAMS's anthropogenic NH3 emissions (by a factor of ∼1.8) and the Calculation of AMmonia Emissions in ORCHIDEE (CAMEO) agricultural and natural soil NH3 emissions (by ∼1.4 times). The global and regional budgets are mostly within the range of other inversion estimates. The analysis provides confidence in their seasonal variability and continental- to regional-scale budgets. Our analysis shows a rise in NH3 emissions by ∼5 % to ∼37 % during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 over different regions compared to the same-period emissions in 2019. However, this rise is probably due to a decrease in atmospheric NH3 sinks due to the decline in NOx and SO2 emissions during the lockdowns."

Our findings highlight that organic matter, sulfate, and nitrate are the dominant contributors to PM2.5 mass concentrations. Notable seasonal variations in the light absorption capacity of water-soluble brown carbon, accompanied by a high degree of oxidation are also observed. 
 Brown carbon (BrC) aerosols have attracted considerable attention due to their significant climatic effects, yet their sources, optical properties, and seasonal behavior remain poorly understood in remote high-altitude regions. In this study, year-long fine particular-matter (PM2.5) samples were collected at a receptor site in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to investigate the optical and chemical properties and sources of water-soluble BrC (WS-BrC). The annual average PM2.5 concentration was 10.3 ± 7.4 µg m−3 with clear seasonal variation (spring > winter > fall > summer). Organic aerosol (OA) was the major component across all seasons with an annual contribution of 37.7 % to the total PM2.5 mass, followed by sulfate (21.3 %), nitrate (12.1 %), and other species. Backward trajectory analysis indicated that aerosols were mainly transported from the northeast and east of the sampling site. The seasonal mass absorption efficiency of WS-BrC at the wavelength of 365nm (MAE365) were 0.92 ± 0.54 m2g−1 in spring, 0.40 ± 0.24 m2 g−1 in summer, 0.81 ± 0.46 m2 g−1 in fall, and 0.97 ± 0.49 m2 g−1 in winter, exhibiting a relatively weak light absorption throughout the year with the strongest photobleaching in summer. Notably, WS-BrC light absorption was positively correlated with the oxidation degree of OA during spring and winter, but negatively correlated in summer and fall, suggesting different chemical aging processes and sources of BrC. These findings enhance our understanding of BrC behavior on the TP and contribute to assessments of its climatic impacts in this high-altitude region."

Simonson,A large-eddy simulation exploration of the assumptions used in retrieving entrainment from a mixing diagram approach with ground-based remote sensors,"Entrainment is key in understanding temperature and moisture changes within the boundary layer, but it is difficult to observe using ground-based observations. This work used simulations to verify an assumption that simplifies entrainment estimations from ground-based observational data, recognizing that entrainment is the combination of the transfer of heat and moisture from above the boundary layer into it and the change in concentration of heat and moisture as boundary layer depth changes. 
 Entrainment is a crucial component of the atmospheric boundary layer (BL) moisture and heat budget. While usually thought of as only entrainment flux, entrainment within the mixed layer budget equation is really composed of two terms: the flux of a property across the boundary separating the BL from the free troposphere and the change in the concentration of a property as the depth of the BL changes. In a recent study, Wakefield et al. (2023) used ground-based remote-sensing observations to estimate entrainment flux as the residual of a mixing diagram framework that was applied to the daytime convective boundary layer. This present work uses large-eddy simulation (LES) to examine how well this residual assumption for entrainment fluxes alone compares to the actual sum of those two entrainment terms derived from spatial averages of the LES output. We highlight the importance of the second entrainment term in closing the mixed layer budget and show that the residual assumption does not represent entrainment flux only but rather a total entrainment term when the boundary layer depth is changing."

 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem balance and can have both beneficial and harmful effects on human health. Erythemal UV radiation (UVER), which is a weighted sum of UVA and UVB radiation, is directly linked to skin cancer in humans. Although satellite observations offer a useful tool to monitor UV radiation globally, current global satellite products have limitations such as coarse spatial/temporal resolutions and poor spatial/temporal continuity. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method to estimate all-sky UVER by establishing a practical parametric model between UVER and downward shortwave radiation (DSR), total ozone column (TOC), solar zenith angle (SZA), and elevation. A multiple scattering correction algorithm was also developed to improve the accuracy of UVER estimation over highly reflective surfaces. The UVER estimation was validated against 49 ground stations worldwide and showed high accuracy with R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 607.92 J/m2∙day, relative RMSE = 23.97 %, MBE = -81.32 J/m2∙day, relative MBE = -3.76 %. Based on the proposed method, a seamless global land high-resolution (1 km) all-sky daily dose of UVER (EDD) product during 2005–2022 was developed as a new member of the Global Land Surface Satellites (GLASS) product suite.

 The Fenwei Plain (FWP) has experienced the most serious winter PM2.5 pollution in China since 2000. This study investigates causes behind interannual variability of wintertime PM2.5 concentration in the FWP during 2000–2021 and projects future trends through integrated observations, reanalysis data and simulations. The results show that the Eurasian-like (EUL) pattern is responsible for the interannual variability of PM2.5 concentration in the FWP, accounting for up to 55 % of the dominant pollution mode in the region. The EUL pattern modulates PM2.5 anomalies by causing higher relative humidity, more stable atmospheric stratification and anomalous southeasterly wind. Additionally, based on an EUL index, this study further projects that large-scale atmospheric circulation may exacerbate PM2.5 pollution in the FWP during 2035–2060. Specifically, the EUL pattern exhibits greater extremity and a higher frequency under high emission scenarios (i.e., 39.9 % in SSP585) compared to low emission scenarios (i.e., 19.9 % in SSP245), suggesting increased frequency of the EUL pattern and the associated PM2.5 pollution events in the FWP after 2035 in high emission scenarios. These insights provide scientific support for prevention and control of PM2.5 pollution in the FWP in winter."

 Wildland fires, including both wildfires and prescribed burns, emit large quantities of smoke containing hazardous air pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Understanding PAHs concentrations in these smoke-filled environments is key to developing effective mitigation strategies to protect public health and safety. However, conventional measurement strategies are not always feasible in the highly dynamic and logistically complex settings of wildfire events. As a result, alternative approaches are needed, such as the use of silicone wristbands (SWBs) as passive air samplers. In this study, PAHs were analyzed in SWBs worn by firefighters during prescribed burns and wildfires. After deployment, extraction, and GC-MS/MS analysis, PAH air concentrations were calculated using a compound-specific kinetic uptake model. Personal exposure to PAHs was task-specific: wildfire operators and torchers, who ignite the fires, experienced the highest concentrations (mean sum of PAHs ≈ 5000 ng/m3), followed by liners, who manage fire boundaries (≈2000 ng/m3), while truck drivers exhibited the lowest exposure concentrations (≈100 ng/m3), likely due to their roles keeping them farther from the smoke-dense areas. Additionally, to evaluate the SWBs’ ability to capture particle-bound PAHs, PAH air concentrations measured in SWBs were compared with those obtained from PM2.5 filter sampling. The findings highlight the utility of passive air sampling with SWBs in detecting PAHs and underscore their potential for monitoring exposure concentrations in complex atmospheric environments."

 This study aims at quantifying the effect of different aerosol types on sunburning solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, quantified by the UV Index (UVI), using global simulations with a radiative transfer model which are based on aerosol optical depth data derived from the GFDL-ESM4 model. The reductions in UV radiation due to the presence of aerosols show a strong regional variability, with the largest effect caused by organic aerosols and dust, followed by black carbon, while sulfates and sea salt have a minor influence. In the 1950s and 1990s decreases in the UVI are dominated by the presence of organic aerosols mainly over Western S. America (−3.9 UVI units) and South and East Asia (−1.9), as well as by dust in Northern Africa (−3.8). Despite its low optical depth (0.08), the effect of black carbon on UVI is significant in specific regions (e.g., Central Africa and South and East Asia in the 1950s and India in the 1990s.Aerosol decreases from the 1990s to the 2090s under the SSP1–2.6 scenario result in UVI increases, by up to ∼5 over South and East Asia due to decreases in organics and black carbon. Under SSP3–7.0, the UVI changes are mostly negative worldwide, primarily due to increases in organics. Finally, under SSP5–8.5, UVI increases mainly in Asia, Europe, and the Southern S. America due to decreases in black carbon, sulfates, dust and organics, while in other regions the UVI changes are negative driven by increases in organics."

 The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a densely populated and agriculturally productive region, experiences substantial emissions from industrial activities, vehicular traffic, and biomass burning. These emissions contribute to high aerosol loading and significant variability affecting the ultraviolet (UV) radiation, impacting air quality, climate, and public health. The present study employs Box-Jenkins, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to analyze and forecast the ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) using data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) over selected urban regions in the IGP. Time-series data from January 2005 to December 2020 (∼16 years) are utilized to capture seasonal patterns and long-term trends, enabling predictions for the next two years. Stationarity of UVA, UVB, and AOD data is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, followed by autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) analysis to determine the optimal model order. Model is fitted by estimating various parameters through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) optimization techniques and found suitable with (1,1,1)(1,1,1)12, considering a monthly seasonal factor for predicting UVA, UVB fluxes, and AOD. When SARIMA was used with exogenous variables for prediction of UVA, UVB and AOD it was found that different stations had different optimal configurations. The model validation involves error and comparative analyses. Error metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the predicted data, indicate low errors. Comparative analysis shows strong agreement between modelled and CERES data, with significant correlation metrics such as the R-squared coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient (r), degree of agreement (DOA), and Taylor skill score (TSS). Model accuracy is further assessed using normalized Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while model adequacy is evaluated through Ljung-Box and Jarque-Bera tests. Results indicate a strong seasonal dependence of UV radiation and AOD, with peaks during pre-monsoon and winter months, respectively. The SARIMA model effectively captures temporal variability and provides very good forecast for time series data valuable to researchers in air quality management and climate mitigation."

 Various initialization procedures have proven beneficial for improving tropical cyclone (TC) prediction, yet numerous challenges remain. This study first employs the dynamical initialization (DI) method to enhance the initial TC intensity, and subsequently assesses the effectiveness of assimilating radiance data from the Microwave Humidity Sounder II (MWHS-2) and the Microwave Temperature Sounder III (MWTS-3) onboard the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, along with the conventional data. A case study on Typhoon Doksuri is conducted using the Hybrid EnKF-3DVAR method for a 48-h forecast. Results demonstrate that the DI scheme not only strengthens the initial vortex, but also improves both track and intensity forecasts. On the basis of DI, assimilating both conventional and microwave data can further refine the initial conditions, thereby reducing forecast errors. More specifically, assimilating conventional data yields the best performance in track forecasting, while simultaneously assimilating conventional data, MWHS-2, and MWTS-3 radiance remarkably refines both thermodynamic and dynamic variables in the initial fields, resulting in the most accurate prediction of minimum sea level pressure (MSLP). Moreover, the DI rectifies the distribution of 24-h accumulated extreme rainfall after landfall in Fujian Province, China, but underestimates the rainfall intensity. However, additionally assimilating MWHS-2 radiance data enhances the forecast of severe precipitation especially over 400 mm. These findings support that combining DI with data assimilation (DA) can further improve initial conditions and thus TC forecasts. In conclusion, the credibility of FY-3E microwave radiance assimilation in reducing forecast errors, particularly the efficacy of MWHS-2 radiance in heavy rainfall forecasts, has also been proved."

Validated against independent datasets, our approach improves aerosol classification and may help refine lidar-based processing strategies. 
 Aerosol typing is essential for understanding atmospheric composition and its impact on the climate. Lidar-based aerosol typing has been often addressed with manual classification using optical property ranges. However, few works addressed it using automated classification with machine learning (ML) mainly due to the lack of annotated datasets. In this study, a high-vertical-resolution dataset is generated and annotated for the University of Granada (UGR) station in Southeastern Spain, which belongs to the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET), identifying five major aerosol types: Continental Polluted, Dust, Mixed, Smoke and Unknown. Six ML models – Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM and Neural Network- were applied to classify aerosol types using multiwavelength lidar data from EARLINET, for two system configurations: with and without depolarization data. LightGBM achieved the best performance, with precision, recall, and F1-Score above 90 % (with depolarization) and close to 87 % (without depolarization). The performance for each aerosol type was evaluated and dust classification improved by ∼ 30 % with depolarization, highlighting its critical role in distinguishing aerosol types. Validation against independent datasets, including a smoke case and a Saharan dust event, confirmed robust classification under real and extreme conditions. Compared to NATALI, a neural network-based EARLINET algorithm, the approach presented in this work shows improved aerosol classification accuracy, which emphasize the benefits of using high-resolution multiwavelength lidar data from real measurements. This highlights the potential of ML-based methods for robust and accurate aerosol typing, establishing a benchmark for future studies using multiwavelength lidar at high-resolution data from EARLINET."

The CH4 emissions were much higher than those reported in local inventories, with natural gas contributing up to 74 % of the emissions. Several CH4 sources not accounted for in current inventories were identified. These results emphasize the need for more comprehensive emissions tracking in urban areas to enhance climate change mitigation efforts. 
 Urban areas are regions where large greenhouse gas emissions are expected, but in many urban areas, the sources and sinks remain uncertain. In this study, we conducted mobile and eddy covariance measurements to evaluate CH4 emissions in the megacity Osaka, Japan. Based on the mobile measurements, several elevated CH4 concentrations were observed. Most locations were not related to CH4 sources identified by emission inventories reported by local governments. Two platforms for mobile measurements, vehicle and bicycle, showed good consistency for estimating total CH4 emissions, but vehicle measurements tended to yield smaller natural gas emission estimates than bicycle measurements. CH4 emissions from bicycle measurements were adjusted using daytime CH4 fluxes via the eddy covariance method for flux footprint areas and used to upscale to Sakai and Osaka cities. Using these upscaled emissions from vehicle measurements as a proxy for total area fluxes the estimated CH4 emissions were 10 021 ± 1000 t CH4 yr−1 for Osaka and 2379 ± 480 t CH4 yr−1 for Sakai, 18 times and 2.5 times greater, respectively, than inventory estimates. Coincident C2H6 observations indicated that natural gas emissions contributed 64 % of the total CH4 emissions in Osaka city and 47 % in Sakai city. From these snapshots, the CH4 emissions from the metropolitan areas in Japan may be considerably greater than the emission inventories, and most CH4 sources are not well characterized in those inventories. These unaccounted sources need to be better characterized to improve the Japanese CH4 inventory and assess whether these emissions can be mitigated."

Using a Bayesian isotope mixture model, we found that the relative contribution of the NO3 + volatile organic compound (VOC) pathway to NO3− formation in spring in Lhasa was several times higher than that in urban cities, highlighting the significant influence of VOCs transported from outside the Tibetan Plateau. 
 Atmospheric particulate nitrate aerosol (NO3-), produced via the oxidation of nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2), plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry and air quality, yet its formation mechanism remains poorly constrained in the plateau region. In this study, we report for the first time the yearly variation in the signatures of the stable oxygen isotope anomaly (Δ17O=δ17O-0.52×δ18O) in NO3- collected in the urban Lhasa (3650 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.)), on the Tibetan Plateau, China. Our results show that NO2+OH was the largest contributor to NO3- formation (46±26 %), followed by NO3+volatile organic compound (VOC) (26±18 %) and N2O5+H2O (28±11 %) using the Bayesian Isotope Mixture Model. Notably, there were significant differences in the NO2+OH, NO3+VOC, and N2O5+H2O pathways between spring and the other three seasons (T test, p<0.05). Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) dispersion model, we highlighted the influence of VOC emissions from regions such as Afghanistan and northern India, which enhanced NO3- concentrations in Lhasa during spring. Furthermore, the diurnal distribution of NO3- oxidation pathways varied distinctly across seasons, suggesting that these differences in NO3- pathways were attributed to aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), VOC concentrations, and the atmospheric lifetime of NO3-."

The world's longest record of solar radiation intensities causing harmful skin redness comes from observations at Belsk, Poland, between 1976 and 2023. In this century, the intensity of such radiation is stable but 15 % higher than in the 1970s. This trend is due to the combined effects of a decrease in stratospheric ozone and an increase in cloud transparency before 2000. 
 The world's longest homogenised series of measured erythemal solar irradiance comes from biometers operating in Belsk, Poland (51.84° N, 20.79° E), in 1976–2023. Linear trends in erythemal radiant exposure (ERE) are calculated for the first (1976–1999) and second (2000–2023) halves of the observation period. A statistically significant increasing trend of 6.9 % per decade was found for annual ERE in the first period. In the second period, only the trend in seasonal (June–August) ERE was statistically significant (3.1 % per decade). The method proposed here to reveal the sources of the ERE trends involves the construction of separate and combined forcings from clear-sky (total column ozone and aerosol optical depth) and cloud proxies (sunshine duration, clearness index). The superposition of these proxy effects over 1985–1999 was the source of the positive trend in annual ERE for the first half of the observations. Before 1985, clear-sky and cloud effects had cancelled each other. The maximum ERE growth rate of 19.4 % per decade over 10 years was found in 1984–1993, with overlapping forcing effects of decreasing ozone and cloudiness responsible. Clear-sky and cloud effects stabilised after 1996 and 2005, respectively. The cloud effect has begun to force a positive trend in the annual ERE again since 2015 due to increasing cloud transparency and/or the disappearance of cloud cover. Comparisons of the performance of linear and non-linear versions of the ERE models show that interaction effects between clear-sky and cloud proxies can be neglected in trend analyses."

Using measurements, reanalysis data, and models, we found that cloud–radiation interactions can worsen O3 pollution, and climate warming will amplify the influence. We highlight that climate change will pose greater challenges for China's O3 pollution prevention and control, and actions such as reducing O3 precursors emissions and mitigating climate change are urgently needed. 
 Ozone (O3) pollution has recently become the most critical air quality issue in China, yet its underlying drivers related to climate change remain poorly understood. Here, we use a regional atmospheric chemistry model, along with 10-year ground-level O3 measurements, and reanalysis data on low cloud cover (LCC) and surface downward shortwave radiation (SSRD) to investigate the impacts of variations in LCC, SSRD, and cloud–radiation interactions (CRIs) on O3 production. We design six numerical experiments and specifically modify parameters related to cloud radiation effects in the chemistry module to find out the underlying cause for O3 increase during the warm season of 2022 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. Results show that O3 production is strongly modulated by LCC and SSRD. CRI plays a significant role in regulating O3 concentration; i.e., reduced LCC, increased SSRD, and a weakened CRI are primarily responsible for the sharp increase in warm-season O3 concentration observed in 2022 in the YRD, China. Moreover, climate warming is likely to exacerbate future O3 pollution via weakening CRI due to fewer clouds and more SSRD. To mitigate O3 pollution, we thus propose implementing more stringent emission reduction measures on O3 precursors, along with proactive strategies to address climate change."

In this study, we quantified and characterized the OSs over East Asian marginal seas. The chemical nature and spatiotemporal distribution of OSs were modified by the joint influence of marine emissions and transported terrestrial pollutants. The results highlight the vital roles of OSs in shaping organic aerosol formation and sulfur cycle during summer in the marine boundary layer. 
 Organosulfates (OSs) represent an unrecognized fraction and a potentially important source of marine organic aerosols. Based on shipboard observations over East Asian marginal seas, we characterized OSs in marine aerosols during spring, summer, and autumn. The C2–C3 OSs and isoprene-/monoterpenes-derived OSs were quantified using synthesized standards. The total quantified OSs concentrations ranged from 4.5 to 109.1 ng m−3, contributing 0.1 %–3.2 % of the mass concentration of marine organic aerosols. The highest OSs concentrations, dominated by C2–C3 OSs and isoprene-OSs, were observed in summer, which surpassed the abundance of methane sulfonic acid, a key component in climate regulation by oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions. Abundant OSs formation in summer was mainly attributed to the increased isoprene emissions from the ocean. During the spring and autumn cruises, transported continental pollutants resulted in the higher fraction of monoterpene-derived (nitrooxy-)OSs, as well as the elevated OSs concentrations over regions surrounded by the continent. This work highlights the joint effects of marine emissions and continental outflows on the formation and distribution of atmospheric OSs over marginal seas."

Such oxidation can also generate a variety of new OS products, and can be as a potential source for some atmospheric OSs with previously unknown origins. 
 Organosulfates (OSs) are ubiquitously present in atmospheric aerosols and cloud droplets, and affect aerosol-cloud-climate interactions via their distinct physicochemical properties. Although various formation pathways and transformation mechanisms have been proposed, the origins of many atmospheric OSs remain unclear or unexplained. In this study, we investigated the aqueous-phase oxidation of an α-pinene-derived organosulfate (C10H17O5SNa, αpOS-249) by •OH radicals as a potential source of some uncharacterized atmospheric OSs by quantifying the kinetics and characterizing the reaction products. An aqueous-phase photoreactor was used to conduct the aqueous-phase •OH oxidation of   αpOS-249, revealing a rate constant of (2.2 ± 0.2) × 109 L mol−1 s−1 and atmospheric lifetimes ranged from minutes to about 2 d under atmospherically relevant cloud conditions. The product analysis revealed that a variety of more oxygenated C10 OS products, smaller OS (< C10) products, and inorganic sulfates (e.g., bisulfate and sulfate) can be produced via functionalization and fragmentation processes upon oxidation. Most of the OS products have been detected in the atmosphere, with some of them whose sources and formation mechanisms are unknown thus far. Our study provides a new perspective that the chemical transformation of larger OSs via aqueous-phase oxidation can proceed efficiently to yield a variety of new OSs, serving as a source for atmospheric OSs, particularly smaller OSs. These findings would be useful in field data interpretation and model simulations regarding the abundance, formation, transformation, and atmospheric fates of OSs."

 This study presents a three-year continuous observation of ozone (O3) pollution at an urban campus site in Beijing, analyzing temporal characteristics of O3, seasonal variations in ozone production efficiency (OPE), and its sensitivity to nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Despite strict emission controls, which reduced NOx by 32 % and NOy by 21 % in 2020 compared to 2019, the daily maximum 8-h average O3 still frequently exceeded national standards, though summer averages decreased. OPE analysis revealed seasonal shifts in sensitivity: summer O3 formation was NOx-sensitive (with the highest proportion of NOx-limited regimes among all seasons), while spring, autumn, and winter were VOCs-sensitive. Regional transport significantly impacted O3, particularly in summer via high-VOCs air masses. The NOx/NOy ratio (an indicator of air mass aging) was negatively correlated with OPE. OPE followed a Lorentz curve with NOx (R2 = 0.94), confirming a nonlinear dependence. Sensitivity analysis (6:00–19:00) showed <1 % NOx-limited conditions year-round. Transition regimes matched O3 diurnal patterns: the proportion of the transition regime peaked around 14:00 (coinciding with daily O3 concentration peaks). Spring and autumn were mostly VOCs-limited with transitions; summer balanced three regimes (38.0 % VOCs-limited, 31.5 % transition, 30.4 % NOx-limited) and leaned toward transition; winter was entirely VOCs-limited. The study emphasizes coordinated NOx/VOCs control (especially summer NOx) and regional emission management to mitigate O3 pollution, alongside ongoing VOCs reduction efforts."

However, changes in extreme wildfire regimes and their consequential impact on carbon emissions and burned area (BA) remain unclear. Our results indicate that extreme wildfires in northern Eurasia exhibit a latitudinal shift in intensity and frequency during 2003–2023. Within the historically fire-prone latitude band of approximately 50° N–60° N, a declining trend is observed in both intensity and frequency of extreme wildfires. Conversely, a northward shift of high-intensity extreme wildfires brings unprecedented carbon emissions and BAs to high-latitude regions that are rich in forest carbon storage and permafrost. Although extreme wildfires account for only 10% of all fire events, they contribute to over 30% of total wildfire carbon emissions and BAs across most regions of northern Eurasia."

The health risks remain unclear. Recently, Poyang and Dongting lakes faced record droughts, exposing 99 % and 88 % of their areas. We show that lake bed dust can raise PM10 to 637.5 μg m-³ and exceed non-carcinogenic (HQ = 4.13) and Cr carcinogenic  (approx. 2.10 × 10−⁶)  risk thresholds, posing growing health threats. 
 Many lakes worldwide are shrinking rapidly due to climate change and human activities. Pollutants accumulated in dried lake bed sediments may be released into the atmosphere as dust aerosols. However, whether lake bed dust carries sufficient toxic materials and exceeds threshold atmospheric concentrations to pose a significant health risk is currently unknown. Recently, Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, the largest lakes in east China, experienced record-breaking droughts, with 99 % and 88 % areas exposed to the air. Here, we demonstrate, through field sampling, laboratory simulations, and model validation, that lake bed dust from these lakes could contribute maximum daily PM10 concentrations up to 637.5 µg m−3. This study provides new evidence, which we show, that the dust generated from lake beds exceeded regional thresholds for short-term non-carcinogenic risk (HQ = 4.13) and Cr carcinogenic risk (≈2.10 × 10−6). These findings also suggest that lake bed dust could have a greater impact on human health as climate change leads to more extreme drought conditions in the future."

Thompson;Nalini Krishnankutty;Ignacio Pisso;Philipp Schneider;Kerstin Stebel;Motoki Sasakawa;Andreas Stohl;Stephen M. Platt,Efficient use of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model for atmospheric inversions using satellite observations of column mixing ratios,"Satellite remote sensing of atmospheric mixing ratios of greenhouse gases (GHGs) can provide information on their emissions. This study presents a novel method to use atmospheric mixing ratios observed by satellites with a Lagrangian model of atmospheric transport to estimate GHG emissions. This method can reduce model errors resulting from how an observation is represented by an atmospheric model, thereby helping to reduce the errors in the GHG emissions derived. 
 Satellite instruments for measuring atmospheric column mixing ratios have improved significantly over the past couple of decades, with increases in pixel resolution and accuracy. As a result, satellite observations are being increasingly used in atmospheric inversions to improve estimates of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly CO2 and CH4, and to constrain regional and national emission budgets. However, in order to make use of the increasing resolution in inversions, the atmospheric transport models used need to be able to represent the observations at these finer resolutions. Here, we present a new and computationally efficient methodology to model satellite column average mixing ratios with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) and calculate the Jacobian matrices describing the relationship between surface fluxes of GHGs and atmospheric column average mixing ratios, as needed in inversions. The development will enable a more accurate representation of satellite observations (especially high-resolution ones) via the use of LPDMs and, thus, help improve the accuracy of emission estimates obtained by atmospheric inversions. We present a case study using this methodology in the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) LPDM and the FLEXINVERT inversion framework to estimate CH4 fluxes over Siberia using column average mixing ratios of CH4 (XCH4) from the TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) instrument aboard the Sentinel-5P satellite.

Our analysis revealed that activity growth, technology advancements, and policy-driven emission controls were key driving forces of NMVOC emission changes, but their roles were different across sectors and regions. 
 Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) play a crucial role in tropospheric atmospheric chemistry. Developing accurate NMVOC emission inventories is essential for chemical transport modeling and pollution mitigation. While global NMVOC emissions have been estimated in several inventories, representing the impacts of technology evolution on NMVOC emission dynamics remains challenging. Here, we developed a technology-based global NMVOC emission inventory (MEIC-global-NMVOC) under the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory model for Climate and air pollution research (MEIC) framework to better represent NMVOC emission evolution and drivers. We compiled spatially and temporally full-coverage and consistent activity rates from multiple sources using data fusion and reconstruction approaches. Next, we estimated the evolution of technology distributions and emission control measures by data-driven and policy-driven technology turnover models. The dynamics of global anthropogenic NMVOC emissions during 1970–2020 were presented by sector, fuel type, and product, highlighting activity growth and technology development as key drivers. In developing regions, emission growth was driven by surges in activity rates but curbed by advanced combustion technologies, improved vehicle standards, and substitution of solvent-borne paints. In developed regions, besides the mitigation measures above, emission control technologies substantially reduced fugitive emissions from energy production and emissions from solvent use, driven by policies such as the U.S. New Source Performance Standards and European Union Directives. Despite large uncertainties, MEIC-global-NMVOC emission estimates were generally comparable with other emission inventories at aggregated level for global or regional totals, but remarkable sectoral differences remained. The MEIC-global-NMVOC emission inventory offers a new database for atmospheric chemistry and pollution mitigation research."

Firstly, a global Tm vertical adjustment rate model (NGGTm-H) was developed using the sliding-window algorithm. Secondly, the daily variation characteristics of Tm and its relationships with geographical situations were investigated. Finally, a hybrid-grid global Tm model considering the time-varying vertical adjustment rate (NGGTm) was developed. 
 The atmospheric weighted mean temperature (Tm) is a key parameter in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) water vapour retrieval and can convert the zenith wet delay (ZWD) into precipitable water vapour (PWV). However, there are some shortcomings in the existing Tm models, such as the detailed time-varying vertical adjustment rate not being considered. In addition, the spatiotemporal characteristics of Tm need to be further refined. Therefore, we developed a new global high-precision and high-spatiotemporal-resolution Tm model considering time-varying vertical adjustment rate using the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) atmospheric reanalysis data. Firstly, a new global grid Tm vertical adjustment rate model (NGGTm-H) was developed using the sliding-window algorithm. Secondly, the daily variation characteristics of Tm and its relationships with geographical situations were investigated. Finally, a new global hybrid-grid Tm model (NGGTm) considering time-varying vertical adjustment rate was developed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the NGGTm model was compared with the Bevis and global pressure and temperature 3 (GPT3) models using the Tm data recorded at 378 radiosonde stations in 2017 and the surface gridded Tm data calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis data. The results show that taking the surface gridded Tm data of ERA5 as reference values, the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) value calculated by the NGGTm model was 2.84 K, which was lower with 0.50, 0.18 and 0.06 K than those of the Bevis, GPT3-5 and GPT3-1 models, respectively. Meanwhile, taking the Tm from the radiosonde stations as the reference values, the mean bias and RMSE of the NGGTm model were 0.10 and 3.30 K, respectively, which exhibit the best accuracy and stability among the Bevis, GPT3-5 and GPT3-1 models."

 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), the substitute for chlorofluorocarbons, are regulated under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. China is considered an emission hot region of HCFCs; however, observations and emission estimates are insufficient, with the need of higher sensitivities of new observations to constrain emissions beyond 2021. To better quantify China's HCFC emissions, we build a new atmospheric site named Changdao (CHD), which is more sensitive to emissions in northern China than previously-used sites. Using these measurements, we provide the most recent emission estimates for China in 2022: 150 ± 13 Gg yr−1 for HCFC-22, 31 ± 2.5 Gg yr−1 for HCFC-141b, and 8.8 ± 0.8 Gg yr−1 for HCFC-142b.

 In February 2022, a high load of aerosols released into the atmosphere from biomass burning areas recorded in the Northern South America Region significantly impacted the air quality in several cities of Colombia, including the Aburrá Valley, a major urban area in the Tropical Andes. Based on extensive surface and vertical measurements of meteorological variables and pollutant concentrations provided by the Early Warning System of Medellín and the Aburrá Valley - SIATA, we examined the physical factors behind the inflow of polluted air masses. The research focuses on the role of wind, buoyancy and wind shear on the horizontal and vertical transport of pollutants. A holistic analysis of the dynamic and thermal structure of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) is presented, supported by surface in-situ observations of pollutant concentrations, turbulent fluxes, and vertical profiles of several variables recorded before, during, and after the aerosol inflow. This severe air pollution event resulted in an increase in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by more than 115 % during the night, with average daily concentrations surpassing the maximum allowable concentration for PM2.5 set by Colombian air quality regulations. The results show that during the event, atmospheric pollutants entered during the nighttime from the north and moved southward along the valley axis, driven by a strong channelized airflow at 250 m above the surface and with an average speed of 3.8 m/s. According to high-resolution forecasts with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, the nocturnal airflow was consistent with anomalous northeasterly winds toward the valley. The low-level wind channeled by the valley's topography generated significant mechanical turbulence through vertical wind shear, which considerably increased the vertical momentum fluxes and turbulent kinetic energy within the surface layer. The associated vertical mixing contributed to the downward transport of pollutants, increasing near-surface concentrations of biomass-associated black carbon and PM2.5, superpassing 40 % in relative contribution and reaching up to 60 μgm−3, respectively. Overall, the case study offers new perspectives and improves our understanding of the turbulent mixing and its role in the vertical transport of pollutants through the boundary layer within complex terrain in a tropical setting."

 Aerosol composition and mixing state influence its ability to form cloud droplets and ice crystals and to scatter and absorb sunlight, all of which affect its impact on climate. In this study, aerosol samples were collected from different altitudes, ranging from the sea surface to ∼ 8000 m, over the ocean in the western North Pacific in the summer of 2022 using an aircraft and a research vessel. The samples were classified into three periods based on the sampled air parcel sources: ocean and desert (period 1), Siberian Forest biomass burning event (period 2), and their mixtures (period 3). Measurements of particle composition using transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry revealed that samples from period 1 had high sea salt and mineral dust fractions, whereas samples from period 2 had high fractions of potassium-bearing particles with organics and black carbon. Samples from period 3 showed influences of both sea spray and biomass burning. During periods 1 and 3, the sea salt fractions increased as the samples were collected at lower altitudes. The compositions of biomass burning and sea spray were mixed at individual particles, with higher fractions of Na and K during period 1 and period 2, respectively, than in other periods. Our analysis of individual particles revealed a wide range of compositions and mixing states of particles, which depend on the aerosol source, size, and altitude.

We show that PMC height controls ice particle properties and propose a new formation mechanism involving charged meteoric smoke particle nucleation (CMN scheme). This scheme introduces the cold-trap effect for H2O redistribution, which are fundamentally bottom-up driven by upwelling. These findings provide new insights into PMC formation and water dynamics. 
 Polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), composed of ice particles, play a crucial role in mesospheric H2O redistribution, yet their formation mechanism remains incompletely understood. Using the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite observations, we reveal a previously unreported hemispheric asymmetry: southern hemisphere PMCs show a significant latitudinal decrease in column ice particle concentration, while their northern hemisphere counterparts exhibit zero trend. Our further analysis demonstrates that the column-averaged ice particle concentration (Nc) and radius (rc) are primarily governed by PMC height (h), rather than environmental temperature (Tenv). To explain these observations, we propose the charged meteoric smoke particle (MSP) nucleation (CMN) scheme, an altitude-dependent framework based on two key postulates: (1) charged-MSPs serve as ubiquitous ice nuclei throughout the PMC layer, and (2) ice particles grow predominantly in situ with negligible sedimentation. The CMN scheme naturally accounts for the observed vertical gradients in ice particle concentration (increasing with altitude due to charged-MSPs distribution) and size (decreasing with altitude due to H2O competition among ice particles). By eliminating sedimentation, the CMN scheme introduces a novel bottom-up H2O redistribution mechanism we term the cold-trap effect. This mechanism is driven by summer polar upwelling dynamics: upward H2O transport induces hydration, while simultaneous ice particle formation (facilitated by upwelling-induced cooling) blocks further H2O transport, ultimately causing dehydration above PMCs. While the traditional growth-sedimentation (GS) scheme and freeze-drying effect are well-validated, our CMN scheme and cold-trap effect provide an alternative paradigm particularly for understanding zonal and daily-scale PMC variability and associated H2O redistribution processes."

Satellites enable monitoring of these emissions from space. Our simulations show that the upcoming Twin ANthropogenic Greenhouse gas Observers (TANGO) mission can detect about 500 targets per 4 d cycle under clear skies, but cloud cover reduces detection. Integrating cloud forecasts into TANGO’s manoeuvering boosts detection, highlighting its potential for improving global emission monitoring. 
 Targeting satellite observations offer a promising avenue for detecting and quantifying anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from localized point sources at high spatial resolution. In this study, we assess the detection potential of the Twin ANthropogenic Greenhouse gas Observers (TANGO) satellite mission, scheduled for 2028, using orbit simulations and the TNO global point source (GPS) inventory. We examine its target selection approach across three observational scenarios, clear sky, cloud filtered, and cloud forecast, by applying two prioritization schemes (one favouring CH4 point sources over CO2 and the other vice versa). Results show that, under current detection limits (TDLs), TANGO can detect a large fraction of major point sources, identifying ∼500 targets per repeat cycle, depending on the prioritization scheme employed. However, cloud cover significantly reduces observational yield (∼ 64 %–68 % fewer detections). Integrating a cloud-forecast-informed target selection improves the total number of detected targets by 34.6 % under CO2 prioritization and 22.1 % under CH4 prioritization compared to the cloud-filtered scenario, demonstrating the benefits of adaptive observation strategies. We also explore a hypothetical enhanced detection limit (EDL) scenario, representing the potential for future satellites with improved sensitivity. While EDL extends the range of observable sources, many of these smaller emitters are associated with greater uncertainties, highlighting the importance of well-characterized retrieval precision. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of a satellite constellation, which could enhance revisit times and observational frequency for sources of key interest. Our results demonstrate TANGO as a case study for the capabilities and challenges of next-generation targeting satellite missions, highlighting the importance of high-resolution GHG monitoring and cloud-aware adaptation for improving global emission quantification."

 An in-house-developed millimeter-wave humidity sounder onboard EOS-07 (EOS-07 MHS), launched in February 2023, operates at six frequencies around the 183.3 GHz water vapor absorption band. This study presents a preliminary performance assessment of EOS-07 MHS, including brightness temperature validation, humidity profile retrieval methodology and its validation.Under clear-sky conditions, the biases in brightness temperature measured by EOS-07 MHS, relative to RTTOV simulations were within ±1 K, except for channels 1 and 6. Similarly, intercomparisons with ATMS observations showed biases within ±1 K and a standard deviation of 2–3 K.A random forest-based method was employed to retrieve specific humidity profiles from EOS-07 MHS observations demonstrated agreement with ERA5 reanalysis and radiosonde observations. Compared with radiosonde data, the mean bias and standard deviation of retrieved specific humidity were approximately 0.78 g/kg and 2.3 g/kg, respectively.

 Mounting evidence links ozone (O3) and extreme temperature events (ETEs) to increased mortality, yet the interaction between these factors remains poorly understood. This study investigates the relationship between ambient maximum 8-h moving average ozone concentrations (O3-8h) and exposure to heatwaves and cold spells, and their impact on non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Using a case-crossover design, we analyzed 248,060 non-accidental deaths in Qingpu, Shanghai, China, from 2012 to 2019. Heatwaves and cold spells were defined as periods of sustained extreme temperatures lasting more than two consecutive days. Various temperature thresholds and durations were used to define these events at the grid level. Conditional logistic regression models were employed to assess exposure-response relationships and additive interactions. The odds ratio (OR) for non-accidental mortality associated with low O3-8h concentrations during heatwaves (defined as P92.5_3d) was 1.096 (95 % CI: 0.954, 1.260), compared to low O3-8h without heatwave exposure. During heatwaves, the OR was 1.046 (95 % CI: 1.007, 1.086). Significant synergistic effects were observed between heatwaves and ozone exposure on respiratory and non-accidental mortality (RERI >0, AP > 0, S > 1). No significant interaction was found between cold spells and ozone exposure. Ozone and heatwaves accounted for approximately 1.9 %, 1.3 %, and 3.1 % of non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths, respectively. These findings suggest that heatwaves and ozone exposure significantly increase mortality risk, with a synergistic effect exacerbating the risk."

 Black carbon (BC) is a short-lived climate pollutant that adversely impacts human health, regional air quality, and climate. Accurate monitoring of its spatiotemporal variability remains a challenge due to limited ground-based observations. This study develops a high-resolution (1 × 1 km) dataset of annual BC columnar concentrations across Karnataka, India, for 2018–2024 by combining satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with ground-based BC observations using regression modeling. Results show a consistent rise in annual BC concentrations of 0.2–0.5 μg/m3 per year, except in 2020 when emissions decreased due to pandemic-related restrictions. District-level analysis identifies Kalaburagi, Raichur, Ballari, Bengaluru Urban, and Vijayanagara as major BC hotspots. Sectoral contributions indicate Industry (46.4 %) and Road Transport (39.8 %) as dominant sources, with smaller shares from Residential (6.8 %), Forest Fires (3.5 %), Stubble Burning (2.4 %), and miscellaneous activities (1.2 %).

The high-resolution BC maps and hotspot and sectoral analyses provide improved spatial detail compared to reanalysis products or chemical transport models. These results highlight the growing BC b urden in Karnataka, the need for targeted mitigation in industrial and transport sectors, and the value of satellite-based approaches in supporting evidence-based air quality and climate policies."

 The interaction between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Antarctic stratospheric ozone represents an important tropical-polar coupling mechanism. Using satellite-based observations, reanalysis datasets, and simulations from the global three-dimensional chemical-transport (TOMCAT) and chemistry-climate (WACCM) models, this study investigates how sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) associated with ENSO influence ozone variability. The results show that the peak phase of ENSO significantly impacts the interannual variability of Antarctic spring (September–October) stratospheric ozone in decaying years. Specifically, during the decaying year of El Niño (or La Niña), lower stratospheric ozone depletion is reduced (or enhanced) in Antarctic springtime. During the peak phase of El Niño, tropical SSTA intensifies convection and weakens upper tropospheric winds over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, allowing more wave momentum fluxes from the troposphere into the stratosphere. In the decaying years, anomalous wave trains in both the troposphere and stratosphere link the tropical lower-atmospheric dynamics with the mid-high latitude stratospheric dynamics. Moreover, in the Southern Hemisphere under El Niño, the enhanced upward propagation of planetary waves accelerates the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) and decelerates the mid-latitudes stratospheric zonal wind. Concurrently, polar stratospheric warming destabilizes the polar vortex in the decaying year, suppressing Antarctic springtime ozone depletion. In contrast, following La Niña, these coupling mechanisms typically reverse, leading to mid-latitude stratospheric zonal wind acceleration and polar stratospheric cooling, which strengthen the polar vortex and thus enhance ozone depletion. These findings advance understanding of ENSO-ozone teleconnections and inform ozone recovery predictions."

 The Arctic is experiencing warming nearly twice the global average rate. This significantly affects its precipitation with the snow to rain and mixed phase transitions. Accurate characterization of these changes requires high-resolution vertical profiling of microphysical processes. This study combines surface observation with vertical profiles of the atmospheric parameters and precipitation to investigate the vertical evolution of different forms of Arctic precipitation. Data were collected from the Himadri Research Station, Ny-Å lesund (78°55′N, 11°56′E) in Svalbard, which is a key location along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway into the Arctic. Micro Rain Radar (MRR), disdrometer and ceilometer were used to characterize the type of precipitation and their microphysical evolution up to 6km in altitude, along with the associated cloud base height. The study also explores seasonal variability in the vertical distribution of both liquid and solid precipitation and links their relationship with atmospheric parameters. Different types of precipitation show a varied behavior in terms of vertical evolution and were found to be highly sensitive within 1.5–2 km above the surface altitude. The results are expected to advance the understanding of Arctic precipitation processes, provide critical insights for improving satellite-based precipitation retrievals, and improve the performance of numerical weather prediction and climate models in polar regions."

 Accurately mapping the spatial distribution of surface air relative humidity (RH) is critically important for diverse fields including climate change, public health, and environmental conservation. Although machine learning has exhibited considerable advantages in RH mapping, factors such as its inherent bottom-up learning strategy, the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of geographical phenomena, and the scarcity of ground-based observations limit model performance. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal-guided hybrid learning (STGHL) model for precise RH mapping. The model establishes a hybrid learning paradigm that integrates principles of spatiotemporal autocorrelation and heterogeneity into deep learning architectures. The paradigm organically combines top-down guided learning with bottom-up spontaneous learning through the design of three specialized guided learning modules, which collectively enable neural networks to deeply represent the complex spatiotemporal patterns of RH. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the STGHL model by generating daily RH maps across the Chinese mainland during the period 2014–2018. The rigorous 10-fold spatial cross-validation results show that the STGHL model achieves exceptional performance, with an R2 of 0.92, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.93%, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.24%.

 This study investigates the occurrence and characteristics of stratospheric ozone (O3) intrusion events in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, from 2015 to 2022, using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 (EAC4) dataset. Through statistical analysis and backward trajectory analyses, the study identifies stratospheric O3 intrusion events and explores their vertical transmission patterns. Results show that the northwest of the BTH region, between 108°E–118°E and 45°N–50°N, is most sensitive to such intrusions. The study defines stratospheric O3 slanted intrusion events using three parameters: tropopause pressure change, vertical velocity, and O3 concentration change. These events lasted 43 days in the study period, with a peak in spring—May alone accounting for 33 % of all intrusions. During these events, stratospheric O3 significantly exceeds average levels in the lower troposphere. A detailed analysis of a typical event on June 17, 2015, shows that the westerly jet stream in the mid-latitudes drives the downward tropopause shift toward the BTH region, resulting in rapid horizontal transport of O3-rich air masses at high altitudes. The stratospheric O3 contribution increased at the 600 hPa level as the wind speed decreased with altitude. After about 30 h, the invading air mass reached the lower troposphere in northwest BTH. Vertical transmission is also evident, with significant tropopause descent and faster O3 transport from sensitive northwest areas. This study enhances the understanding of stratospheric O3 intrusions, which is crucial for identifying natural sources of ground-level O3 pollution in the BTH region."

 Accurate detection of precipitation on a global scale is essential for advancing our understanding of the hydrological cycle and improving climate models. This study evaluates the performance of the Rain Masking Algorithm (RMA), developed for NASA’s Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET), in detecting rainfall events and distinguishing them from non-rain events over multiple years. The RMA’s effectiveness was validated against data from co-located disdrometers at two distinct MPLNET sites: the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the United States and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain. Comparisons were also conducted with precipitation retrievals from the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) project. Results indicate that the RMA is highly effective at detecting rain events, outperforming IMERG in sensitivity and accuracy at both sites, and demonstrating also unique capability in distinguishing virga, precipitation that evaporated before reaching the ground (not considered in the intercomparison). However, the algorithm shows limitations in identifying low-intensity precipitation and occasionally records false positives due to transient atmospheric artifacts. These results underscore the potential of the RMA in advancing the validation of satellite precipitation data from the ground, which is advantageous for the upcoming ESA-JAXA EarthCARE mission. Although the current analysis does not include EarthCARE data, we present the performance of RMA and a corresponding matchup strategy that are intended to facilitate next validation efforts for EarthCARE’s precipitation data. This work also highlights the RMA as a promising tool for refining global precipitation monitoring and advancing meteorological and climate forecasting accuracy."

These aerosols then interact with stratocumulus clouds over the Southeast Atlantic, which is difficult for climate models to account for. Our instrument, 4STAR, determines aerosol radiative properties. A dataset was already created for 2016, but additional quality control was required to address instrument issues for 2017 and 2018. 
 The NASA ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) airborne field campaigns deployed a 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research) instrument onboard a P-3 aircraft to measure columnar optical properties of biomass burning aerosol smoke plumes over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean from 2016 to 2018. Although 4STAR's retrievals of aerosol optical properties from direct solar irradiances and diffuse sky radiances were performed, analyzed, and compared against other field campaigns via Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) campaign medians by Pistone et al. (2019) for ORACLES 2016, such an analysis was not extended to 2017 and 2018 due to previously unquantified instrument performance issues.

The instrument issues were diagnosed and mitigated through use of a four-wavelength set, instead of the previous five-wavelength set. Uniform Quality Control (QC) standards were established to ensure consistent data quality across all three campaigns. This resulted in research-quality, four-wavelength 4STAR datasets for 2017 and 2018 that have since been archived along with the original five-wavelength 4STAR 2016 dataset on the NASA Earth Science Project Office website, replacing the older versions at https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2017_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021b) and https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2018_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021c).

SFR retrieval is highly sensitive to ice habit assumptions. Comparisons of the SFRs based on Cloud Profiling Radar, ERA5, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Stage IV indicate that dense and sphere‐like particles tend to overestimate SFR, whereas most non‐spherical particles underestimate it. SFR biases differ by more than 200% between the most extreme cases. Although several ice habits perform well globally, an optimal choice of ice habit is environmentally dependent: A hollow bullet rosette works well in moist and warm conditions, whereas a solid ice sphere excels in cold and dry conditions. A machine learning model integrates multiple ice habits into the SFR algorithm by adjusting their contributions based on environmental conditions. This multi‐ice habit approach improves statistical metrics by ∼10% overall (by 40% in deep clouds) compared to a single ice habit method."

 The stratosphere is generally considered to be stable, with minimal vertical mixing. However, deep convection can transport low-altitude material above the tropopause. Here we use in situ single-particle measurements from the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere mission to show that carbonaceous-sulfate particles from the troposphere account for up to 90% of the stratospheric particles with physical diameter from 0.1 to 1.5 µm in a 4-km layer above the tropopause during an active fire season in 2022. We find that ~43% of the stratospheric carbonaceous-sulfate particles originate from biomass burning. These particles, which are chemically complex and organic-rich, do not remain unchanged once injected into the stratosphere, but form mixtures containing both tropospheric and stratospheric components, indicating perturbation of the stratospheric aerosol layer. We suggest that the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires combined with increasing deep convection as the climate warms may enhance the delivery of biomass burning products to the lower stratosphere, with implications for ozone chemistry and radiative forcing.

 Exposure to concurrent heatwave and ozone pollution events poses a great threat to the health burden. Yet the impacts of future warming on such compound extremes and the associated health risks remain unclear. Here, using dynamic downscaling techniques and multi-model ensembles, we estimate excess deaths attributed to heatwave-ozone compound extremes from climate change under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We find that, driven by future climate change, ozone pollution events in China are projected to grow by 58% by the middle of the century under SSP3-7.0, half of which are also heatwave days. Consequently, the heatwave-ozone compound event exposure rises by a factor of two, causing an additional 61,600 deaths nationwide.

 Accurate cloud detection is essential for the quantitative applications of satellite imager observations, but nighttime cloud detection has challenges due to limited spectral bands, for example, physical methods using only infrared (IR) bands without using spatial textures as input for cloud detection often result in high uncertainties, especially in some situations such as cryosphere surface. Although numerous segmentation-style deep learning cloud detection algorithms have proposed in previous studies, they are inadequate for nighttime due to the difficulty in acquiring two-dimensional truth data for training and validation. To overcome these challenges, the Transformer based Nighttime Cloud Detection (TNCD) framework, which integrates spatial features and utilizes an advanced Transformer architecture with relative position encoding, layer scaling, and channel attention mechanisms, is proposed and investigated for nighttime cloud detection. The model was trained on labels derived from CALIOP data, utilizing a dataset comprising nearly one hundred million segments from MODIS. Independent validation indicates that TNCD achieves robust and consistent performance across various scenarios, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 93.26 % and over 90 % in cryosphere regions. The proposed algorithm avoids the pattern noise appeared in the traditional physical methodology due to the utilization of auxiliary data at coarser resolutions, it also mitigates the negative impact of stripes in IR images for cloud detection. Moreover, TNCD shows high transferable practicability across sensors, with over 90 % OA for MERSI. More importantly, our research underscores the importance of water vapor absorption bands for nighttime cloud detection over the cryosphere. TNCD's high accuracy and robustness provide unique methodology that could be used operationally for nighttime cloud detection."

The average concentrations and number of high concentration outliers extracted by the trend analyses for NOy, T.NO3, CO, and O3 were high in spring, whereas those in winter were high for CO and low for NOy, T.NO3, and O3. These seasonal variations occurred because of wet removal of T.NO3 by high precipitation on the Sea of Japan coast for NOy and T.NO3 and low photochemical activity for O3 in winter.

 When the Tropical Cyclone (TC) Amphan over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) moved northward on 15–21 May 2020, it caused a wide range of heavy precipitation in central and eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is mainly attributed to the water vapor transport from the BoB to the TP. Based on the COSMIC2 and FY3D GNOS radio occultation temperature and moisture profiles and ERA5 reanalysis data, this paper investigates the water vapor channel structure over the TP associated with Amphan using scatter composite and grid interpolation. The observation analysis reveals that under the influence of Amphan, the water vapor over the BoB is transported to the southeastern TP by the southerly jet and then transported eastward by the westerly jet, forming a turning water vapor transport channel over the southeastern TP, and there is an easterly backflow returning the TP in the lower and middle troposphere below the east-turning water vapor channel. The specific humidity near 600 hPa increased by about 3 g kg−1, and the average daily temperature at 300 hPa–200 hPa increased by 10 K over the southeastern TP compared to that before the water vapor channel was formed. The southerly warm and moist airflow from the BoB converges with the colder air over the TP and the cold-dry air behind the southern branch trough, forming a frontal zone on the north side of the water vapor channel. The moisture inversion and temperature inversion can be found in the water vapor channel over the TP.

Furthermore, thanks to a specific filter positioned in front of one of the TIR cameras, it is possible to compute the sulfur dioxide (SO2) content emitted by the volcano at a safe distance from the vent. 
 In the last few decades, volcanic monitoring using remote sensing systems has become an essential tool to investigate the effects of volcanic activity on environment, climate, human health, and aviation, as well as to give insights into volcanic processes. Compared to satellite measurements, ground-based instruments offer continuous spatial and temporal coverage capable of providing high-resolution and high-sensitivity data.This work presents a new simplified prototype of a thermal infrared (TIR) system (named “VIRSO2”). The instrument comprises three cameras, one working in the visible spectrum and two in the TIR (8–14 µm). In front of one of the two TIR cameras, an 8.7 µm filter is placed. The system is designed for the detection of volcanic emission, geometry estimation, determining the columnar content of SO2 and ash, and SO2 flux retrievals. The retrieval procedures developed are detailed starting from the geometric characterisation with wind direction correction, the calibration by considering the effects of filter multireflections and temperature, and the SO2 mass by exploiting MODTRAN radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. The SO2 flux is then computed by applying the traverse method, with the plume speed obtained from the wind speed at the crater altitude. As test cases, the measurements collected at Etna Volcano (Italy) on 1 April 2021 during a lava fountain episode and 30 August 2024 during a quiescent phase have been considered. The results show that the system can provide reliable information on plume detection, altitude, and SO2 flux.Its simplicity, its low cost, and the possibility of carrying out measurements at a safe distance from the vent during both the day and the night make this system ideal for real-time monitoring of volcanic emissions, thus helping to provide information on the state of activity of the volcano and therefore to mitigate the effect that these natural phenomena have on humans and the environment."

Buggee;Peter Pilewskie,Retrieving vertical profiles of cloud droplet effective radius using multispectral measurements from MODIS: examples and limitations,"This research aimed to improve our understanding of cloud structure using spaceborne measurements. The study applied an optimal estimation method to determine how cloud droplet sizes change with height, using satellite data and coincident aircraft measurements for validation. It found that current space-borne spectrometers lack the accuracy to fully resolve this vertical structure, but upcoming instruments like CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Earth Observatory) Pathfinder will significantly enhance this capability. 
 With the coming launch of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Earth Observatory (CLARREO) Pathfinder (CPF) comes an opportunity to develop a new retrieval for warm, non-precipitating clouds from spectral reflectance measurements. With continuous coverage across the shortwave spectrum and a factor of 5 to 10 lower radiometric uncertainty than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), CPF facilitates the retrieval of a vertical profile of droplet size, providing insight into the internal structure of a cloud. Measurements from MODIS coincident with in situ observations provide the foundation for developing an optimal estimation technique. Solution constraints were required to ensure consistency with forward model assumptions. The limited unique information in the MODIS bands used in this analysis resulted in a non-unique solution, with many droplet profiles leading to convergence. Droplet size at cloud bottom is difficult to constrain because visible and shortwave infrared reflectances have an average penetration depth near cloud top. The region of convergence within the solution space decreased along the cloud bottom radius dimension by 1 µm when increasing the number of wavelengths used in the retrieval from 7 to 35 and by 3.75 µm when reducing the total uncertainty from 3 % to 1 %. The enhanced accuracy and, to a lesser degree, the enhanced spectral sampling provided by CPF measurements are essential to extracting vertically resolved droplet size information from moderately thick, warm clouds."

Each contrail is segmented, tracked, and, where possible, attributed to individual flights. A baseline model based on panoptic segmentation is also provided to demonstrate instance-level detection. This dataset enables empirical analysis of contrail lifecycle and supports the validation and calibration of physical models. 
 Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments."

However, the overall patterns of thermal tides and their individual components' contribution to superrotation remain poorly understood. Using a 16‐year radio occultation data set observed by Venus Express and Akatsuki, we have, for the first time, revealed the thermal tide structure from the cloud base to mesopause (50–90 km) in the southern hemisphere. The tidal patterns are equatorially symmetric and validated by simulations with the Venus Planetary Climate Model, extending tidal insights beyond the northern hemisphere focus of previous studies. The simulation indicates that diurnal tide‐induced AM flux divergence is the primary driving force for equatorial cloud‐top superrotation, with its meridional and vertical AM flux divergence dominating in the region of ∼5 km above and below the cloud top, respectively."

 Under the background of policy-driven emission reduction in China, the intensification of ozone pollution and its causes has attracted great attention over the past decade. Based on the synchronous observation of the Mie scattering lidar and microwave radiometers, combined with the TUV Radiation model, a quantitative evaluation of the synergistic effects of pollutant emissions and climate change on decadal-scale ozone pollution was performed, and the reasons for the intensification and spatial heterogeneity of ozone pollution were investigated in the southern Yangtze River Delta, Zhejiang province, from 2011 to 2020. The results showed that aerosol pollution was obviously improved after 2014, whereas ozone pollution displayed an overall upward trend and pronounced spatial heterogeneity, while an upward trend was exhibited in the most areas and a downward trend in some water areas such as the southeast coast. Compared with the period before 2014, the promoting of aerosol emission reduction including air temperature rising, the inhibiting of climate change as well as precursor reduction on ozone pollution in Hangzhou were 8.18 μg m−3, 0.98 μg m−3 and around 2.07 μg m−3 in the period after 2014, respectively, while the corresponding values were 0.49 μg m−3, 6.37 μg m−3 and around 3.68 μg m−3 in Zhoushan. The results indicated that aerosol emission reduction and climate change exhibited the promoting and inhibiting (“climate benefit”) effects, respectively. The differences between the impacts of aerosol emission reduction and the increase in water vapor content were the main causes of the intensification and spatial heterogeneity of ozone pollution. Although the changes in ozone precursor concentrations were conducive to reducing ozone pollution, the accurate relationship between them requires further study."

 Beijing is particularly prone to frequent wintertime haze episodes. In this study, we introduce the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) and SOSAA (the model to Simulate the concentration of Organic vapors, Sulfuric Acid, and Aerosols) modeling system for air quality analysis and applied the newly developed modeling system to a severe pollution episode during a case study in Beijing in November 2018. FLEXPART-SOSAA uses a Lagrangian approach following backward trajectories, and its novelty includes detailed chemical and aerosol mechanisms along each trajectory, incorporating aerosol size distribution in addition to simple mass concentrations. This is particularly valuable from a health perspective. In this study, we demonstrated FLEXPART-SOSAA's capabilities along 7-day backward trajectories to investigate the origins and processes of haze during the case study. Our findings indicate that approximately 75 % of the particles in Beijing originated from outside the city. During the haze episode, the back-trajectories passed through the high-emission region of southern Hebei province. Some of the particle mass was traced back to the Xinjiang region in far western China. After evaluating the results, we tested reduced-emission scenarios and sensitivity tests. We determined that comprehensive emission control across multiple emission sectors was more effective than addressing only one individual sector, and emission control at a regional or national level would be significantly more effective than implementing restriction only in the city of Beijing. Additionally, we found that postponing agricultural waste burning to a time when haze is not in the forecast could help mitigate pollution in the city."

 Global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of compound climate events, highlighting the need to understand their patterns and impacts. The physical characteristics of heatwaves (HWs) followed by extreme precipitation events (EPs) across 13 subregions of the Middle East (ME) are investigated on a 25-years period from 2000 to 2024. The frequency, duration, and intensity of HWs are quantified using maximum temperature of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis. The final product of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG-F) is used for analyzing EP following HWs, as it demonstrated the highest accuracy in a comparative evaluation of six satellite-based precipitation products against rainfall data from 120 weather stations. Iran, Türkiye, and Yemen exhibited the highest HW intensity, frequency, and duration, respectively. Although July showed the highest number of HWs, May and September demonstrated the highest success rates for a shift toward EP within a 36-h window, reaching 58.5 % and 57 %, respectively. The last day of HWs and the subsequent day accounted for the majority of EPs, contributing 21.3 % and 39.7 % of the total EP, respectively. An increasing trend in EP contributions following HWs has been observed since 2013, with a slope of 29 %. The contribution to the probability of EP following HWs was notably higher in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, about 8 and 11.6 times greater than climatology, respectively, underscoring their significance as potential water resources. EPs following HWs contributed 62.6 % of the total precipitation, compared to 38.4 % from climatological EPs, and had a 72.2 % occurrence probability versus 27.8 % in the climatology. EP intensity presented a positive trend across the ME, with statistically significant increases in Iran and Yemen, exposing the higher HW intensity and duration. The strong correlations between HW intensity and duration and subsequent EP (R2 = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively) are characterized by slopes of 0.36 °C and 2.4-day correspond to an increase in EP rate. Satellite precipitation data revealed high levels of convective and warm rain, liquid water content, and higher droplet size in EPs following HW relative to climatological EPs. Finally, the ME is subdivided into three regions (Türkiye, Iran, and Arabian Peninsula/Egypt) to enable region specific analysis of large-scale atmospheric conditions before, during, and after EPs. Notably, across all regions, a pronounced convergence of moisture flux from adjacent water bodies is observed 48 h prior to rainfall, supplying sufficient atmospheric moisture. During the EPs, low geopotential height systems, whether weak or strong, contributed to temperature reduction, facilitating atmospheric saturation and subsequent EP development particularly in Türkiye and Iran."

 To better understand the in-cloud enrichment of secondary inorganic ions, the chemical composition of individual particles during cloud events and cloud-free periods, as well as cloud water and PM2.5 samples, were measured from August to September 2023 at Mt. Damaojian (1128 m a.s.l.) in southeastern China. Our results demonstrated that cloud processes promoted the aqueous-phase formation of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate, but the degree of sulfate enrichment was lower than that observed for ammonium and nitrate. Furthermore, the average hourly relative peak area (RPA) of secondary inorganic ions revealed their selective enrichment in cloud droplets. The RPA of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate in cloud droplet residual (RES) particles were 5.11, 3.05, and 1.43 times greater than those in cloud interstitial (INT) particles during two consecutive long-lasting cloud events, respectively. Both ammonium and nitrate showed ubiquitous enrichment across all particle types, including K-rich, Black carbon (BC), Metal, and Sea salt (SS) particles, although with distinct degrees of enrichment. Ammonium exhibited the highest degree of enrichment in the SS particles, whereas nitrate showed the most pronounced enhancement in the BC particles. Notably, the RPA of nitrate in all four types of particles exhibited a significant positive correlation with the liquid water content (LWC), reinforcing the role of aqueous-phase processing. Unlike ubiquitous ammonium and nitrate, sulfate enrichment was restricted to K-rich and Metal particles. The different enrichments of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate underscore particle-specific influences on their in-cloud formation. These findings extend our current understanding of atmospheric chemistry in clouds."

We show that aerosol optical hygroscopicity (f(RH)) was generally higher on NPF days than in non-event cases, likely due to enhanced secondary formation and subsequent growth of both pre-existing and newly formed particles with stronger photooxidation, specifically under persistent heatwaves. This would further impact the aerosol direct radiative forcing. 
 As a crucial climate-forcing driver, the aerosol optical enhancement factor (f(RH)) is significantly modulated by chemical compositions and the evolution of particle number size distribution (PNSD), e.g., during new particle formation (NPF). However, mechanisms regulating aerosol optical hygroscopicity during different NPF days, particularly those under heatwaves due to global warming, remain poorly understood. In the hot summer of 2022 in urban Chongqing of southwest China, simultaneous measurements of aerosol optical and hygroscopic properties, PNSD, and bulk chemical compositions were conducted. Two distinct types of NPFs were identified: NPFs with relatively polluted periods (NPFpolluted) and  clean cases during heatwave-dominated periods (NPFclean, HW). Compared to the NPFpolluted events, NPFclean, HW occurred approximately 1 h earlier, and the subsequent growth was prolonged, accompanied by a smaller aerosol effective radius (Reff) and lower formation/growth rate during heatwaves. This agreed with the concurrently increased aerosol hemispheric backscattering fraction and scattering Ångström exponent. A generally higher f(RH) was observed on NPF days than in non-event cases, partly attributable to distinct changes in PNSD patterns during NPF days. Moreover, heatwave-induced stronger photooxidation may intensify the formation of more hygroscopic secondary components and prolong the atmospheric aging/subsequent growth of both pre-existing and newly formed particles, largely contributing to the enhanced f(RH), especially during NPFclean, HW days. The higher f(RH) and lowered Reff could synergistically elevate the aerosol direct radiative forcing, specifically under persistent heatwave conditions. Further in-depth exploration of molecular-level characterizations and the aerosol radiative impacts of both direct and indirect interactions under heatwaves in a warming climate is recommended."

The strength of this cloud impact is driven by cloud properties as well as solar elevation and surface reflection. As these dependencies are poorly represented in climate models, cloud, surface, and radiation observations are used to quantify the contributions of the drivers in the Arctic. It is shown that the weaker surface reflection dominates the stronger cooling effect of clouds over open ocean compared to sea ice. 
 Arctic low-level clouds play an important, albeit uncertain, role in the Arctic climate system. Consequently, their effect on the radiative energy budget (REB) is subject to considerable uncertainty as well. To reduce this uncertainty and to assess the importance of processes driving the cloud radiative effect (CRE), it is crucial to quantitatively disentangle the impact of essential parameters that non-linearly affect the CRE. Therefore, this study uses a CRE parameterization and low-level airborne REB observations in combination with an approach similarly applied in climate dynamics to quantify the contributions of the concurrently observed solar zenith angle (SZA), cloud optical thickness, and surface albedo on the solar CRE at the surface. Based on a case study characterized by inhomogeneous cloud and surface conditions in the marginal sea ice zone, it is shown that the surface albedo contributed more than 95 % to the solar CRE difference between open ocean and sea ice. Using the same approach, the analysis is extended to observations from a series of aircraft campaigns and indicates that the variability in the non-cloud properties SZA and surface albedo between seasons and surface types, respectively, has a larger impact on the resulting difference in the solar CRE than the variability in cloud properties."
10.5194/acp-25-12843-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用MATS卫星对中间层和低热层的大气辉光进行了全球观测。重点关注了由大气潮汐和行星波引起的大尺度扰动对O2辉光的影响。观测结果显示，日落时分的赤道地区辉光强度达到最大值，而日出时分则出现最小值，这与大气潮汐的预期行为相符。此外，还在北半球高纬度地区观测到了一种向西传播的扰动，被解释为准10天纬向波数为1的行星波。因此，该研究与利用卫星观测进行大气成分分析和大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['O2 airglow', 'MATS satellite', 'Mesosphere', 'Lower thermosphere', 'Atmospheric tides', 'Planetary waves', 'Limb imager', 'Equatorial maximum', 'Dayglow']",Björn Linder;Lukas Krasauskas;Linda Megner;Donal P. Murtagh,The global O2 airglow field as seen by the MATS satellite: strong equatorial maximum and planetary wave influence,"The Swedish satellite MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) conducts global measurements of atmospheric airglow in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. In this article, we present the first global results from the mission. Observations from February to April 2023 show that the emission strength is largely controlled by atmospheric tides and by perturbations introduced by a propagating planetary wave. 
 The Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy (MATS) satellite was launched in November 2022, carrying as its main instrument a limb-viewing telescope with six spectral channels designed to image atmospheric O2 airglow and noctilucent clouds. Although the main objective of the satellite mission is to observe structures in the airglow introduced by propagating smaller-scale waves, the airglow emissions are also subjected to large-scale dynamic disturbances, such as atmospheric tides and planetary waves. This work presents large-scale structures in the airglow field, as observed by the MATS limb imager from February 2023 to April 2023. The ascending (north-going) node in the satellite orbit, corresponding to the local sunset, is dominated by a strong equatorial maximum in the dayglow. In contrast, the descending (south-going) node, corresponding to the local sunrise, indicates an accompanying equatorial minimum. These characteristics align with the expected behaviour of atmospheric tidal movements. Specifically, a downwelling of atomic oxygen is expected over the Equator at local sunset, contributing to airglow chemistry and enhancing the emissions. Another distinct feature in the data is a westward propagating disturbance observed at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere, maximising in February, interpreted as the quasi-10 d planetary wave of zonal wavenumber 1."
10.5194/amt-18-5349-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种新型的松弛涡度累积（REA）采样系统，专门用于基于放射性碳（14C）区分化石和非化石来源的城市二氧化碳（CO2）排放。该系统通过有条件地收集空气样本，并分析其中的14CO2含量，来估算空气中化石燃料CO2的浓度，从而实现对城市环境中总CO2排放中化石和非化石成分的区分。虽然该研究没有直接使用卫星观测或遥感技术，但它通过地面测量来监测大气成分，特别是CO2的来源，这与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。该研究的结果可以用于验证和校准基于遥感的CO2排放估算模型，从而提高空气质量监测的准确性。,"['CO2 fluxes', 'fossil fuel CO2', 'radiocarbon (14C)', 'urban CO2', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Ann-Kristin Kunz;Lars Borchardt;Andreas Christen;Julian Della Coletta;Markus Eritt;Xochilt Gutiérrez;Josh Hashemi;Rainer Hilland;Armin Jordan;Richard Kneißl;Virgile Legendre;Ingeborg Levin;Susanne Preunkert;Pascal Rubli;Stavros Stagakis;Samuel Hammer,A relaxed eddy accumulation flask sampling system for 14C-based partitioning of fossil and non-fossil CO2 fluxes,"We present, to our knowledge, the first relaxed eddy accumulation system explicitly tailored to a radiocarbon (14C)-based partitioning of fossil and non-fossil urban CO2 fluxes. Laboratory tests and in-depth quality and performance checks prove that the system meets the technical requirements. A pilot application on a tall tower in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, demonstrates the ability to separate fossil and non-fossil CO2 components within the typical precision of 14C measurements. 
 A relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system was developed and tested, enabling conditional sampling of air for subsequent 14CO2  analysis. This allows a 14C-based estimation of fossil fuel CO2 concentrations in the collected air samples and, thus, an observation-based partitioning of total CO2 fluxes measured in urban environments by eddy covariance into fossil and non-fossil components. This article describes the REA system, evaluates its performance, and assesses uncertainties in the concentration measurements. In the REA system, two separate inlet lines equipped with fast-response valves and loop systems adapted to the technical requirements enable the conditional collection of air in two sets of aluminum cylinders for updraft and downdraft samples, respectively. The switching between updraft sampling, downdraft sampling, and standby mode is thereby determined by the vertical wind measured at 20 Hz by a co-located ultrasonic 3D anemometer. A logger program provides different options for the definition of a deadband, which is used to increase the concentration differences between updraft and downdraft samples. After the sampling interval, the accumulated air is transferred by an automated 24-port flask sampler into 3 L glass flasks, which can be analyzed in the laboratory, and the cylinders are  re-evacuated for the next sampling. The REA system was tested in the laboratory, as well as on a tall tower near the city center of Zurich, Switzerland. Between July 2022 and April 2023, 103 REA updraft and downdraft flask pairs for flux measurements and 9 flask pairs for quality control purposes were selected from the tall tower for laboratory analysis based on suitable micro-meteorological conditions. Uncertainties in the CO2 concentration differences between updraft and downdraft flasks were estimated by simulations using 20 Hz in situ measurements of a closed-path gas analyzer and an open-path gas analyzer co-located with the ultrasonic anemometer. The measurements show that there is no significant bias in the concentration differences between updraft and downdraft samples and that uncertainties due to the sampling process are negligible when estimating fossil fuel CO2 signals. In the Zurich measurements, the CO2 concentration differences between the flask pairs agreed with the differences obtained from in situ measurements within −0.005 ± 0.227 ppm. The largest source of uncertainty, as well as the main limitation, in the separation of fossil and non-fossil CO2 signals in Zurich was the small signal-to-noise ratio of the Δ14C differences measured by accelerator mass spectrometry between the updraft and downdraft flasks. The novel REA flask sampling system meets the high technical requirements of the REA method and is a promising technology for observation-based estimation of fossil fuel CO2 fluxes."

We investigated the performance of four airborne hygrometers, deployed on aircraft or stratospheric balloon platforms and based on different techniques, in a climate simulation chamber. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of the involved sensors for atmospheric monitoring and research applications. 
 The AquaVIT-4 intercomparison of atmospheric hygrometers was conducted at the AIDA (Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere) climate simulation chamber of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, in March–April 2022, within the framework of the HEMERA H2020 EU project. The objectives were to document the performance of existing hygrometers and to support the development of novel methods for water vapor (H2O) measurements in the upper atmosphere. The AquaVIT-4 intercomparison involved seven hygrometers based on either infrared laser absorption spectroscopy or frost-point hygrometry techniques: four deployed on aircraft or stratospheric balloon platforms and three reference instruments. The simulated conditions in the AIDA chamber reproduced the characteristic atmospheric conditions of the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS, altitude range ∼ 5–28 km) in the tropics and midlatitudes, spanning  20–600 hPa pressure, 190–245 K temperature, and 0.5–530 ppm H2O mixing ratio. The campaign was divided into two phases, each consisting of 4 measurement days: an “open intercomparison”, where the simulated conditions were known to the participants, and a “blind intercomparison”, where the conditions were coordinated by independent referees and unknown to the participating teams. Here we present a statistical analysis of the entire dataset, which allows us to assess the accuracy and limitations of each instrument. For the accuracy evaluation, two sets of reference measurements were defined: one for in situ instruments, located inside the AIDA vessel, and one for extractive instruments, sampling the chamber gas through a heated inlet. This distinction accounts for H2O desorption effects, which are most prominent at low pressures and low H2O concentrations. All instruments showed  good agreement with the reference values in the range of H2O >2 ppm, with mean deviations within ± 7 % for H2O >10 ppm and ± 8 % between 2–10 ppm H2O. The largest differences were found for H2O <2 ppm, a rarely observed range in the atmosphere, though most of the instruments still achieved average deviations within ± 10 %. Overall, the results of AquaVIT-4 demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of the four involved sensors for upper-atmospheric monitoring and research applications."

Fernandes;Crystal A. Kolden,State of Wildfires 2024–2025,"The second State of Wildfires report examines extreme wildfire events from 2024 to early 2025. It analyses key regional events in Southern California, Northeast Amazonia, Pantanal–Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, assessing their drivers and predictability and attributing them to climate change and land use. Seasonal outlooks and decadal projections are provided. Climate change greatly increased the likelihood of these fires, and without strong mitigation, such events will become more frequent. 
 Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires globally, yet our understanding of these high-impact events remains uneven and shaped by media attention and regional research biases. The State of Wildfires project systematically tracks global and regional fire activity of each annual fire season, analyses the causes of prominent extreme wildfire events, and projects the likelihood of similar events occurring in future climate scenarios. This, its second annual report, covers the March 2024 to February 2025 fire season. During the 2024–2025 fire season, fire-related carbon (C) emissions totalled 2.2 Pg C, 9 % above average and the sixth highest on record since 2003, despite below-average global burned area (BA). Extreme fire seasons in South America's rainforests, dry forests, and wetlands and in Canada's boreal forests pushed up the global C emissions total. Fire C emissions were over 4 times above average in Bolivia, 3 times above average in Canada, and ∼ 50 % above average in Brazil and Venezuela. Wildfires in 2024–2025 caused 100 fatalities in Nepal, 34 in South Africa, and 31 in Los Angeles, with additional fatalities reported in Canada, Côte d'Ivoire, Portugal, and Türkiye. The Eaton and Palisades fires in Southern California caused 150 000 evacuations and USD 140 billion in damages. Communities in Brazil, Bolivia, Southern California, and northern India were exposed to fine particulate matter at concentrations 13–60 times WHO's daily air quality standards. We evaluated the causes and predictability of four extreme wildfire episodes from the 2024–2025 fire season, including in Northeast Amazonia (January–March 2024), the Pantanal–Chiquitano border regions of Brazil and Bolivia (August–September 2024), Southern California (January 2025), and the Congo Basin (July–August 2024). Anomalous weather created conditions for these regional extremes, while fuel availability and human ignitions shaped spatial patterns and temporal fire dynamics. In the three tropical regions, prolonged drought was the dominant fire enabler, whereas in California, extreme heat, wind, and antecedent fuel build-up were compounding enablers. Our attribution analyses show that climate change made extreme fire weather in Northeast Amazonia 30–70 times more likely, increasing BA roughly 4-fold compared to a scenario without climate change. In the Pantanal–Chiquitano, fire weather was 4–5 times more likely, with 35-fold increases in BA. Meanwhile, our analyses suggest that BA was 25 times higher in Southern California due to climate change. The Congo Basin's fire weather was 3–8 times more likely with climate change, with a 2.7-fold increase in BA. Socioeconomic changes since the pre-industrial period, including land-use change, also likely increased BA in Northeast Amazonia. Our models project that events on the scale of 2024–2025 will become up to 57 %, 34 %, and 50 % more frequent than in the modern era in Northeast Amazonia, the Pantanal–Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, respectively, under a medium–high scenario (SSP370) by 2100. Climate action can limit the added risk, with frequency increases held to below 15 % in all three regions under a strong mitigation scenario (SSP126). In Southern California, the future trajectory of extreme fire likelihood remains highly uncertain due to poorly constrained climate–vegetation–fire interactions influencing fuel moisture, though our models suggest that risk may decline in future. This annual report from the State of Wildfires project integrates and advances cutting-edge fire observations and modelling with regional expertise to track changing global wildfire hazard, guiding policy and practice towards improved preparedness, mitigation, adaptation, and societal benefit. Thirteen new datasets and model codebases presented in this work are available from the State of Wildfires Project's Zenodo community, including updated annual statistics on wildfire extent (Jones et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15525674), outputs from modelling of fire causality using PoF model (Di Giuseppe, 2025; https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.8570224.v1) and codebase for the extreme event attribution/projections model,  ConFLAME (Barbosa et al., 2025a, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16790787)."

This study generated a global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite data and a deep learning model. The dataset accurately depicts global and regional XCO2 patterns, advancing the monitoring of carbon emissions and understanding of global carbon dynamics. 
 The irreversible trend for global warming underscores the necessity for accurate monitoring and analysis of atmospheric carbon dynamics on a global scale. Carbon satellites hold significant potential for atmospheric CO2 monitoring. However, existing studies on global CO2 are constrained by coarse resolution (ranging from 0.25 to 2°) and limited spatial coverage. In this study, we developed a new global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite observations, multi-source satellite products, and an improved deep learning model. We then investigated changes in global atmospheric CO2 and anomalies from 2015 to 2021. The reconstructed XCO2 products show a better agreement with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements, with R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.54 ppm. The products also provide more accurate information on the global and regional spatial patterns of XCO2 compared to origin carbon satellite monitoring and previous XCO2 products. The global pattern of XCO2 exhibited a distinct increasing trend with a growth rate of 2.32 ppm yr−1, reaching 414.00 ppm in 2021. Globally, XCO2 showed obvious spatial variability across different latitudes and continents. Higher XCO2 concentrations were primarily observed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in regions with intensive anthropogenic activity, such as East Asia and North America. We also validated the effectiveness of our XCO2 products in detecting intensive CO2 emission sources. The XCO2 dataset is publicly accessible on the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12706142 (Wang et al., 2024a). Our products enable enhanced ability in identifying regional- and county-level XCO2 hotpots, carbon emissions and fragmented carbon sinks, providing a robust basis for targeted global carbon governance policies."

We introduce a new method using graph convolutional neural networks, in which molecular graphs enable the model to capture molecular connectivity better than with non-structural embeddings. The method shows strong agreement with experimentally determined vapor pressures, and outperforms existing estimation methods. 
 The vapor pressures (pvap) of organic molecules play a crucial role in the partitioning of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Given the vast diversity of atmospheric organic compounds, experimentally determining pvap of each compound is unfeasible. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms allow the prediction of physicochemical properties based on complex representations of molecular structure, but their performance crucially depends on the availability of sufficient training data. We propose a novel approach to predict pvap using group contribution-assisted graph convolutional neural networks (GC2NN). The models use molecular descriptors like molar mass alongside molecular graphs containing atom and bond features as representations of molecular structure. The model's group contribution component is a shallow fully-connected neural network which processes numerical molecular descriptors and complements the model's graph component. Molecular graphs allow the ML model to better infer molecular connectivity compared to methods using other, non-structural embeddings. We achieve best results with an adaptive-depth GC2NN, where the number of evaluated graph layers depends on molecular size. We present two vapor pressure estimation models that achieve strong agreement between predicted and experimentally-determined pvap. The first is a general model with broad scope that is suitable for both organic and inorganic molecules and achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.69 log-units (R2= 0.86). The second model is specialized on organic compounds with functional groups often encountered in atmospheric SOA, achieving an even stronger correlation with the test data (MAE = 0.37 log-units, R2= 0.94). The adaptive-depth GC2NN models clearly outperform existing methods, including parameterizations and group-contribution methods, demonstrating that graph-based ML techniques are powerful tools for the estimation of physicochemical properties, even when experimental data are scarce."

The sites included Syowa Station (69°00′S, 39°35′E) and site S17 (69°02′S, 40°05′E) on the coastal Antarctic ice sheet. Observations were conducted over three summers (2014/15, 2016/17, and 2017/18) as part of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE). Surface aerosol particles containing 7Be were collected daily or twice daily using a high‐volume air sampler. 7Be concentrations ranged from below the detection limit of approximately 1–12 mBq/m3. The 7Be concentrations are higher at higher latitudes than at midlatitudes, and the effects of removal by precipitation associated with storm track may be more pronounced at midlatitudes. Fluctuations in 7Be concentrations were correlated with the passage of synoptic‐scale disturbances over the sea to the west of 80°E, likely due to tropopause folding. Maximum concentrations were observed at site S17, where a stepwise increase from approximately 4 mBq/m3 (5–14 January) to approximately 8 mBq/m3 (15–28 January) was observed, likely due to repeated synoptic‐scale disturbances. A diurnal pattern was observed in 7Be concentrations at site S17, with nighttime (daytime) concentrations being highest (lowest) when katabatic winds were stronger (weaker). From January 2015 to January 2017, the increase rate in 7Be concentration at site S17 was similar to the increase rate in neutron counts observed at the Neumayer III station, suggesting a reflection of the elevated 7Be production due to increased galactic cosmic rays."

We analyze in situ measurements of temperature, pressure, ClO, ClONO2, H2O, NO2, aerosol surface area density (SAD), and organic chlorine species obtained by instruments aboard the NASA ER‐2 over the continental US during the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) campaign to show that chlorine activation large enough to affect loss of ozone was not observed, for the summers of 2021 and 2022. During both deployments, tropopause‐overshooting convection with water vapor and temperature conditions suitable for chlorine activation were sampled. Due to their relatively young chemical age, most of these cold and wet air masses had abundances of inorganic chlorine (Cly) too low to support eventual enhancements of ClO that would lead to widespread ozone depletion. Even in the few air masses with higher levels of Cly, the abundance of nitrogen oxides was elevated and the ratio of ClONO2 to Cly was observed to be very low, limiting the availability of ClONO2 to react with HCl and sustain chlorine activation. However, we show that for the average chemical and meteorological conditions of cold, wet, overshooting air parcels observed during DCOTSS, significant chlorine activation could occur if stratospheric sulfate SAD were enhanced by major volcanic eruptions or climate intervention efforts."

The average NR‐PM2.5 concentration is 4.7 ± 5.3 μg m−3 with a dominant contribution of organics. Our findings reveal distinct seasonal variations in NR‐PM2.5 mass loading and chemical composition, regulated by the alternation of the Asian summer monsoon and westerlies there, as well as the balance between the wet scavenging and dry deposition in each season.

Here, we describe the GReenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA2PES), which provides gridded emissions of fossil‐fuel carbon dioxide (ffCO2) and 93 air quality (AQ) species for 17 combustion and non‐combustion sectors at 4 km × 4 km spatial resolution across the contiguous US. We find that the AQ emissions most spatially correlated with ffCO2 are nitrogen oxides (NOx, ρ = 0.67), followed by sulfur dioxide (SO2, ρ = 0.51), carbon monoxide (CO, ρ = 0.44), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5, ρ = 0.38). We evaluate GRA2PES ffCO2 emissions with an ensemble of publicly available regional and global inventories at national (Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) = +1.4%), state (NMB = +1.5%, R2 = 0.98), and urban (NMB = +11.5%, R2 = 0.97) scales. Nationally, the differences of publicly available inventories from the ensemble average range from −10.0% to +5.7%, and consistency diverges at state and urban scales. We simulate GRA2PES ffCO2 in a particle dispersion model and compare to measurements of radiocarbon (14C)‐derived ffCO2 collected in Los Angeles (August 2021), with results suggesting that GRA2PES ffCO2 may be low by 19% for this city, but well within model‐observation differences for other publicly available inventories (−43% to +94%). GRA2PES AQ/ffCO2 ratios converted to concentration space generally agree with field observations (NMB = +4%, log R2 = 0.90).

It is also an important chemical reactor that contributes to the multiphase chemistry of ozone destruction by halogen compounds. Sulfuric acid is the main chemical component of stratospheric aerosol, but the processes that control the composition and size of stratospheric particles remain uncertain. We report direct observations of the composition of individual particles of 0.12–1.2 μm geometric diameter, sampled in situ in the high latitude lower stratosphere during February and March of 2023, at altitudes up to 19 km. Polar vortex air was frequently sampled, enabling an investigation into the nature of particles formed in air descending from the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Over 90% of particles at the sampled sizes in very old polar vortex air contain metals from the ablation of meteors, suggesting that almost all sulfuric acid particles formed in such air grow onto meteoric smoke. Such particles contain extremely low levels of organic matter, typically less than about 0.3% by mass, and relatively high mass fractions of metals, around 5%–8%. These newly characterized “neat” meteoric‐sulfuric particles gain additional sulfuric acid and organic compounds by coagulation with background stratospheric aerosol, forming “aged” meteoric‐sulfuric particles, which are encountered throughout the stratosphere. On the basis of these observations, we estimate a meteoric iron flux into the Earth's atmosphere of about 0.3–1 Gg yr−1."

However, the mechanisms underlying MT production in plants and their subsequent release into the atmosphere remain poorly understood. Existing parameterization schemes for MT emissions in BVOC models require refinement, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where recent field observations provide new insights. In this study, the light‐temperature dependence algorithm in MEGAN2.1 was updated based on in situ measurements. The revised algorithm significantly reduced estimated MT emissions in South China, with reductions ranging from ∼9% (∼8 Gg) in summer to ∼60% (∼6.5 Gg) in winter over Guangdong province. As a result, chemical transport model simulations showed that the maximum daily 8‐hr average (MDA8) ozone (O3) concentrations decreased by 3%–5% (1.0–1.5 ppb), with a maximum reduction of up to 7% (2 ppb). Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) concentrations declined by 10%–20% (0.5–1 μg/m3), with the maximum reduction of 24% (1.2 μg/m3) in summer 2022. These decreases were primarily driven by a reduction in atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). Moreover, the revised algorithm amplified reduction of MTs‐derived SOA through various formation pathways. These findings suggest that previous models may overestimated BVOC emissions, leading to inflated predictions of both O3 and SOA concentrations. This overestimation could be further exacerbated by AOC changes and shifts in SOA formation pathways associated with MT emissions."

Mielke;Jürgen Kusche;Petra Friederichs;Anne Springer,GRACE‐FO and Future Satellite Gravity Missions Will Need to Account for Global Cloud Water Convergence,"Convective storms cause significant atmospheric and hydrological mass changes through the rapid accumulation of water vapor, cloud water, and heavy precipitation over hours or days. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE‐Follow‐On (GRACE‐FO) gravity field solutions enable holistic monitoring of terrestrial water storage changes, but only after mathematically removing modeled atmospheric mass variations from the observations. While this removal typically accounts for atmospheric water vapor, extreme convective events also lead to mass changes arising from liquid and frozen cloud water, which are currently neglected in gravity field processing. Using ERA5 cloud water data, we identified over 50,000 extreme events (≥ ${\ge} $0.6 Gt) from 2002 to 2023, which we hypothesize to fall within the detection range of the GRACE‐FO laser ranging interferometer. Our global catalog provides details on the biggest events and the evolution of different atmospheric and terrestrial water storages over the affected regions. We show that cloud water mass changes during these events can be comparable in magnitude to water vapor variations. We also observed a steady annual increase of about 52 events, from 1,796 in 2002 to 2,791 in 2023, alongside increasing intensity, which we attribute to the intensification of the water cycle driven by global warming. Our findings suggest that atmospheric cloud water, predominantly during large convective events in the tropics, map into GRACE‐FO observations and that the integration of state‐of‐the‐art cloud water simulations into the dealiasing products will improve the exploitation of GRACE‐FO and Next Generation Gravity Mission data for ocean science and hydrological and climate research, particularly on submonthly timescales."

 Daily high-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is critical for air quality monitoring and public health. However, current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy over large spatial and temporal scales due to limitations in modeling complex spatiotemporal dependencies. This study proposed a novel hybrid deep learning model—CNN-Transformer-KAN Network (CTKNet)—which utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture spatial features, Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies, and the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for nonlinear representation learning. Utilizing spatially continuous satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and other multi-source spatiotemporal inputs, CTKNet estimated daily PM2.5 at a spatial resolution of 1 km across China for the period 2015–2020, marking the first application of KAN in PM2.5 estimation. It outperformed existing models, achieving a high cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95 (sample-based), 0.90 (station-based), and 0.78 (time-based), and corresponding RMSEs of 8.13, 11.03, and 17.76 µg/m3. Yearly sample-based cross-validation R2 values ranged from 0.91 to 0.96 with RMSEs below 11.74 µg/m3, while seasonal R2 values ranged from 0.82 to 0.89 with RMSEs below 22.14 µg/m3. Analysis reveals a significant decline in PM2.5 nationwide, especially in eastern and central China. Seasonal peaks occur in winter, with minima in summer, influenced by meteorology. Spatially, PM2.5 is highest in eastern and northern regions; urban agglomerations like Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) show severe pollution, while Pearl River Delta (PRD) exhibits the lowest levels due to favorable conditions. CTKNet also holds promise for other fine-scale environmental mapping tasks using multi-source spatiotemporal data."

 In this paper, we analyzed Black Carbon Aerosol Optical Thickness (BCAOT) for long period of twenty-one years (2003–2023) to explore black aerosol radiative characteristics on spatial and temporal basis over a hugely populated and highly polluted Delhi region of Northern India. The BCAOT was retrieved at 550 nm wavelength from the MERRA-2 products. Detailed BCAOT quantitative analysis was made on a monthly, seasonal and interannual basis under regional synoptic climatic changes. A linear forecasting model was applied to MERRA-2 BCAOT values to understand its behavior up to 2040 years. We implemented Mann-Kendall (MK) test to further understand the nature of BCAOT. MK-tau of BCAOT was found to be 0.239 for monsoon season and minimum −0.348 for post-monsoon season. MODIS retrieved cloud optical characteristics were also analyzed and correlated to BCAOT over Delhi region of India. Seasonal mean scattering BCAOT was highest (∼1.45 ± 0.0065) in 2011 of monsoon season, but lowest in (1.408 ± 0.0041) in post-monsoon season. BCAOT rate of growth per year was found to be slow but steady (+0.000008 per year). BCAOT was correlated with different cloud parameters and Pearson coefficient was found positive for BCAOT and CF, PWV, UAT, COT, CER (∼+0.92, +0.77, +0.20, +0.33, +0.27), whereas negative for ANGP, CTT, CTP, (∼−0.46, −0.79, −0.78). The strong correlation between BCAOT and cloud fraction suggests that BC aerosols could absorb and reflect the outgoing longwave Earth's emitted radiation and thereby changed the cloud characteristics and its reflectivity."

 Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS) have efficient light absorption properties, significantly affecting atmospheric oxidative capacity and radiative forcing. However, the effects of photooxidation on light absorption properties of ambient HULIS remain poorly understood. In this study, the light absorption properties of HULIS in winter and summer, daytime and nighttime, were investigated in Xi'an, northwest China, as well as their changes during the aqueous-phase photooxidation process. The light absorption coefficient of HULIS at 365 nm (Abs365) in winter was 2.3–16.4 times that in summer, and the mass absorption efficiency of HULIS at 365 nm (MAE365) in winter was 1.9–2.8 times that in summer, indicating the chromophores in HULIS in winter had higher light absorption capacity. The absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) values of HULIS were lower in winter in the high pollution period (5.79–5.89) than in the low pollution period (6.41–6.79) and in summer (6.58–6.85), suggesting that the chromophores in HULIS in the winter high pollution period could contain more conjugated systems and aromatic ring structures. During the photooxidation experiment, the Abs365 value continued to decrease, indicating the photobleaching nature of HULIS. The atmospheric half-lives (τ1/2) of HULIS were estimated to be 6.5–14.8 h in different seasons. The AAE value of HULIS in the high pollution period of winter continued to increase during the photooxidation process, whereas in summer and the low pollution period of winter, it first increased and then remained relatively stable during the day, and continued to decrease at night. The results provided in this study are helpful for further understanding the atmospheric evolution of ambient HULIS."

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of several multi-source emission quantification models using data from fixed-point continuous monitoring systems (CMSs), collected during a controlled-release study. This work offers a novel contribution by evaluating multi-source emissions quantification techniques, leveraging a fixed-point CMS to capture the complexities of overlapping plumes from simultaneous releases. 
 Quantifying methane emissions from oil and gas facilities is crucial for emissions management and accurate facility-level greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory development. This paper evaluates the performance of several multi-source methane emission quantification models using the data collected by fixed-point continuous monitoring systems as part of a controlled-release experiment. Two dispersion modeling approaches (Gaussian plume, Gaussian puff) and two inversion frameworks (least-squares optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo) are applied to the measurement data. In addition, a subset of experiments are selected to showcase the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) informed calculations for direct solution of the advection–diffusion equation. This solution utilizes a three-dimensional wind field informed by solving the momentum equation with the appropriate external forcing to match on-site wind measurements. Results show that the Puff model, driven by high-frequency wind data, significantly improves localization and reduces bias and error variance compared to the Plume model. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based inversion framework further enhances accuracy over least-squares fitting, with the Puff MCMC approach showing the best performance. The study highlights the importance of long-term integration for accurate total mass emission estimates and the detection of anomalous emission patterns. The findings of this study can help improve emissions management strategies, aid in facility-level emissions risk assessment, and enhance the accuracy of greenhouse gas inventories."

On one year of the retrieval, the retrieved aerosol properties (aerosol optical thickness, AOT, Angstrom Exponent, AE, and Single Scattering Albedo, SSA) agree well with adjacent clear-sky aerosol retrievals. The seasonal global pattern of ACA events and above cloud AOT are also within expectation. 
 This paper describes an algorithm for above-cloud aerosol (ACA) retrievals from PARASOL (Polarisation and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar) Multi-Angle Polarimetric measurements. The algorithm, based on neural networks (NNs), has been trained on synthetic measurements and has been applied to the processing of one-year PARASOL data. The algorithm makes use of three subsequent NNs: (1) for the detection of liquid clouds, (2) for the retrieval of aerosol properties for ACA cases, and (3) an NN forward model to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the retrieval. The NN's theoretical capability of retrieval is investigated by several synthetic data studies. It is shown that the NNs retrieve ACAOT550 (above cloud aerosol optical thickness, at 550 nm), AE440–670 (Ångström exponent, between 440 and 670 nm), and SSA550 (single scattering albedo, at 550 nm) with an RMSE (root mean squared error) of ∼0.1 on ACAOT550, ∼0.4 on AE440–670 and ∼0.04 on SSA550 in synthetic experiments. Finally, comparison between the NN retrievals and adjacent PARASOL-RemoTAP clear-sky retrieval in 2008 shows good agreement within the range expected from the synthetic study."

We evaluate model performance, feature importance, and application of the model to another observatory and quantify how the models respond to instrument outages. 
 Vertically resolved thermodynamic cloud-phase classifications are essential for studies of atmospheric cloud and precipitation processes. The Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Thermodynamic Cloud Phase (THERMOCLDPHASE) value-added product (VAP) uses a multi-sensor approach to classify the thermodynamic cloud phase by combining lidar backscatter and depolarization, radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectral width, microwave-radiometer-derived liquid water path, and radiosonde temperature measurements. The measured pixels are classified as ice, snow, mixed phase, liquid (cloud water), drizzle, rain, and liq_driz (liquid+drizzle). We use this product as the ground truth to train three machine learning (ML) models to predict the thermodynamic cloud phase from multi-sensor remote sensing measurements taken at the ARM North Slope of Alaska (NSA) observatory: a random forest (RF), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture. Evaluations against the outputs of the THERMOCLDPHASE VAP with 1 year of data show that the CNN outperforms the other two models, achieving the highest test accuracy, F1 score, and mean intersection over union (IOU). Analysis of ML confidence scores shows that ice, rain, and snow have higher confidence scores, followed by liquid, while mixed, drizzle, and liq_driz have lower scores. Feature importance analysis reveals that the mean Doppler velocity and vertically resolved temperature are the most influential data streams for ML thermodynamic cloud-phase predictions. Lidar measurements exhibit lower feature importance due to rapid signal attenuation caused by the frequent presence of persistent low-level clouds at the NSA site. The ML models' generalization capacity is further evaluated by applying them at another Arctic ARM site in Norway using data taken during the ARM Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) field campaign. The models demonstrated similar performance to that observed at the NSA site. Finally, we evaluate the ML models' response to simulated instrument outages and signal degradation and show that a CNN U-Net model trained with input channel dropouts performs better when input fields are missing."

Smith Jr.;Jianfeng He;Musheng Lan;Zhenhong Du;Chengfeng Le,Increased Carbon Sink Within the Seasonal Sea Ice Zone Associated With Climate Variability in the Southern Ocean,"Ice distributions in Antarctica have undergone substantial changes over the past few decades, notably characterized by a progressive expansion of the seasonal sea ice zone (SIZ). However, the carbon sink dynamics and mechanisms in this climate‐sensitive region remain uncertain. We applied a random forest algorithm on satellite data to reconstruct a 20‐year (2003–2022) record of spring‐summer CO2 flux in the Southern Ocean. Our findings revealed that the rate of CO2 uptake increase in the SIZ is nearly four times faster than that in the non‐SIZ, suggesting a notable poleward shift of Southern Ocean carbon sink. The accumulation of the SIZ carbon sink was attributed to enhanced phytoplankton growth during austral spring‐summer, driven by the positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode. These results deepen understanding of the intricate relationship between climate variability and regional carbon sink dynamics, offering valuable insights into future climate change impacts on polar carbon sinks."

The seasonal phytoplankton responses on these events were investigated using a coupled physical‐biogeochemical model. In fall and winter, light limitation and BFe dilution caused by deep mixing suppressed phytoplankton growth following such events. However, as the mixed layer shallowed in spring, BFe concentrations in the upper ocean increased sharply, triggering a rapid increase in diatom biomass. In contrast, summer exhibited no significant enhancement of diatom biomass due to mesozooplankton grazing pressure, while picoplankton instead dominated the phytoplankton increase. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for local physical and biological factors when projecting the impacts of atmospheric deposition on marine biogeochemical cycles under global climate change."

In this study, we employ large‐eddy simulations of two idealized precipitating stratocumulus cases to investigate the roles of collision‐coalescence, cloud droplet sedimentation, and droplet effective radius in the ship track and quantify their individual and combined effects on plume buoyancy anomalies and spreading rates. Our results indicate that cloud droplet sedimentation and collision‐coalescence are the primary mechanisms controlling buoyancy and horizontal spreading, whereas the influence of effective radius is negligible.

 Satellite lidar plays a unique role in observing the global vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds. CALIPSO (Apr 2006–Aug 2023) pioneered such observations, and China's Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL) on board the DQ-1 satellite (Apr 2022-) continues this mission. Consequently, it is crucial to develop aerosol and cloud products of ACDL. Particularly, detecting the vertical and horizontal extent of aerosol and cloud layers is one of the most challenging tasks. In this study, we developed an ACDL layer detection algorithm based on the Two-Dimensional Multiscale Hypothesis Testing (2D-MHT) methodology. Notably, we proposed an approach for the uncertainty estimation in lidar return signals from the background atmosphere, enabling successful layer detection for ACDL. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only accurately identifies layers within ACDL measurements, but also provides the probability that a specific signal bin belongs to a layer. This probability enables users to customize layer definitions, a feature not available in other lidar products that typically rely on threshold-based methods. Furthermore, the ACDL layer products offer higher horizontal resolution and detect 53.0 % more layers globally compared to the CALIPSO V4.51 merged layer product in June 2022. These findings underscore the significant potential of our algorithm and ACDL layer products for advancing atmospheric and climate research."

 Observed winter fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations in Bangladesh tend to be high with monthly mean concentrations ranging between 182 and 229 μg m−3. To evaluate the model skill in reproducing the high observed concentrations, we apply the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQv5.4) model and compare model predicted PM2.5 concentrations with observed data in Bangladesh in January 2019. We use anthropogenic emissions estimates from the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (version 3) mosaic inventory, supplementing them with brick kiln emissions estimates over Bangladesh, and replacing them with emissions from the Speciated MultipOllutant Generator for India. The model reproduces monthly mean observed PM2.5 concentrations to within −27 % to −2 % in Bangladesh and successfully tracks the day-to-day and diurnal variation of observed PM2.5 concentrations. Both model and observed data show higher night-time PM2.5 concentrations than daytime concentrations due to shallow boundary layers, lower temperature, lower wind speed, and higher relative humidity at night. We find brick kiln emissions contribute monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations of 31–46 μg m−3 (18–27 %) in Bangladesh. A substantial portion of the contribution of brick kiln emissions to PM2.5 concentrations originate from secondary organic aerosols due to the large amount of volatile organic compounds emissions. A 50 % reduction of brick kiln emissions can improve PM2.5 concentrations in Bangladesh by 14–20 μg m−3. Organic mass is the largest component of PM2.5 in Bangladesh representing over 50 % of the PM2.5 mass."

 Emissions from biomass burning (BB) and diesel combustion significantly impact air quality, health and climate by releasing pollutants. However, due to variability in combustion sources and efficiency, and emission aging, their aerosol's composition and optical properties remain poorly understood and underrepresented in climate and air quality models. This study investigated the chemical and physical properties of BB aerosol emissions using advanced instrumentation in the EUPHORE simulation chamber. Emissions from different wood types (including mixtures with diesel exhaust) were analyzed, considering flaming and smoldering combustion, and their evolution under day and night conditions.Results indicated that combustion phase had a greater influence on emissions than wood type. Flaming combustion and diesel exhaust produced similar elemental carbon (EC) emissions (0.55 g/kg fuel and 0.46–0.73 g/kg fuel, respectively) while smoldering yielded lower EC (0.1–0.37 g/kg fuel) and higher organic carbon (OC), leading to higher OC/EC ratios (53 ± 20 g/kg fuel) than flaming and diesel fumes (1.5 ± 0.8 and 0.6 ± 0.1 g/kg fuel, respectively). Smoldering emissions contained more complex, higher molecular weight organics, with more harmful effects than flaming. Daytime aging promoted formation of highly-oxidized organic compounds, while nighttime aging, driven by nitrate radicals, formed nitro-aromatic compounds, associated with genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Both aging processes also increased aerosol absorption and scattering, affecting climate-relevant properties.This study provides one of the most comprehensive chamber-based analyses of BB and diesel-related emissions and their atmospheric evolution, integrating aerosol chemical composition and optical properties. The results contribute to understanding the impact of BB on air quality, health and climate, enhancing models and informing effective mitigation strategies."

 In recent years, global warming and its associated problems have garnered widespread attention from the international community. The Earth's three pole regions are among the most sensitive areas to global climate change, experiencing warming rates that significantly exceed the global average, a phenomenon known as polar amplification. However, the academic community has yet to reach a consensus on the possible mechanisms behind polar amplification, and research that links the three pole regions together remains relatively scarce. To gain a systematic understanding of the long-term variability in the radiation and energy budgets of the three pole regions, we utilized satellite observation, reanalysis, and model simulation data products to examine the interannual, seasonal, and spatiotemporal variations in several radiation components of these regions from 2001 to 2023. Subsequently, the radiative kernel method was employed to partition the total radiation budget variations over the three pole regions into partial contributions from surface albedo, water vapor, clouds, air temperature, and surface temperature, thereby explaining the causes of radiation budget anomalies in these regions. The results reveal that the surface shortwave downward radiation in the Earth's three pole regions has undergone a remarkable long-term decreasing trend. In contrast, the longwave downward radiation has shown a consistent long-term increase. Moreover, the shortwave net radiation, longwave net radiation, and total net radiation in the Arctic and Antarctic regions all exhibit long-term increasing trends to varying degrees, whereas the opposite is true for the Tibetan Plateau. By combining radiative kernel analysis with multivariate regression, we found that a substantial part of the changes in the shortwave radiation budgets in the three pole regions can be attributed to variations in surface albedo. Conversely, the variability in the longwave radiation budgets is closely associated with changes in cloud cover, surface temperature, and air temperature, and it also displays similar seasonal variation characteristics to these variables."

Surface daily PM2.5 observations exceeded 100 µg m−3, affecting major cities such as New York City and Philadelphia, while many areas lacked PM2.5 monitors, making it difficult to assess local air quality conditions. To address this gap, we developed a WRF-CMAQ-BenMAP modeling system to provide rapid, spatially continuous estimates of wildfire-attributable PM2.5 concentrations and associated health impacts, particularly benefiting regions lacking air quality monitoring. CMAQ simulations driven by two wildfire emissions datasets and two meteorological drivers showed good agreement with PM2.5 observations, with linear regression results of R2∼0.6 and slope ∼0.9. We further quantified uncertainties introduced by varying emissions and meteorological drivers and found the choice of wildfire emissions dataset alone can alter PM2.5 simulations by up to 40 µg m−3 (∼40%). Short-term health impacts were evaluated using the BenMAP model. Validation against asthma-associated emergency department (ED) visits in New York State confirmed the framework’s ability to replicate real-world outcomes, with ED visits increased up to ∼40%. The modeling results identified counties most severely affected by wildfire plumes, the majority of which lack regulatory air quality monitors. Our approach highlights the value of integrated modeling for identifying vulnerable populations and delivering timely health burden estimates, regardless of local monitoring availability."

Eastham;Jerome P. Jarrett,Zero-dimensional contrail models could underpredict lifetime optical depth,"Contrails are clouds that form behind aircraft and can warm the atmosphere as much as carbon dioxide emissions from those planes. This work compares two contrail models of different complexities to understand their lifecycle and impact. The models differ in how contrails evolve over time, implying that we may be significantly underestimating their climate impact. This highlights the need for model diversity and more evaluation against observations of long-lived contrails. 
 Proposed contrail avoidance schemes rely on being able to robustly predict which contrails cause the most climate warming. However, it has not yet been shown that different contrail models agree sufficiently to support the targeting of individual contrails by climate impact. To address this, we compare the most widespread contrail model, the Contrail Cirrus Prediction (CoCiP), to a higher-fidelity contrail model, the Aircraft Plume Chemistry, Emissions, and Microphysics Model (APCEMM), under parameterized meteorological conditions. The results show that the time-integrated total extinction (a proxy for climate impact) in APCEMM is 3.8 times that in CoCiP and that the models have opposite sensitivities of their time-integrated total extinction to relative humidity. We argue that these differences are due to the differing representations of the distribution of ice particles in space and in size across the contrails. The use of a monodisperse ice particle size distribution in a Gaussian plume means that CoCiP models the contrail exclusively as an accelerating, falling mass. The use of a spatially gridded and size-resolved aerosol scheme allows APCEMM to represent the separation of the precipitation plume from the contrail core, hence modeling behavior beyond the initial phase in which the contrail grows unconstrained. This behavior is consistent with prior large-eddy simulation studies, and it accounts for 92 % of the aggregate APCEMM time-integrated total extinction across all simulations. This suggests that models lacking a size-resolved aerosol scheme may underestimate the time-integrated total extinction. While a strategy avoiding a given proportion of persistent contrails in an unbiased way is still expected to yield a proportional reduction in the time-integrated total extinction, implementing strategies using contrail models to select the specific contrails to avoid may lead to fewer reductions in the time-integrated total extinction, primarily due to the current level of disagreement between models. We therefore recommend more research to establish confidence in model predictions at later contrail ages."

An unprecedented evaluation of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative phase 4 models is performed on different deposition schemes in relation to the land use and land cover (LULC) used. Among the results, LULC masks have to be harmonized and up-to-date information used in place of masks that are outdated and too coarse. Alternatively, LULC masks should be evaluated and intercompared when multiple model results are analyzed. 
 We present the collective evaluation of the regional-scale models that took part in the fourth edition of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The activity consists of the evaluation and intercomparison of regional-scale air quality models run over North American (NA) and European (EU) domains for 2016 (NA) and 2010 (EU). The focus of the paper is ozone dry deposition. Dry deposition is among the most important processes of removal of chemical compounds from the atmosphere and an important contributor to the overall chemical budget of the latter. Furthermore ozone dry deposition is very important as it can be severely detrimental to vegetation physiology. The collective evaluation begins with an operational evaluation, namely a direct comparison of model-simulated predictions with monitoring data aiming at assessing model performance (Dennis et al., 2010). Following the AQMEII protocol and Dennis et al. (2010), we also perform a probabilistic evaluation in the form of ensemble analyses and an introductory diagnostic evaluation. The latter analyzes the role of dry deposition in comparison with dynamic and radiative processes and land use/land cover (LULC) types in determining surface ozone variability. Important differences are found across dry deposition results when the same LULC is considered. Furthermore, we found that models use very different LULC masks, thus introducing an additional level of diversity in the model results. The study stresses that, as for other kinds of prior and problem-defining information (emissions, topography, or land–water masks), the choice of  LULC mask should not be at modeler discretion. Furthermore, LULC should be considered as a variable to be evaluated in any future model intercomparison, unless set as common input information. The differences in LULC selection can have a substantial impact on model results, making the task of evaluating dry deposition modules across different regional-scale models very difficult."

To characterize the suitability of these VIs for scientific applications, we assessed the between-sensor uncertainties for the nine HLS VI products and 12 additional ones, using VIs derived from HLS V2.0 (L30 and S30) surface reflectance for the years 2021 and 2022. A random sample of over 136 million cloud-free observations from 545 same-day L30 and S30 image pairs were selected to represent different landscapes globally in subarctic, temperate, and tropical climates. First, we evaluated between-sensor consistency for each VI derived from L30 and S30 and found high consistency (R2 > 0.94) for most VIs, except for chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI, R2 = 0.5). Second, we quantified the impact of potential factors on VI uncertainties using the mean absolute difference (MAD) between L30 and S30. Large view azimuth angle differences (VAD) between observation pairs (> ∼ 125°) increased MAD by ≤0.01 in most VIs. The impact on the Root Mean Square Error Interquartile Range (RMSEIQR) for these VIs varied from a decrease of 0.029 to an increase of 0.017. High solar zenith angle (SZ) (> ∼ 60°), prevalent during winter, also increased MAD by <0.07 and RMSEIQR by <0.2 for most VIs. Furthermore, one of the largest discrepancies was found in the area of terrain shadow, with a relative difference of over 20 %. The findings showed the importance of continuing HLS algorithm refinement. Finally, we analyzed VI uncertainties across VI values and for the qualitative aerosol optical depth characterization at three levels. Using VIs derived from low-level aerosols as a baseline, we assessed the impact of aerosol levels. VIs derived from moderate-level aerosol conditions closely aligned with the baseline. However, high aerosol levels introduced evident discrepancies, highlighting increased uncertainty in VIs under these conditions. Notably, even for low-level aerosol observations, uncertainties increased at VI tail values. For robust application of HLS V2.0 VIs in scientific studies, we recommend VI value ranges associated with low uncertainty. Additionally, we reported standard deviations of discrepancies, stratified by aerosol level and VI value, enabling users to account for uncertainties in their analyses, especially for VIs derived from high aerosol levels or beyond recommended ranges."

 Low-cost sensors (LCS) and mobile monitoring can enhance existing regulatory air pollution monitoring programs, to obtain more comprehensive spatial and temporal data on air quality. In this study, we evaluate rapid and hyperlocal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution gradients in London using a network of LCS nodes and mobile monitoring through a Mobile Air Pollution Sensing (MAPS) car. Based on both stationary and in-transit measurements, the correlations (R2) between the MAPS car and the LCS nodes decreased from 0.80 to 0.19 as their distance increased from 0–5 m to 16–45 m. Case studies in parks and tunnels revealed that NO2 mixing ratios varied significantly over small distances and times. For example, the mean mixing ratio of NO2 in the urban environment was 21.2 ± 11.8 ppb, whereas it increased to 61.3 ± 25.0 ppb in the Rotherhithe Tunnel, while NO2 increased from a mean of 11.4 ± 3.0 ppb to 22.0 ± 16.3 ppb, from the center of Regent’s Park to the roads that surround it. This study shows that pollution changes rapidly in urban areas in both space and time and that high-density networks and mobile monitoring can significantly increase the accuracy of pollution mapping."

 Aerosols significantly impact the regional radiation budget and global climate change. The aerosol extinction coefficient, which quantifies the absorption and scattering of light by aerosol particles in the atmosphere, is essential for environment monitoring and atmospheric optics research. While satellite retrievals, such as the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE), provide high-precision measurements of aerosol extinction coefficients, their spatial coverage is inherently limited. Conversely, the MERRA-2 reanalysis data offers global 3-D aerosol mass mixing ratios but suffers from significant uncertainties. Statistics indicate that the correlation coefficient is only about 0.42 (0.36) between aerosol extinction coefficients calculated directly from MERRA-2 and those retrieved by CALIPSO (SAGE). To address this issue, this study employed a machine learning approach to integrate MERRA-2 data with CALIPSO and SAGE retrievals, producing an optimal full-coverage 3-D aerosol extinction coefficient dataset. The optimized extinction coefficients achieve significantly improved correlation coefficients of 0.70 with CALIPSO and 0.75 with SAGE retrievals. Importantly, the optimized results can reflect the extinction characteristics of faint aerosols, which are missed by CALIPSO L2 layer product. This study provides valuable 3-D data for further understanding global distribution of aerosols, aerosol-climate interactions, and atmospheric processes."

 The Twain-Hu Basin (THB) in Central China, characterized by low-elevation topography and prevailing northerly winter winds, serves as a critical receptor for transboundary air pollutants from the North China Plain (NCP). This study systematically investigates the synergistic mechanisms between regional transport and local meteorology-terrain interactions that drive winter PM2.5 pollution events in this region, by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) vertical profiling, ground-based monitoring, and synoptic dynamic analyses. Results indicate that air pollutants from NCP are transported southward along the Dabie-Funiu Mountains corridor under northerly flows, where topographic barriers enhance pollutant retention within the quasi-basin structure of THB via airflow obstruction and subsidence, forming a dynamic “transport-stagnation” pollution pattern. UAV-based observations reveal a two-layer PM2.5 vertical structure: cold air intrusion and turbulent mixing promote vertical dispersion during transport phases, whereas shallow boundary layers (<200 m) and temperature inversions during stagnation exacerbate near-surface accumulation via aerosol-boundary layer positive feedback. THB's terrain-meteorology coupling amplifies vertical redistribution and horizontal transport efficiency through synergistic valley wind circulations and mesoscale weather systems. This study establishes a dynamical framework for understanding regional “transport-stagnation” PM2.5 pollution and proposes strategic prioritization of topographic corridors and meteorologically sensitive periods in cross-regional governance. These insights offer a scientific basis for optimizing pollution control strategies in complex terrain regions."

 This study investigates the characteristics of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) based on their organizational structures over the eastern and northeastern parts of the Indian subcontinent, during premonsoon (March–May) and monsoon (June–September) seasons, using 27-years (1998–2024) of TRMM and GPM satellite observations, together with ERA5 reanalysis and surface observations. MCSs were objectively identified from satellite precipitation features using rainfall area and convective thresholds, and then separated into linear and nonlinear systems according to convective geometry. Linear MCSs were further classified into five modes such as Trailing/Leading Stratiform (TS/LS), Parallel-Stratiform (PS), Embedded-Line (EL), No-Stratiform (NS) and Bow-Echo (BE) based on the shape of the convective region and the arrangement of stratiform precipitation.Linear MCSs, though less frequent, produce stronger convection, more extreme hourly rainfall, and intense winds, whereas nonlinear MCSs occur more often and contribute the majority of seasonal rainfall. Among linear modes, TS/LS modes are the most frequent, while infrequent modes such as BE and NS produce the most intense convection, highest rain rates, and greatest potential for damaging winds and extreme hourly rainfall. PS modes display intermediate convective intensity, while EL modes remain the weakest. Environmental composites show notable differences in Convective-Available-Potential-Energy, Total-Column-Water-Vapour and wind shear across modes, with shear contrasts reduced in monsoon.This work provides the first comprehensive characterization of MCS organizational structures in the subcontinent, clarifying their role in seasonal rainfall and severe weather. The findings offer a benchmark for evaluating model simulations and improving forecasts over this highly vulnerable part of Indian subcontinent."

 We present the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-type Ozone Profile Essential Climate Variable (GOP-ECV) data record covering the 26-year period from July 1995 until October 2021. It is derived from a series of five nadir-viewing ultraviolet–visible(–near-infrared) GOME-type satellite instruments, including GOME/the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-2), the Scanning Imaging Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY)/the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)/Aura, GOME-2/Meteorological Operational satellite A (MetOp-A), and GOME-2/Meteorological Operational satellite B (MetOp-B), which are merged into a single coherent long-term time series. It provides monthly mean ozone profiles at a spatial resolution of 5° × 5° latitude by longitude. The profiles are given as partial columns for 19 atmospheric layers ranging from the surface up to 80 km. The underlying profile retrieval algorithm is the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory scheme, which is sensitive to both tropospheric and stratospheric amounts of ozone. The merged profile record has been developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the framework of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative+ (ESA-CCI+) ozone project (Ozone_CCI+). Profiles from the individual instruments are first harmonized through careful inspection and elimination of inter-sensor deviations and drifts and then merged into a combined record. In a further step, the merged time series is harmonized with the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record, which is based on nearly the same satellite sensors. GTO-ECV possesses  excellent long-term stability, and, with the homogenization presented in this paper, an improvement in the robustness and stability of the merged profiles can be achieved. For this purpose, an altitude-dependent scaling is applied that utilizes ozone profile Jacobians obtained from a machine learning approach. We found that climatological ozone distributions derived for selected layers from the final GOP-ECV data record exhibit expected spatiotemporal patterns."

In the existing European CAMS-REG inventory, several improvement opportunities exist, especially an underestimation in urban centers of ~35 %. We calculate emissions by combining gap-filled road information and emission factors, for the first time giving detailed emissions for most roads in Europe. With this, our dataset is much closer in line with independently combined city inventories. 
 Spatially resolved estimates of road transport emissions are fundamental for tackling challenges of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Emission estimates at 0.05° x 0.1° resolution are provided in the widely used CAMS-REG regional European emissions inventory. For the road transport sector, several improvement opportunities were identified: Firstly (1) an underestimation of ca. 35 % of NOx emissions in comparison to 8 independent urban inventories; secondly (2), artefacts in the spatial distribution in Eastern European non-EU countries; thirdly (3), the necessity of labour-intense downscaling methodologies to create high-resolution urban inventories from the fixed resolution dataset. To overcome these, emissions for all road links in the domain (n=59,710,490) were estimated using gap-filled activity data (AADT) from OpenStreetMap and OpenTransportMap. Gap filling was performed with random forest models trained on land-use and road information data. Model performance was R2: 0.63–0.74 and MAE(AADT): 1570–2028, with better performance for larger roads. Up-to-date emission factors were applied on road links using a novel maximum-speed–based classification. To generate the CAMS-REG v8.1 inventory, the resulting spatial distribution was used as a proxy map, together with national totals. The new dataset lowered the difference-to-city inventories to 19 % for absolute NOx emissions, and can be flexibly gridded to high resolutions. Median increase in urban emission share is 24 % compared to national totals, and non-EU cities see large increases (e.g. Istanbul, +197 %; St. Petersburg, +288 %) in attributed emissions due to the updated spatial distribution. Two case studies (London and Milan) show an increased spatial correlation, from R2 ≈ 0.3 using CAMS-REG v4.2 to R2 ≈ 0.6, with CAMS-REG v8.1 against the local inventory. Vector and gridded versions of the emission dataset and spatial distribution are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15688723 (Hohenberger et al. (2025))."

 Airborne mineral dust significantly influences Earth's climate through perturbing Earth's radiation budget, modulating cloud formation and microphysical properties, and fertilizing the biosphere. Recent field campaigns have revealed substantially more coarse-mode dust particles in the atmosphere than previously recognized, yet current satellite retrievals and climate models inadequately represent these particles. This study presents a novel retrieval algorithm for dust aerosol optical depth at 10 μm (AOD10μm) and effective diameter (Deff) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared (TIR) observations over global land and ocean. Building upon the previous synergistic approach for MODIS and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), we improve the retrieval from CALIOP-track-limited coverage to full-swath MODIS observations at 10-km resolution over both ocean and land surfaces. The retrieval improvements include: (1) application of climatological CALIOP dust vertical profiles (2007–2017) to constrain dust vertical distribution for off-CALIOP-track pixels; (2) the improved optimization method to effectively handle non-monotonic cost functions arising from temperature inversions within the Saharan Air Layer; and (3) extension to land surfaces through incorporation of MODIS-retrieved surface emissivity and ERA5 reanalysis data. Validation against coarse-mode AOD from global AERONET (N = 4703) and MAN (N = 1673) observations yields R = 0.82 and 0.85 for AOD10μm, with retrieval uncertainty characterized as ε = 15 % × AOD + 0.04. The retrieved Deff demonstrates excellent agreement with in-situ measurements collected from 24 field campaigns around the globe (R = 0.84, MBE = 0.23 μm, RMSE = 0.73 μm), capturing the particle size variation from near-source regions (Deff = 7–8 μm) to long-range transport (Deff = 3–5 μm). Case studies of dust events over the Namibian coast and trans-Atlantic corridor demonstrate the retrieval's capability to resolve episodic dust properties and size-dependent deposition during transport. This improved retrieval addresses the critical observational gap for coarse and super-coarse dust particles (D > 5 μm), providing essential constraints for dust life cycle studies and climate model evaluation."

 Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are widely used in refrigeration, air-conditioning, semiconductor, and other industries, contributing a total direct radiative forcing only surpassed by carbon dioxide and methane. Current modeling efforts of F-gases use simplified chemical schemes and ignore three-dimensional dynamics, which limits the quantification of their chemical impacts, and a full suite of F-gases is not currently included in atmospheric chemical transport models. Here, we develop and implement a chemistry module in the GEOS-Chem model with 27 additional F-gases (including minor CFCs, minor HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and SO2F2) with constrained emissions. The updated simulations capture most of the surface mole fraction baseline trends and some pollution events for F-gases in 2020–2021, with a normalized mean bias between −14 % and 5 % at the Mace Head station and −17 % and 3 % at the ShangDianZi station. The impact of emission spatial distributions decreases with lifetime, suggesting that accurate global modeling of the background of long-lived species (>10 years) is less dependent on the spatial distribution of the emission than on the total magnitude. The impact of the updated simulation on key reactive species, including ozone, HOx, ClOx, and NOx, is <1 %. For species with 10-year lifetimes, F-gas chemical losses drive 20–40 % changes in their mixing ratios. Our work provides a comprehensive F-gases chemistry module complementing the major CFCs and HCFCs in the GEOS-Chem model, and this suite of F-gases provides potential applications for understanding their climate impacts and atmospheric processes."

This study investigates tropospheric BrO at two research sites: Marambio (MAR; 64° 13′ S, 56° 37′ W) and Belgrano II (BEL; 77° 52′ S, 34° 7’ W). These stations sit in the surroundings of the Weddell Sea, a known hot-spot for bromine emissions in Antarctica. MAX-DOAS (Multi-axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) measurements were performed for the period 2015–2023, enabling us to infer vertical profiles of BrO mixing ratios in the low troposphere. These long-term observations are combined with air mass trajectories and satellite observations of bromine-emitting surfaces in Antarctica such the ocean, land (with or without snow), total sea ice and different sea ice states of development (SISD). The goal is to assess correlations between observed BrO and surface types that may emit bromine directly and indirectly in the polar regions, particularly focusing on different SISD.Results show a strong BrO seasonality at both sites, with particular high surface BrO volume mixing ratios (40 parts per trillion) after polar sunrise. From the different SISD, BrO correlates in particular with sea ice thinner than 30 cm. In case of future bromine trend studies in a context of global warming, this study suggests considering not only sea ice extent but also SISD, especially thin sea ice."

 Accurate monitoring of atmospheric CO2 concentration and fluxes is essential for understanding carbon cycles and carbon budget assessments. This study utilized a coherent differential absorption lidar (CDIAL) system to conduct continuous, high-resolution vertical CO2 profiling in the coastal area of Shenzhen to elucidate its spatiotemporal distribution, the emission sources, and most importantly the dynamic interactions between CO2 and the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The results revealed anomalous CO2 accumulation within the 500–1200 m altitude and a stratified vertical gradient decreasing from planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the bottom, driven by temperature inversions and near-stagnant vertical mixing. This accumulation near the PBL enhances atmospheric heating, reduces surface heat flux, and suppresses PBL development, forming positive feedback that further inhibits pollutants diffusion. The results of the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis based on the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model indicated that industrial, vehicular, and marine emissions were the primary sources of CO2. External contributions included long-range transport from northern inland regions (72 %) and short-range coastal transport (27 %), particularly in Dapeng Peninsula, Huishen Coastal Expressway, southern Huizhou, and Daya Bay. This study highlights the capability of CDIAL for high-resolution CO2 monitoring, flux quantification, and uncovering dynamic interactions with boundary layer."

 This study investigates a rare and appalling lightning event that occurred in Gujarat, India, on November 26, 2023, resulting in fatalities, extensive property damage, and substantial agricultural losses. Combining observational and modeling approaches, the analysis delves into the synoptic weather patterns and microphysical dynamics underlying this outbreak. Real-time data from the ground-based lightning sensor network identified the unseasonal and anomalous nature of the event. Observations from INSAT 3D and ERA5 reanalysis outputs reveal that the interaction of a cyclonic circulation over the northern Arabian Sea with Western Disturbances created an atypically moisture-rich environment, triggering convective activity uncommon in Gujarat during late November. The radar reflectivity profile from the GPM 2ADPR product confirms the occurrence of convective precipitation devoid of bright band signatures, while ERA5 outputs indicate elevated cloud liquid and ice water content during the event. Simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-ELEC model reveal enhanced ice and snow concentrations in the upper layer of the cloud, facilitating cloud electrification and the formation of inverted dipolar charge centers with the negative charge centre top of the positive one when non-inductive charging is considered. Analysis of space charge structures highlights the predominant acquisition of positive charges by graupel particles in the mixed-phase layer, driven by elevated cloud liquid water. By synthesizing observational data and model simulations, this study provides a detailed characterization of the event, emphasizing the dual roles of synoptic-scale disturbances and microphysical processes in driving the unseasonal extreme lightning event. The findings highlight the critical influence of Western Disturbances in modulating convective anomalies and highlight the need for advancements in forecasting capabilities and understanding of unseasonal weather phenomena to mitigate future risks."

 A zero-dimensional chemical box model was used to study O3 production P(O3) in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) during a severe O3 episode. The study revealed that this area in MCMA falls into a VOC-limited regime. Different photochemical indicator (PI) ratios offer additional supporting perspectives on NOx sensitive and VOC-sensitive conditions. We found VOC/NOx ratio <8 throughout the day which was supported by noontime satellite retrieved HCHO/NO2 ratio (FNR) < 1 for the O3 episode suggesting a VOC limited regime. VOCs and OH reactivity levels are approximately half that of measurements reported in 2003. The modelled peak OH (0.25 pptv), HO2 (12pptv) and P(O3) (17 ppb h−1) are 0.5, 4.5 and 6.5 times lower than reported for the MCMA in 2003. Model adjustment to 4.5 times HO2 leads to P(O3) half that of the previously calculated P(O3) in 2003 and 25 % of the value reported for 2015–2019 in MCMA. Therefore, for effective O3 abatement policies, it is crucial to use a combination of P(O3) isopleths alongside PIs and FNRs. An analysis of Propylene-Equivalent (Propy-Equiv) concentrations revealed that ethylene, m,p-xylene, traffic exhaust related isoprene, toluene, m,p-xylene, propylene and propane which account for 62.6 % of the overall Propy-Equiv need to be controlled in the time frame before 14:00 when P(O3) is elevated. These VOCs are mainly associated with vehicle exhaust and evaporative emissions. Compared to previous liquified petroleum gases (LPG) reduction, it is suggested that reductions of these traffic emissions prior to 14:00 might be an essential step in lowering in-situ O3 production."

 On 1 May 2024, a Saharan dust plume was observed over Hatfield, UK, and analyzed using a novel spectroscopic lidar system (LITES) developed at the University of Hertfordshire. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first coordinated study over the UK combining lidar optical properties at 532 nm with a spectrally resolved analysis of a long-range transported Saharan dust event. A distinct dust layer was observed between 2–5 km, with lidar-derived optical thickness values ranging from 0.19 to 0.26 at 532 nm, indicating a low-to-moderate Saharan dust intrusion. Within this layer, the lidar ratio was 53 ± 14 sr and the particle linear depolarization ratio was 0.27 ± 0.02, confirming the presence of non-spherical dust particles. After 4 h, despite the reduction in dust loading, the lidar ratios (mean: 51 ± 11 sr) and particle linear depolarization ratios (0.28 ± 0.01) remained characteristic of Saharan dust. Complementary AERONET observations, collected approximately 10 km from the lidar site, recorded low Å ngström exponent values (0.05–0.2 at 440–870 nm) and a high total AOD of 0.5, with coarse-mode AOD contributing 0.37 (74%) at 500 nm, further confirming the dominance of coarse-mode Saharan dust. Spectrally resolved lidar signals revealed distinct Raman-shifted features near 571.0 nm ± 1.3 nm (1284 ± 40 cm−1) and higher backscatter signals in the 542.9–554.4 nm (377-759 cm−1) range, using a primary emission wavelength of 532 nm. These spectral features persisted throughout the dust layer but were absent in the Raman spectrum of a low-level cloud that was embedded in the dust layer during the lidar observation time. These dust spectral features furthermore disappeared above the dust layer, confirming their attribution to Saharan dust. The spectrally resolved observations are consistent with the Raman spectra of dust samples, which were measured in the LITES laboratory using Raman spectroscopy for direct comparison."

 Accurate and timely monitoring of methane emissions is essential for mitigating the impacts of greenhouse gases, particularly in remote regions lacking on-land sensors. Traditional satellite-based methods for detecting methane often encounter challenges due to coarse spatial resolutions and spectral interferences, especially in areas with mixed land use and numerous inland water bodies. One example is the Sentinel-5P satellite, which is extensively utilized for monitoring air quality and global greenhouse gas concentrations. Our study identified significant gaps in the coverage of Sentinel-5P imagery in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, home to the world’s third largest oil reserve, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring solutions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Median-Based Multi-Reference (MBMR) algorithm for methane retrieval, designed for Sentinel-2’s shortwave infrared (SWIR) imagery. The MBMR algorithm takes into account surface albedo variability, local greenhouse gas concentrations, and improved reference scene selection to enhance the accuracy of plume detection. Performance evaluations using simulated methane plume datasets and controlled methane release experiments demonstrate that MBMR outperforms both baseline methods and existing state-of-the-art algorithms. When applied to actual methane leaks from the NGTL pipeline system and Syncrude’s bitumen upgrader in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, MBMR showcased its robust capability to identify methane plumes amidst complex landscapes and diverse emissions scenarios. The successful integration of MBMR with Sentinel-2 imagery, which is primarily used for land cover mapping, vegetation and water indexing, harvesting planning, and disaster response, highlights its potential as a reliable and cost-effective tool for continuous monitoring of methane emissions in challenging environments."

 Climate warming has led to a rising frequency of extreme heat events over China, which further exacerbate surface ozone (O₃) pollution alongside accelerating anthropogenic emissions, especially for the key city clusters, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Sichuan Basin (SCB), and Pearl River Delta (PRD). With long-term observations, reanalysis, and GEOS-Chem simulations, this study reveals significant enhancements ozone levels during heatwave days (HWs) compared to non-heatwave days (NHWs), driven by distinct yet interconnected meteorological and physicochemical processes across different city clusters. In BTH, a persistent 500 hPa high-pressure system, together with reduced relative humidity, enhanced downward solar radiation at the surface, and 850 hPa southerly winds, leads to elevated temperatures and consequently higher O₃ concentrations during HWs compared with NHWs. The YRD experiences intensified subsidence and suppressed cloud cover under the northward shifted Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), creating ideal conditions for photochemistry. Similarly, SCB and PRD, in the dominance of the northwestward extension of WPSH and associated subsidence, features increased SSRD and surface air temperatures. Moreover, tropical cyclones over Northwest Pacific may affect O3 anomalies in PRD. Process analysis demonstrates that chemical production dominates O₃ enhancement across all regions. Horizontal transport shows a positive contribution in BTH but significant negative contributions in the other three regions. In contrast, vertical transport and mixing processes exhibit relatively weak impacts. The findings can provide theoretical support to tackle ozone pollution for major city clusters in China amid the increasing frequency of extreme heat events."

This study employs models contributing at least ten ensemble members to the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project—MIROC6 and CanESM5—to examine the mid-century response of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer monsoons to changes in aerosol burdens. We focus on a scenario characterized by an increase in aerosol burdens over South Asia, but strong reductions over the NH extra-tropics, since this is consistent with observed trends. These anomalous reductions induce an inter-hemispheric energy imbalance, prompting a large-scale response in the atmospheric meridional overturning circulation. The upper-tropospheric levels of the overturning circulation enhance heat transport towards the Southern Hemisphere, while the lower levels bring enhanced moisture convergence into the NH, leading to more rainfall across NH monsoon regions. Our findings highlight that global air pollution control measures may have wide-ranging impacts well beyond the aerosol source regions. For South Asia, these findings suggest that widespread remote aerosol reductions could offset the precipitation suppression from rising local aerosol pollution."

We find that changes in transport patterns are the dominant factor in the overall ozone–ENSO responses, with the opposing effects of chemical depletion and increased biomass burning on ozone largely offsetting each other. Models consistently project an increase in tropical ozone–ENSO response associated with strengthening anomalous circulation and more abundant water vapor with global warming. 
 The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates tropospheric ozone variability, yet quantitative contributions from individual processes and future response remain unclear. Here, we evaluate the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and 10 chemistry–climate models (CCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in capturing ozone–ENSO response, quantify the roles of transport, chemistry, and biomass burning, and examine the future evolution of these responses. The GEOS-Chem simulation over 2005–2020 well reproduces the satellite-observed ozone–ENSO response, including the instantaneous decrease (increase) in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) over the tropical eastern (western) Pacific in El Niño, and the delayed response in subtropics and mid-latitudes. The combined effects of transport, chemistry, and biomass burning emissions explain over 90 % of the simulated TCO variability in the tropical Pacific during ENSO. Changes in transport patterns show the dominant role by explaining 53 % (+0.8 DU) and 92 % (−2.2 DU) of the variability in TCO,  respectively, in the western and eastern Pacific during El Niño relative to normal periods. Chemical depletion reduces ozone by 0.2 and 0.7 DU, respectively, in the western and eastern Pacific, which is offset by enhanced biomass burning emissions of 0.4 and 0.1 DU. Only 5 out of the 10 CMIP6 CCMs, with interactive tropospheric chemistry and accurate representation of ENSO dynamics, reproduce the tropical ozone–ENSO response. These models consistently indicate that tropical ozone–ENSO response will increase by 15 %–40 % in 2100 under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, associated with strengthening anomalous circulation and increasing water vapor with global warming. These results are critical for understanding climate–chemistry interactions and for future ozone projection."

Two long-lasting Arctic MPCs and year-round statistics show persistent droplet activation and dominant immersion freezing, indicating well-filled cloud condensation nuclei and ice-nucleating particle reservoirs. These findings help explain MPC longevity and may improve cloud life cycle representation in weather and climate models. 
 Vertically resolved observations of the temporal evolution of mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) were performed over the central Arctic during the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition, which lasted from October 2019 to September 2020. The research icebreaker Polarstern, drifting with the pack ice for more than 7 months, mostly at latitudes > 85° N, served as a platform for state-of-the-art remote sensing of aerosols and clouds. The use of the recently introduced dual field-of-view (FOV) polarization lidar technique in combination with the well-established lidar-radar retrieval technique provided, for the first time, a robust instrumental basis to monitor the evolution of the liquid and the ice phase of MPCs and the interplay between the two phases. Two long-lasting Arctic MPC events observed close to the North Pole in mid-winter (December 2019) and late summer (September 2020) are discussed to provide new insight into Arctic MPC evolution processes. In the second part of the article, cloud statistics, covering all seasons of a year, are presented. The focus is on the optical and microphysical properties of the liquid phase. These results are solely derived from the dual-FOV lidar observations. The key findings of the study can be summarized as follows: persistent activation of aerosol particles to form water droplets is of great importance for the longevity of MPCs. The observations confirm that ice formation occurs predominantly via immersion freezing. The field studies suggest that the free tropospheric reservoirs of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) were always well filled, i.e., the clouds did not exhaust their supply of activatable and activated particles. The observation of long-lasting MPC events, low ice production rates, and a sufficiently large INP reservoir leads to the recommendation to use a time-dependent immersion freezing parameterization in MPC modeling efforts."

Many compounds were both emitted and absorbed depending on the season and time of day. Emissions peaked in summer, while uptake was stronger in autumn. This unique long-term dataset improves our understanding of forest–atmosphere interactions and supports better air quality and climate models. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone (O3) are key constituents of tropospheric chemistry, affecting both air quality and climate. Forests are major emitters of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs), yet large uncertainties remain regarding the diversity of exchanged compounds, the drivers of their bidirectional fluxes, and their in-canopy chemistry. Long-term and comprehensive in situ datasets remain scarce, limiting our understanding of these complex processes. We conducted a three-year field campaign (2022–2024) at the Integrated Carbon Observation System forest station of Vielsalm (BE-Vie), combining vertical concentration profile and eddy covariance flux measurements above and below the canopy. Using a PTR-ToF-MS and a dedicated open-source processing pipeline, we identified 51 significantly exchanged VOCs. The vertical and diurnal gradients of the mixing ratios reflected the interplay between emission, deposition, chemistry, and transport. Combined with a profile of turbulence statistics, these observations offer an opportunity to investigate their behaviour within the canopy. The forest acted as a net VOC source in summer (∼ 1.25 μg m−2 s−1), while deposition dominated in autumn. Many oxygenated VOCs displayed bidirectional exchange. Monoterpenes, isoprene, and methanol were the most abundant flux contributors, but 15–30 (30–43) compounds were needed to account for 90 % of total emissions (depositions), depending on the season.

However, the seasonality of sulfate aerosols over NATL has decreased since 1970, likely due to a reduction in the United States (US) SO2 emissions following the Clean Air Act of 1970. We performed atmospheric chemistry and transport simulations to assess the impact of changing US SO2 emissions between 1970 and 2010 on NATL sulfate burden and radiative forcing. United States SO2 emission reductions weakened the seasonality in NATL sulfate burden by ∼17%, primarily due to a decrease in chemical production and transport in summer. These emission reductions caused a summertime radiative forcing (∼2 W m−2) twice as large as the wintertime forcing. Our findings highlight the complex, season‐dependent responses of sulfate burden and radiative effects to regional emission changes."

 H2O2-driven oxidation has been considered to be the main cause of sulfate formation in haze events. However, field observations have confirmed that the known H2O2 sources cannot explain its ambient levels. In this study, the photochemistry of acetylacetone (AA), a ubiquitous β-diketone in the atmosphere, was investigated under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation using droplets formed in-situ by deliquescence of hygroscopic ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4). Special emphasis was placed on elucidating its contributions to H2O2 formation and SO2 oxidation under varying conditions. Results show that AA photolysis significantly boosted H2O2 production. In (NH4)2SO4 droplets, H2O2 peaked early after UV irradiation, while in NaH2PO4 droplets, it reached fourfold higher and peaked later because phosphate promotes the AA photolysis. Hydrogen atom donors like citric acid redirected radical termination from H2O2 to organic hydroperoxides (ROOHs). Cl− and Br− altered radical processes: Cl− suppressed H2O2 production but enhanced ROOHs production, while Br− exhibits stronger, concentration-dependent effects on both species. SO2 oxidation was achieved by various oxidizing species such as H2O2 and ROOHs produced during AA photolysis. Key products such as pyruvic acid, peroxyacetic acid and propanedioic acid were identified and possible UV-driven reaction pathways were revealed. These results uncover new H2O2 production and sulfate formation pathways, and show the complexity of aerosol-phase photochemistry. This work improves our understanding of atmospheric H2O2 source and redox processes, offering new insights for the oxidation potential of atmospheric organic aerosols and atmospheric oxidation capacity, and enhancing atmospheric chemistry models to better predict air quality and climate."

Lagrangian diagnostics based on high-resolution ICON simulations show long residence times of the cirrus in stratospheric air, allowing us to separate different diabatic processes during transit. The findings suggest that radiative diabatic cloud processes significantly impact the tropopause thermodynamic structure. 
 Diabatic processes are essential in shaping the thermodynamic and chemical structure of the extratropical transition layer (ExTL). Cirrus may play a vital role due to associated latent heating and its influence on radiative and turbulent properties. Here we present for the first time a combination of in situ observations of the ExTL thermodynamic structure inside and outside cirrus using a dual-platform approach during the AIRTOSS-ICE campaign and a Lagrangian analysis based on high-resolution simulations. Earlier analysis by Müller et al. (2015) suggests cirrus formation in stratospherically influenced air based on measured N2O mixing ratios. The dual-platform approach reveals substantial disturbances in the vertical profile of potential temperature with a weakened stratification inside the cirrus and sharpening above.Lagrangian analysis based on high-resolution ICON simulations suggests that cirrus-related radiative cooling and latent heating are essential for the formation of the observed perturbed potential temperature profile. Radiative cooling and to a lesser degree turbulent heat and momentum transport result in substantial potential vorticity (PV) production in the upper part of the cirrus and a steepening of the vertical potential vorticity gradient. The simulation reproduces key aspects of the observations and the larger-scale evolution as evident from satellite and radiosonde data. Our analysis further indicates that the cirrus particles formed in an already moist ExTL air mass over southern Germany about 12 h before being sampled over the North Sea.Our findings underline the importance of diabatic cloud processes for the thermodynamic structure of the ExTL and potential cross-tropopause exchange."

Haugvaldstad;Dirk Olivié;Trude Storelvmo;Michael Schulz,Dust radiative forcing in CMIP6 Earth System models: insights from the AerChemMIP piClim-2xdust experiment,"Our study examines what would happen if desert dust in the atmosphere doubled, motivated by dust sedimentation records showing a large increase in dust levels since industrialization began. Using climate model simulations, we assess how more dust affects Earth's energy balance and rainfall. We found that models disagree on whether more dust overall cools or warms the planet. Additionally, more dust tends to reduce rainfall because it absorbs radiation and encourages the formation of ice clouds. 
 Mineral dust significantly affects the downwelling and upwelling shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative fluxes, and changes in dust can therefore alter the Earth's energy balance. This study analyses the dust effective radiative forcing (DuERF) in nine CMIP6 Earth System Models (ESMs) using the piClim-2xdust experiment from AerChemMIP. The piClim-2xdust experiment uses a global dust emission tuning factor to double the emission flux. The DuERF is decomposed into contributions from dust-radiation (direct DuERF) and dust-cloud (cloud DuERF) interactions. The net direct DuERF ranges from −0.56 to 0.05 W m−2. Models with lower (higher) dust absorption and a smaller (larger) fraction of coarse dust show the most negative (positive) direct DuERF. The cloud DuERF is positive in most models, ranging from −0.02 to 0.2 W m−2, however, they differ in their LW and SW flux contributions. Specifically, NorESM2-LM shows a positive LW cloud DuERF attributable to the effect of dust on cirrus clouds. The dust forcing efficiency varies tenfold among models, indicating that uncertainty in DuERF is likely underestimated in AerChemMIP. There is a consistent fast precipitation response associated with dust decreasing atmospheric radiative cooling (ARC). Models with strongly absorbing dust show reduced precipitation, explainable by decreased clear-sky ARC (up to 3.2 mm yr−1). In NorESM2-LM, this decrease is associated with a cloudy sky ARC due to an increase in cirrus clouds (up to 5.6 mm yr−1). Taken together, these findings suggest that the fast precipitation response induced by dust alone may be significant and comparable to that caused by anthropogenic black carbon."

Since emission inventories are typically provided at the annual level, emissions are downscaled to a refined temporal resolution using temporal profiles. This study quantifies the impact of using new anthropogenic temporal profiles on the performance of an European air quality multi-model ensemble. Overall, the findings indicate an improvement of the modelling results. 
 An accurate characterization of the temporal distribution in primary emissions is essential for air quality modeling. This study evaluates the impact of replacing the default temporal profiles in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) European air quality multi-model ensemble with an updated dataset (CAMS-REG-TEMPO). The sensitivity of 11 regional models and the ensemble to these changes is assessed by comparing modeled and observed monthly, weekly, and diurnal cycles of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), coarse particulate matter (PM10), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across Europe. NO2 shows the greatest improvement, with weekly cycle correlations increasing up to +0.17 due to better road transport emissions representation. PM10 correlations improve in winter (up to +0.13 weekly and +0.07 diurnal) due to refined residential wood combustion emissions. PM2.5 correlations remain largely unchanged, except for diurnal cycles, which improve in winter (+0.18) but slightly degrade in spring and summer (−0.02). O3 is the least affected, as correlations were already high with default profiles (0.9–0.95). For some species and timescales (e.g., NO2 diurnal cycles), results vary across models, highlighting the complex interactions between emission timing and atmospheric processes. CAMS-REG-TEMPO has little effect on annual RMSE and bias, aside from slight improvements in high PM10 concentrations. Overall, the findings support implementing CAMS-REG-TEMPO in the operational CAMS multi-model ensemble."

This study combines observations and model simulations, projecting a stratospheric water vapor anomaly lasting 4–7 years, with significant temperature variations and ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere lasting 7–10 years. These findings offer critical insights into the role of stratospheric water vapor in shaping climate and atmospheric chemistry. 
 The Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai Model–Observation Comparison (HTHH–MOC) project aims to comprehensively investigate the evolution of volcanic water vapor and sulfur emissions and their subsequent atmospheric impacts and underlying response mechanisms using state-of-the-art global climate models. This study evaluates multi-model ensemble simulations participating in the HTHH–MOC free-run experiment with climate projections for 10 years (2022–2032). Model results are evaluated against satellite observations to assess their ability to reproduce the observed evolution of stratospheric water vapor, aerosols, temperature, and ozone from 2022 to 2024. The participating models accurately capture the observed distribution patterns and associated upper atmospheric responses, providing confidence for their future projections. Model simulations suggest that the Hunga eruption-induced stratospheric water vapor anomaly lasts 4–7 years, with a water vapor e-folding time of 31–43 months. This prolonged water vapor perturbation leads to significant stratospheric and mesospheric cooling, resulting in significant ozone loss in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere for 7–10 years. Comparisons between simulations with both SO2 and H2O emissions and those with H2O-only emissions indicate that the pronounced dipole response with upper-stratospheric cooling and lower-stratospheric warming is driven by the combined effects of SO2 and H2O injections. These results highlight the prolonged atmospheric impacts of the Hunga eruption and the potential critical role of stratospheric water vapor in modulating long-term atmospheric chemistry and dynamics."

Satellite data reveal a role for increased tropical emissions. Larger emissions over eastern Brazil can be explained by warmer temperatures, which has led to exceptional drought, while hydrological changes play more of a role in emission increases elsewhere in the tropics. Broadly, we find that this situation continues into 2024. 
 The global annual mean atmospheric CO2 growth rate in 2023 was one of the highest since records began in 1958, comparable to values recorded during previous major El Niño events. We do not fully understand this anomalous growth rate, although a recent study highlighted the role of boreal North American forest fires. We use a Bayesian inverse method to interpret global-scale atmospheric CO2 data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2). The resulting a posteriori CO2 flux estimates reveal that from 2022 to 2023, the biggest changes in CO2 fluxes of net biosphere exchange (NBE) – for which positive values denote a flux to the atmosphere – were over the land tropics. We find that the largest NBE increase is over eastern Brazil, with small increases over southern Africa and Southeast Asia. We also find significant increases over southeastern Australia, Alaska, and western Russia. A large NBE increase over boreal North America, due to fires, is driven by our a priori inventory, informed by independent data. The largest NBE reductions are over western Europe, the USA, and central Canada. Our NBE estimates are consistent with gross primary production estimates inferred from satellite observations of solar-induced fluorescence and from satellite observations of vegetation greenness. We find that warmer temperatures in 2023 explain most of the NBE change over eastern Brazil, with hydrological changes more important elsewhere across the tropics. Our results suggest that the ongoing environmental degradation of the Amazon is now playing a substantial role in increasing the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate."

Summer polar upwelling bottom-up drives opposite water vapor variability between the two hemispheres. Subsequently, mesospheric ozone is negatively modulated by water vapor through ozone chemistry, which further influences temperatures above 90 km via radiative and chemical heating. 
 The upper mesosphere, a transition region between Earth's atmosphere and space, is characterized by complex interactions among water vapor (H2O), atomic hydrogen (H), ozone (O3), atomic oxygen (O), and temperatures. Using MLS, SABER, and SOFIE satellite data, we explore the upwelling-driven interannual variability of temperatures near 90 km (T90) and atmospheric constituents during solstice months, revealing a bottom-up control mechanism of “upwelling–H2O(H)–O3(O)–T90” in the two hemispheres. First, summer polar upwelling transports H2O upward, which is then transported toward the winter hemisphere by meridional winds. Subsequently, the hydration increases H via photolysis and depletes O3 in the winter hemisphere through H-driven catalytic loss. The O varies in pace with O3 due to chemical equilibrium, and the radiative and chemical heating by O/O3 reactions reduces the T90 in the winter hemisphere (T90W). Second, upwelling-induced cooling promotes polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) formation, with ice particle growth blocking H2O transport and dehydrating heights above PMCs. This dehydration reduces H abundance, thereby decreasing H-driven O3 loss. Meanwhile, the colder temperatures directly increase O3 through ozone kinetics. The enhanced O3, together with the coupled O, collectively increase the summer polar temperatures above 90 km (T90S). This anti-phase interannual variability between hemispheres, mediated by PMC microphysics and H2O-O3 chemistry, establishes summer polar upwelling as a fundamental driver of mesospheric climate and highlights the importance of dynamical-chemical coupling in the upper mesosphere."

In this paper, a two-step bias correction scheme is established based on radiation observations of HIRAS-II (Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder-II) carried on FY-3E. 
 Meteorological satellite data have been extensively utilized in global numerical weather prediction systems and have a positive impact to improve forecast accuracy. In order to correctly assimilate satellite radiance observations in data assimilation systems, the systematic observation biases must be corrected to conform to a Gaussian normal distribution with a mean of 0. By selecting appropriate air-mass predictors through correlation assessment, a two-step bias correction scheme (namely the scan-angle bias correction and the air-mass bias correction) is established in this paper based on radiance observations of FY-3E/ HIRAS-II from 1 to 31 January 2023. The results indicate that FY-3E/HIRAS-II O−B (observation-simulation) bias exhibits scanning angle bias dependence from nadir to limb field of view. Statistics have found that this scanning angle bias does not depend on latitude band. After scan-angle bias correction using statistical scan-angle correction coefficients, the dependence of the O−B biases on the scan angle can be eliminated. The second step is to perform air-mass correction. Our correction scheme is compared with the air-mass bias correction scheme in NCEP-GSI. Although the scan angle influence is also considered in NECP-GSI scheme, it does not account for the water vapor effect in the atmosphere. Consequently, the correction effect is not good for channels with lower peak height of weighting function, resulting in a slightly residual positive bias after correction. The combination of air-mass predictors (model surface skin temperature, model total column water vapor, thickness of 1000–300 hPa, and thickness of 200–50 hPa) selected through importance assessment in this study effectively eliminates the air-mass biases. The systematic biases between observed brightness temperature and background simulated brightness temperature from background atmospheric field for all HIRAS-II channels significantly decrease after bias correction, and the bias distribution essentially follows a Gaussian normal distribution with a mean of 0. The FY-3E/HIRAS-II data assimilation experiments show that the selected air-mass predictors (EXP-2 scheme) is the most effective among the four experiments. The mean O−B and O−A in all channels are the smallest after bias correction. Compared with the independent ERA5 objective analysis fields, the EXP-2 scheme has a significant improvement for the temperature analysis at upper air and near surface. The water vapor profiles of the EXP-2 scheme are the closest to ERA5 at almost all height levels."

Analyses at various scales showed a moderate overall correlation – stronger in suburban areas and weaker in urban zones. Correlations peaked in winter and autumn, likely due to stable weather. The findings suggest that satellite data can complement ground monitoring but require adjustments for regional and climatic variations. 
 Effective monitoring of air pollution is essential for the development of environmental and public health policies. Comprehensive air quality management requires precise tools and strategies to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants. This study investigates the correlation between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations detected by the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5p) satellite and those measured at ground stations by Catalonia's official air quality monitoring network during 2022 and 2023. The methodology integrates satellite and surface data aligned in space and time. The relationship between both measurements is analyzed under different frameworks: (i) global, considering the entire territory; (ii) by geographic zone (urban, suburban, and rural, as well as inside and outside the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA)); (iii) according to the type of stations (traffic, background, industrial); and (iv) at a seasonal level, covering different quarters of the year. Statistical tools are then used to identify patterns and differences based on zones, typology, and seasonality characteristics. The results show a moderate positive correlation at the global level, with r=0.66. By zones, the analysis reveals that suburban (r=0.66) and non-BMA zones (r=0.67) present stronger correlations compared to urban zones (r=0.55), traffic typology (r=0.61), or stations located in the BMA zone (r=0.42). Seasonally, the correlation peaks in winter (r=0.70) and autumn (r=0.66), periods with more stable atmospheric conditions for NO2 concentrations, while it is lowest in spring (r=0.61) and summer (r=0.57). These findings highlight the utility of the S5p satellite as a complement to ground-based networks in NO2 monitoring, while revealing the limitations of applying a direct relationship between both types of data at the regional level and across different geographic zones."

Complete data fusion (CDF) is an a posteriori method used so far to combine only one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric products (vertical profiles) related to the same or nearby geolocations  from simultaneous and independent remote sensing observations. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of the CDF algorithm to two-dimensional (2D) products and show its first application to simulated ozone datasets from the future Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer New Generation (IASI-NG) mission and the Changing-Atmosphere Infrared Tomography (CAIRT) ESA’s Earth Explorer 11 candidate mission, in nadir- and limb-viewing observational geometry, respectively. We present the analysis of the performance of the CDF in three (one 1D and two 2D) case studies considering different configurations for the acquisitions of the two sensors, evaluating for each the number of degrees of freedom, the Shannon information content, the total errors and the spatial resolution. Furthermore, we quantitatively compare the 1D-CDF and 2D-CDF performances, demonstrating that the exploitation of tomographic capabilities of atmospheric sensors allows advanced data fusion techniques, like 2D CDF, to maximize the information extracted from complementary datasets."

The correction improves measurement accuracy by reducing Doppler velocity biases to within 5 and 7 cm s−1. Our results demonstrate the importance of continuous pointing characterization to maintain the scientific accuracy of EarthCARE’s CPR Doppler observations. 
 The Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission, a joint effort between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), aims to advance our understanding of aerosols, clouds, precipitation, and radiation using a comprehensive payload of active and passive sensors. A key component of the payload is the 94 GHz cloud profiling radar (CPR), which provides the first-ever Doppler velocity measurements collected from space. Accurate knowledge of the CPR antenna pointing is essential for ensuring high-quality CPR Doppler velocity measurements. This study focuses on the geolocation assessment and antenna mispointing corrections during EarthCARE's commissioning phase and beyond, using Earth's surface Doppler velocity measurements collected over the first 9 months of the mission. While the instrument footprint is proven to be properly geolocated within about 100 m, surface Doppler velocity observations reveal mispointing trends influenced by solar illumination cycles and thermoelastic distortions on the antenna. Correcting these effects significantly reduces biases, ensuring better Doppler velocity measurements, essential for understanding cloud microphysics and dynamics. The results, validated through the analysis of Doppler velocities in ice clouds, underline the critical role of pointing corrections for the success of the EarthCARE mission."

Our method used diverse sky images taken from various locations across the globe to train our machine learning model. We achieved a very high accuracy in detecting cloud cover, even in polluted areas. Our model surpasses traditional methods by running efficiently with minimal computational needs. 
 Cloud fraction (CF) is an integral aspect of weather and radiation forecasting, but real time monitoring of CF is still inaccurate, expensive and exclusive to commercial sky imagers. Traditional cloud segmentation methods, which often rely on empirically determined threshold values, struggle under complex atmospheric and cloud conditions. This study investigates the use of a Random Forest (RF) classifier for pixel-wise cloud segmentation using a dataset of semantically annotated images from five geographically diverse locations. The RF model was trained on diverse sky conditions and atmospheric loads, ensuring robust performance across varied environments. The accuracy score was always above 85 % for all the locations along with similarly high F1 score and Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) score establishing the efficiency of the model. Validation experiments conducted at three Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites and two Indian locations, including Gadanki and Merak, demonstrated that the RF classifier outperformed conventional Total Sky Imager (TSI) methods, particularly in high-pollution areas. The model effectively captured long-term weather and cloud patterns, exhibiting strong location-agnostic performance. However, challenges in distinguishing sun glares and cirrus clouds due to annotation limitations were noted. Despite these minor issues, the RF classifier shows significant promise for accurate and adaptable cloud cover estimation, making it a valuable tool in climate studies."

After integrating simulations into data from 2 different satellite missions, we extract the probability of detection. We compare our results with real plumes, which shows the consistency of the models. Detection and monitoring efforts can be optimized by filtering data based on these results, reducing unnecessary searches and increasing the action taken on these emissions. 
 The offshore oil and gas industry is an important contributor to global anthropogenic methane emissions. Satellite-based, high-resolution imaging spectrometers are showing a great potential for the detection of methane emissions over land. However, the use of the same methods over offshore oil and gas extraction basins is challenged by the low reflectance of water in the near- and shortwave infrared spectral windows used for methane retrievals. This limitation can be partly alleviated by data acquisitions under the so-called sun glint configuration, which enhances the at-sensor radiance. In this work, we assess the performance of two space-based imaging spectrometers, EnMAP and EMIT, for the detection of offshore methane plumes applying the matched filter method. We use simulated plumes to generate parametric probability of detection (POD) models for a range of emission flux rates (Q), at-sensor radiances and wind speeds. The POD models were confronted with real plume detections for the two instruments. Our analysis shows that the spatial resolution of the instrument and the at-sensor radiance (which drives the retrieval precision) are the two factors with the greatest impact on plume POD. We also evaluate the dependence of the at-sensor radiance on the illumination-observation geometry and the surface roughness. Our POD models properly represent the different trade-offs between spatial resolution and retrieval precision in EnMAP and EMIT. As an example, for most combinations of Q and wind speed values at POD = 50 %, EMIT demonstrates better detection performance at Q>7 t h−1, whereas EnMAP performs better at Q<7 t h−1. This study demonstrates the ability of these two satellite instruments to detect high-emitting offshore point sources under a range of different conditions. By filtering data based on these conditions, methane emission detection and monitoring efforts can be optimized, reducing unnecessary searches and ultimately increasing the action taken on these emissions."

We also conduct a comparison of dust CCN concentration profiles derived using both POLIPHON and the independent Optical Modelling of the CALIPSO Aerosol Microphysics (OMCAM) retrieval. 
 Mineral dust is abundant in the atmosphere. To assess its climate impact, it is essential to obtain information on the three-dimensional distribution of cloud condensation nucleation (CCN) and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations related to mineral dust. The POlarization LIdar PHOtometer Networking (POLIPHON) method uses aerosol-type-dependent conversion factors to transform lidar-derived aerosol optical parameters into CCN- and INP-relevant microphysical parameters. We present a global dataset of conversion factors at 532 nm obtained using Aerosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations at 137 sites for INP and 123 sites for CCN calculations. Dust presence is identified using a column-integrated dust ratio threshold of 80 %, derived from the AERONET columnar particle linear depolarization ratio at 1020 nm. INP-relevant conversion factors (c250,d, cs,d, and cs,100,d) exhibit distinct regional patterns, generally lower near deserts and increasing downstream from dust sources. CCN-relevant conversion factors (c100,d and χd) display significant site-to-site variation. A comparison of dust-related particle concentration profiles derived using both POLIPHON and the independent Optical Modelling of the CALIPSO Aerosol Microphysics (OMCAM) retrieval shows that profiles generally agree within an order of magnitude. This result is consistent with the respective retrieval uncertainties and corroborates the usefulness of lidar observations for inferring dust-related CCN and INP concentration profiles."

Existing datasets often miss night-time burning and how smoke rises in the atmosphere. We created an open dataset for 2023 that records fire emissions every hour in three dimensions at high resolution. By combining satellite data and machine learning, it improves understanding of when and where smoke is released and supports better forecasts and policy decisions. 
 Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of atmospheric pollutants in Southeast and East Asia (SEA), yet most existing emission inventories lack accurate diurnal cycles and vertical injection profiles, limiting the accuracy of air quality and climate simulations. This study develops the Southeast and East Asia Fire (SEAF) inventory, an hourly 3 km three-dimensional (3D) emission dataset for 2023, by fusing fire radiative power (FRP) from Himawari-8/9 AHI and VIIRS through cloud correction, cross-calibration, and a region–vegetation-specific Gaussian diurnal reconstruction with dynamic gap filling. Vertical profiles are further constrained using a random forest (RF) – Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework trained with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) smoke plume heights (SPH) and ERA5 meteorology. The SEAF inventory exhibited strong consistency with TROPOMI CO, showing a correlation of R = 0.97 in monthly columns and differing by only 7.81 % during a representative event on 9 March 2023. Annual PM2.5 emissions in SEAF are approximately 2362 Gg y-1, which is 67 % lower than the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) but aligns well with the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEER) and the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED) estimates. The RF–SHAP framework successfully predicted SPH, with over 90 % of estimates within ± 500 m. This approach corrects the near-surface overweighting of conventional schemes by reducing emissions below 0.3 km and enhancing injection between 2.7–5.5 km during the spring burning peak, yielding vertical profiles that closely align with satellite observations. SHAP analysis identified temperature- and radiation-related factors, particularly the vertical integral of temperature (Vit) and terrain elevation, as the primary drivers of SPH, with additional contributions from FRP, planetary boundary layer height, and seasonal–meteorological interactions. These advances in both diurnal timing and vertical injection are anticipated to provide an observation-driven, hourly 3D BB emission dataset for SEA that can improve the reliability of air quality, climate, and policy assessment models."

Zerefos,Assessment of the accuracy in UV index modelling using the UVIOS2 system during the UVC-III campaign,"The UVIOS2 model has been evaluated at Davos, Switzerland during the UVCIII campaign. The accuracy in the modelled UV indices has been assessed for different combinations of model inputs. A good overall agreement between UVIOS2 and the world reference spectroradiometer QASUME was found (average ratio of ~ 1 between the modelled and measured UV index), although the variability in the ratio can be large under cloudy conditions. 
 The third campaign for the calibration and intercomparison of solar UV radiometers (UVC III) took place at Davos, Switzerland in June–August 2022. More than 70 radiometers participated in the campaign and measured side-by-side with the portable reference spectroradiometer QASUME. The UVIOS2 system is a flexible UVI modelling tool that can be exploited for different applications depending on the inputs. Thus, different combinations of satellite, reanalysis, and/or ground-based inputs were used to test the UVIOS2 performance when it is used as a tool for UVI nowcasting or for climatological studies. While UVIOS2 provided quite accurate estimates of the average (for the period of the campaign) UVI levels, larger deviations were found for individual estimates. The average agreement between the UVI from the UVIOS2 and QASUME was better than 1 % for all the different sets of inputs that were used for the study. The range of the variability was of the order of 40 % for instantaneous measurements (15 min), mainly due to the model's inability to capture the instantaneous effects of cloudiness, especially under broken cloud conditions. Under clear-sky conditions the model was found to perform much better, with the differences between the model estimates and the QASUME measurements being smaller than 12 % for 95 % of the studied cases. Even at the pristine environment of Davos, single scattering albedo (SSA) was found to contribute significantly to the modelling uncertainties under cloudless conditions. For Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) of the order of 0.2–0.4 at 550 nm, the role of the SSA was found to be comparable to the role of AOD in the modelling of the UVI."

Atmospheric CO2 concentration data are a valuable source of information that can be used to improve the accuracy of these models. In this study, we present a statistical ensemble-variational data assimilation method named EnVarDA to calibrate parameters of a land surface model using these data. We show that this method is easy to implement and more efficient and accurate than traditional methods. 
 A comprehensive understanding and accurate modelling of the terrestrial carbon cycle are of paramount importance to improve projections of the global carbon cycle and more accurately gauge its impact on global climate systems. Land surface models, which have become an important component of weather and climate applications, simulate key aspects of the terrestrial carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration. These models rely on parameterisations that require careful calibration. In this study we explore the assimilation of atmospheric CO2 concentration data for parameter calibration of the ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms (ORCHIDEE) land surface model using an EnVarDA method, an adjoint-free ensemble-variational data assimilation method. By circumventing the challenges associated with developing and maintaining tangent linear and adjoint models, the EnVarDA method offers a very promising alternative. Using synthetic observations generated through a twin experiment, we demonstrate the ability of EnVarDA to assimilate atmospheric CO2 concentrations for model parameter calibration. We then compare the results to a VarDA method that uses finite differences to estimate tangent linear and adjoint models, which reveals that EnVarDA is superior in terms of computational efficiency, fit to the observations, and parameter recovery."

 Atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) models are useful tools to increase our understanding of the physical interactions and processes occurring in the atmosphere and surface. In the category of free and open-source models, the library for radiative transfer (libRadtran) is a widely used and versatile package. However, running high-resolution calculations with libRadtran is often tedious since libRadtran does not include all the required information to run line-by-line executions (i.e., resolving individual spectral lines of gases) in a flexible way under specific atmospheric conditions, meaning that external software is required. This poses a problem for a user since generating necessary files for libRadtran requires familiarity with the topic of molecular spectroscopy in addition to knowing how to use the external software, which may not be tailored for producing libRadtran-compatible files. In this paper, we present HAPI2LIBIS, a compact software tool intended to be used in close connection with libRadtran to enable easy high-resolution calculations. HAPI2LIBIS streamlines the generation of high-resolution molecular absorption data for libRadtran by utilizing the latest version of the High-Resolution Transmission Molecular Absorption (HITRAN) database and the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI) with user-specified spectral ranges and atmospheric profiles. HAPI2LIBIS also stores computed absorption cross-sections in its dynamically constructed lookup table and includes an option for pressure- and temperature-dependent interpolation in order to accelerate subsequent simulations."

Here we use tropospheric HCHO retrievals from the Pandonia Global Network (PGN), combined with NASA's GEOS Composition Forecast (GEOS‐CF) model to understand the diurnal variation of summertime HCHO across the contiguous US. While PGN HCHO tropospheric column (HCHOtrop) shows a weak diurnal cycle in most regions, a distinct midday peak is found at the urban sites of Southern US (mainly in Houston), likely driven by highly reactive VOC emissions. For the vertical profile of HCHO mixing ratio within the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), PGN shows a significant decrease from 0.5 to 2 km while GEOS‐CF exhibits an excessively well‐mixed vertical shape. This discrepancy in HCHO profile leads to an overestimated HCHOtrop in GEOS‐CF in Northeast Coastal US and Southeast US.

EMeRGe airborne observation can identify the suitability of emission inventories used in the CMAQv5.0.2 model for Asian polluted regions. GFEDv4.1s is suitable for fire emissions. Anthropogenic BC and CO emissions from the Philippines (REASv2.1) are insufficient. The estimated Chinese emissions in 2018 are 0.65±0.25 TgBC, 166±65 TgCO, and 12.4±4.8 PgCO2, suggesting a reduction and increment for China's BC and CO emissions in the HTAPv2.2z inventory. 
 Accurate estimates of short-lived climate forcer emissions are essential for effective climate change mitigation, yet large uncertainties remain across Asia. This study integrates the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality version 5.0.2 (WRF/CMAQv5.0.2) simulations with Effect of Megacities on the Transport and Transformation of Pollutants at Regional and Global Scales (EMeRGe) airborne observations from spring 2018 to refine combustion-related emissions of black carbon (BC) and CO over East Asia. Aircraft observations, which are less affected by near-surface processes, confirmed the accuracy of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4.1s) inventory near Thailand. In contrast, anthropogenic BC and CO from the Regional Emission Inventory for Asia (REASv2.1) in the Philippines showed negative biases. For Chinese air masses, the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution with corrections (HTAPv2.2z) resulted in overestimation for BC and underestimation for CO, agreeing with our prior ground-based findings on Fukue Island. Scaling Chinese BC emissions using an observation/model ratio (0.48 ± 0.13) gave our best estimate of 0.65 ± 0.25 Tg BC yr−1. Chinese emissions were further estimated at 166 ± 65 Tg CO yr−1 and 12.4 ± 4.8 Pg CO2 yr−1 using the BC/CO and CO/CO2 ratios from observations. These results suggest HTAPv2.2z requires revisions of 50 % downward for BC and 20 % upward for CO, particularly over central East China during spring. Other inventories including Community Emissions Data System (CEDSv2021_02_05) remain notably biased, while Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSEv6b) and Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis (TCR2) estimates fall within our identified uncertainty ranges."
10.5194/acp-25-13299-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注对流层臭氧的辐射强迫估算，利用IAGOS飞机观测数据和离线辐射模型，评估了不同时间段（1994-2004年作为基准，对比2011-2016年、2017-2019年和2020-2023年）的对流层臭氧趋势和气候影响。研究发现，对流层臭氧水平的增长趋势逐渐停止，甚至在高层对流层有所下降，相应的，年代际臭氧辐射强迫也在逐渐减小。该研究强调了臭氧垂直分布对对流层臭氧辐射强迫的重要性。由于涉及大气成分（臭氧）的监测和分析，以及气候变化这一环境应用，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'radiative forcing', 'IAGOS aircraft observations', 'tropospheric ozone column', 'ozone vertical profiles', 'climate change', 'air quality']",Pasquale Sellitto;Audrey Gaudel;Bastien Sauvage,Decadal tropospheric ozone radiative forcing estimations with offline radiative modelling and IAGOS aircraft observations,"Tropospheric ozone is a potent greenhouse gas: its anthropogenic levels rise contributes to climate change. We evaluate tropospheric ozone trends and climate impacts with aircraft data and a radiative model, comparing a baseline period (1994–2004) to different recent time periods (2011–2016 to 2020-2023). Tropospheric ozone levels increasing trends progressively stopped and even decreased in the upper troposphere. Correspondingly, the decadal ozone radiative forcing is progressively decreasing. 
 We use an offline radiative transfer model driven by IAGOS aircraft observations to estimate the tropospheric ozone radiative forcing (RF) at decadal time scale (three time intervals with a common starting period in 1994–2004 and ending periods: 2011–2016, 2017–2019 and 2020–2023), over 11 selected Northern Hemispheric regions. We found a positive trend in the tropospheric ozone column (TOC) for the three time intervals, even if decadal trends are progressively reduced from 2011–2016 (ΔTOC +3.6 ± 2.0 DU, +14.8 ± 11.5 %, 2.5 ± 1.4 DU per decade) to 2017–2019 (ΔTOC +3.9 ± 3.9 DU, +17.5 ± 22.1 %, 2.0 ± 2.0 DU per decade) to 2020–2023 (ΔTOC +3.5 ± 2.8 DU, +13.8 ± 12.1 %, 1.5 ± 1.2 DU per decade). The progressively reduced average TOC decadal trends in 2020–2023 and 2017–2019, with respect to 2011–2016, originate from stagnation in ΔTOC in more recent time intervals (especially in the COVID and post-COVID crisis periods) and decreases of trends of the more radiative efficient upper tropospheric ozone. These average trend reductions are accompanied with reductions of the tropospheric ozone RF, from 2011–2016 (41.6 ± 24.0 mW m−2 per decade) to 2017–2019 (27.6 ± 36.7 mW m−2 per decade) to 2020–2023 (14.6 ± 25.6 mW m−2 per decade). The total tropospheric ozone RF sensitivity varies between 18.4 ± 7.4 mW m−2 DU−1, in 2011–2016, and 11.1 ± 10.4 mW m−2 DU−1, in 2020–2023. Our decadal RF estimates vary from being ∼ 25 %–90 % larger (2011–2016 and 2017–2019 ending periods) to ∼ 30 % smaller (2020–2023 ending period) than the most recent global average RF estimates with online modelling. Our study underlines the importance of the evolution of ozone vertical profiles for the tropospheric ozone RF."

We find that climate models represent the observed shift to smaller, more numerous cloud droplets well. However, climate models diverge in their aerosol-induced changes to large-scale cloud properties, particularly cloud liquid water content. Our study shows that Holuhraun had a cooling effect on the Earth. 
 Aerosols significantly influence Earth's radiative balance, yet considerable uncertainty exists in the underpinning mechanisms, particularly those involving clouds. Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are the most uncertain element in anthropogenic radiative forcing, hampering our ability to constrain Earth's climate sensitivity and understand future climate change. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption in Iceland released sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower troposphere on a level comparable to continental-scale emissions. The resultant volcanic plume across an often near-pristine region of the northern North Atlantic Ocean presents an ideal opportunistic experiment to explore ACI representation within general circulation models (GCMs). We present Part 2 of a two-part AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models) Phase III inter-model comparison study that utilises satellite remote sensing observations to assess modelled cloud responses to the Holuhraun attributed volcanic aerosol within eight state-of-the-art GCMs during September and October 2014. We isolate the aerosol effect from meteorological variability and find that the GCMs – particularly their multi-model ensemble response – adeptly capture the observed cloud microphysical changes associated with the ACI first indirect effect (i.e. Twomey effect). Meanwhile, a clear divergence exists in the GCM responses of large-scale cloud properties, namely cloud liquid water content, expected from the precipitation suppression mechanism of the ACI second indirect effect (i.e. rapid adjustments). We attribute this to limitations and differences in their autoconversion schemes under high aerosol loading, specifically in sub-grid-variability  representations. Finally, our multi-model ensemble estimates that Holuhraun had a global radiative forcing of −0.11 ± 0.04 Wm−2 across September and October 2014."

Davis;Klaus Keller;Sha Feng,Application of PRIM for understanding patterns in carbon dioxide model-observation differences,"We apply the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) technique to airborne CO2 and meteorological data to better understand atmospheric conditions and implications for carbon dioxide model-observation-mismatches. We found PRIM is capable of separating observations from different seasons and levels based on atmospheric conditions. Large magnitude carbon dioxide model-observation-differences were associated with non-typical atmospheric conditions, with implications for transport model evaluation. 
 Reducing uncertainties in regional carbon balances requires a better understanding of CO2 transport in synoptic weather systems. Here, we apply the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), a data-mining method to identify high-density regions for a target-class within an input parameter space, to airborne observations of potential temperature, wind speed, water vapor mixing ratio, and CO2 dry mol fraction gathered during the Atmospheric Carbon and Transport (ACT)-America Summer 2016 and Winter 2017 campaigns. ACT observations were targeted at expert-designated cases of fair weather and near-frontal warm and cold sector air at atmospheric boundary-layer, lower-, and higher free tropospheric levels (ABL, LFT, and HFT, respectively).We investigate atmospheric characteristics of these pre-defined cases and associated CO2 model-observation-differences in the mesoscale WRF-Chem model. PRIM results separate winter- and summertime observations as well as observations from ABL, LFT, and HFT with enrichment factors of 4.0–20.5 inside the PRIM box compared to the entire dataset but cannot distinguish between near-frontal warm and cold sector observations in the higher free troposphere. Analyzing of the parameter space constrained by PRIM, we find that large magnitude model observation differences preferentially associated with times when atmospheric conditions are less typical. This association suggests that PRIM could provide a useful tool for isolating atmospheric conditions with large-magnitude and non-Gaussian CO2-residuals for targeted transport model evaluation and to potentially improve inversion results during synoptically active periods."
10.5194/acp-25-13343-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了平流层准两年振荡(QBO)对厄尔尼诺-南方涛动(ENSO)与华北平原PM2.5浓度之间关系的非线性影响。研究发现，在东风QBO期间，ENSO对PM2.5的影响更强。厄尔尼诺和东风QBO年份，PM2.5浓度因不利气象条件而上升；反之，拉尼娜和东风QBO年份，PM2.5水平下降。研究将这些变化归因于行星波动力学。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究的PM2.5浓度、大气环流、气象因素等都与大气环境遥感监测密切相关，例如可以通过卫星观测PM2.5浓度，分析大气成分和气象条件。,"['PM2.5', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Circulation', 'ENSO', 'QBO', 'Planetary Waves', 'Meteorological Factors']",Xiadong An;Wen Chen;Tianjiao Ma;Lifang Sheng,Nonlinear effects of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation on ENSO modulating PM2.5 over the North China Plain in early winter,"Air pollution in the North China Plain is tends to be influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). During El Niño and easterly QBO, pollution rises, while La Niña and easterly QBO improve air quality through changes in atmospheric circulation and weather conditions. 
 The North China Plain (NCP) experiences severe air pollution, with PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm) as the primary pollutant, especially in early winter (November to December). The PM2.5 concentrations in this period are significantly modulated by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this study, we have found that the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) exerts a nonlinear impact on the relationship between ENSO and PM2.5 concentrations over the NCP in early winter. During the easterly QBO (EQBO) phase, ENSO's influence on PM2.5 concentration is stronger compared to the westerly QBO (WQBO) phase. In El Niño and EQBO years, PM2.5 concentrations rise due to meteorological factors like a shallower boundary layer, higher relative humidity, and intensified southerly wind anomalies. Conversely, during La Niña and EQBO years, PM2.5 levels decrease due to opposite meteorological conditions. The study attributes these changes to planetary wave dynamics. During El Niño and EQBO years, upward-propagating planetary waves in mid-latitudes enhance upper-level divergence over Eurasia, strengthening westerlies. These westerlies guide Rossby wave trains into Northeast Asia, forming a strong anomalous anticyclone that worsens air pollution over the NCP. In La Niña and EQBO years, downward-propagating planetary waves induce divergence in sub-polar regions, strengthening westerlies that facilitate La Niña-related wave trains. These wave trains trigger cyclonic circulation over Northeast Asia, improving air quality in the NCP. These findings underscore the complex interplay between ENSO, QBO, and atmospheric dynamics in shaping regional air pollution."

Both the lidar ratio (LR) and the depolarization ratio (DPR) exhibit an asymptotic trend with dust particle size. Two parameterization schemes were developed: one to estimate the DPR of a single dust particle given its size and the other to estimate the DPR of dust particles with a lognormal particle size distribution given the effective radius. 
 The lidar backscattering properties of Asian dust particles, namely the lidar ratio (S) and backscattering depolarization ratio (δ), were studied using a discrete dipole approximation (DDA) model. The three-dimensional morphology of the dust particles was reconstructed in fine detail using the focused ion beam (FIB) tomography technique. An index based on the symmetry of the scattering matrix was developed to assess the convergence of random orientation computation using DDA. Both S and δ exhibit an asymptotic trend with dust particle size: the S initially decreases, while the δ increases with size, before both approach their asymptotic values. The lidar properties were found to have statistically insignificant dependence on effective sphericity. The presence of strongly absorbing minerals, such as magnetite, can greatly reduce the dust's single-scattering albedo and δ. Utilizing the robust asymptotic trend behavior, two parameterization schemes were developed: one to estimate the δ of a single dust particle given its size and the other to estimate the δ of dust particles with a lognormal particle size distribution given the effective radius. The parameterization scheme was compared with results based on the TAMUdust2020 database, showing hexahedrons to reasonably represent realistic geometries with similar physical properties."

We studied oxygenated organic molecules, key intermediates, in a complex urban environment in China. Using an advanced analytical method, we identified major chemical pathways and how environmental factors influence them. Our findings enhance the understanding of atmospheric chemistry, offering insights for better environmental and climate policies. 
 Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), which are low-volatility intermediates produced via volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation, play a critical role in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation through gas-to-particle conversion. Despite recent advancements in OOM characterization, the high complexity of OOM spectra poses a significant challenge in the interpretation of their sources. This study investigates OOM formation in a Chinese megacity using an improved analytical strategy that integrates binned positive matrix factorization (PMF) on multiple subrange mass spectral analysis. Unlike traditional approaches that handle mass spectral peak identification and chemical interpretation sequentially, our method simultaneously optimizes both, reducing uncertainties associated with peak assignment and chemical analysis. The method successfully identified 2571 OOM molecules and systematically revealed major OOM formation pathways through 11 distinct factors: five daytime photochemical processes, four nighttime NO3-driven oxidation processes and two regional mixed sources. Notably, this approach enabled the successful separation of sesquiterpene oxidation products in ambient measurements – compounds previously unidentified by traditional full-mass-range analysis owing to their weak signals. The method captured dynamic changes in OOM composition under varying environmental conditions, demonstrating the influence of temperature and NOx levels on OOM formation, as well as the volatility-dependent patterns influenced by condensation sink (CS). This improved analytical strategy provides new insights into atmospheric OOM chemistry and establishes a robust foundation for future studies of VOC–OOM–SOA conversion mechanisms."

Shonkwiler;Anna Hodshire;Daniel Zimmerle,Evaluating the feasibility of using downwind methods to quantify point source oil and gas emissions using continuously monitoring fence-line sensors,"Accurate methane quantification from oil and gas sites is critical for reliable reporting and climate assessments. This study tested downwind models using point sensors. A non-standard eddy covariance (EC) failed due to instrumentation issues, while the Gaussian plume inverse model (GPIM) and backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLs) model gave more reliable results. The bLs was the most accurate for single sources, with the best performance at 15 min averaging and 5° wind sectors. 
 The dependable reporting of methane (CH4) emissions from point sources, such as fugitive leaks from oil and gas infrastructure, is important for profit maximization (retaining more hydrocarbons), evaluating climate impacts, assessing CH4 fees for regulatory programs, and validating CH4 intensity in differentiated gas programs. Currently, there are disagreements between emissions reported by different quantification techniques for the same sources. It has been suggested that downwind CH4 quantification methods using CH4 measurements on the fence line of production facilities could be used to generate emission estimates from oil and gas operations at the site level, but it is currently unclear how accurate the quantified emissions are. To investigate the accuracy of downwind methods, this study uses fence-line simulated data collected during controlled-release experiments as input for a non-standard closed-path eddy covariance (EC), the Gaussian plume inverse model (GPIM), and the backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLs) model in a range of atmospheric conditions. This study's EC attempt was unsuccessful due to data collection and instrumentation issues, resulting in invalid results characterized by underestimated emissions, large negative fluxes, and cospectra/ogives that deviated from their ideal shapes. Consequently, the EC results could not be compared with the GPIM and bLS model. The bLs model demonstrated the highest accuracy for single-release single-point emissions, though it exhibited greater uncertainty than GPIM under multi-release conditions. Across the GPIM and bLs model, the most reliable quantification was achieved with 15 min averaging and a narrow 5° wind sector range. Although EC was limited in this context, future studies should consider employing a standard EC system and further optimizing GPIM and bLs approaches – particularly for complex multi-source scenarios – to enhance quantification accuracy and reduce uncertainty."

 Large amounts of spaceborne hyperspectral imagery with high spectral and spatial resolution have been acquired in recent years, enabling extensive applications across various fields. Accurate spectral and radiometric calibration is the foundation for the quantitative use of these data. However, most existing approaches conduct spectral and radiometric calibrations independently, allowing errors in one process to propagate into the other and degrade overall accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm for the simultaneous calibration of spectral and radiometric parameters in spaceborne hyperspectral imagers. The method jointly estimates both sets of parameters by modeling the relationship between measured and simulated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance. Validation using MODTRAN-based synthetic datasets demonstrated high calibration accuracy, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) below 0.24 nm and 0.33 nm for the center wavelength and full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the visible–near-infrared (VNIR) band, and below 0.34 nm and 0.35 nm in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band. The derived radiometric calibration coefficients yielded mean relative errors (MREs) within 0.25 % for VNIR and 2.80 % for SWIR. Application to the Chinese ZY1E/AHSI hyperspectral sensor confirmed stable on-orbit performance, with minimal wavelength drift and bandwidth variation. Cross-comparison with Landsat-8/OLI TOA radiance indicated that the proposed method improved radiometric accuracy, reducing relative errors to within 10 %. The derived surface reflectance showed excellent agreement with in-situ measurements, with average relative errors below 3 % and 1 % in the VNIR and SWIR bands, respectively. Sensitivity analyses under varying observation geometry, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and water vapor content (WVC) further verified the robustness and reliability of the proposed simultaneous calibration framework for operational hyperspectral applications."

Temporal disaggregation shows strong associations between methane enhancements and environmental drivers, including PM2.5, NO2, CO, OH concentrations, temperature, and NDVI. Fossil fuel–related emissions increase with pollutant accumulation and low OH availability, while waste-related emissions exhibit temperature sensitivity and weak vegetation coupling. The spatial distribution of CH4 enhancements also varies with season and meteorology, indicating the need for region-specific emission mitigation strategies. This work provides a high-resolution CH4 inversion approach and highlights the importance of integrating atmospheric chemistry and environmental feedback in methane source attribution at the urban scale."

 In this study, 12-h quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) by a cloud-resolving model for six heavy-rainfall events selected from the Mei-yu seasons (May–June) of 2016–2019 in Taiwan are examined. For each case, 30 forecasts from five experiments were made at six lead times 12 h apart (up to 60 h) using different initial fields, some with data assimilation (DA) of those on the Global Telecommunication System (GTS data) and GTS data plus sounding retrievals from polar-orbiting satellite (SAT data) to study their impacts on QPFs.Among these six cases, three occurred when strong prefrontal southwesterly flow at low levels impinged on the island (SWF cases), with rainfall maxima of 193–307 mm in mountain interiors in southern Taiwan. For these SWF cases, the predictability was relatively high, and the QPFs also benefited from initial fields produced using a finer grid. Around 70 % of instances, the DA of additional data also exhibited positive impacts on QPFs, both over the entire Taiwan and at local rainfall centers. In the other three cases, Mei-yu fronts were present near Taiwan and heavy rainfall (peaking at 227–635 mm) from organized convective systems occurred over low-lying plains as well. Due to the high nonlinearity of deep convection, the predictability of such events was much lower with less-ideal overall performance. While the overall gain was only minimal, better QPFs for the frontal cases were still achievable at roughly 1/3 of times through DA, particularly when key information near Taiwan was ingested, typically immediately upstream from the heavy rainfall region."

 Cloud water, as a key component of clouds, plays a critical role in cloud-related processes such as precipitation and radiation. However, some early satellite observation datasets exhibit some inaccuracies in distinguishing cloud water phases. This paper aims to obtain more accurate cloud water data for earlier years. To achieve this, machine learning schemes are developed to predict the global monthly mean ice water fraction (IWF). These predictions are based on CloudSat-CALIPSO satellite observations, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) dataset and the fifth-generation Earth Reanalysis Atmospheric (ERA5) reanalysis data. Four machine learning algorithms are used: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The results show that all four schemes achieve high predictive accuracy on the test set. However, LGB outperforms in computational efficiency, and is selected for the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and final long-term reconstruction. A new metric is defined by integrating coefficient of determination (R2) and training time to comprehensively evaluate the performance of machine learning schemes called R2-Time score (RTS). SHAP analysis indicates that specific humidity, latitude, and relative humidity are the main factors influencing IWF prediction, and the LGB scheme's prediction mechanism aligns with physical expectation. The prediction mechanisms of the scheme do not exhibit strong temporal or spatial dependency. Ultimately, the study uses the LGB scheme to reconstruct global monthly mean IWF data from July 1983 to December 2009. The reconstructed IWF dataset successfully captures distinct annual cycles and reproduces the climatic variability observed in ISCCP and CloudSat-CALIPSO records, while simultaneously correcting the systematic biases in cloud-phase classification present in ISCCP. This study offers both improved historical datasets and methodological advances for investigations of cloud–climate interactions.Plain language summaryClouds have an important impact on radiation, precipitation, and the water cycle in the Earth-atmosphere system. As a key component of clouds, cloud water plays a decisive role in cloud formation and dissipation, precipitation, and radiation processes. However, early passive remote sensing satellite observations have errors in distinguishing cloud water phases. To obtain more accurate cloud water phase data, this study trains four machine learning schemes using multi-source data from CloudSat-CALIPSO, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and the fifth-generation Earth Reanalysis Atmospheric (ERA5) reanalysis data to predict ice water fraction (IWF): Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). We propose a new metric, R2-Time score (RTS), to comprehensively evaluate the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of machine learning schemes. Additionally, we verify the generalization ability of the machine learning schemes and evaluate the interpretability of the LGB scheme using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Finally, we reconstruct the global monthly mean IWF data from July 1983 to December 2009 using the LGB scheme, providing both data support and methodological reference for future cloud-climate feedback analysis and historical climate studies."

Freeman;Huanxin Zhang;Jun Wang;Shan-Hu Lee,Estimating surface sulfur dioxide concentrations from satellite data over eastern China: Using chemical transport models vs. machine learning,"Air pollutants like sulfur dioxide impact human health and the environment. Our work estimated surface sulfur dioxide concentrations from satellite data over eastern China. One method used atmospheric models, and another method used machine learning. We found that compared to measurements from an air quality monitoring network, both methods accurately captured the locations of sulfur dioxide, but the machine learning method was generally much more accurate in the estimated concentrations. 
 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important air pollutant that contributes to negative health effects, acid rain, and aerosol formation and growth. SO2 has been measured using ground-based air quality monitoring networks, but routine monitoring sites are predominantly in urban areas, leaving large gaps in the network in less populated locations. Previous studies have used chemical transport models (CTMs) or machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate surface SO2 concentrations from satellite vertical column densities, but their performance has never been directly compared. In this study, we estimated surface SO2 concentrations using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrievals over eastern China from 2015–2018 utilizing GEOS-Chem CTM simulations and an extreme gradient boosting ML model. For the first time, we quantified methodological uncertainties for both methods and directly compared their performance on the same truth dataset. The surface concentrations estimated from the CTM-based method had similar spatial distributions (r=0.58) and temporal variations compared to the in situ measurements but were underestimated (slope = 0.24; RPE = 75 %) and had worsening performance over time. The ML-based method produced more accurate spatial distributions (r = 0.77) and temporal variations with a smaller discrepancy (slope = 0.69; RPE = 30 %) and stable performance over time. Despite the higher accuracy of the ML-based method at the monitoring sites, the CTM-based method produced more reasonable gridded spatial distributions over areas without monitoring data. These results suggest that satellite data could be a reliable way to estimate global SO2 concentrations to parameterize other chemical processes in the atmosphere."

Carslaw;A. Robert MacKenzie;Zongbo Shi,Rethinking machine learning weather normalisation: a refined strategy for short-term air pollution policies,"Air pollution causes millions of deaths annually, driving policies to improve air quality. However, assessing these policies is challenging because weather changes can hide their true impact. We created a logical evaluation framework and found that a widely applied machine learning approach that adjusts for weather effects could underestimate the effectiveness of short-term policies, like emergency traffic controls. We proposed a refined approach that could largely reduce such underestimation. 
 Air pollution causes millions of premature deaths annually, driving widespread implementation of clean air interventions. Quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of such interventions is critical in air quality management. Machine learning-based weather normalization (ML-WN) has been employed to isolate meteorological influences from emission-drive changes; however, it has its own limitations, particularly when abrupt emission shifts occur, e.g., after an intervention. Here we developed a logical evaluation framework, based on paired observational datasets and a test of “ML algebra” (i.e., the “commutation” of a normalisation step), to show that ML-WN significantly underestimates the immediate effects of short-term interventions on nitrogen oxides (NOx), with discrepancies reaching up to 42 % for 1 week interventions. This finding challenges assumptions about the robustness of ML-WN for evaluating short-term policies, such as emergency traffic controls or episodic pollution events. We propose a refined approach (MacLeWN) that can reduce such underestimation biases by > 90 % in idealised but plausible cases studies. We applied both approaches to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on NOx as measured at Marylebone Road, London. For the 1 week period after the lockdown, ML-WN estimates approximately 17 % smaller NOx reductions compared to MacLeWN, and such underestimation diminishes as policy duration extends, decreasing to ∼ 10 % for 1 month and becoming insignificant after 3 months. Our findings indicate the importance of carefully selecting evaluation methodologies for air quality interventions, suggesting that ML-WN should be complemented or adjusted when assessing short-term policies. Increasing model interpretability is also crucial for generating trustworthy assessments and improving policy evaluations."

This study implemented an improved parameterization of BrC bleaching in a model with which BrC can survive much longer in cold, dry air, especially when lofted into the upper atmosphere by wildfires. The results reveal stronger warming effects and impacts on atmospheric oxidation, highlighting the need to consider BrC in climate and pollution control strategies. 
 Brown carbon (BrC), a light-absorbing component of organic aerosols, undergoes bleaching in the atmosphere, a process where its light absorption capacity diminishes over time due to chemical transformation. A recent study suggests that the lifetime of freshly emitted, unbleached BrC (referred to as fresh BrC) against bleaching (τBrC) is influenced by ambient temperature and relative humidity. In this study, we incorporate the improved τBrC parameterization into an atmospheric chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to assess its atmospheric chemical and radiative effects. Our results show that τBrC varies strongly with altitude, ranging from 1–10 h in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to over 100 h in the upper troposphere, where bleaching becomes negligible. Dry regions (e.g., northern Africa and South Asia) exhibit longer surface τBrC, while humid regions (e.g., the tropics) show shorter τBrC. The updated τBrC parameterization triples the global burden of fresh BrC compared to the baseline parameterization with uniform τBrC, increasing its effective lifetime from 0.45 to 1.45 d and amplifying the direct radiative effect (DRE) of BrC by 48 % (from +0.059 to +0.088 W m−2). Lofted wildfire emissions experience prolonged τBrC due to reduced bleaching in the free troposphere, underscoring the importance of fire injection height. Additionally, BrC absorption suppresses photochemical activity, reducing the photolysis rate of NO2 (JNO2) by up to 7.4 %, surface ozone by 0 %–2.5 %, and tropospheric OH by 0 %–6.9 %. These effects intensify during major wildfire events, such as the Siberian fires in 2019 that caused JNO2 and ozone to drop by 36.3 % and 17.5 %, respectively, highlighting BrC's role in perturbing atmospheric oxidation capacity."

 We investigate the feasibility of a satellite-borne heterodyne spectrometer for the retrieval of atomic oxygen concentration and temperature in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.

We then apply retrieval algorithms for the atomic oxygen concentration and temperature and compare the retrieved profiles to the reference, i.e. the original NRLMSIS 2.1 profiles. The emission spectra are simulated using radiative transfer under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium.By considering two separate heterodyne receivers with sensitivity of 11 000 and 25 000 K noise temperature for the 2.1 and 4.7 THz lines, respectively, and data accumulated over 177 s of measurement time, corresponding to a ground track of 1250 km, we can retrieve vertical temperature profiles from 100 km altitude to 200 km altitude within ±2 % relative uncertainties and an atomic oxygen concentration profile from 110 to 300 km within ±3 % relative uncertainties.

 This study presents the development of an automated aerosol typing model utilizing Mie–Raman–fluorescence lidar data collected by LILAS (Lille Lidar for Atmospheric Study), located on the ATOLL (ATmospheric Observations at LiLLe) platform in Lille, France. The proposed model, FLARE-GMM (Fluorescence Lidar-based Aerosol REcognition from Gaussian Mixture Model), employs a Gaussian mixture model trained on a dataset spanning from early 2021 to the end of 2023. FLARE-GMM is able to distinguish the predominant aerosol type in a given layer between dust, urban, and biomass burning aerosols by using the PLDR (particular linear depolarization ratio) and the fluorescence capacity, as well as relative humidity, all measured with LILAS. To ensure accurate model training, cases were manually selected to include only pure aerosol layers, as mixed aerosols are not accurately modeled by GMM. Following the training phase, the model's performance was evaluated by investigating extreme events in which the aerosol type is not ambiguous. This approach was also completed with the use of a test dataset, on which FLARE-GMM was compared to NATALI (Neural Network Aerosol Typing Algorithm Based on Lidar Data), another automatic aerosol typing model based on neural networks using lidar data. The results demonstrated that FLARE-GMM shows promise in accurately identifying aerosol types, indicating its potential for classifying aerosols in a variety of situations. Finally, FLARE-GMM was used to estimate the aerosol types present in Lille's atmosphere throughout the entire dataset from early 2021 to the end of 2023. A statistical analysis of these results was conducted, further underscoring the model's capability in automated aerosol classification."

The LNOx remains inadequately quantified in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), a region experiencing one of the highest lightning frequencies in China. Here, we combine the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Lightning Location System (GHMLLS) flash data and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to quantify the LNOx emission contribution and investigate the impact on NOx and O3 concentration. An updated LNOx vertical distribution parameterization is developed, incorporating the lightning channel current intensity profile via the Modified Transmission Line Equivalent (MTLE) model. LNOx can contribute 4 % to the total NOx emissions during the PRD's convective season. Lightning scenario results reveal a 22 % increase in surface NOx concentrations compared to the base scenario. A titration effect is observed in O3 concentrations, with overall increases most pronounced at 4–6 km altitudes due to enhanced LNOx production. Vertical and horizontal transport processes dominate atmospheric composition changes during extreme thunderstorm events, significantly influencing surface O3 levels. We highlight the critical role of lightning's current profile in changing its atmospheric impacts. Multidimensional lightning observations are essential to elucidate LNOx's complex role in regional atmospheric chemistry facing global warming."

Processes such as permafrost thaw, tropical forest dieback, reduced ocean uptake, and intensifying climate extremes are already weakening natural carbon sinks, with potential to amplify warming and accelerate crossing of tipping points. Detecting and quantifying these dynamics requires sustained, high-resolution, spatially-comprehensive Earth Observations. Drawing on outcomes from a 2024 community workshop, we identify three core priorities for advancing CC feedback monitoring: (1) frequent, long-term measurements of carbon fluxes and stocks at sub-continental scales; (2) improved flux detectability using greenhouse gas partial columns; and (3) targeted monitoring of poorly-observed vulnerable regions, such as the tropics, high latitudes, and the Southern Ocean. We argue that a unified, multi-platform observing system, built on lower-cost, proven technologies and orbits and focused on high-risk observation gaps, would significantly reduce uncertainties in Earth System Models, provide early warnings of feedbacks and tipping points, inform climate mitigation strategies, and enhance transparency in carbon monitoring."

 Satellite observations of the total column dry-air carbon dioxide (XCO2) have been proven to support the monitoring and constraining of fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions at the urban scale. We utilized the XCO2 retrieval data from China's first laser carbon satellite dedicated to comprehensive atmospheric environmental monitoring, DQ-1, in conjunction with a high-resolution transport model and a Bayesian inversion system, to establish a system for quantifying and detecting CO2 emissions in urban areas. Additionally, we quantified the impact of uncertainties from satellite measurements, transport models, and biospheric fluxes on emission inversions. To address uncertainties from the transport model, we introduced random wind direction and speed errors to the ffCO2 plumes and conducted 104 simulations to obtain the error distribution. In our pseudo-data experiments, the inventory overestimated fossil fuel emissions for Beijing and Riyadh, while underestimating emissions for Cairo. Specifically, we simulated Beijing and leveraged DQ-1's active remote sensing capabilities, utilizing its rapid day-night revisit ability. We assessed the impact of daily biospheric fluxes on ffXCO2 enhancements and further analyzed the diurnal variations of biospheric flux impacts on local XCO2 enhancements using three-hourly average NEE data. The results of a case study indicate that a significant proportion of local XCO2 enhancements are notably influenced by biospheric CO2 variations, potentially leading to substantial biases in ffCO2 emission estimates. Moreover, considering biospheric flux variations separately under day and night conditions can improve simulation accuracy by 20 %–70 %.

Our study assesses the effect of two widely used emission inventories of these species on ozone and the methane lifetime. Our results indicate tropospheric ozone and methane lifetime differences of around 4 % even though both emission inventories aim at representing present-day conditions. We further attribute the differences to emissions of individual sectors, e.g. land traffic. 
 This study assesses the influence of anthropogenic emission inventories of ozone (O3) precursor species (i.e. NOx, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs)) prescribed in the simulations of the two phases of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) on tropospheric O3, hydroxyl radical (OH), and the methane (CH4) lifetime. We performed two transient simulations for the period 2000–2010 with the chemistry–climate model EMAC, one prescribing the emission inventory of CCMI-1 and the other that of CCMI-2022. Using the tagging approach, we attribute the differences of O3, OH, and the tropospheric CH4 lifetime to individual emission sectors. It is, to our knowledge, the first application of the tagging approach to attribute changes of the simulated CH4 lifetime to individual emission sectors.The emission inventory used for CCMI-2022 leads to a 3.7 % larger tropospheric O3 column and to a 3.2 % shorter tropospheric CH4 lifetime compared to CCMI-1 in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropospheric O3 column is 4.5 % larger, and the tropospheric CH4 lifetime 4.3 % shorter. Differences in tropospheric O3 are largely driven by changes of emissions from the anthropogenic non-traffic and land transport sectors in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the primary contributors are emissions from anthropogenic non-traffic, biomass burning, and shipping. These sectors also play a significant role in reducing the simulated tropospheric CH4 lifetime. However, the contribution of a particular sector to changes in O3 does not necessarily align with its impact on the CH4 lifetime."

This study examines aerosol composition and size distribution over the eastern China seas across four seasons, revealing how anthropogenic pollutants interact with natural aerosols. The strong effects of these interactions on nitrogen partitioning, dust composition, and sea salt chloride depletion are quantified, with implications for understanding nutrient deposition and coastal ozone chemistry. 
 Marine aerosols play important roles in climate, marine biogeochemistry, and coastal air quality. Over the eastern China seas adjacent to densely populated East Asia, aerosols are mutually affected by anthropogenic pollution and natural emissions. However, the impacts of anthropogenic–natural interactions on aerosol composition and properties are not well constrained, due to limited systematic observations. Here we characterized the composition of size-resolved aerosols over this region across four seasonal cruise campaigns, identifying major aerosol sources and influencing processes. Aerosol mass concentrations typically show trimodal distributions, with fine-mode mass dominating in spring and winter, due to strong influences of continental pollution. However, in 50.9 % of samples, continental secondary aerosols are highly aged, lacking a fine-mode NO3- peak. Gaseous HNO3 evaporated from continental secondary aerosols and anthropogenic NOx react with natural dust and sea spray aerosols (SSAs), forming coarse-mode NO3-, which contributes 43.2 % and 12.7 % of total NO3-, respectively. This shifts NO3- from fine to coarse mode, altering the spatial pattern of nitrogen deposition and its ecological effects. Additionally, 27.7 % of SSA Cl− is depleted on average, reaching 40.8 % in summer; this is an important source of reactive halogens that affect ozone chemistry. Shipping emissions contributed to more than 20 % of SO42- in spring and summer before the International Maritime Organization's 2020 regulation, but this contribution probably decreased by one order of magnitude thereafter. This analysis highlights the importance of anthropogenic–natural interactions over coastal seas, underscoring the need for further studies to assess their subsequent environmental impacts."

By combining atmospheric simulation and machine learning, we show that shipping emissions increase ozone levels by an average of 3.5 ppb nationwide, with large differences depending on location and season. Our findings highlight that controlling shipping emissions together with land-based sources is critical for improving air quality. 
 With the Two Phases of Clean Air Actions in China, the shipping sector has emerged as a significant source with substantial emission reduction potential compared to land-based anthropogenic sectors. Therefore, understanding the contribution of shipping emissions to ozone (O3) pollution is therefore essential for advancing China's air pollution control efforts. In this study, a coupled framework including a chemical transport model with machine learning techniques was developed to systematically investigate the interannual and seasonal impacts of shipping emissions on O3 concentrations across China during the period from 2016 to 2020, and explore mechanisms by which shipping emissions influence O3 formation. Results indicate that shipping emissions increase O3 concentrations by a five-year average of 3.5 ppb nationwide, exhibiting significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity across different regions and seasons. Although significant differences exist between the emissions of ocean vessels and inland vessels, their contributions to O3 formation are becoming increasingly comparable. Solely controlling shipping emissions may has limited impact on O3 mitigation. Instead, coordinated reductions targeting both shipping and land-based anthropogenic sources, along with region-specific and targeted emission control strategies, are critical for achieving substantial improvements in O3 pollution mitigation."

Error analysis reveals seasonal variation with lower accuracy in autumn/winter, and increased uncertainty with lower Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI. 
 A global AOD retrieval product from the Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) has been proposed. We have validated the AOD from the early stages of on-orbit operation and achieved high accuracy, but we lack an understanding of the retrieval accuracy over longer time scales from a systematic validation and analysis of POSP-retrieved AOD. The objectives of the current study are: (1) To ensure the reliability of POSP AOD products and explore the potential factors influencing their performance; (2) To provide a valuable reference for the enhancement of these products in future developments. To achieve these objectives, POSP AOD products have been validated using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements (over 276 sites) as reference. The results from 19 314 collocations show a high accuracy, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.914, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.085, and the fraction within the expected error (EE) of 78.5 %. In addition, the validation at individual sites indicates that the performance of POSP products is better than that of MODIS (Deep Blue and Dark Target) AOD. Further error analysis indicates that the accuracy of POSP AOD exhibits a clear seasonal variation, being lower in the autumn and winter than in the spring and summer. Additionally, the uncertainty in AOD increases as NDVI decreases. Globally, the spatial variability of the quarterly averaged AOD has been analysed. The results show that the validation metrics of POSP and MODIS AOD are comparable. However, over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, POSP AOD is in better agreement with MAIAC AOD, while over other regions, it is in better agreement with DB/DT AOD."

We have used measurements of ultrafine particles (UFPs), a less understood air pollutant with potentially significant health implications, for training machine learning models that can substantially reduce the inaccuracy in UFP concentrations predicted by a climate model. This approach could aid epidemiological studies of ultrafine particles by extending exposure records. 
 Air pollution, particularly exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) with diameters below 100 nm, poses significant health risks, yet their spatial and temporal variability complicates impact assessments. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques in enhancing the accuracy of a global aerosol-climate model's outputs through statistical downscaling to better represent observed data at specific sites. Specifically, the study focuses on the particle number size distributions from the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ. The coarse horizontal resolution of ECHAM-HAMMOZ (approx. 200 km) makes modeling sub-gridscale phenomena, such as UFP concentrations, highly challenging. Data from three European measurement stations (Helsinki, Leipzig, and Melpitz) were used as target of downscaling, covering nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation particle size ranges during years 2016–2018. Six different ML methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Process Regression and Generalized Linear Model) were employed, with hyperparameter optimization and feature selection integrated for model improvement. A separate ML model was trained for each of the sites and size ranges. Results showed a notable improvement in prediction accuracy for all particle sizes compared to the original global model outputs, particularly for the accumulation subrange. Challenges remained particularly in downscaling the nucleation subrange, likely due to its high variability and the discrepancy in spatial scale between the climate model representation and the underlying processes. Additionally, the study revealed that the choice of downscaling method requires careful consideration of spatial and temporal dimensions as well as the characteristics of the target variable, as different particle size ranges or variables in other studies may necessitate tailored approaches. The study demonstrates the feasibility of ML-based downscaling for enhancing air quality assessments. This approach could support future epidemiological studies and inform policies on pollutant exposure. Future integration of ML models dynamically into global climate model frameworks could further refine climate predictions and health impact studies."

 Seasonal influenza transmission is influenced by environmental and climatic factors, but the role of particulate matter (PM2.5) and its organic constituent remains unclear. This study uses Bayesian spatiotemporal models to explore the effects of PM2.5 and Organic Matters (OM) on influenza transmission and identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity across socio-economic statuses to enhance early warning systems (EWS) for seasonal influenza.

PM2.5 and OM data were sourced from Tracking Air Pollution, and socio-economic factors, including floating population, population density, and GDP per capita, were obtained from government records. A spatiotemporal model with spatial and temporal autoregression terms, implemented under the Bayesian inference framework, and generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to assess associations and compared with spatiotemporal models. PM2.5 was positively associated with increased influenza transmission in all cities under the Bayesian spatiotemporal models (Guangzhou: Relative Risk (RR) = 1.16, 95 % Credible interval (95 % CrI): 1.08–1.23; Beijing: RR = 1.37, 95 % CrI: 1.18–1.60; Wuhan: RR = 1.18, 95 % CrI: 1.10–1.26).

Spatiotemporal models had better performance than regression models and identified high-risk clusters of influenza in suburban areas. PM2.5 and OM significantly influence seasonal influenza transmission, even after adjusting for socio-economic factors. Bayesian spatiotemporal models outperformed GLMs in capturing environmental effects and identifying high-risk areas, supporting their use in EWS to enhance public health interventions."

 China is currently the world's largest carbon emitter and striving to mitigate its emissions to meet the carbon neutrality goals. However, due to sparse monitoring networks and uneven economic development, significant uncertainties exist in the country's carbon emission statistics, particularly in urban areas. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of carbon source-sink characteristics in one of the most thriving regions in China, the Greater Bay Area (GBA), one-year monitoring of CH4, CO2, and CO was conducted at a suburban coastal site in Hong Kong since February 2023. After filtering out local influences, regional data for CH4, CO2 and CO show distinct seasonal variations, with higher concentrations observed during the cold season (2038.0 ± 63.8 ppbv, 443.0 ± 12.6 ppmv and 213.3 ± 64.5 ppbv for CH4, CO2 and CO, respectively) and lower concentrations during the warm season (1948.7 ± 76.2 ppbv, 431.6 ± 10.1 ppmv and 113.6 ± 55.8 ppbv for CH4, CO2 and CO, respectively), influenced by variations in regional source and sink strength and long-distance transport driven by the Asiatic monsoon. Notably, CH4 exhibits a strong correlation with CO, while CO2 demonstrates a weaker correlation with the other two gases, suggesting that Hong Kong possesses unique regional-derived emission pattern compared to other Chinese cities. Back-trajectory and potential source contribution function analyses highlight central China as the primary source regions for CH4 and CO, and eastern and central China as the primary source regions for CO2.

 East Asia, including Korea, is a major source of secondary air pollutants due to its high population density and intense industrial activity. As economic growth continues, concerns over air quality and its impact on health and the environment have increased. To better characterize atmospheric pollution, South Korea has adopted multiple monitoring approaches, including ground-based, sonde, satellite, and airborne observations. Among these, airborne measurements offer unique advantages in resolving the vertical structure of air pollutants. Following the 2016 Korea–United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign, Korea enhanced its airborne measurement capabilities through the modification of the Beechcraft 1900D aircraft for air quality research. During the fall of 2021, ten research flights (35 h total) were conducted over the Seoul Metropolitan Area and the Yellow Sea as part of the Satellite Integrated Joint Monitoring of Air Quality (SIJAQ) campaign. The objective was to investigate the vertical distribution and chemical composition of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1). Results showed that elevated NR-PM1 concentrations in urban areas were primarily driven by increases in nitrate fractions, highlighting the key role of secondary nitrate formation during high pollution events. Over the Yellow Sea, high NR-PM1 levels were attributed to long-range transport, with oxidized aerosols entering inland regions. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of aircraft-based observations in capturing vertical aerosol characteristics and identifying pollution sources. The findings provide critical insight into regional aerosol chemistry and support the validation and improvement of satellite-based air quality retrievals, including those from GEMS, contributing to enhanced air quality management in Korea."

 Rapid economic development and intensified urbanization have led to a significant rise in PM2.5 pollution events, posing severe risks to public health and societal well-being. Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is crucial to mitigate these impacts. However, existing approaches that rely solely on numerical simulation or deep learning algorithms often suffer from limitations in forecasting accuracy, spatial resolution, and coverage. To address these challenges, this study presents a hybrid PM₂.₅ forecasting framework that combines machine learning techniques with forecast data from GEOS-CF—a global atmospheric constituent prediction system that incorporates the GEOS-Chem chemistry module—alongside other high-resolution spatial and temporal predictors. The proposed framework provides 120-h, gap-free forecasts at a high spatial resolution of 1 km. The application of the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) further improves the model's capability to forecast high PM2.5 concentrations by addressing data imbalances. The model was trained and validated under real-world conditions, ensuring that future data were excluded from the training process to prevent artificially inflated performance. Using China as a case study, validation results showed an average correlation coefficient (R) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67 and 36.64 μg/m3, respectively, for the first 12 h, and 0.48 and 39.39 μg/m3 for the full 120-h forecast. This represents a significant improvement over GEOS-CF forecasts, which had R (RMSE) values of 0.33 (124.68 μg/m3) and 0.22 (95.21 μg/m3) for the same periods. The proposed framework also significantly reduces computational costs compared to running numerical models at a 1-km scale over large areas, enabling near-real-time, high-resolution PM2.5 forecasting, even in resource-constrained environments."

Here we use a combination of space-based (Atmosphere–Space Interaction Monitor and Geostationary Lightning Mapper) and ground-based (Earth Networks Total Lightning Network and Extreme Low Frequency magnetic field antenna) instruments to systematically identify continuing current lightning between June 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021 in the Contiguous United States. Matched flashes are analyzed using two approaches. In the first, we classify the flashes according to the approximate models of Fairman and Bitzer (2022) as either having continuing current or not. In the second approach, we classify cloud-to-ground flashes reported by the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network using ΔB, a sensitive magnitude derived from Extreme Low Frequency magnetic signals. ΔB quantifies the difference in the average magnetic field signal during the 20 ms before and after the return stroke. A threshold of 0.15 pT was established based on simultaneous observations of a continuing current flash on April 22, 2017, recorded by an Extreme Low Frequency magnetic antenna in Cabo Verde and the Huntsville, Alabama Marx Meter Array. Significant differences were observed in the dual-wavelength (337.0 nm and 777.4 nm) light curves recorded by the Atmosphere–Space Interaction Monitor for flashes with and without continuing current, suggesting its potential for identifying this type of lightning based on spectral emission."

10.1029/2025GL118286,True,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文分析了2024年母亲节风暴期间，一氧化氮(NO) 5.3微米红外辐射的响应。通过TIMED卫星上的SABER观测数据，发现NO辐射显著增强，达到了SABER时代夜间辐射的最高值。利用AMPERE的测量数据，发现增强的场向电流在黄昏/夜晚区域最大程度地向赤道方向渗透。TIEGCM模拟显示了最强的焦耳加热率，以及增强的热层密度、NO、原子氧和温度结构，这些结构持续了超过24小时。研究表明，最强的夜间NO辐射可归因于增强的焦耳加热率，该加热率由场向电流更强的赤道扩张以及热层温度和成分的空前增强所驱动。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来研究大气成分的变化及其影响因素。,"['Nitric Oxide (NO)', 'infrared radiative emission', 'SABER', 'TIMED satellite', 'Thermosphere', 'Ionosphere', 'Mesosphere', 'field-aligned currents', 'Joule heating', 'thermospheric density', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing']",Tikemani Bag;Vir Singh,The Mother's Day Storm of 2024 Triggered the Strongest Nighttime Radiative Emission of the SABER Era,"The response of Nitric Oxide (NO) 5.3 µm infrared radiative emission to the 2024 Mother's Day storm is investigated by utilizing Sounding of Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) observations onboard the Thermosphere‐Ionosphere‐Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Although NO emission displayed a drastic enhancement, it recorded the highest nighttime emission of the SABER era. The intensified field‐aligned currents from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) measurements showed maximum equatorward penetration in the dusk/night sector, reaching below the magnetic latitude of 40° in both hemispheres. TIEGCM simulation demonstrated the strongest Joule heating rate, along with enhanced thermospheric density, NO, atomic oxygen, and temperature structures that sustained for more than 24 hr. The investigation reveals that the strongest nighttime NO emission can be attributed to the enhanced Joule heating rate, driven by stronger equatorial expansion of field‐aligned currents, along with an unprecedented enhancement in thermospheric temperature and composition."
10.1029/2025JD044766,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文探讨了臭氧在平流层准两年振荡（QBO）次级环流中的作用。论文通过线性理论和辐射/光化学/对流平衡模型，量化了臭氧对次级环流的影响。研究表明，臭氧加热在决定次级环流的强度和结构方面起着主导作用，特别是光化学汇在低层平流层中至关重要。此外，研究还评估了由臭氧加热引起的次级环流成分，并讨论了其对模型生成的QBO的影响。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及大气成分（特别是臭氧）的监测和分析，以及对大气温度和环流的理解，这些都可以通过卫星观测和其他遥感技术来实现。,"['ozone', 'QBO (Quasi-Biennial Oscillation)', 'secondary circulation', 'radiative heating', 'photochemical sink', 'ERA 5', 'atmospheric composition', 'temperature anomalies']",Peter Hitchcock;Alison Ming,The Role of Ozone in the Secondary Circulation of the QBO: Linear Theory,"The secondary circulation is central to understanding how changes in ozone (or other radiatively active species) might affect the dynamics of the quasibiennial oscillation (QBO). We develop here a linearized scaling theory to quantify the potential role of ozone in determining the secondary circulation, and validate it against a radiative/photochemical/convective equilibrium column model that reproduces the observed temperature and ozone anomalies of the QBO. Although the potential for radiative heating due to ozone to affect the secondary circulation is generally appreciated, theoretical discussions of the secondary circulation have not included an explicit representation of the ozone budget. For realistic parameter values, ozone heating can play a dominant role in determining the strength and structure of the secondary circulation. In particular, the photochemical sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone is conventionally thought to be determined by transport is key to obtaining a realistic circulation: in its absence the theory predicts a much weaker circulation in which vertical motion is aligned with the core of the jets rather than the shear zones. The photochemical sink (and thus the secondary circulation) depends nonlocally on the ozone column above. We further apply this theory to estimate the component of the secondary circulation that is due to ozone heating, confirming a previously inferred over‐estimate of the secondary circulation in ERA 5. These results have implications for understanding the role of interactive ozone in model‐generated QBOs."
10.1029/2024GH001223,True,GeoHealth,该研究论文探讨了不同人为排放清单对空气质量和人类健康的影响。它通过比较三种全球排放清单（CEDS、CAMS 和 ECLIPSEv6b）中痕量气体和气溶胶的排放量，并使用大气模型来量化这些排放清单对PM2.5和臭氧的影响，从而评估空气质量。研究结果表明，不同排放清单之间存在显著差异，尤其是在黑碳、有机碳、氨和二氧化硫的排放方面，这些差异导致了全球PM2.5和臭氧浓度以及由此导致的人类健康影响的显著变化。该研究强调了人为活动导致的过早死亡主要集中在亚洲和非洲大陆。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，尤其是空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'PM2.5', 'ozone', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'emission inventories', 'mortality', 'trace gases', 'aerosols']",Halima Salah;Ying Xiong;Debatosh Partha;Noribeth Mariscal;Like Wang;Simone Tilmes;Wenfu Tang;Yaoxian Huang,Impact of Anthropogenic Emission Estimates on Air Quality and Human Health Effects,"Global bottom‐up anthropogenic emission inventories show substantial spatial and temporal differences of short‐lived pollutant emissions, which results in uncertainties in terms of air quality and human health impacts. In this study, we compare the emissions of trace gases and aerosols for the year 2015 from three different global emission inventories, the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS), the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Global Anthropogenic Emissions (CAMS‐GLOB‐ANT), and Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short‐Lived Pollutants version 6b (ECLIPSEv6b). We then employ the Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry version 6.0 within the Community Earth System Model version 2.2.0 to quantify the atmospheric chemistry and air quality impacts from the above three anthropogenic emission inventories, with a focus on PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters equal or less than 2.5 μm) and ozone (O3). Our results indicate that differences between emission inventories are largest for black carbon, organic carbon, ammonia and sulfur dioxide, in terms of global annual total emissions. These differences in emissions across CEDS, CAMS, and ECLIPSEv6b lead to substantial variations in global annual totals and spatial distribution patterns. This study shows that the global annual total PM2.5‐induced premature mortality is three times higher than that from O3 mortality, indicating that PM2.5 is the primary contributor compared with O3. An inter‐comparison of global human health impacts from CEDS, CAMS and ECLIPSEv6b indicates that 80% (CEDS), 81.2% (CAMS), and 77.6% (ECLIPSEv6b) of premature deaths due to anthropogenic activities are associated with Asia and Africa continents."
