10.1088/1748-9326/ae06b7,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注的是大规模太阳能发电站的选址问题，以及公众态度和社区参与在其中的作用。它探讨了影响公众对太阳能项目接受程度的因素，以及如何通过社区参与来减少选址冲突。虽然太阳能发电与减少空气污染等环境效益相关，但该论文的核心内容并非直接关于大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Sika Gadzanku;Wenrui Qu;Shahzeen Z Attari;Parrish Bergquist;Sanya Carley;Alison Knasin;David M Konisky;Gilbert Michaud;Jennifer Silva,Public attitudes and community engagement in large-scale solar siting,"Large-scale solar (LSS) systems represent an increasing share of energy infrastructure in the United States. The number of LSS systems is expected to continue to grow, and such expansion will require support from local communities that are asked to host new projects. Here, we perform a systematic literature review of studies that evaluate: (1) the factors that shape the perception, acceptance, and opposition of LSS; and (2) the role of stakeholders and community engagement in current LSS siting conflicts. Our review of the literature finds that local communities have complex, location-specific opinions and attitudes towards solar projects. Shaped by project characteristics such as size, land use type, and project ownership type, people value local benefits such as jobs, reduced pollution, increased tax revenue, and local ownership, and are critical of highly localized burdens such as impacts to the local landscape. We further find that scholars promote early and direct communication of potential benefits and tradeoffs, as well as an inclusive decision-making process and engagement activities that reflect community values and build trust. Our review reveals that further research is needed to investigate the roles and impacts of: (1) emerging LSS configurations such as solar plus storage hybrids and LSS projects paired with transmission and substation additions; (2) evolving LSS stakeholder groups including landowners, agricultural industry, and the media; and (3) causal relationships between public perceptions, community engagement activities, and project outcomes."

This study identified the potential source of nurdle pollution using a combination of chemical analysis and numerical modeling. Chemical data of the nurdles collected from over 70 sites from Houston to the Yucatán Peninsula during 2021–2024 revealed distinct patterns in polymer type, color distribution, and weathering status, providing strong evidence for Texas as the primary source of these nurdles. Color distribution results showed that white nurdles, representative of fresher nurdles, dominated the Texas sites and more weathered, yellow nurdles, were found in Mexico regions. This color trend suggests an increased surface degradation as nurdles move southward. Analysis through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows polyethylene (PE) as the dominant polymer across all sampled sites, showcasing a linked homogeny through the regions, and the data were further used to build chemical weathering indices, which provided a way of quantifying the degree of oxidation nurdles have undergone. Results showed that the Mexico nurdles had higher indices than those in Texas, reinforcing the hypothesis that the Mexico nurdles have undergone longer environmental exposure. Physical oceanographic modeling, incorporating wave and current dynamics, confirmed that nurdles released from Texas can be transported to Mexican coastlines, while nurdles released from Mexico do not reach deep into the US. shorelines due to strong prevalent downcoast currents along the inner shelf. This movement pattern, together with chemical and weathering evidence, strongly supports Texas as the primary source of nurdle pollution along the gulf coast. Identification of the pollutant source will assist management practices and international cooperation to tackle nurdle pollution."

As global warming continues, understanding the compound events (CEs) characterized by dry hazards is crucial especially in Asia, where dense populations heighten vulnerability. This study examines the intricate characteristics of 2023 compound heatwave, drought, and fire (CHDF) events in Asia by analyzing spatial and temporal patterns from 1960 to 2023 during the extended warm season (April–October). Results reveal that the 2023 CHDF notably diverged from historical trends, with heatwave-driven CEs exhibiting a four- to eightfold increase in spatial extent since 1980. The severity and duration of 2023 HDF reached return periods of approximately 23 and 40 years, respectively. In particular, urban cores in East and Southeast Asia emerged as hotspots for CHDF events, pointing to the influence of land transformation. Attribution analysis further highlights the dominant role of human-induced climate change in amplifying the likelihood of 2023-like CEs, with DF responding more modestly than heatwave-driven CEs. Projections under SSP245 suggest that 2023-level CHDF events may stabilize by the 2060s with mitigation, while SSP585 indicates continued escalation and earlier emergence (≈1–5 years). Findings from this study emphasize the growing risk of compound dry hazards and the pressing need for targeted mitigation efforts and adaptive strategies to reduce Asia’s vulnerability to climate extremes."

However, attributing inferred CH4 fluxes to specific source sectors often relies heavily on prior information and assumptions, introducing uncertainties. Incorporating co-emitted species into top–down analyzes can provide additional observational constraints for more accurate source attribution. In this study, we examine the 2010–2018 emission trends of CH4 and ammonia (NH3), both of which are emitted from the livestock sector, using satellite observations of these two gases. Our analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between CH4 and NH3 emission trends at the continental scale, mainly driven by increases in Pan-Tropical regions including South Asia, East and West Africa, North Latin America, and Brazil. This observation-derived correlation is generally consistent with changes in livestock populations. In contrast, widely used bottom–up emission inventories fail to capture this correlation, likely due to inconsistencies in the activity data used for compiling greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. These findings support the attribution of substantial increases in CH4 emissions to the livestock sector, identifying it as one of the major drivers for recent rises in tropical CH4 emissions."

The Imperial College Storm Model (IRIS) was used to analyse the impact of global warming on North Atlantic hurricane landfall through a storyline approach. The storyline assumes increases of potential intensity (PI) as the cause of change with no changes to tracks or basin frequency. This allows study of both recent trends and projections for the first time in a consistent way. The observed hurricane intensification is simulated but underestimated. For a +2 ∘C global warming scenario hurricanes of intensity Category 4 and above become 62% more likely in the basin and nearly twice (92%) more likely at landfall. The future number of hurricanes, their decay and tracks are uncertain and their impact is examined by sensitivity studies. Reduction of the basin count offsets warming driven landfall frequency increases only for weaker hurricanes. The increased frequency and fraction of the most damaging landfalling hurricanes is controlled by changes in PI."

Assessing agricultural areas impacted by soil salinity change is very important to support decision-makers or planners in sustainable land use planning. To overcome limitations in current spatial extrapolation methods for a reliable prediction of salinity trends across extensive river deltas, an advanced synthesis approach was developed with the use of machine learning (ML) particularly appropriate to account for a multitude of factors representing land cover conditions, processes, and interactions. This study aims to: (i) address the extrapolation challenge in ML-based soil salinity mapping, and (ii) predict land cover changes due to soil salinity. The Mekong River Delta (MRD) and Red River Delta (RRD) were selected as case studies. A hybrid ML approach and land change modeler were used to analyze 39 contributing factors. To resolve the spatial extrapolation issue in soil salinity monitoring, we used 109 salinity-affected locations in the MRD and 72 in the RRD. Land cover data from 2000 and 2023, along with salinity maps, were used to project the 2050 land cover. Multiple ML models were used to cross-verify and obtain robust results. All models achieved R2 scores above 0.85, with the best model exceeding 0.93, demonstrating high predictive performance. Among the models, XGR-particle swarm optimization achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.939), followed closely by XGR-fennec fox optimization, XGR-coati optimization algorithm (R2 = 0.932), and XGR-osprey optimization algorithm (R2 = 0.921), respectively, highlighting the robustness of optimization-enhanced XGBoost models. Future projections show that cropland will decline from 67% of the area (in 2000) to 64% (2023) and about 60% (2050) under the influence of salinity, with approximately 41 km2 of cropland converted to aquaculture by 2050, mostly in high-salinity coastal zones. This study develops a powerful synthesis framework to address the problem of spatial extrapolation challenges related to natural hazard mapping in general and soil salinity mapping in particular, based on ML and on accurate prediction of land cover/land use change under effects of soil salinity in the context of climate change. Results from the synthesis approach help accurately identify areas affected by salinity intrusion, useful for the development of effective solutions in space and time towards the goal of sustainable development."

Yet limited research explicitly measures community resilience to health risks of a changing environment. This review aimed to identify and assess the dimensions and indicators of community resilience frameworks for the health and wellbeing impacts of environmental and climate change. Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science), grey literature, and reference lists of included studies were systematically searched and screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria at the title and abstract level and then full-text, according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines. Charted data was analysed using qualitative and quantitative synthesis methods, with dimensions and indicators coded and re-categorised to identify core resilience components and their co-occurrence. Across the 8243 studies screened, 11 unique dimensions and 41 indicator categories of community resilience were identified. The most common dimensions were economic, community capacity, social, and institutional and political dimensions, with no frameworks including both health and environmental dimensions. Consensus on how to measure common dimensions was lacking and many of the indicators required for a comprehensive assessment of health-related community resilience were inconsistently or infrequently employed. Overall, the capacity of the frameworks to account for socially differentiated impacts across a community, as well as factors relating to health and wellbeing, culture, communication and information, and knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural practices, was insufficient. Findings highlight the need for further studies focused explicitly on health impacts and hazards to establish greater consensus on core dimensions and indicators, including under-represented components and their interconnections. This review makes a strong case that community resilience frameworks for the health impacts of climate change will require greater integration of environmental and health dimensions; factors that more accurately reflect public health interests and dynamics; and equity considerations for unique place-based contexts."

This study investigates the impact of educational exposure on perceptions of CDR methods among individuals with a pre-existing interest in climate solutions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-surveys of participants (n = 366 pre-survey, n = 83 post-survey, n = 29 matched pairs) enrolled in a six-week online CDR curriculum. Baseline comparisons with previous studies confirmed that participants were more knowledgeable about CDR and held more positive environmental attitudes than nationally representative population samples. Following the educational intervention, participants demonstrated significant increases in self-reported CDR knowledge and more favourable risk-benefit assessments across all CDR technologies, with the largest gains for enhanced weathering and biochar. Qualitative analysis revealed that, rather than simple endorsement, education fostered more nuanced evaluation capabilities, with participants developing greater appreciation for both benefits and method-specific limitations. Notably, participants shifted away from technology-specific preferences and towards more portfolio-based thinking, recognizing the complementary roles of different CDR approaches. These findings suggest that informed engagement with CDR technologies produces sophisticated rather than uncritical assessment frameworks, with implications for how CDR communication and engagement strategies might be designed to support constructive public dialogue about these emerging technologies."

Analysis of cloud properties from Himawari‐8 is combined with data from IMERG and ERA5 to explore new results about changes in cloud properties relating to heavy rainfall and intraseasonal variability. This study brings a fresh angle to the challenge of understanding the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) modulation of cloud and precipitation over Sumatra by examining changes in the total cloud area and, more importantly, changes in the cold cloud tops that indicate the deepest convection. Although widespread cold clouds are likely regardless of MJO phase, the enhanced prevalence of cold tops requires the support of the large‐scale convective envelope. These results provide insight about how the MJO influences the nature as well as the amount of convection. Heavy rainfall is shown to make a larger percentage contribution to the total rainfall during the MJO‐enhanced convection phases (2‐3‐4) over Sumatra. This contribution is suggested to be related to a higher prevalence of cold cloud core areas in phases 2 and 4. In phase 3, there is a remarkable increase in the percentage contribution of heavy rainfall in the cold cloud area but a relatively lower prevalence of the coldest cloud core area, suggesting large‐scale environmental support for heavy rainfall but not necessarily the most intense convection.

As a dengue fever (DF) hotspot, Guangzhou lacks research on how extreme weather characteristics and spatial factors interact to shape DF patterns. This study analyzed DF distribution in Guangzhou from 2017 to 2019, using a zero‐inflated negative binomial spatial lag (ZINB‐SAR) regression model to assess the effects of daytime heatwaves (DHW), nighttime heatwaves (NHW) and extreme precipitation (EP) on DF. Results revealed that DF cases were predominantly clustered in central urban areas, with an epidemic season from May to November. The ZINB‐SAR model outperformed negative binomial regression and spatial econometric models, with all spatial effect coefficients significantly positive. Analysis of lagged effects showed that each additional DHW event increased DF cases by up to 10.80% (95% CI: 6.22%–15.59%) at a 2‐month lag, while NHW events increased DF by 2.73% (95% CI: −1.59%–7.23%). Threshold analysis indicated DHW intensity shifted from promoting to inhibiting DF between 0.66°C and 0.76°C, while NHW intensity transitioned between 0.95°C and 2.28°C. EP demonstrated the strongest effects at a 3‐month lag, increasing DF cases by 12.05% (95% CI: 9.03%–15.17%), although its intensity was not statistically significant. Seasonal and spatial variations in DF incidence were evident. In conclusion, DHW and EP impacts were primarily driven by event frequency rather than intensity, whereas NHW effects were more dependent on intensity. These findings highlight the complex spatiotemporal interplay between extreme weather and DF in Guangzhou, providing critical evidence for developing targeted climate‐adaptive disease control strategies."

 Monolayer amorphous carbon (a-C), an atom-thin two-dimensional (2D) carbon amorphous material, has attracted significant attention due to its structural and transport properties.

Moreover, quantum tunneling measurements at liquid helium temperature were conducted on the a-C films, confirming the samples’ homogeneity and their insulating behavior.

The compound reduced fibril formation by approximately 75%, providing insights relevant to Alzheimer’s drug development. 
 Alzheimer’s disease is a specific neurodegenerative disorder, distinct from normal aging, with a growing unmet medical need. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, primarily consisting of amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils. Therapeutic antibodies can slow down the disease, but are associated with potential severe side effects, motivating the development of small molecules to halt disease progression. This study investigates the interaction between the clinical drug candidate small molecule anle138b and lipidic Aβ₄₀ fibrils of type 1 (L1). L1 fibrils were previously shown to closely resemble fibrils from Alzheimer’s patients. Using high-resolution structural biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that anle138b selectively binds to a cavity within the fibril. This structural insight provides a deeper understanding of a potential drug-binding mechanism at the atomic level and may inform the development of therapies and diagnostic approaches. In addition, anle138b reduces fibril formation in the presence of lipids by approximately 75%. This may suggest a mechanistic connection to its previously reported activity in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease.

Here this group reports combining the self-bioluminescent bacteria with a neutral red photosensitizer in alginate microcapsules as a self-driven metronomic photodynamic therapeutic system with preclinical anti-cancer effects. 
 Metronomic photodynamic therapy is a long-term, low-dose treatment strategy that employs optical devices with continuous photosensitizer administration and requires stable device attachment with a consistent power source. These factors significantly limit patient mobility. Currently, no metronomic photodynamic therapy modality can operate independent of external devices, underscoring the critical need for in vivo light sources that function without external energy inputs. In this study, we integrate self-luminous bacteria with a photosensitizer in alginate microcapsules to create a self-driven metronomic photodynamic therapy that can be securely implanted within a tumour, thereby enabling continuous light emission without requiring an external energy source or ongoing replenishment of photosensitive reactants. By harnessing nutrients from the tumour microenvironment, this system sustains the generation of reactive oxygen species. A single injection effectively eliminates larger tumours (>300 mm3) in an opaque melanoma mouse model and transplanted hepatocarcinoma rabbit model. Self-driven metronomic photodynamic therapy demonstrates advantages over traditional photodynamic therapy, indicating its potential as a versatile therapeutic approach for cancer treatment with deeply situated lesions.

 Conservation benefits from dietary change are commonly assessed without accounting for different conservation objectives. By representing fine-scale habitat and landscape change within a dynamic land-system model, we assess how a partial or full transition to healthier diets would affect indicators across the ‘Nature for Nature’ and ‘Nature for Society’ conservation value perspectives. We find that most diet-related conservation benefits are already achieved by a partial shift to healthier diets. This is because, particularly in many countries in tropical Africa and Asia, adopting healthier diets would mainly involve substituting staple foods with more varied plant-based foods rather than replacing resource-intensive livestock products. Conservation action in line with the Global Biodiversity Framework, by contrast, most consistently improves outcomes across both value perspectives, even under current demand trends, showing that spatial planning is central for decoupling conservation outcomes from food demand. However, any progress towards healthier diets not only lowers greenhouse gas emissions but also reduces barriers to effective conservation, such as higher food prices and imports. This study examines the outcomes of dietary shifts across intrinsic and instrumental conservation perspectives, finding that most conservation benefits already come from a partial shift to healthier, more plant-based diets, whereas greater benefits depend on more targeted conservation action."

Here, we quantified the impacts of tropical Indo-Pacific coupling using an extended nonlinear recharge oscillator model for ENSO that incorporates key tropical IO climate modes. Enabling the PO-to-IO effect increased the amplitudes of the IOD and IOB by 23% and 38%, respectively, and regulated IOB seasonality. Conversely, IO-to-PO connection increased ENSO peak variability by 5%, shortened its periodicity by 1 year, and more than doubled the frequency of extreme ENSO events when coupling strength was doubled.

 Livestock are vital for global food security, but are a significant source of methane, a greenhouse gas. Breeding for highly efficient nitrogen utilization and lower emissions is therefore a key goal for sustainable agriculture. Here we compared these traits across wild, indigenous, crossbred, and improved bovines via an extensive meta-analysis, supplemented with measurements of 150 yaks. Our results revealed that indigenous bovine produce less methane and have lower urinary nitrogen loss than improved breeds, indicating superior feed conversion and nitrogen efficiency. Notably, crossbreeds also produce significantly less methane, revealing a hybrid advantage for sustainable breeding. Furthermore, our direct measurements showed that methane emissions from yaks were 39% lower than predicted by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier2 models, a pattern of overestimation also evident in other indigenous bovines. These findings reveal that well-adapted indigenous breeds are crucial genetic resources, highlighting the need for breed-specific data to guide global mitigation efforts.

In contrast to the positive δ7Licarb values in seep carbonates formed near the seafloor, carbonates originating from organoclastic sulphate reduction in deeper burial settings exhibit negative δ7Licarb values (−6.6‰ to −1.2‰). Calculated δ7Lifluid values (−4‰ to +1.4‰) in pore fluids closely match the δ7Lisilicate values of the silicate component in the rocks, suggesting congruent silicate weathering is approached. A positive correlation between δ7Lifluid and δ13Ccarb values indicates organoclastic sulphate reduction enhances silicate weathering, which together promote carbonate authigenesis in anoxic sediments. Our findings demonstrate that lithium isotopes are a valuable tool for tracing carbon–silicate interactions and reconstructing carbon cycling in anoxic sediments. Carbonates formed under different conditions display varying compositions of lithium isotopes, according to analyses of lithium isotope compositions of authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Mexico."

 Understanding drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and stocks is critical for carbon (C) neutrality in Earth’s extensive dryland croplands. Here, we analyzed 721 soil samples across northern China and revealed divergent regional dynamics of SOC stocks in topsoil (0–20 cm) over three decades. Agricultural intensification in northern China, marked by tripled productivity via strategic N-fertilization and policy-driven increases in straw return, created a major C sink (+3.1 Mg C ha−1), offsetting ~1.5% of China’s average annual emissions. Conversely, Northeast China experienced SOC depletion (−3.9 Mg C ha−1; ~12% loss since 1980s) driven by warming-enhanced decomposition of organic matter. Encouragingly, an annual straw return in excess of 270 kg C ha−1 could offset SOC losses in the face of future warming. Therefore, it is imperative to implement effective soil management practices and adaptation strategies to bolster soil resilience and health, as continued climate warming may undermine soil carbon sequestration.

 We developed a Time-series-based Image Fusion (TIF) algorithm to generate 10-m surface reflectance time series by synthesizing Landsats 8/9 and Sentinel-2 A/B data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on image pairs or thematic maps, TIF extracts all valid pixel-level observation pairs across time to build per-pixel linear regression models. This approach captures the spectral relationships between sensors while accounting for land surface dynamics. A temporal weighting scheme and an iterative refinement strategy improves the fusion process, yielding reusable coefficients that support efficient, scalable 10-m time-series generation. TIF was applied to all Landsat multispectral bands, using native 10-m Sentinel-2 bands (Blue, Green, Red) and resampled bands (NIR and SWIR1/2) for visual assessment, with quantitative accuracy evaluated at the original Sentinel-2 resolutions. Experiments across five U.S. sites show TIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like STARFM, FSDAF 2.0, Sen2Like, and ESRCNN. For instance, TIF demonstrated a reduction in RMSE by 24 % and an increase in SSIM by 6 % compared to FSDAF 2.0 and ESRCNN, and outclassed STARFM and Sen2Like, which showed weaker results across all metrics. In multi-date change detection, TIF-predicted images achieved a mean F1 score of 0.70 and a mean disagreement rate of 0.05 against reference maps. TIF offers a potential practical and efficient pathway for creating 10-m versions of NASA's HLS products, opening new opportunities for fine-scale, time-sensitive Earth observations."

 The cooling effect generated by urban green space (UGS) plays a vital role in mitigating heat waves and enhancing citizen well-being. However, long-term studies examining the evolution of cooling effect alongside rapid urbanization-induced UGS changes remain scarce. Focusing on Beijing, China, this study quantifies the spatiotemporal changes in UGS cooling effects and identifies their key two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) drivers over nearly four decades (1985–2023). We innovatively proposed three distinct cooling intensity (CI) indicators for spatially explicit analysis and employed both stepwise regression analysis and machine learning models. Key findings include: (1) Beijing’s UGS coverage exhibited an overall slight decline, yet its spatial distribution became more balanced. The proportion of grids with UGS coverage below 20 % decreased significantly, from 8 % in 1985 to less than 1 % in 2023. (2) The perceived trend in cooling effect strength (strengthening vs. weakening) critically depended on the CI indicator used. The traditional CI (temperature difference between UGS and surroundings) showed a continuous decrease from 2.65 °C in 1985 to 1.83 °C in 2023. Conversely, regression model slopes indicated that a 10 % increase in UGS coverage yielded a stronger cooling effect in recent years, despite declining model R2 values. Additionally, nearly 32 % of the study area exhibited an increase in outside CI of at least 0.5 °C, indicating a strengthening trend in the cooling effect. (3) Both statistical and machine learning analyses consistently identified the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the dominant driver, explaining over 50 % of CI variations. Landscape metrics and 3D UGS features contributed 38 % and 10 %, respectively. Combining all 2D and 3D characteristics explained over 70 % of CI variations, with NDVI, mean vegetation height, and aggregation index (AI) being the top three positively influential features."

 Recent studies have highlighted the need to identify oil and gas (O&G) facilities to connect anonymous aerial or satellite emissions surveys to specific facilities in the production basin. This study proposes a novel deep learning architecture that processes high-resolution (30 cm GSD) 3-band, pansharpened, visible-spectrum (RGB) satellite imagery from Maxar to identify facility outlines and key on-site equipment. The architecture utilizes a dual-branch model paradigm that combines few convolutional layers and Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) within a Transformer-based structure. One branch focuses on detecting two major equipment types at the site, while the other branch identifies overall facility boundaries. Comparison to test data indicates our architecture achieves 93% accuracy for facility identification with as few as 260 positive training samples. Comparing resulting facility data to regulatory reporting indicates that satellite deep-learning–based detection identifies more facilities, with greater detail and specificity than current reporting programs. To implement widespread anonymous aerial or satellite sampling, this type of facility recognition is likely required to attribute emission detections to O&G facilities."

 Understanding pollution, source and effect of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) is crucial for improving air quality in urban suburbs. This study utilized a proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole mass spectrometer to investigate OVOC pollution characteristics and environmental impacts across four seasons (2022–2023) in an urban suburb of Guangzhou. Results showed that OVOCs dominated total VOCs (averaging 75.4 %), with methanol, acetone, formaldehyde, and carboxylic acids as predominant species. These compounds significantly contributed to ozone formation potential (40.6 %–60.3 %) and OH reactivity. OVOC concentrations exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern (spring > autumn > winter > summer), influenced by photochemical processes and regional transport. Diurnal variations indicated that methanol peaked in the morning and evening linked to primary emissions, while aldehydes and ketones peaked in the afternoon due to secondary formation. Carboxylic acids displayed complex multi-peak patterns with significant nighttime accumulation, correlating with PM2.5 and suggesting a key role in secondary organic aerosol formation. Photochemical age-based source apportionment revealed diverse contributions: primary emissions were crucial for methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, and acetic acid; secondary formation was important for acetaldehyde, methyl ethyl ketone, and acetic acid; biogenic emissions contributed to formic acid, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and acetone; and background sources impacted methanol in colder seasons. Trajectory clustering and potential source contribution function analyses identified seasonally modulated transport patterns influencing the source areas of OVOCs, PM2.5 and O3. The study highlights OVOCs as key drivers of O3 and SOA formation in urban suburb, while effective mitigation of photochemical pollution in such area requires a multi-faceted control strategy that not only targets local primary precursors (e.g., from traffic and solvents) but also incorporates regionally coordinated efforts to address seasonally varying transboundary pollution."

Over-dispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analyses were applied to estimate the effect sizes, followed by stratified analyses and estimates of the interaction with ozone. Our findings indicate that PM2.5 and its components are significantly associated with increased daily mortality. Specifically, every interquartile range increase in PM2.5 resulted in a 1.97 % increase in all-cause mortality, 2.15 % increase in cardiovascular mortality, and 2.34 % increase in respiratory mortality. Similar but less significant effects were found in five PM2.5 components. Women and the elderly were more susceptible, and the effects were stronger during warm seasons for all pollutants except Sulfate. High levels of ozone amplified the mortality risks associated with PM2.5, Sulfate, Nitrate, and Ammonium, but not with Organic Matter and Black Carbon.

 Spatio-temporal analysis of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) plays a critical role in modulating climate, air quality, and ecosystem health. This study systematically examines the 40-year spatial-temporal characteristics and recent trends of AOD over four main continents represented by China, Germany, America, and South Africa from 1985 to 2024, using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Deep Blue (MODIS DB). The long-term annual mean AODs were found to be 0.27, 0.18, 0.13, and 0.10 for China, Germany, America, and South Africa, respectively, with peak values observed in 1992 across all regions likely linked to volcanic activities. During recent period from 2019 to 2024, the seasonality of AOD was characterized by minima in autumn over South Africa, moderate levels in summer over America and Germany, and maxima in spring over China. Meanwhile, recent monthly variations of AOD show diverse patterns, with AOD peaks in March, July, June, and September for China, America, Germany and South Africa, respectively. Furthermore, recent trends showed declining AOD rates of −3.1 × 10−3 and −1.0 × 10−2 per year over China and America, respectively, likely attributable to stringent environmental regulations and clean energy transitions. In contrast, increasing trends of AOD were observed in South Africa (1.3 × 10−3 per year) and Germany (1.1 × 10−3 per year), probably suggesting more aerosol emissions. Spatially, recent reductions of AOD derived using the Mann-Kendall test were concentrated in densely populated and industrialized areas of China and parts of America, while increases were widespread across Germany and South Africa. The research underscores the need for sustained monitoring and targeted mitigation strategies to control aerosol emissions, and is benefit for the studies of environment and climate change."

 Smoke aerosols from biomass burning (BB) in the Indochina Peninsula (ICP) constitute a globally significant source of absorptive aerosols, substantially impacting regional climate and air quality. Over the past four decades, the second dominant mode of spring smoke aerosol distribution over the ICP has exhibited a characteristic north-south dipole pattern. To investigate its driving mechanisms, this study analyzes smoke aerosols and meteorological variables using climate statistics (1980–2024), with a focus on interactions among sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric circulation, and smoke absorptive aerosol optical depth (SAAOD). Results demonstrate high sensitivity of the SAAOD dipole to meteorological conditions: positive SAAOD anomalies in the northern ICP correspond to decreased humidity, elevated temperatures, and reduced precipitation, while negative anomalies in the southern ICP correlate with increased humidity, enhanced upward motion, and greater precipitation. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis reveals a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.41) between the interannual variability of the SAAOD dipole and preceding winter SST anomalies in the Arabian Sea (AS), Bay of Bengal (BOB), and South China Sea (SCS). Mechanistically, warm SST anomalies in these regions drive anomalously strong equatorial westerlies, triggering a coupled cyclone system spanning the BOB and SCS. Convergence of BOB-derived westerly moisture and SCS-derived easterly moisture over the southern ICP fuels intense convection and high precipitation, suppressing BB. Moreover, warm SST anomalies induce a meridional overturning circulation, causing downdrafts over the northern ICP. The anomalous cyclone over the SCS enhances transport of dry continental northeasterlies to the northern ICP. These winds warm the leeward slopes of the Yungui Plateau, generating localized hot, dry conditions conducive to BB."
