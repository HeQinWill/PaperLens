10.5194/acp-24-11081-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了南美洲亚马逊地区的土地覆盖变化对大气成分的影响。研究者利用卫星遥感数据，分析了森林覆盖率、火灾面积、以及大气中异戊二烯、甲醛、甲醇、一氧化碳和二氧化氮等痕量气体的时空分布。结果表明，森林覆盖率与异戊二烯浓度呈线性关系，而火灾面积与二氧化氮浓度呈非线性关系。这些发现可以用于评估地球系统模型，并进一步探索生物圈-大气相互作用。,"['atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'satellite remote sensing', 'isoprene', 'nitrogen dioxide', 'burned area', 'forest cover', 'model evaluation']",Emma Sands;Richard J. Pope;Ruth M. Doherty;Fiona M. O'Connor;Chris Wilson;Hugh Pumphrey,"Satellite-observed relationships between land cover, burned area, and atmospheric composition over the southern Amazon","Changes in vegetation alongside biomass burning impact regional atmospheric composition and air quality. Using satellite remote sensing, we find a clear linear relationship between forest cover and isoprene and a pronounced non-linear relationship between burned area and nitrogen dioxide in the southern Amazon, a region of substantial deforestation. These quantified relationships can be used for model evaluation and further exploration of biosphere-atmosphere interactions in Earth System Models. 
 Land surface changes can have substantial impacts on biosphere–atmosphere interactions. In South America, rainforests abundantly emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which, when coupled with pyrogenic emissions from deforestation fires, can have substantial impacts on regional air quality. We use novel and long-term satellite records of five trace gases, namely isoprene (C5H8), formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in addition to aerosol optical depth (AOD), vegetation (land cover and leaf area index), and burned area. We characterise the impacts of biogenic and pyrogenic emissions on atmospheric composition for the period 2001 to 2019 in the southern Amazon, a region of substantial deforestation. The seasonal cycle for all of the atmospheric constituents peaks in the dry season (August–October), and the year-to-year variability in CO, HCHO, NO2, and AOD is strongly linked to the burned area. We find a robust relationship between the broadleaf forest cover and total column C5H8 (R2 = 0.59), while the burned area exhibits an approximate fifth root power law relationship with tropospheric column NO2 (R2 = 0.32) in the dry season. Vegetation and burned area together show a relationship with HCHO (R2 = 0.23). Wet-season AOD and CO follow the forest cover distribution. The land surface variables are very weakly correlated with CH3OH, suggesting that other factors drive its spatial distribution. Overall, we provide a detailed observational quantification of biospheric process influences on southern Amazon regional atmospheric composition, which in future studies can be used to help constrain the underpinning processes in Earth system models."
10.5194/acp-24-11103-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究使用系留气球测量了格陵兰岛冰盖中央地区云层以下的气溶胶垂直剖面。研究发现，由于极地地区表面的辐射冷却，大气边界层内存在稳定的层结，导致云层与近地表环境分离。这种分离层的存在使得地表气溶胶测量结果无法代表云层附近或云层内部的气溶胶。研究结果表明，在格陵兰岛中央地区夏季，这种分离层出现的频率为49%，这意味着地表气溶胶测量结果在半数时间内无法准确描述与云层相关的氣溶膠。该研究强调了垂直气溶胶测量对于理解极地地区气溶胶对云层性质影响的重要性。,"['aerosol', 'cloud', 'Greenland Ice Sheet', 'melt', 'tethered balloon', 'in situ measurements', 'vertical profiles', 'atmospheric boundary layer', 'decoupling layers']",Heather Guy;Andrew S. Martin;Erik Olson;Ian M. Brooks;Ryan R. Neely III,Measurement report: In situ vertical profiles of below-cloud aerosol over the central Greenland Ice Sheet,"Aerosol particles impact cloud properties which influence Greenland Ice Sheet melt. Understanding the aerosol population that interacts with clouds is important for constraining future melt. Measurements of aerosols at cloud height over Greenland are rare, and surface measurements are often used to investigate cloud–aerosol interactions. We use a tethered balloon to measure aerosols up to cloud base and show that surface measurements are often not equivalent to those just below the cloud. 
 Surface radiative cooling in polar regions can generate persistent stability in the atmospheric boundary layer. Stable layers below clouds can decouple the cloud layer from the near-surface environment. Under these conditions, surface aerosol measurements are not necessarily representative of the near-cloud or intra-cloud aerosol populations. To better understand the variability in the vertical structure of aerosol properties over the central Greenland Ice Sheet, in situ measurements of aerosol particle size distributions up to cloud base were made at Summit Station in July and August 2023. These measurements identified distinct vertical aerosol layers between the surface- and cloud-base-associated thermodynamic decoupling layers. Such decoupling layers occur 49 % of the time during the summer in central Greenland, suggesting that surface aerosol measurements are insufficient for describing the cloud-relevant aerosol population half of the time. Experience during this first measurement season demonstrated the ability of a tethered-balloon platform to operate effectively under icing conditions and at low surface pressure (< 680 hPa). The results presented here illustrate the value of vertically resolved in situ measurements of aerosol properties in developing a nuanced understanding of the aerosol effects on cloud properties in polar regions."
10.5194/acp-24-11063-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究关注了青藏高原地区黑碳气溶胶的物理化学特性，重点分析了来自低海拔地区的人为排放对高原黑碳浓度、混合状态和光吸收能力的影响。研究利用了地面观测数据，结合源解析和气团轨迹分析，揭示了不同地区黑碳的化学组成差异以及人为排放对黑碳老化过程的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及到大气成分分析、卫星观测和空气质量监测等方面。,"['Black carbon', 'Aerosol', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Light absorption', 'Mixing state', 'Tibetan Plateau']",Jinbo Wang;Jiaping Wang;Yuxuan Zhang;Tengyu Liu;Xuguang Chi;Xin Huang;Dafeng Ge;Shiyi Lai;Caijun Zhu;Lei Wang;Qiaozhi Zha;Ximeng Qi;Wei Nie;Congbin Fu;Aijun Ding,Impacts of elevated anthropogenic emissions on physicochemical characteristics of black-carbon-containing particles over the Tibetan Plateau,"In this study, we found large spatial discrepancies in the physical and chemical properties of black carbon over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Elevated anthropogenic emissions from low-altitude regions can significantly change the mass concentration, mixing state and chemical composition of black-carbon-containing aerosol in the TP region, further altering its light absorption ability. Our study emphasizes the vulnerability of remote plateau regions to intense anthropogenic influences. 
 Black carbon (BC) in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region has distinct climate effects that strongly depend on its mixing state. The aging processes of BC in the TP are subject to emissions from various regions, resulting in considerable variability of its mixing state and physicochemical properties. However, the mechanism and magnitude of this effect are not yet clear. In this study, field observations on physicochemical properties of BC-containing particles (PMBC) were conducted in the northeast (Xihai) and southeast (Lulang) regions of the TP to investigate the impacts of transported emissions from lower-altitude areas on BC characteristics in the TP. Large spatial discrepancies were found in the chemical composition of PMBC. Both sites showed higher concentrations of PMBC when they were affected by transported air masses outside the TP but with diverse chemical composition. Source apportionment for organic aerosol (OA) suggested that primary OA in the northeastern TP was attributed to hydrocarbon OA (HOA) from anthropogenic emissions, while it was dominated by biomass burning OA (BBOA) in the southeastern TP. Regarding secondary aerosol, a marked enhancement in nitrate fraction was observed on aged BC coating in Xihai when the air masses were brought by updrafts and easterly winds from lower-altitude areas. With the development of boundary layer, the enhanced turbulent mixing promoted the elevation of anthropogenic pollutants. In contrast to Xihai, the thickly coated BC in Lulang was mainly caused by elevation and transportation of biomass burning plumes from south Asia, showing a large contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The distinct transported emissions lead to substantial variations of both chemical composition and light absorption ability of BC across the TP. The thicker coating and higher mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of PMBC in air masses elevated from lower-altitude regions reveal the promoted BC aging processes and their impacts on the mixing state and light absorption of BC in the TP. These findings emphasize the vulnerability of plateau regions to influences of elevated emissions, leading to significant changes in BC concentration, mixing states and light absorption across the TP, all of which need to be considered in the evaluation of BC radiative effects for the TP region."
10.5194/acp-24-11045-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注城市公交车排放的颗粒物和酸性分子，并利用先进的排放测量技术（如Go:PAM反应器、CIMS和FIGAERO）对这些排放物进行在线化学表征。研究发现，虽然替代燃料（压缩天然气和生物燃料）可以减少新鲜颗粒物的排放，但所有燃料都会导致二次空气污染。研究重点关注了二次有机气溶胶的形成，并强调了在评估未来交通技术的环境影响时，需要考虑未受监管的化合物和二次污染物的形成。,"['particulate matter', 'acidic molecules', 'air quality', 'emission measurement', 'chemical composition', 'secondary organic aerosol', 'Go:PAM', 'CIMS', 'FIGAERO']",Liyuan Zhou;Qianyun Liu;Christian M. Salvador;Michael Le Breton;Mattias Hallquist;Jian Zhen Yu;Chak K. Chan;Åsa M. Hallquist,Online characterization of primary and secondary emissions of particulate matter and acidic molecules from a modern fleet of city buses,"Our research on city bus emissions reveals that alternative fuels (compressed natural gas and biofuels) reduce fresh particle emissions compared to diesel. However, all fuels lead to secondary air pollution. Aiming at guiding better environmental policies, we studied 76 buses using advanced emission measurement techniques. This work sheds light on the complex effects of bus fuels on urban air quality, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluations of future transportation technologies. 
 The  potential impact of transitioning from conventional fossil fuel to a non-fossil-fuel vehicle fleet was investigated by measuring primary emissions via extractive sampling of bus plumes and assessing secondary mass formation using the Gothenburg Potential Aerosol Mass (Go:PAM) reactor from 76 in-use transit buses. Online chemical characterization of gaseous and particulate emissions from these buses was conducted using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) with acetate as the reagent ion, coupled with the Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO). Acetate reagent ion chemistry selectively ionizes acidic compounds, including organic and inorganic acids, as well as nitrated and sulfated organics. A significant reduction (48 %–98 %) in fresh particle emissions was observed in buses utilizing compressed natural gas (CNG), biodiesels like rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), and hybrid-electric HVO (HVOHEV) compared to diesel (DSL). However, secondary particle formation from photooxidation of emissions was substantial across all the fuel types. The median ratio of particle mass emission factors of aged to fresh emissions increased in the following order: DSL buses at 4.0, HVO buses at 6.7, HVOHEV buses at 10.5, RME buses at 10.8, and CNG buses at 84. Of the compounds that can be identified by CIMS, fresh gaseous emissions from all Euro V/EEV (Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle) buses, regardless of fuel type, were dominated by nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrous acid (HONO), nitric acid (HNO3), and isocyanic acid (HNCO), alongside small monoacids (C1−C3). Notably, the emission of nitrogen-containing compounds was lower in Euro VI buses equipped with more advanced emission control technologies. Secondary gaseous organic acids correlated strongly with gaseous HNO3 signals (R2=0.85–0.99) in Go:PAM, but their moderate to weak correlations with post-photooxidation secondary particle mass suggest that they are not reliable tracers of secondary organic aerosol formation from bus exhaust. Our study highlights that non-regulated compounds and secondary pollutant formation, not currently addressed in legislation, are crucial considerations in the evaluation of environmental impacts of future fuel and engine technology shifts."

Significant positive correlations between EPFRs and the water-soluble oxidative potential of PM2.5 were found, primarily attributable to the water-soluble fractions of EPFRs. These findings emphasize understanding EPFRs' atmospheric evolution for climate and health impacts. 
 Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) represent a novel class of hazardous substances, posing risks to human health and the environment. In this study, we investigated the EPFRs in ambient fine, coarse, and total suspended particles (PM2.5, PM10, and TSPs) in the rural North China Plain, where local primary emissions of EPFRs were limited. We observed that the majority of EPFRs occurred in PM2.5. Moreover, distinct seasonal patterns and higher g factors of EPFRs were found compared to those in urban environments, suggesting unique characteristics of EPFRs in rural areas. The source apportionment analyses revealed atmospheric oxidation as the largest contributor (33.6 %) to EPFRs. A large water-soluble fraction (35.2 %) of EPFRs was determined, potentially resulting from the formation of more oxidized EPFRs through atmospheric oxidation processes during long-range or regional transport. Additionally, significant positive correlations were observed between EPFRs and the oxidative potential of water-soluble PM2.5 measured by dithiothreitol-depletion and hydroxyl-generation assays, likely attributable to the water-soluble fractions of EPFRs. Overall, our findings reveal the prevalence of water-soluble EPFRs in rural areas and underscore the fact that atmospheric oxidation processes can modify their properties, such as increasing their water solubility. This evolution may alter their roles in contributing to the oxidative potential of PM2.5 and potentially also influence their impact on climate-related cloud chemistry."
10.5194/acp-24-10815-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究利用气溶胶化学物种监测仪（ACSM）数据，结合有机物和硫酸盐离子正矩阵分解（PMF）技术，对都柏林港口区域的亚微米气溶胶化学成分和来源进行了研究。研究发现，船舶排放可分为两种类型：富硫酸盐型（S-Ship）和富有机物型（O-Ship）。富硫酸盐型排放主要来自使用重油的船舶，富有机物型排放主要来自使用低硫燃料的船舶。研究还发现，船舶排放对该区域PM1浓度有显著贡献，尤其是富有机物型排放，其频率远高于富硫酸盐型排放。,"['air quality monitoring', 'aerosol chemical composition', 'source apportionment', 'PMF', 'ship emissions', 'sulfate', 'organic aerosol']",Kirsten N.

Two distinct types of ship emissions were identified and characterised: sulfate-rich plumes from the use of heavy fuel oil with scrubbers and organic-rich plumes from the use of low-sulfur fuels. The latter were more frequent, emitting double the particle number and having a typical V / Ni ratio for ship emission. 
 Source apportionment quantitatively links pollution to its source but can be difficult to perform in areas like ports where emissions from shipping and other port-related activities are intrinsically linked. Here we present the analysis of aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) data using combined organic and sulfate ion positive matrix factorisation (PMF) during an intensive measurement campaign in Dublin Port. Two main types of ship emissions were identified by this technique: sulfate-rich (S-Ship) and organic-rich (O-Ship). The S-Ship emissions were attributed to heavy fuel oil use and are characterised by particles with standard V/Ni ratios from 2.7–3.9 and a large fraction of acidic sulfate aerosol. The O-Ship emissions were attributed to low-sulfur fuel types and were comprised mostly of organic aerosol (OA) with the V/Ni ratios ranging only from 0–2.3. O-Ship plumes occurred over 3 times more frequently than S-Ship plumes during the measurement period. A third minor ship emission factor (X-Ship) was resolved by PMF but not clearly attributable to any specific fuel type. Overall, ship plumes had PM1 concentrations in the range 4–252 µg m−3, with extreme concentrations usually lasting for 5–35 min. Despite their short duration, shipping emission plumes were frequent and contributed to at least 28 % of PM1 (i.e. 14 % O-Ship, 12 % S-Ship, and 2 % X-Ship). Moreover, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) and black carbon could also originate, in part, from shipping-related activities such as ferry traffic and heavy-goods vehicles, suggesting that the overall contribution of shipping activity to ambient PM1 is likely higher, upwards of 47 %."

Previous work has developed a new machine learning method for measuring supercooled liquid water in Antarctic clouds using simple lidar observations. We evaluate this technique using a lidar dataset from Christchurch, New Zealand, and develop an updated algorithm for accurate supercooled liquid water detection at mid-latitudes. 
 The use of depolarization lidar to measure atmospheric volume depolarization ratio (VDR) is a common technique to classify cloud phase (liquid or ice). Previous work using a machine learning framework, applied to peak properties derived from co-polarized attenuated backscatter data, has been demonstrated to effectively detect supercooled-liquid-water-containing clouds (SLCCs). However, the training data from Davis Station, Antarctica, include no warm liquid water clouds (WLWCs), potentially limiting the model's accuracy in regions where WLWCs are present. In this work, we apply the same framework used on the Davis data to a 9-month micro-pulse lidar dataset collected in Ōtautahi / Christchurch,  Aotearoa / New Zealand, a location which includes WLWC. We then evaluate the results relative to a reference VDR cloud-phase mask. We found that the Davis model performed relatively poorly at detecting SLCC with a recall score of 0.18, often misclassifying WLWC as SLCC. The performance of our new model, trained using data from Ōtautahi / Christchurch, displays recall scores as high as 0.88 for identification of SLCC, although it generally underestimates SLCC occurrence. The overall performance of the new model highlights the effectiveness of the machine learning technique when appropriate training data relevant to the location are used."

The data are automatically calibrated by a newly implemented data processing system. The accuracies of the mid-cost instruments vary from 1.0 to 2.4 ppm for hourly afternoon measurements. Our model–data analyses highlight prospects for integrating mid-cost instrument data with high-precision measurements to improve fine-scale CO2 emission quantification in urban areas. 
 To effectively monitor highly heterogeneous urban CO2 emissions using atmospheric observations, there is a need to deploy cost-effective CO2 sensors at multiple locations within the city with sufficient accuracy to capture the concentration gradients in urban environments. These dense measurements could be used as input of an atmospheric inversion system for the quantification of emissions at the sub-city scale or to separate specific sectors. Such quantification would offer valuable insights into the efficacy of local initiatives and could also identify unknown emission hotspots that require attention. Here we present the development and evaluation of a mid-cost CO2 instrument designed for continuous monitoring of atmospheric CO2 concentrations with a target accuracy of 1 ppm for hourly mean measurements. We assess the sensor sensitivity in relation to environmental factors such as humidity, pressure, temperature and CO2 signal, which leads to the development of an effective calibration algorithm. Since July 2020, eight mid-cost instruments have been installed within the city of Paris and its vicinity to provide continuous CO2 measurements, complementing the seven high-precision cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) stations that have been in operation since 2016. A data processing system, called CO2calqual, has been implemented to automatically handle data quality control, calibration and storage, which enables the management of extensive real-time CO2 measurements from the monitoring network. Colocation assessments with the high-precision instrument show that the accuracies of the eight mid-cost instruments are within the range of 1.0 to 2.4 ppm for hourly afternoon (12:00–17:00 UTC) measurements. The long-term stability issues require manual data checks and instrument maintenance. The analyses show that CO2 measurements can provide evidence for underestimations of CO2 emissions in the Paris region and a lack of several emission point sources in the emission inventory. Our study demonstrates promising prospects for integrating mid-cost measurements along with high-precision data into the subsequent atmospheric inverse modeling to improve the accuracy of quantifying the fine-scale CO2 emissions in the Paris metropolitan area."

Our findings suggest that such a satellite mission is highly capable of resolving individual wave parameters and could give new insights into the role of gravity waves in general atmospheric circulation and atmospheric processes. 
 In the past, satellite climatologies of gravity waves (GWs) have initiated progress in their representation in global models. However, these could not provide the phase speed and direction distributions needed for a better understanding of the interaction between GWs and the large-scale winds directly. The ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT could provide such observations. CAIRT would use a limb-imaging Michelson interferometer resolving a wide spectral range, allowing temperature and trace gas mixing ratio measurements. With the proposed instrument design, a vertical resolution of 1 km, along-track sampling of 50 km, and across-track sampling of 25 km in a 400 km wide swath will be achieved. In particular, this allows for the observation of three-dimensional (3D), GW-resolving temperature fields throughout the middle atmosphere.In this work, we present the methodology for the GW analysis of CAIRT observations using a limited-volume 3D sinusoidal fit (S3D) wave analysis technique. We assess the capability of CAIRT to provide high-quality GW fields by the generation of synthetic satellite observations from high-resolution model data and comparison of the synthetic observations to the original model fields. For the assessment, wavelength spectra, phase speed spectra, horizontal distributions, and zonal means of GW momentum flux (GWMF) are considered. The atmospheric events we use to exemplify the capabilities of CAIRT are the 2006 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropics, and the mesospheric preconditioning phase of the 2019 SSW event.Our findings indicate that CAIRT would provide highly reliable observations not only of global-scale GW distributions and drag patterns but also of specific wave events and their associated wave parameters. Even under worse-than-expected noise levels of the instrument, the resulting GW measurements are highly consistent with the original model data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimated GW parameters can be used for ray tracing, which physically extends the horizontal coverage of the observations beyond the orbit tracks."

To evaluate the practical application value of these data, it is necessary to assess their quality. This study evaluates the refractivity profile data quality from 8 YUNYAO satellites. By using the ""three-cornered hat"" (3CH) method and comparing with data from Metop-C and COSMIC-2, it was found that the YUNYAO GNSS-RO data has high data quality. 
 GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Radio Occultation (RO) data is an important component of numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. To incorporate more GNSS RO data into NWP systems, commercial RO data has become an excellent option. Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. (YUNYAO) plans to launch a meteorological constellation of 90 satellites equipped with GNSS-RO instruments, which will significantly increase the amount of GNSS-RO data in NWP systems. This study evaluates the quality of neutral atmosphere refractivity profiles from YUNYAO satellites Y003 to Y010 during the period from May 1 to July 31, 2023. Compared with the refractivity calculated from ERA5, the absolute value of the mean bias (MB) for YUNYAO refractivity data is generally less than 1.5 % between 0 and 40 km, and close to 0 between 4 and 40 km. The standard deviation (SD) is less than 3.4 %, and there are differences in the SDs for different GNSS satellites, especially in the lower troposphere and the stratosphere. Second, the refractivity error SD of YUNYAO RO data is estimated using the ""three-cornered hat"" (3CH) method and multiple data sets. In the pressure range of 1000–10 hPa, the refractivity error SD of YUNYAO RO data is below 2.6 %, and the differences in refractivity error SD among different GNSS satellites do not exceed 0.5 %. Finally, compared to COSMIC-2 and Metop-C RO data, YUNYAO RO data exhibit consistent refractivity error SD and are smaller within 300–50 hPa."

Lunt;Liang Feng;Paul I. Palmer;Frank Hase,Greenhouse gas column observations from a portable spectrometer in Uganda,"We used a Bruker EM27/SUN spectrometer within an automated weatherproof enclosure to measure greenhouse gas column concentrations over a 3-month period in Jinja, Uganda. The portability of the EM27/SUN allows us to evaluate satellite and model data in locations not covered by traditional validation networks. This is of particular value in tropical Africa, where extensive terrestrial ecosystems are a significant store of carbon and play a key role in the atmospheric budgets of CO2 and CH4. 
 The extensive terrestrial ecosystems of tropical Africa are a significant store of carbon and play a key but uncertain role in the atmospheric budgets of carbon dioxide and methane. As ground-based observations in the tropics are scarce compared with other parts of the world, recent studies have instead made use of satellite observations assimilated into atmospheric chemistry and transport models to conclude that methane emissions from this geographical region have increased since 2010 as a result of increased wetland extent, accounting for up to a third of global methane growth, and that the tropical Africa region dominates net carbon emission across the tropics. These studies critically rely on the accuracy of satellite datasets, such as those from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), and the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), along with results from atmospheric transport models, over a geographical region where there are little independent data to test the robustness of published results.In this paper we present the first ground-based observations of greenhouse gas column concentrations over East Africa, obtained using a portable Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer during a deployment covering the first few months of 2020 in Jinja, Uganda. We operated the instrument near autonomously by way of an automated weatherproof enclosure and observed total atmospheric column concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, as well as carbon monoxide, a useful proxy for emissions from incomplete combustion processes in the region. We discuss the performance of the combined enclosure and spectrometer system that we deployed in Jinja to obtain these data and show comparisons of our ground-based observations with satellite datasets from OCO-2 and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) for carbon dioxide and TROPOMI for methane and carbon monoxide, whilst also comparing our results with concentration data from the GEOS-Chem and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) atmospheric inversions that provide a means of increasing spatial and temporal coverage where satellite data are not available. For our measurement period, we find mean differences in XCO2 between OCO-2 and the EM27/SUN of −0.29 % and between OCO-3 and the EM27/SUN of −0.28 %. In the case of TROPOMI, the mean difference in XCH4 that we find between TROPOMI and the EM27/SUN is −0.44 %, whilst for XCO the mean difference is −5.65 %. In each of these cases, the mean difference observed between the satellite and ground-based column concentrations is either close to or within the precision and accuracy requirements for the respective missions. With regard to the model and reanalysis comparisons with the EM27/SUN column concentrations, we see mean differences from the EM27/SUN of a global GEOS-Chem inversion for XCO2 of −0.08 %, a regional high-resolution GEOS-Chem inversion for XCH4 of −0.22 %, and the CAMS global reanalysis for XCO of −9.79 %. Our results demonstrate the value of ground-based observations of total column concentrations and show that the combined EM27/SUN and enclosure system employed would be suitable for acquisition of the longer-term observations needed to rigorously evaluate satellite observations and model and reanalysis calculations over tropical Africa."

However, the potential of GPS data has been limited by its partially fragmented availability and unreliable metadata. A new dataset, spanning 1995–2021, offers consistently processed coordinate time series for 286 GPS sites, promising to enhance future geodynamic research. 
 For nearly three decades, geodetic GNSS measurements in Antarctica have provided direct observations of bedrock displacement, which is linked to various geodynamic processes, including plate motion, post-seismic deformation and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Previous geodynamic studies in Antarctica, especially those pertaining to GIA, have been constrained by the limited availability of GNSS data. This is due to the fact that GNSS data are collected by a wide range of institutions and network operators, with the raw observational data either not publicly available or scattered across various repositories. Further, the metadata necessary for rigorous data processing has often not been available or reliable. Consequently, the potential of GNSS observations for geodynamic studies in Antarctica has not been fully exploited yet. Here, we present consistently processed coordinate time series for GNSS sites in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic region for the time span from 1995 to 2021. The data set is composed of 286 continuous and episodic sites, with 258 sites having a time span longer than three years. The coordinate time series were obtained from a combination of four independent processing solutions using different GNSS software and products, allowing the identification of inconsistencies in individual solutions. From these, we infer a reliable and robust combined solution. A key issue was the thorough reassessment of station metadata to minimise artefacts and biases in the coordinate time series. The resulting data set provides coordinate time series with unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage, promising significant advancements in future geodynamic studies."

Van Dijk,Enhancing long-term vegetation monitoring in Australia: a new approach for harmonising the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer normalised-difference vegetation (NVDI) with MODIS NDVI,"Understanding vegetation response to environmental change requires accurate, long-term data on vegetation condition (VC). We evaluated existing satellite VC datasets over Australia and found them lacking, so we developed a new VC dataset for Australia, AusENDVI. It can be used for studying Australia's changing vegetation dynamics and downstream impacts on the carbon and water cycles, and it provides a reliable foundation for further research into the drivers of vegetation change. 
 Long-term, reliable datasets of satellite-based vegetation condition are essential for understanding terrestrial ecosystem responses to global environmental change, particularly in Australia, which is characterised by diverse ecosystems and strong interannual climate variability. We comprehensively evaluate several existing global Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalised-difference vegetation index (NDVI) products for their suitability for long-term vegetation monitoring in Australia. Comparisons with the MODIS NDVI highlight significant deficiencies, particularly over densely vegetated regions. Moreover, all the assessed products failed to adequately reproduce the interannual variability in the pre-MODIS era as indicated by Landsat NDVI anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach to calibrating and harmonising NOAA's Climate Data Record of AVHRR NDVI to the MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI for Australia using a gradient-boosting decision tree ensemble method. Two versions of the datasets are developed, one incorporating climate data in the predictors (“AusENDVI-clim”: Australian Empirical NDVI-climate) and another that is independent of climate data (“AusENDVI-noclim”). These datasets, spanning 1982–2013 at a spatial resolution of 0.05° and with a monthly time step, exhibit strong correlations (r2=0.89–0.94) and low mean errors compared with MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI (mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.014–0.028, RMSE = 0.021–0.046), accurately reproducing seasonal cycles over densely vegetated regions. Furthermore, they closely replicate the interannual variability in vegetation condition in the pre-MODIS era. A reliable method for gap-filling the AusENDVI record is also developed that leverages climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and woody-cover fraction predictors. The resulting synthetic NDVI dataset shows excellent agreement with the MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI and the recalibrated AVHRR NDVI time series (r2=0.82–0.95, MAE = 0.016–0.029, RMSE = 0.039–0.041). Finally, we provide a complete 41-year dataset where the gap-filled AusENDVI-clim from January 1982 to February 2000 is joined with the MODIS MCD43A4 NDVI from March 2000 to December 2022. Analysing 40-year per-pixel trends in Australia's annual maximum NDVI revealed increasing values, and shifts in the timing, of the annual peak NDVI across most of the continent, underscoring the dataset's potential to address crucial questions regarding the changing vegetation phenology and its drivers. The AusENDVI dataset can be used for studying Australia's changing vegetation dynamics and downstream impacts on the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, and it provides a reliable foundation for further research into the drivers of vegetation change.

 Recent global fire activity has highlighted the importance of understanding fire dynamics across time and space, with records of past fire (palaeofire) providing valuable insights to inform current and future management challenges. New records from the recent increase in palaeofire studies from Australia and surrounds have not been captured in any database for broader comparisons, and Australasia is poorly represented in current international databases used for global modelling of palaeofire trends.

 Safe and secure carbon dioxide (CO2) storage is likely to be critical for mitigating some of the most dangerous effects of climate change. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in activity associated with reservoir characterization and site selection for large-scale CO2 storage projects across the globe. These prospective storage sites tend to be terrestrial sites selected for their optimal structural, petrophysical, and geochemical trapping potential. However, it has also been suggested that storing CO2 in reservoirs within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), characterized by high pressures and low temperatures (e.g., Arctic or marine environments), could provide natural thermodynamic and solubility barriers to gas leakage. Evaluating the prospect of commercial-scale, long-term storage of CO2 in the GHSZ requires reservoir-scale modelling capabilities designed to account for the unique physics and thermodynamics associated with these systems. We have developed the HYDRATE flow mode and accompanying fully implicit parallel well model in the massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model CO2 injection into the marine GHSZ. We have applied these capabilities to a set of CO2 injection scenarios designed to reveal the challenges and opportunities for commercial-scale CO2 storage in the GHSZ.

It better simulates both lake conditions and over-lake atmospheric conditions. More importantly, the study highlights three critical 3D lake processes—ice movement, heat transport, and turbulent mixing—as essential for accurately simulating lake-atmosphere interactions and the Great Lakes’ winter climate. 
 The Laurentian Great Lakes significantly influence the climate of the Midwest and Northeast United States, due to their vast thermal inertia, moisture source potential, and unique heat and moisture flux dynamics. This study presents a newly developed coupled lake-ice-atmosphere (CLIAv1) modeling system for the Great Lakes by coupling the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) regional climate model (RCM) with the three-dimensional (3D) Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) and investigates the impact of coupled dynamics on simulating the Great Lakes' winter climate. By integrating 3D lake hydrodynamics, CLIAv1 addresses the limitations of traditional one-dimensional (1D) lake and demonstrates superior performance in reproducing observed LSTs, ice cover distribution, and the vertical thermal structure of the Great Lakes compared to the NU-WRF model coupled with the default 1D Lake Ice Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS). CLIAv1 also enhances simulation of over-lake atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, wind speed, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, underscoring the importance of resolving complex lake dynamics for reliable climate projections. More importantly, this study addresses the crucial question about what are the key processes influencing lake thermal structure and ice cover that are missed by 1D lake models but effectively captured by 3D lake models. Through process-oriented numerical experiments, we identify key 3D hydrodynamic processes – ice transport, heat advection, and shear production in turbulence – that explain the superiority of 3D lake models over 1D lake models, particularly in cold season performance and lake-atmosphere interactions. Properly resolving these processes using 3D hydrodynamic model is crucial for successfully simulating the lake-ice-atmosphere coupled Great Lakes winter system. This research underscores the necessity of incorporating 3D hydrodynamic models in RCMs to improve our predictive understanding of the Great Lakes' response to climate change. The findings advocate for a shift towards high-resolution, physics-based modeling approaches to ensure accurate future climate and limnological projections for large freshwater systems."

Wick,DC Electric Fields Promote Biodegradation of Waterborne Naphthalene in Biofilter Systems,"Biofiltration is a simple and low-cost method for the cleanup of contaminated water. However, the reduced availability of dissolved chemicals to surface-attached degrader bacteria may limit its efficient use at certain hydraulic loadings. When a direct current (DC) electric field is applied to an immersed packed bed, it invokes electrokinetic processes, such as electroosmotic water flow (EOF). EOF is a surface-charge-induced plug-flow-shaped movement of pore fluids. It acts at a nanometer distance above surfaces and allows the change of microscale pressure-driven flow profiles and, hence, the availability of dissolved contaminants to microbial degraders. In laboratory percolation columns, we assessed the effects of a weak DC electric field (E = 0.5 V·cm–1) on the biodegradation of waterborne naphthalene (NAH) by surface-attached Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a. To vary NAH bioavailability, we used different NAH concentrations (C0 = 2.7, 5.1, or 7.8 × 10–5 mol·L–1) and Darcy velocities typical for biofiltration (U¯ = 0.2–1.2 × 10–4 m·s–1). In DC-free controls, we observed higher specific degradation rates (qc) at higher NAH concentrations. The qc depended on U¯, suggesting bioavailability restrictions depending on the hydraulic residence times. DC fields consistently increased qc and resulted in linearly increasing benefits up to 55% with rising hydraulic loadings relative to controls. We explain these biodegradation benefits by EOF-altered microscale flow profiles allowing for better NAH provision to bacteria attached to the collectors even though the EOF was calculated to be 100–800 times smaller than bulk water flow. Our data suggest that electrokinetic approaches may give rise to future technical applications that allow regulating biodegradation, for example, in response to fluctuating hydraulic loadings."

We examined associations between biomarkers of phthalate exposures and metabolic alterations using untargeted metabolomics in 99 pregnant women and 86 newborns [mean (SD) gestational age = 39.5 (1.5) weeks] in the PROTECT cohort. Maternal urinary phthalate metabolites were quantified using isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), while metabolic profiles in maternal and cord blood plasma were characterized via reversed-phase LC-MS. Multivariable linear regression was used in metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) to identify individual metabolic features associated with elevated phthalate levels, while clustering and correlation network analyses were used to discern the interconnectedness of biologically relevant features. In the MWAS adjusted for maternal age and prepregnancy BMI, we observed significant associations between specific phthalates, namely, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and 34 maternal plasma metabolic features. These associations predominantly included upregulation of fatty acids, amino acids, purines, or their derivatives and downregulation of ceramides and sphingomyelins. In contrast, fewer significant associations were observed with metabolic features in cord blood. Correlation network analysis highlighted the overlap of features associated with phthalates and those identified as differentiating markers for preterm birth in a previous study. Overall, our findings underscore the complex impact of phthalate exposures on maternal and fetal metabolism, highlighting metabolomics as a tool for understanding associated biological processes. Future research should focus on expanding the sample size, exploring the effects of phthalate mixtures, and validating identified metabolic features in larger, more diverse populations."

However, since the 1970s, saltmarsh wetlands in coastal China have been seriously threatened by the invasive Spartina alterniflora. Although the Chinese government has initiated a nationwide S. alterniflora removal project, the potential benefits and risks of this project remain unknown. Here, we focus on the Yangtze River Estuary Saltmarsh Wetland (YRESW) and simulate its future ecosystem structure, function, and quality under three scenarios based on remote sensing and field investigation data. The simulation scenarios include the absence of a removal project, natural regeneration postproject (NRP), and planted restoration postproject. The results show that the removal project will reverse the escalating invasion trend of S. alterniflora in the YRESW. Compared to the baseline year of 2022, there is a remarkable increase in ecosystem structure (composition: +107%, configuration: +27%) and ecosystem quality (+10.5%) under the NRP scenario. Although blue carbon storage sharply decreases under both scenarios involving project implementation, planted restoration can restore YRESW’s carbon sequestration capacity to 0.19 Tg C per year, achieving 87% of the carbon storage present before the project. This study underscores the necessity of comprehensive and detailed risk assessments in ecological projects, particularly when dominant species are involved.

Herein, we developed a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from on-road vehicles as well as their mitigation potentials based on real-world databases and up-to-date policy scenarios. Total CO2 emissions of China’s road transportation are estimated to be 1102 million tons (Mt) in 2022 and will continue to increase if future strategies are implemented as usual. Under current development trend and announced policy controls (i.e., integrated scenario), annual CO2 emissions are estimated to peak at 1235 Mt in 2025 and then decline to approximately 200 Mt around 2050. The scenario analysis indicates that electrification of passenger vehicles emerges as the most imperative decarbonization strategy for achieving carbon peak before 2030. Additionally, fuel economy improvement of conventional vehicles is identified to be effective for CO2 emission reduction for trucks until 2035 while new energy vehicle promotion shows great mitigation potentials in the long term.

Both HO• and Cl• can spontaneously react with aromatic compounds via radical adduct formation (RAF), hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and single electron transfer (SET) pathways. The SET reactions of Cl• were more thermodynamically favorable than HO•, but contrary results were obtained for HAT reactions.

The important role of SET in the HO• reactions with aromatic compounds was further verified by accurately calculating the solvation free energy of HO•/HO– and experimentally tracking the radical cations, which were generally neglected in previous studies. Meanwhile, the ΔGaq‡ value of each reaction pathway of Cl• was lower than that of HO•, resulting in  higher rate constants of Cl• with aromatic compounds than HO•.

However, despite qualitative links established between entrainment and aerosol loading, a quantitative relationship based on observational evidence remains elusive. This study utilizes aircraft observations of cumulus clouds during two field campaigns to determine the quantitative relationship between entrainment rate and aerosol loading. In both campaigns, the entrainment rate is negatively correlated with aerosol loading. It is speculated that increased aerosol loading enhances cloud edge droplet evaporation, which leads to increased buoyancy and vertical velocity within the cloud, thereby reducing the entrainment rate.

These variations are well‐explained by upper ocean silicate concentrations, with high opal ‘ballasting’ in the silicate‐deplete tropical Atlantic Ocean, and low ballasting in the silicate‐rich Southern Ocean. A plausible, testable hypothesis is that opal ballasting varies because diatoms grow thicker frustules where silicate concentrations are higher, carrying less organic carbon per unit opal. The observed pattern does not fully emerge in an advanced ocean biogeochemical model when diatom silicification is represented using a single global parameterization as a function of silicate and iron.

In these cases, the time scales are defined by dissipation of energetic electrons and effective recombination processes. The results presented in this paper were applied in the regions of pulsating aurora and polar arcs, demonstrating the fact that ionospheric conductance requires some time to form and decay. These time delays constitute an effective “inertia” in the conductance calculation which is not accounted for in many global models which assume an instantaneous connection between precipitation and conductance. Ionospheric conductance inertia influences the temporal variation in ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields, and as a result, impacts magnetosphere‐ionosphere (MI) dynamics on a global scale."

A case is selected wherein the WindBorne balloon directly sampled a jet streak associated with a tropopause polar vortex (TPV). The observed TPV merged with another TPV at the same time as a downstream Arctic cyclone (AC) redeveloped eastward. The case is used to better understand the role of the observed TPV in the evolution of the downstream AC. The assimilation of the WindBorne observations improves the forecast track and amplitude of the TPV during the ∼1 day forecast period that the TPV can be tracked as a distinct feature. The root mean square error of temperature at 350 hPa is improved by the WindBorne assimilation throughout the 2.5 day forecast period. The surface cyclone track forecast is improved by the WindBorne assimilation during the period of eastward redevelopment of the surface cyclone, and the sea level pressure RMSE in the surrounding region is reduced during the first ∼1.5 days of forecast lead time. Results demonstrate the capability of the long‐duration controllable WindBorne balloons to improve the analysis of the TPV associated with the jet streak, leading to improved forecast of both tropopause‐level and surface pressure features. Additionally, the importance of observing the upstream TPV amplitude for improving forecasts of the process of TPV merging and its impact on the evolution and longevity of the mature AC is confirmed."

Recently, there has been increasing discussion on the potential supplementation of this conventional mitigation portfolio with Solar Radiation Modification (SRM). However, the impact of SRM on conventional mitigation measures has received limited attention to date. In this study, we explore one part of this impact, the potential effect of one type of SRM, Stratospheric Aerosol Injections (SAI), on WRE. Using hourly output from the Earth System Model CNRM‐ESM2‐1, we compare WRE potential under a medium emission scenario (SSP245) and a high emission scenario (SSP585) with an SRM scenario that has SSP585 baseline conditions and uses SAI to offset warming to approximately SSP245 global warming levels. Our results suggest that SAI may affect surface wind resources by modifying large‐scale circulation patterns, such as a significant poleward jet‐shift in the Southern Hemisphere. The modeled total global WRE potential is negligibly reduced under SAI compared to the SSP‐scenarios. However, regional trends are highly variable, with large increases and decreases in WRE potential frequently reaching 12% across the globe with SAI. This study highlights potential downstream effects of SRM on climatic elements, such as wind patterns, and offers perspectives on its implications for our mitigation efforts."

This study systematically explores how interspecific interactions and herbivory influence the dominant wetland species, as well as the resultant morphological evolution and landscape configuration. To achieve this, we develop a new eco‐morphodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamics, sediment transport, bed‐level change, and vegetation dynamics. The novelty of the current model lies in newly incorporated modules to simulate biotic interactions between mangroves and saltmarshes, enabling exploration of eco‐morphodynamic feedback in mangrove‐saltmarsh ecotones in response to tidal flows and species interactions. Our results show that vertical growth rates of coexisting vegetation species are dominant factors in determining wetland dominance. When mangroves and saltmarshes exhibit comparable growth rates, mangroves typically become the dominant wetland species. Conversely, if mangroves grow more slowly than saltmarshes, they are unable to outcompete saltmarshes. Additionally, herbivory can fundamentally alter wetland dominance depending on herbivore food preferences. Our simulations further underline that saltmarsh‐dominated wetlands develop channel networks more extensively and rapidly than mangrove‐dominated systems. This pattern is also observed during species invasions, with invading saltmarshes extending channel networks, while invading mangroves inhibit ongoing network expansion. This study highlights the pivotal roles of relative growth properties and herbivory in driving ecotone development in respect to wetland dominance and channel network development at the intertidal scale."

It depends. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Assessment Report Six (AR6) took a step toward ending so‐called ‘model democracy’ by discounting climate models that are too warm over the historical period (i.e., models that ‘run hot’) when making projections of global temperature change. However, the IPCC did not address whether this procedure is reliable for other quantities. Here, we explore the implications of weighting climate models according to their skill in reproducing historical global‐mean surface temperature using three other climate variables of interest: global average precipitation change, regional average temperature change, and regional average precipitation change. We find that the temperature‐based weighting scheme leads to an improved prediction of global average precipitation, though we show that this prediction could be overconfident. On regional scales, we find a heterogeneous pattern of error reduction in future regional precipitation. This stands in sharp contrast with the broad regional pattern of error reduction in future temperature projections, though we do find regions where error is not significantly reduced. Our results demonstrate that practitioners using weighted climate model ensembles for climate projections must take care when weighting by temperature alone, lest they produce unreliable climate projections that result from an inappropriate weighting procedure."

This study investigates how copper mining influences the dispersion of these elements in the wind‐transportable fraction (<75 μm) of surface sediments across an 80 km radius. We employed a multi‐pronged approach, utilizing spatial modeling to map element distributions, exponential decay analysis to quantify concentration decline with distance, regime shift modeling to identify dispersion pattern variations, and pollution assessment to evaluate impact. Our results reveal significant mining‐driven increases in surface concentrations of copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), and arsenic (As). Notably, within the first 20 km, concentrations peaked at 1,016 mg kg⁻1 for Cu, 31 mg kg⁻1 for Mo, and a remarkable 165 mg kg⁻1 for As. Cu and Mo displayed significant dispersion, extending up to 50 km from the source. However, As exhibited the most extensive reach, traveling up to 70 km downwind, highlighting the far‐reaching ecological footprint of mining operations. Mineralogical analyses corroborated these findings, identifying mining‐related minerals in surface sediments far beyond the immediate mining area. Although pollution indices based on the proposed Local Geochemical Background reveal significant contamination across the study area, establishing accurate pre‐industrial baseline values is essential for a more reliable assessment. This study challenges the concept of “natural pollution” by demonstrating that human activities exacerbate baseline metal(loid)s levels.

 A goal of neuroscience is to obtain a causal model of the nervous system. The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome1–3 specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other, but not how strongly they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the ‘effectome’. Specifically, we propose an estimator for a linear dynamical model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to greatly improve estimation efficiency. We validate our estimator in connectome-based linear simulations and show that it recovers a linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of more biophysically realistic simulations. We then analyse the connectome to propose circuits that dominate the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that the dominant circuits involve only relatively small populations of neurons—thus, neuron-level imaging, stimulation and identification are feasible. This approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, we provide evidence that fly whole-brain dynamics are generated by a large collection of small circuits that operate largely independently of each other.

 The Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) bilayer nickelate, La3Ni2O7, was recently found to show signatures of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) at pressures above 14 GPa (ref. 1). Subsequent investigations achieved zero resistance in single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples under hydrostatic pressure conditions2–4. Yet, obvious diamagnetic signals, the other hallmark of superconductors, are still lacking owing to the filamentary nature with low superconducting volume fraction2,4,5. The presence of a new 1313 polymorph and competing R–P phases obscured proper identification of the phase for HTSC6–9. Thus, achieving bulk HTSC and identifying the phase at play are the most prominent tasks. Here we address these issues in the praseodymium (Pr)-doped La2PrNi2O7 polycrystalline samples. We find that substitutions of Pr for La effectively inhibit the intergrowth of different R–P phases, resulting in a nearly pure bilayer structure. For La2PrNi2O7, pressure-induced orthorhombic to tetragonal structural transition takes place at Pc ≈ 11 GPa, above which HTSC emerges gradually on further compression. The superconducting transition temperatures at 18–20 GPa reach

 Brains comprise complex networks of neurons and connections, similar to the nodes and edges of artificial networks. Network analysis applied to the wiring diagrams of brains can offer insights into how they support computations and regulate the flow of information underlying perception and behaviour. The completion of the first whole-brain connectome of an adult fly, containing over 130,000 neurons and millions of synaptic connections1–3, offers an opportunity to analyse the statistical properties and topological features of a complete brain. Here we computed the prevalence of two- and three-node motifs, examined their strengths, related this information to both neurotransmitter composition and cell type annotations4,5, and compared these metrics with wiring diagrams of other animals. We found that the network of the fly brain displays rich-club organization, with a large population (30% of the connectome) of highly connected neurons. We identified subsets of rich-club neurons that may serve as integrators or broadcasters of signals. Finally, we examined subnetworks based on 78 anatomically defined brain regions or neuropils.

 Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analysing electron microscopic brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative1–6, but nevertheless inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here we present a neuronal wiring diagram of a whole brain containing 5 × 107 chemical synapses7 between 139,255 neurons reconstructed from an adult female Drosophila melanogaster8,9. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages and predictions of neurotransmitter identities10–12. Data products are available for download, programmatic access and interactive browsing and have been made interoperable with other fly data resources. We derive a projectome—a map of projections between regions—from the connectome and report on tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine and descending neurons) across both hemispheres and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviours. The technologies and open ecosystem reported here set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.

 A central feature of meiosis is the pairing of homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (‘homologues’) along their lengths1–3. Recognition between homologues and their juxtaposition in space is mediated by axis-associated recombination complexes. Also, pairing must occur without entanglements among unrelated chromosomes. Here we examine homologue juxtaposition in real time by four-dimensional fluorescence imaging of tagged chromosomal loci at high spatio-temporal resolution in budding yeast. We discover that corresponding loci come together from a substantial distance (1.8 µm) and complete pairing in a very short time, about 6 min (thus, rapid homologue juxtaposition or RHJ). Homologue loci first move rapidly together (in 30 s, at speeds of roughly 60 nm s−1) into an intermediate stage corresponding to canonical 400 nm axis coalignment. After a short pause, crossover/non-crossover differentiation (crossover interference) mediates a second short, rapid transition that ultimately gives close pairing of axes at 100 nm by means of synaptonemal complex formation. Furthermore, RHJ (1) occurs after chromosomes acquire prophase chromosome organization, (2) is nearly synchronous over thirds of chromosome lengths, but (3) is asynchronous throughout the genome. Finally, cytoskeleton-mediated movement is important for the timing and distance of RHJ onset and for ensuring its normal progression. General implications for local and global aspects of pairing are discussed. Homologue juxtaposition during meiosis is examined in real time by imaging of tagged chromosomal loci at high resolution in budding yeast, showing that corresponding loci come together and complete pairing in a very short time."

 Two different hard-radiation phenomena are known to originate from thunderclouds: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs)1 and gamma-ray glows2. Both involve an avalanche of electrons accelerated to relativistic energies but are otherwise different. Glows are known to last for one to hundreds of seconds, have moderate intensities and originate from quasi-stationary thundercloud fields2–5. TGFs exhibit high intensities and have characteristic durations of tens to hundreds of microseconds6–9. TGFs often show a close association with an emission of strong radio signals10–17 and optical pulses18–21, which indicates the involvement of lightning leaders in their generation. Here we report unique observations of a different phenomenon, which we call flickering gamma-ray flashes (FGFs). FGFs resemble the usual multi-pulse TGFs22–24 but have more pulses and each pulse has a longer duration than ordinary TGFs. FGF durations span from 20 to 250 ms, which reaches the lower boundary of the gamma-ray glow duration. FGFs are radio and optically silent, which makes them distinct from normal TGFs. An FGF starts as an ordinary gamma-ray glow, then suddenly increases exponentially in intensity and turns into an unstable, ‘flickering’ mode with a sequence of pulses. FGFs could be the missing link between the gamma-ray glows and conventional TGFs, whose absence has been puzzling the atmospheric electricity community for two decades. Flickering gamma-ray flashes associated with terrestrial thunderstorms have been observed, which may be the missing link between gamma-ray glows and TGFs."

 In response to intense pressure, technology companies have enacted policies to combat misinformation1–4. The enforcement of these policies has, however, led to technology companies being regularly accused of political bias5–7. We argue that differential sharing of misinformation by people identifying with different political groups8–15 could lead to political asymmetries in enforcement, even by unbiased policies. We first analysed 9,000 politically active Twitter users during the US 2020 presidential election. Although users estimated to be pro-Trump/conservative were indeed substantially more likely to be suspended than those estimated to be pro-Biden/liberal, users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites—even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople—and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots. We find similar associations between stated or inferred conservatism and low-quality news sharing (on the basis of both expert and politically balanced layperson ratings) in 7 other datasets of sharing from Twitter, Facebook and survey experiments, spanning 2016 to 2023 and including data from 16 different countries. Thus, even under politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected. Political imbalance in enforcement need not imply bias on the part of social media companies implementing anti-misinformation policies. We find that conservatives tend to share more low-quality news through social media than liberals, and so even if technology companies enact politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected."

 The recent assembly of the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain connectome, containing more than 125,000 neurons and 50 million synaptic connections, provides a template for examining sensory processing throughout the brain1,2. Here we create a leaky integrate-and-fire computational model of the entire Drosophila brain, on the basis of neural connectivity and neurotransmitter identity3, to study circuit properties of feeding and grooming behaviours. We show that activation of sugar-sensing or water-sensing gustatory neurons in the computational model accurately predicts neurons that respond to tastes and are required for feeding initiation4. In addition, using the model to activate neurons in the feeding region of the Drosophila brain predicts those that elicit motor neuron firing5—a testable hypothesis that we validate by optogenetic activation and behavioural studies. Activating different classes of gustatory neurons in the model makes accurate predictions of how several taste modalities interact, providing circuit-level insight into aversive and appetitive taste processing. Additionally, we applied this model to mechanosensory circuits and found that computational activation of mechanosensory neurons predicts activation of a small set of neurons comprising the antennal grooming circuit, and accurately describes the circuit response upon activation of different mechanosensory subtypes6–10. Our results demonstrate that modelling brain circuits using only synapse-level connectivity and predicted neurotransmitter identity generates experimentally testable hypotheses and can describe complete sensorimotor transformations.

Hurrell,Signature of the western boundary currents in local climate variability,"Analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data demonstrate that sea surface temperature variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in local climate variability than previously indicated. 
 The western boundary currents are characterized by narrow, intense ocean jets and are among the most energetic phenomena in the world ocean. The importance of the western boundary currents to the mean climate is well established: they transport vast quantities of heat from the subtropics to the midlatitudes1, and they govern the structure of the climatological mean surface winds2–6, precipitation4–6 and extratropical storm tracks7–13. Their importance to climate variability is much less clear, as the tropospheric response to extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability is generally modest relative to the internal variability in the midlatitude atmosphere12–14. Here we exploit novel local analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data to demonstrate that SST variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in climate variability than has been indicated in previous work. Our results indicate that warm SST anomalies in the major boundary currents of both hemispheres are associated with a distinct signature of locally enhanced precipitation and rising motion anomalies that extend throughout the depth of the troposphere. The tropospheric signature closely mirrors that of ocean dynamical processes in the boundary currents. Thus, the findings indicate a distinct and robust pathway through which extratropical ocean dynamical processes influence local climate variability. The observational relationships are also reproducible in Earth system model simulations but only when the simulations are run at high spatial resolution. Analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data demonstrate that sea surface temperature variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in local climate variability than previously indicated."

 Natural disasters trigger complex chains of events within human societies1. Immediate deaths and damage are directly observed after a disaster and are widely studied, but delayed downstream outcomes, indirectly caused by the disaster, are difficult to trace back to the initial event1,2. Tropical cyclones (TCs)—that is, hurricanes and tropical storms—are widespread globally and have lasting economic impacts3–5, but their full health impact remains unknown. Here we conduct a large-scale evaluation of long-term effects of TCs on human mortality in the contiguous United States (CONUS) for all TCs between 1930 and 2015. We observe a robust increase in excess mortality that persists for 15 years after each geophysical event. We estimate that the average TC generates 7,000–11,000 excess deaths, exceeding the average of 24 immediate deaths reported in government statistics6,7. Tracking the effects of 501 historical storms, we compute that the TC climate of CONUS imposes an undocumented mortality burden that explains a substantial fraction of the higher mortality rates along the Atlantic coast and is equal to roughly 3.2–5.1% of all deaths. These findings suggest that the TC climate, previously thought to be unimportant for broader public health outcomes, is a meaningful underlying driver for the distribution of mortality risk in CONUS, especially among infants (less than 1 year of age), people 1–44 years of age, and the Black population. Understanding why TCs induce this excess mortality is likely to yield substantial health benefits.

 The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, in large part due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome1 with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome2, and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.

 Mutation of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (encoded by TET2) drives myeloid malignancy initiation and progression1–3. TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin state and activation of genes contributing to aberrant haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal4,5. However, the open chromatin observed in TET2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, leukaemic cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells5 is inconsistent with the designated role of DNA 5-methylcytosine oxidation of TET2. Here we show that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m5C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitination. TET2 depletion thereby leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub, more open chromatin and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2-mutant human leukaemia becomes dependent on this gene activation pathway, with MBD6 depletion selectively blocking proliferation of TET2-mutant leukaemic cells and largely reversing the haematopoiesis defects caused by Tet2 loss in mouse models. Together, our findings reveal a chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m5C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies. Chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A to promote an open chromatin state in TET2-deficient cells."

 Thunderstorms emit fluxes of gamma rays known as gamma-ray glows1,2, sporadically observed by aircraft1,3–7, balloons8–11 and from the ground12–18. Observations report increased gamma-ray emissions by tens of percent up to two orders of magnitude above the background, sometimes abruptly terminated by lightning discharges1,3–5. Glows are produced by the acceleration of energetic electrons in high-electric-field regions within thunderclouds8 and contribute to charge dissipation3. Glows had been considered as quasi-stationary phenomena3,5,12, with durations up to a few tens of seconds and spatial scales up to 10–20 km. However, no measurements of the full extension in space and time of a gamma-ray-glow region and their occurring frequency have been reported so far. Here we show that tropical thunderclouds over ocean and coastal regions commonly emit gamma rays for hours over areas up to a few thousand square kilometres. Emission is associated with deep convective cores; it is not uniform and continuous but shows characteristic timescales of 1–10 s and even subsecond for individual glows. The dynamics of gamma-glowing thunderclouds strongly contradicts the quasi-stationary picture of glows and instead resembles that of a huge gamma-glowing ‘boiling pot’ in both pattern and behaviour.

 A catalogue of neuronal cell types has often been called a ‘parts list’ of the brain1, and regarded as a prerequisite for understanding brain function2,3. In the optic lobe of Drosophila, rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision4,5. Here we analyse the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells, and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families (Tm, Li, and LPi)6–10 at least double in number of types. A new serpentine medulla (Sm) interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analysing the distances in high-dimensional feature space, and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features. We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object and colour vision. Connectivity with ‘boundary types’ that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development. An analysis of the Drosophila connectome yields all cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, and their rules of connectivity."

 Many animals use visual information to navigate1–4, but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction5 by integrating visual input from ER neurons6–12, which are part of the anterior visual pathway (AVP)10,13–16. Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron-microscopy data17. The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons10,14,15, which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle (AOTUsu) in the central brain; TuBu neurons9,16, which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons6–12, which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input. We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations.

 Lysosomes have crucial roles in regulating eukaryotic metabolism and cell growth by acting as signalling platforms to sense and respond to changes in nutrient and energy availability1. LYCHOS (GPR155) is a lysosomal transmembrane protein that functions as a cholesterol sensor, facilitating the cholesterol-dependent activation of the master protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)2. However, the structural basis of LYCHOS assembly and activity remains unclear. Here we determine several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of human LYCHOS, revealing a homodimeric transmembrane assembly of a transporter-like domain fused to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) domain. The class B2-like GPCR domain is captured in the apo state and packs against the surface of the transporter-like domain, providing an unusual example of a GPCR as a domain in a larger transmembrane assembly. Cholesterol sensing is mediated by a conserved cholesterol-binding motif, positioned between the GPCR and transporter domains. We reveal that the LYCHOS transporter-like domain is an orthologue of the plant PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporter family, and has greater structural similarity to plant auxin transporters than to known human transporters. Activity assays support a model in which the LYCHOS transporter and GPCR domains coordinate to sense cholesterol and regulate mTORC1 activation.

 The brain helps us survive by forming internal representations of the external world1,2. Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific external stimuli3,4. However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective5. PV interneurons differ from excitatory neurons in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)6,7. Excitatory neurons express calcium-impermeable AMPARs that contain the GluA2 subunit (encoded by GRIA2), whereas PV interneurons express receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs). Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between CP-AMPAR expression and the low feature selectivity of PV interneurons. We find low expression stoichiometry of GRIA2 mRNA relative to other subunits in PV interneurons that is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans, and causes abundant CP-AMPAR expression. Replacing CP-AMPARs in PV interneurons with calcium-impermeable AMPARs increased their orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Manipulations to induce sparse CP-AMPAR expression demonstrated that this increase was cell-autonomous and could occur with changes beyond development. Notably, excitatory–PV interneuron connectivity rates and unitary synaptic strength were unaltered by CP-AMPAR removal, which suggested that the selectivity of PV interneurons can be altered without markedly changing connectivity. In Gria2-knockout mice, in which all AMPARs are calcium-permeable, excitatory neurons showed significantly degraded orientation selectivity, which suggested that CP-AMPARs are sufficient to drive lower selectivity regardless of cell type. Moreover, hippocampal PV interneurons, which usually exhibit low spatial tuning, became more spatially selective after removing CP-AMPARs, which indicated that CP-AMPARs suppress the feature selectivity of PV interneurons independent of modality. These results reveal a new role of CP-AMPARs in maintaining low-selectivity sensory representation in PV interneurons and implicate a conserved molecular mechanism that distinguishes this cell type in the neocortex. Calcium-permeable AMPA receptors are identified to have a role in maintaining low feature selectivity in a specific population of inhibitory interneurons, and this function is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans."

 As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function. Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analysing its structure to predict that three Dm3 (refs. 1–4) and three TmY (refs. 2,4) cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity, and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical5,6 receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning7, position invariance8,9 and completion of noisy or illusory contours10,11. The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain12,13, which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision14.

 Walking is a complex motor programme involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting1–6, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear. Here, using connectome-informed models7–9 and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (‘walk-OFF’) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism (‘brake’) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning. The brake neurons, by constrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioural contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming. Two halting mechanisms, ‘walk-OFF’ and ‘brake’, are shown to be engaged by distinct neural circuits in Drosophila, in a context dependent manner."

 Ageing impairs the ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to transition from quiescence to proliferation in the adult mammalian brain. Functional decline of NSCs results in the decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration following injury during ageing1–4. Several genetic interventions have been found to ameliorate old brain function5–8, but systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs—and more generally in old cells—has not been done. Here we develop in vitro and in vivo high-throughput CRISPR–Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screens in primary cultures of young and old NSCs uncovered more than 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore the activation of old NSCs. The top gene knockouts are involved in cilium organization and glucose import. We also establish a scalable CRISPR–Cas9 screening platform in vivo, which identified 24 gene knockouts that boost NSC activation and the production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of Slc2a4, which encodes the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top intervention that improves the function of old NSCs. Glucose uptake increases in NSCs during ageing, and transient glucose starvation restores the ability of old NSCs to activate. Thus, an increase in glucose uptake may contribute to the decline in NSC activation with age. Our work provides scalable platforms to systematically identify genetic interventions that boost the function of old NSCs, including in vivo, with important implications for countering regenerative decline during ageing.

 Endosymbioses have profoundly impacted the evolution of life and continue to shape the ecology of a wide range of species. They give rise to new combinations of biochemical capabilities that promote innovation and diversification1,2. Despite the many examples of known endosymbioses across the tree of life, their de novo emergence is rare and challenging to uncover in retrospect3–5. Here we implant bacteria into the filamentous fungus Rhizopus microsporus to follow the fate of artificially induced endosymbioses. Whereas Escherichia coli implanted into the cytosol induced septum formation, effectively halting endosymbiogenesis, Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica was transmitted vertically to the progeny at a low frequency. Continuous positive selection on endosymbiosis mitigated initial fitness constraints by several orders of magnitude upon adaptive evolution. Phenotypic changes were underscored by the accumulation of mutations in the host as the system stabilized. The bacterium produced rhizoxin congeners in its new host, demonstrating the transfer of a metabolic function through induced endosymbiosis. Single-cell implantation thus provides a powerful experimental approach to study critical events at the onset of endosymbiogenesis and opens opportunities for synthetic approaches towards designing endosymbioses with desired traits.

 The study investigates the global impact of land property rights on land use efficiency (LUE), as measured by the key indicator for United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11.3.1, namely Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate. By utilizing human-land change data from 165 countries spanning the period between 1990 and 2020, we have developed a fixed effects model and employed legal origins as an instrumental variable to examine the influence of land property rights security on LUE. Our findings demonstrate that the security of land property rights significantly influences LUE, with common law countries exhibiting higher levels of LUE compared to civil law countries while controlling for other variables. Stability in property rights encourages long-term investments in infrastructure and sustainable land management practices, thereby enhancing land productivity and mitigating urban sprawl. Furthermore, safeguarding property rights limits governments’ power to expropriate lands, facilitating rational and efficient land transactions that contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

In this work, it is shown that the sub-gap states of multi-spin impurities are intimately linked, leading to unexpected behavior. 
 Understanding the interplay between individual magnetic impurities and superconductivity is crucial for bottom-up construction of novel phases of matter. Sub-gap bound states that are used in this endeavor are typically considered as independent entities that each result from the exchange scattering between the respective impurity orbitals and electrons of the superconducting condensate. Here we present experimental evidence of individual multi-spin impurities where the sub-gap states are not independent. Specifically, we find that by tuning the energy of the state closest to zero through zero, all other sub-gap states change particle-hole asymmetry as well. We show that this can be understood by including Hund’s coupling, which favors high-spin configurations, into a multi-orbital Anderson model. Unlike for the case of independent spins, the transition we observe signals the simultaneous departure of more than one quasiparticle from the impurity, while the parity of the ground state may remain unchanged. Our results show that Hund’s coupling is not only crucial in generating high-spin impurities, but also to understand the transition between two distinct ground states, and should therefore be taken into account for e.g. impurity-based band-structure engineering. Sub-gap states generated by single spins in a superconductor can be used as building blocks for quantum devices.

 Personalized treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors critically depends on the deep characterization of tumor cells from patient biopsies. Here, we comprehensively characterize a pan-cancer cohort of 150 malignant serous effusion (MSE) samples at the cellular, molecular, and functional level. We find that MSE-derived cancer cells retain the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of their corresponding primary tumors, validating their use as a patient-relevant model system for solid tumor biology. Integrative analyses reveal that baseline gene expression patterns relate to global ex vivo drug sensitivity, while high-throughput drug-induced transcriptional changes in MSE samples are indicative of drug mode of action and acquired treatment resistance. A case study exemplifies the added value of multi-modal MSE profiling for patients who lack genetically stratified treatment options.

 Given the impact of deep stratospheric intrusion on air quality, the development of more extensive trace substances to quantify stratospheric intrusion intensity can better distinguish between stratospheric ozone pollution and anthropogenic factors. The ratio of cosmogenic beryllium-10 to beryllium-7 (10Be/7Be), primarily generated in the stratosphere, has the potential to identify stratospheric air masses on the ground. Here we constructed a 10Be/7Be time-series (July 2020 to September 2021) in rainwater and aerosols from Xi’an, China. Combining in-situ pollutants, reanalysis data, and model calculations support a stratospheric origin for increased 10Be/7Be and identify it as a means of quantifying intrusion intensity. It was found that anticyclones formed by the Asian summer monsoon drive a sudden increase in deep stratospheric intrusion in spring, exacerbating ozone pollution beyond China’s air quality standards. Based on the sufficiently sensitive 10Be/7Be, it further indicates the process of six weak upper atmosphere intrusions in Xi’an during winter.

 Sea-ice surface temperature from atmospheric reanalysis has been used as an indicator of ice melt and climate change. However, its performance in atmospheric reanalyses is not fully understood in Antarctica. Here, we quantified biases in six widely-used reanalyses using satellite observations, and found strong and persistent warm biases in most reanalyses examined. Further analysis of the biases revealed two main culprits: incorrect cloud properties, and inappropriate sea-ice representation in the reanalysis products. We found that overestimated cloud simulation can contribute more than 4 K warm bias, with ERA5 exhibiting the largest warm bias. Even in reanalysis with smaller biases, this accuracy is achieved through a compensatory relationship between relatively lower cloud fraction bias and overestimated sea ice insulation effect. A dynamic downscaling simulation shows that differences in sea-ice representation can contribute a 2.3 K warm bias. The representation of ice concentration is the primary driver of the spatial distribution of biases by modulating the coupling between sea ice and clouds, as well as surface heat conduction. The lack of a snow layer in all reanalyses examined also has an impact on biases. Robust warm biases exist in Antarctic sea-ice surface temperatures across recent commonly used reanalyses, due both to differences in sea-ice concentrations and poorly represented cloud fraction for this region."

 During drought, resource managers want to know when the drought will end to make informed management decisions. However, as anthropogenic climate change has intensified drought conditions, we hypothesize it has affected drought recovery. Here, we leverage monthly self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index data across the western US derived from observations and climate models, and quantify the probability of drought recovery following severe drought. We find that the probability of drought recovery is ~25–50% lower in recent decades (2000–2021) than in the historical record (1901–1980), with at least one-third of the reduced recovery probability attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Climate model ensembles show reduced recovery probabilities in the contemporary era (2000–2040), primarily due to increased evaporative demand in non-winter months, resulting in an additional 1–4 months for droughts to recover compared with the historical record. These findings suggest climate change is slowing drought recovery, with ramifications for water management decisions and drought planning.

 Sedimentary records of Early Pleistocene (~2.6–0.8 Ma) glaciations are sparse on shelves, yet trough mouth fans on adjacent continental slopes provide a continuous record of ice-sheet and climate development throughout the Quaternary. Here, we interpret high-quality 3D seismic reflection data combined with borehole and chronostratigraphic information from a shelf-slope setting in the southwestern Barents Sea to study meltwater and sediment inputs to the deep ocean, focusing on the onset of Pleistocene glaciations. Sandy deposits were brought to the slopes of the high-latitude Bear Island Fan by a preglacial contourite-turbidite system from ⁓2.6–2.4 Ma. Muddy glacigenic debris flows document the first shelf-edge glaciation at ⁓2.4 Ma. From 1.78–0.78 Ma, muddy turbidity-current- and debris-flow-derived sediments were delivered from shelf to slope via six tunnel valleys measuring up to 12 km in width and 200 m in depth. These tunnel valleys and associated downslope deposits formed during the 41-kyr climate cycles of the Early Pleistocene, and evidence abundant channelized, meltwater discharges from these glaciations. Following the mid-Pleistocene transition to 100-kyr cycles, a change in the style of glaciation is suggested by a change in landform and facies associations consistent with a reduced meltwater contribution.

 Earth observation data is key for monitoring vegetation dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. The most widely used method to estimate vegetation properties from Earth observation data is vegetation indices. However, temporal dynamics in vertical leaf angles can strongly alter reflectance signals and, hence, vegetation indices. Here, we derive leaf angles from plant photographs to simulate the effect on vegetation indices with radiative transfer models. We show that leaf angle dynamics systematically confound widely applied vegetation indices. Moreover, we demonstrate that these effects are not random but tightly linked to abiotic environmental conditions. These systematic effects of vertical leaf angles have implications for monitoring plant properties, biodiversity, and ecosystem functional properties. We discuss the related challenges and opportunities to assess spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics with remote sensing and vegetation indices.

 Spaceborne lidars have demonstrated outstanding global ocean observation in terms of sampling at day- and night-time and penetrating thin cloud and aerosol layers. A spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) has the potential to provide accurate optical properties by decreasing the number of assumptions in the retrieval algorithm in comparison with classical elastic spaceborne lidar. In this paper, we report the first ocean application from both particulate and molecular scattering measurements of spaceborne HSRL, namely Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL) onboard China DQ-1 satellite. We use the ACDL/DQ-1 HSRL to quantify particulate backscatter coefficient bbp in the global ocean, with a novel algorithm exploiting the column-integrated particulate and molecular signals. The ACDL-derived bbp data agree well with MODIS-derived data through along-track and global comparisons. It also presents high correlations with the Argo floats in-situ data under various spatial and temporal matching windows. The ACDL/DQ-1 is anticipated to become an important part of the global ocean satellite observations addressing some limitations of traditional passive ocean colour observation."

 The stability of a climate data record (CDR) is essential for evaluating long-term trends in surface temperature using remote sensing products. In the case of a satellite-derived CDR of land surface temperature (LST), this includes the stability of processing steps prior to the estimation of the target climate variable. Instability in the masking of cloud-affected observations can result in non-geophysical trends in a LST CDR. This paper provides an assessment of cloud detection performance stability over a 25-year LST CDR generated using data from the second Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2), the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). We evaluate three cloud detection methodologies, one fully Bayesian, one naïve probabilistic and the operational threshold-based cloud mask provided with each sensor, at four in-situ ceilometer sites. Of the 12 algorithm-site combinations assessed, only two (17 %) were stable across the full timeseries with respect to both cloud contamination and missed clear-sky observations. Five (42 %) were stable with respect to missed clear-sky observations only. The associated impacts on LST trends in the CDR could be as large as (+/−)0.73 K per decade (0.43 K per decade above the target stability), which means that attention needs to be paid to this aspect of stability in order to understand uncertainty in long-term observed trends. Given that cloud detection stability has not to our knowledge been previously assessed for any target climate variable, this conclusion may apply more broadly to other satellite-derived CDRs."

 The adjacency effect distorts the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral signals of coastal and inland waters and is a major challenge for optical remote sensing of nearshore aquatic environments. We introduce a closed-form expression that corrects for the adjacency effect prior to atmospheric correction. The method is included in an open-source Python tool, which ingests level-1 imagery and calculates the point-spread function of the atmosphere to convolve the input imagery. For each band, the difference between the observed and convolved reflectances is used to quantify and correct for the adjacency effect, i.e., pixels are corrected to the TOA reflectance they would have if surrounded by pixels of identical reflectance. Validation was conducted for Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI imagery against a global dataset of coincident in situ radiometric measurements. Results showed improved accuracy of water-leaving reflectance derived by atmospheric correction processors, including ACOLITE, POLYMER, and l2gen, when these were applied following adjacency-effect correction. For matchups within 200 m of shorelines (n = 212), adjacency-effect correction resulted in an average 16.7 % reduction in root mean square error, a 32.4 % reduction in symmetric signed percentage bias, and a 36.8 % reduction in median symmetric accuracy for the three processors. The improvements were more significant in the near-infrared (NIR) range for ACOLITE, visible wavelengths for l2gen, and evenly distributed across the visible-NIR spectrum for POLYMER. We anticipate that this physics-based approach to adjacency-effect correction will lead to improved satellite-derived aquatic products for coastal and inland waters under diverse atmospheric and aquatic conditions."

 Remote sensing observations and artificial intelligence algorithms have emerged as key components for crop yield estimation at various scales during the past decades. However, the utilization of multi-source satellite data and machine learning for estimating aggregated crop yield at the regional level in Europe has been only scarcely explored. Our study aims to bridge this research gap by focusing on the district-level spring barley yield estimation in southern Sweden from 2017 to 2022. We developed an estimation method with the random forest (RF) approach using four satellite-derived products along with two climate variables. These variables were used individually and in combinations as inputs for the RF approach. The results showed that vegetation indices (VIs) outperformed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in barley yield estimation, while combining VIs and SIF variables achieved the highest model performance (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 488 kg/ha). The inclusion of climate variables generally had little added contributions to the model performance. Importantly, barley yield prediction could be achieved two months prior to harvest, using monthly VIs and SIF data from April and May. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using freely accessible satellite data and the machine learning approach for estimating crop yield at the pan-European regional level. We expect that our proposed methodology can be extended to different crop types and regional-scale crop yield estimation in Europe, benefiting national and local authorities in making agricultural productivity decisions."

 Occupants and indoor activities are sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We propose a framework to simulate the pollutant pathway using the INCA-Indoor© model and VOC emission rates to derive dynamic concentrations, and the USEtox model to evaluate health impacts in DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). The applicability of the framework is tested on a case study, and the effect of indoor chemical reactions on health impacts is assessed. In this case study, health impacts were of 0.3 μDALY/day without and 0.4 μDALY/day (13 s/day) with indoor air chemistry (+28 %) out of which 12 % were linked to occupant breath and skin emissions. Cleaning activities led to the highest impacts without chemical reactions (terpinolene, responsible for 0.14 μDALY/day), but indoor air chemistry led to high impacts linked to formaldehyde formation (0.18 μDALY/day). These reactions led to the formation of more formaldehyde, hence leading to 20% more impacts, in summer than in winter. Occupants’ contribution to CO2 concentrations exceeded recommended limits under the given occupancy and ventilation scenario. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation affected indoor particulate matter mass concentrations by up to a factor 1.2 and their number concentrations by up to a factor 25,000 in the presence of VOC emissions. Results of this study indicate that chemical reactions and SOA formation are important factors to consider in indoor air quality impact assessment. A larger number of activities and scenarios can be tested to improve the robustness of the conclusions, since, under different scenarios (for e.g. activities with lower emission rates) and with more complete toxicity data, these conclusions are likely to change."

 Temperature (T), pressure (p), and density (ρ) are fundamental variables describing the atmospheric behavior. This study investigates the interdependence of these variables near Earth's surface in real-world conditions, by evaluating data from different European weather stations. It has been found that the correlation between pressure and temperature is strongly related to the dynamics of the PBL that facilitates a two-group classification. The first group includes all the stations in the plain or in the valley-floor and exhibits a weak correlation, R(p,T). 2D density plots representing hourly pressure against temperature have a distinctive triangular shape at these stations. Regardless of location, the upper boundary of this triangle consistently fits a linear equation with a constant slope and an intercept that scales with the average pressure of the station. This finding holds promising implications for enhancing the quality check of pressure and temperature data, enabling the identification of implausible measurements using a unified equation. In contrast, the second group includes stations with a strongly positive correlation R(p,T) and a more linear density plot; it includes all stations near a mountain-top. Their correlations exhibit identical features when compared to radiosounding data extracted at corresponding heights. The study concludes that: i) the first group of stations is significantly influenced by non-hydrostatic processes such as turbulence, friction and surface radiative heating/cooling in the PBL, resulting in weakly negative R(p,T) for shorter timescales that become null over longer durations; ii) the second group of stations has R(p,T) characteristics similar to the free atmosphere, predominantly regulated by hydrostatic balance and the advection of sensible heat."

 This study investigates the impacts of climate change on temperature and precipitation extremes in eight West Asian countries (Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, and Iraq) using a regional ensemble of CMIP6 models. Ten models were evaluated based on their performance in simulating historical temperature and precipitation using the KGE index. Four climate extreme indices (Tmax, Pmax, TX90p and R95p) were employed to assess changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in the study area. The analysis of climate extremes reveals significant projected changes. Tmax is expected to increase in all countries, with the most pronounced rise anticipated in Turkmenistan, where Tmax in the main part of the country is projected to increase by more than 5 °C under the SSP585. Projections for Pmax show a more nuanced picture. Pakistan is expected to experience the highest overall Pmax. TX90p is projected to increase in all countries, indicating a rise in the frequency of extreme heat events. Pakistan is expected to experience the most significant increase in TX90p, reaching up to 36.1 % under the SSP585 (FF) scenario by 2074, followed by Iran and Afghanistan. R95p does not show a clear future trend. Pakistan is anticipated to see the highest increase in R95p, reaching up to 15.2 mm under the SSP585 scenario by 2074, while Turkey might experience a decrease of up to 7.8 mm under the SSP245 scenario. These findings highlight the diverse and concerning impacts of climate change on temperature and precipitation extremes across West Asia. The projected increase in Tmax, TX90p and potential shifts in precipitation patterns pose significant challenges for the region. This study emphasizes the need for region-specific adaptation strategies to address the multifaceted challenges of climate change in West Asia."

 A Regional Air Quality Model System (RAQMS) driven by WRF was applied to explore the emission, transport, deposition, and direct radiative effect of mineral dust over western China in July 2022, with focus on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Model validation against ground and satellite observations demonstrated the model reproduced meteorological variables, PM10 concentration, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and extinction coefficients in the vertical reasonably well. There was a dust event during 3–7 July 2022, which was originated from the Taklimakan Desert (TKD) and affected eastern and central TP under anticyclonic flows, resulting in the maximum hourly PM10 concentration exceeding 50 μg m−3 in Lhasa. Shortwave radiation was reduced considerably by dust aerosols over eastern TP, with the maximum decrease in daytime mean shortwave radiation reaching 30 W m−2 around Nyingchi on 5 July. Anthropogenic aerosols dominated PM10 mass in the capital cities of western China (54–67 %), while dust aerosols were dominant in the cities near the deserts. During this dust event, dust aerosols from TKD and Qaidam Desert (QDD) significantly influenced eastern TP, with dust contributions to PM10 mass concentration of 52 %, 76 % and 69 %, respectively, in Chamdo, Lhasa and Nyingzhi, respectively. The total dust emission in western China was about 10.6 Tg in July 2022, with the largest contribution from TKD (63.5 %), followed by Gobi Desert (GB) (26 %). The total deposition of dust was estimated to be 6.2 Tg, in which TKD and GB contributed 66 % and 22 %, respectively. During the study period, about 418 Gg dust aerosols were deposited on TP, 49 % of which was from TKD and 25 % from QDD. Foreign dust sources contributed approximately 7 % and 9 % to dust concentration and total deposition over TP, respectively. Over southern TP, the source contribution to dust deposition was estimated to be 42 %, 24 % and 21 % from TKD, foreign sources and QDD, respectively, suggesting potentially important impact of long-range transboundary dust transport on deposition, surface albedo and climate over TP."

Here, we interrogated the in vivo molecular structure changes of collagen in rat Achilles tendons following treadmill running. Unexpectedly, the tendons’ collagen molecules were not mechanically unfolded by running but denatured through proteolysis during physiological post-run remodeling. We further revealed that running induces inflammatory gene expressions in Achilles tendons and that long-term running causes prolonged, elevated collagen degradation, leading to the accumulation of denatured collagen and tendinopathy development. For applications, we demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging of collagenase-induced Achilles tendon injury in vivo using a denatured collagen targeting contrast agent.

NOD-like receptors (NLRs) comprise a highly evolutionarily conserved family of cytosolic bacterial sensors, yet their impact on antitumor immunity against HCC remains unclear. In this study, we uncovered that NOD1, a well-studied member of NLR family, exhibits predominant expression in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and correlates positively with improved prognosis and responses to anti–PD-1 treatments in patients with HCC. Activation of NOD1 in vivo augments antitumor immunity and enhances the effectiveness of anti–PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, NOD1 activation resulted in diminished expression of perilipin 5, thereby hindering fatty acid oxidation and inducing free fatty acid accumulation in TAMs. This metabolic alteration promoted membrane localization of the costimulatory molecule OX40L in a lipid modification–dependent manner, thereby activating CD8+T cells.

However, in metal-free systems, the spin orbitals are largely delocalized, and weak coupling between the spins in the lattice hampers long-range ordering. Metal-free magnetism is of fundamental interest to physical sciences, unlocking unprecedented dimensions for strongly correlated materials and biocompatible magnets. Here, we present a strategy to achieve strong coupling between spin centers of planar radical monomers in π-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) polymers and rationally control the orderings. If the π-states in these triangulene-based 2D polymers are half-occupied, then we predict that they are antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators. Incorporating a boron or nitrogen heteroatom per monomer results in Stoner ferromagnetism and half-metallicity, with the Fermi level located at spin-polarized Dirac points. An unprecedented antiferromagnetic half-semiconductor is observed in a binary boron-nitrogen–centered 2D polymer. Our findings pioneer Stoner and Mott-Hubbard magnetism emerging in the electronic π-system of crystalline-conjugated 2D polymers."

While dysregulation of the splicing process is considered a cancer hallmark, the role of certain splicing factors remains unknown in PCa. This study focuses on characterizing the levels and role of SRSF6 in this disease. Comprehensive analyses of SRSF6 alterations (copy number/mRNA/protein) were conducted across eight well-characterized PCa cohorts and the Hi-MYC transgenic model. SRSF6 was up-regulated in PCa samples, correlating with adverse clinical parameters. Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks. Mechanistically, SRSF6 regulates the splicing pattern of the histone-chaperoneHIRA, consequently affecting the activity of H3.3 in PCa and breast cancer cell models and disrupting pivotal oncogenic pathways (AR and E2F) in PCa cells. These findings underscore SRSF6 as a promising therapeutic target for PCa/advanced-stage PCa."

We demonstrate that loss of 21URNAs compromises homolog pairing and makes it permissive for nonhomologous synapsis resulting in defects in crossover formation and chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis. We identify Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK-3), among others, as a 21URNA target. 21URNA activity restricts PLK-3 protein to proliferative cells, and expansion of PLK-3 in pachytene overlaps with the meiotic defects. Removal ofplk-3results in quantitative genetic suppression of the meiotic defects. One discrete 21URNA inhibits PLK-3 expression in late pachytene cells. Together, these results suggest that the 21URNAs function as pachytene piRNAs duringC. elegansspermatogenesis.

Here, we demonstrate microsized LEDs fabricated by a dry-transfer van der Waals (vdW) integration method using typical layered Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (RPPs). A single-crystalline layered RPP nanoflake is used as the active layer and sandwiched between two few-layer graphene contacts, forming van der Waals LEDs (vdWLEDs). Strong electroluminescence (EL) emission with a low turn-on current density of ~20 pA μm−2and high EQE exceeding 10% is observed at room temperature, which sets the benchmark for the EQE of vdWLEDs ever recorded. Such efficient EL emission is attributed to the inherent multiple quantum well structure and high photoluminescence quantum yield (~35%) of RPPs and a low charge injection barrier of ~0.10 eV facilitated by the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism.

However, in real systems with the finite thickness of the device material being larger than the magnetic exchange length, the skyrmion spin texture extends into the third dimension and cannot be assumed as homogeneous. Using soft x-ray laminography, we reconstruct with about 20-nanometer spatial (voxel) size the full three-dimensional spin texture of a skyrmion in an 800-nanometer-diameter and 95-nanometer-thin disk patterned into a 30× [iridium/cobalt/platinum] multilayered film. A quantitative analysis finds that the evolution of the radial profile of the topological skyrmion number is nonuniform across the thickness of the disk. Estimates of the micromagnetic energy densities suggest that the changes in topological profile are related to nonuniform competing energetic interactions.

Here, we show that a membrane channel protein, chloride intracellular channel protein-1 (Clic1), can physically interact with ERα with a preference to the membrane-bound ERα. Clic1-mediated currents can be enhanced by E2and reduced by its depletion. In addition, Clic1 currents are required to mediate the E2-induced rapid excitations in multiple brain ERα populations. Further, genetic disruption of Clic1 in hypothalamic ERα neurons blunts the regulations of E2on female body weight balance. In conclusion, we identified the Clic1 chloride channel as a key mediator for E2-induced rapid neuronal excitation, which may have a broad impact on multiple neurobiological processes regulated by E2."

Identifying the underlying mechanisms may help to foresee regenerative medicine strategies. Using aXenopusmodel of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that Müller cells actively proliferate upon photoreceptor degeneration in old tadpoles but not in younger ones. Differences in the inflammatory microenvironment emerged as an explanation for such stage dependency. Functional analyses revealed that enhancing neuroinflammation is sufficient to trigger Müller cell proliferation, not only in young tadpoles but also in mice. In addition, we showed that microglia are absolutely required for the response of mouse Müller cells to mitogenic factors while negatively affecting their neurogenic potential. However, both cell cycle reentry and neurogenic gene expression are allowed when applying sequential pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments. This reveals that inflammation benefits Müller glia proliferation in both regenerative and nonregenerative vertebrates and highlights the importance of sequential inflammatory modulation to create a regenerative permissive microenvironment."

In contrast, generation of theADOknockout mouse revealed high tolerance for ADO depletion in adult tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying ADO’s essentiality in cancer cells, we characterized the cell proteome and metabolome following depletion of ADO. This revealed that ADO depletion leads to toxic levels of polyamines which can be driven by ADO’s substrate cysteamine. Polyamine accumulation in turn stimulated expression of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) which resulted in mitochondrial hyperactivity and ROS production, culminating in cell toxicity. This work identifies ADO as a unique vulnerability in cancer cells, due to its essential role in maintenance of redox homeostasis through restraining polyamine levels and proline catabolism."

Here, we reveal that the m6A and its methyltransferase METTL3 are down-regulated in keratinocytes in inflammatory skin diseases. Inducible deletion ofMettl3in murine keratinocytes results in spontaneous skin inflammation and increases susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation with activation of neutrophil recruitment. Therapeutically, restoration of m6A alleviates the disease phenotypes in mice and suppresses inflammation in human biopsy specimens. We support a model in which m6A modification stabilizes the mRNA of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme ELOVL6 via the m6A reader IGF2BP3, leading to a rewiring of fatty acid metabolism with a reduction in palmitic acid accumulation and, consequently, suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis in cutaneous inflammation.

Evidence of hydroxyl radical concentration reduction and detection of a radical nitrogen species that only forms in the presence of chelated Sn(II) point to a radical-based reaction mechanism.

Webb;Kenneth J. McNamara;Aleš Šoster;Mateja Ferk,Ironing out complexities in karst chronology: (U-Th)/He ferricrete ages reveal wet MIS 5c,"Karst landforms provide insights into landscape evolution and paleoclimate but are inherently challenging to date. An ancient interval of particularly intense weathering of Western Australian Pleistocene aeolianites is recorded in a spectacular pinnacle karst landscape with associated ferricrete nodules. (U-Th)/He dating of the ferricrete nodules revealed an age of 102.8 + 10.6/−11.4 thousand years, corresponding to marine isotope stage 5c. The (U-Th)/He age thus directly dates the wettest interglacial period in the region over the last 500 thousand years, which was responsible for the dissolution that formed the pinnacles. The reliability of the ferricrete (U-Th)/He age is supported by bounding optically stimulated luminescence and U-Th dates on associated aeolianites and carbonate precipitates, respectively. A (U-Th)/He approach is globally applicable to aeolianites with associated ferricretes, allowing more accurate dating of the environmental changes affecting these lithologies, and temporally constraining rapid Pleistocene climatic oscillations to better contextualize the associated evolution of the biosphere."
10.1126/sciadv.adp1346,True,Science Advances,这篇论文研究了近几十年来北半球中纬度地区冷极端事件的变化趋势。研究发现，尽管北极快速变暖，但观测到的冷极端事件的频率和强度自1990年以来显著下降，与气候模型预测的趋势一致。研究还指出，先前报道的冷极端事件增加是由于数据覆盖范围变化造成的误差。该研究结果表明，近几十年来中纬度地区冷极端事件减少，模型与观测结果一致。,"['satellite observations', 'temperature extremes', 'climate models', 'Arctic warming', 'midlatitude cold extremes']",Russell Blackport;Michael Sigmond;James A. Screen,Models and observations agree on fewer and milder midlatitude cold extremes even over recent decades of rapid Arctic warming,"An apparent increase in observed cold extremes over recent decades in the northern midlatitudes has been reported, in contrast to robust decreases predicted by climate models. This discrepancy has led to suggestions that models fail to accurately simulate changes in weather patterns caused by Arctic warming. Here, we show that the observed frequency and intensity of midlatitude cold extremes have strongly decreased since 1990 and are consistent with modeled trends. The previously reported increase in cold extremes was overestimated due to an artifact of changing data coverage. We also show that the fraction of land with observed cold extreme increases over recent decades is consistent with model internal variability on top of a near-uniform forced reduction in cold extremes across the midlatitudes. Our results provide strong evidence of a decrease in midlatitude cold extremes over recent decades and consistency between models and observations."

Limited perfusion coupled with the high metabolic demand of growing tumors has led to the hypothesis that many tumors experience metabolic stress driven by limited availability of nutrients such as glucose, oxygen, and amino acids in the tumor. Such metabolic stress has important implications for the biology of cells in the microenvironment, affecting both disease progression and response to therapies. Recently, techniques have been developed to identify limiting nutrients and resulting metabolic stresses in solid tumors. These techniques have greatly expanded our understanding of the metabolic limitations in tumors. This review will discuss these experimental tools and the emerging picture of metabolic limitations in tumors arising from recent studies using these approaches."
