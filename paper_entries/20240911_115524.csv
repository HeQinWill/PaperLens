This threat frequently coexists with human-induced calamities, such as domestic and international conflicts and civil unrest, which could exacerbate the socio-economic instability already present in the region. Using a novel data-driven approach, we evaluated how drought risk in Africa affects the security of various crucial sectors of sustainable development, such as agriculture, water, and food nutrition/health (referred here as ‘nutritional’). Our findings show that different sectors and geographical areas exhibit distinct risk footprints. In Central African countries, for instance, we found that social instability linked to higher nutritional risk is more prevalent than that resulting from the agriculture and water sectors. Socio-economic volatility rather than uncertainty in the climate is the primary driver of this elevated nutritional risk. However, most Northern African countries are at risk of considerable agriculture and water insecurity because of extreme water stress and unstable climate trends. We indicate that the risk is majorly driven by recurrent drought events in Southern Africa, which significantly affect inclusive sectoral securities. The cause of higher risks in Eastern and Western Africa has been found to be an unfavorable interaction of all the risk components—vulnerability, exposure, and hazard. Notably, basic amenities, climate stability, and access to sustainable and renewable water sources are often missing from Africa’s sectoral risk hotspots. Our results emphasize the necessity of maximizing the efficacy of bottom-up initiatives to achieve sustainable food and water security, by integrating socio-economic policies and climate change at the granular level through observation."

Strode;Ralf Sussmann,Solar FTIR measurements of NOx vertical distributions – Part 2: Experiment-based scaling factors describing the daytime variation in stratospheric NOx,"We created a set of scaling factors describing the diurnal increase in stratospheric nitrogen oxides above Zugspitze, Germany. We used these factors to validate recently published model simulation data. On the one hand, this validation enables the use of the validated data to better understand the stratospheric photochemistry. On the other hand, it can improve satellite validation, which has implications for the understanding of urban smog events and other pollution events in the troposphere. 
 Long-term experimental stratospheric NO2 and NO partial columns measured by means of solar Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry at Zugspitze (47.42° N, 10.98° E; 2964 m a.s.l.), Germany, were used to create a set of experiment-based monthly scaling factors (SFexp). The underlying data set is published in a companion paper (Nürnberg et al., 2024) and comprises over 25 years of measurements depicting the daytime variability of stratospheric NO2 and NO partial columns with respect to local solar time (LST). In accordance with simulation-based scaling factors recently published by Strode et al. (2022), we created SFexp normalized to SZA =72° for NO2 and NO for every month of the year as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA). Apart from a boundary value problem at minimum SZA values originating from averaging over different times of the month, the obtained scaling factors SFexp(NO2) and SFexp(NO) as a function of SZA represent  the daytime behavior already shown in model simulations and experiments in the literature very well. This shows a well-pronounced increase in the NO2 and NO stratospheric partial column with the time of the day and a flattening of this increase after noon. In addition to the discussion of SFexp, we validate the simulation-based scaling factors SFsim(NO2) (Strode et al., 2022) and present simulation-based scaling factors for NO SFsim(NO). The simulation-based scaling factors show excellent agreement with the experiment-based ones; i.e., for NO2 and NO the mean value of the modulus between the experiment and simulation over all SZAs and months is only 0.02 %. We show that recently used model simulations can describe  the real behavior of nitrogen oxide (NOx) variability in the stratosphere very well. Furthermore, we conclude that ground-based FTIR measurements can be used for validation of the output of photochemistry models and for creating experiment-based data sets describing the daytime stratospheric NOx variability as a function of SZA. This is a contribution to improved satellite validation and a better understanding of stratospheric photochemistry."

Melton;Vivek K. Arora,Estimation of Canada's methane emissions: inverse modelling analysis using the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) measurement network,"Methane (CH4) emissions in Canada for 2007–2017 were estimated using Canada’s surface greenhouse gas measurements. The estimated emissions show no significant trend, but emission uncertainty was reduced as more measurement sites became available. Notably for climate change, we find the wetland CH4 emissions show a positive correlation with surface air temperature in summer. Canada’s measurement network could monitor future CH4 emission changes and compliance with climate change mitigation goals. 
 Canada has major sources of atmospheric methane (CH4), with the world's second-largest boreal wetland and the world's fourth-largest natural gas production. However, Canada's CH4 emissions remain uncertain among estimates. Better quantification and characterization of Canada's CH4 emissions are critical for climate mitigation strategies. To improve our understanding of Canada's CH4 emissions, we performed an ensemble regional inversion for 2007–2017 constrained with the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) surface measurement network. The decadal CH4 estimates show no significant trend, unlike some studies that reported long-term trends. The total CH4 estimate is 17.4 (15.3–19.5) Tg CH4 yr−1, partitioned into natural and anthropogenic sources at 10.8 (7.5–13.2) and 6.6 (6.2–7.8) Tg CH4 yr−1, respectively. The estimated anthropogenic emission is higher than inventories, mainly in western Canada (with the fossil fuel industry). Furthermore, the results reveal notable spatiotemporal characteristics. First, the modelled differences in atmospheric CH4 among the sites show improvement after inversion when compared to observations, implying the CH4 observation differences could help in verifying the inversion results. Second, the seasonal variations show slow onset and a late-summer maximum, indicating wetland CH4 flux has hysteretic dependence on air temperature. Third, the boreal winter natural CH4 emissions, usually treated as negligible, appear quantifiable (≥ 20 % of annual emissions). Understanding winter emission is important for climate prediction, as the winter in Canada is warming faster than the summer. Fourth, the inter-annual variability in estimated CH4 emissions is positively correlated with summer air temperature anomalies. This could enhance Canada's natural CH4 emission in the warming climate."

Carpenter,An improved estimate of inorganic iodine emissions from the ocean using a coupled surface microlayer box model,"Iodine-mediated loss of ozone to the ocean surface and the subsequent emission of iodine species has a large effect on the troposphere. Here we combine recent experimental insights to develop a box model of the process, which we then parameterize and incorporate into the GEOS-Chem transport model. We find that these new insights have a small impact on the total emission of iodine but significantly change its distribution. 
 Iodine at the ocean's surface impacts climate and health by removing ozone (O3) from the troposphere both directly via ozone deposition to seawater and indirectly via the formation of iodine gases that are released into the atmosphere. Here we present a new box model of the ocean surface microlayer that couples oceanic O3 dry deposition to inorganic chemistry to predict inorganic iodine emissions. This model builds on the previous work of Carpenter et al. (2013), improving both chemical and physical processes. This new box model predicts iodide depletion in the top few micrometres of the ocean surface due to rapid chemical loss to ozone competing with replenishment from underlying water. From this box model, we produce parameterized equations for HOI and I2 emissions, which are implemented into the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem along with an updated sea surface iodide climatology. Compared to the previous model, inorganic iodine emissions from some tropical waters decrease by as much as half, while higher-latitude emissions increase by a factor of ≫10. With these large local changes, global total inorganic iodine emissions increased by ∼49 % (2.99 to 4.48 Tg) compared to the previous parameterization. This results in a negligible change in average tropospheric OH (<0.2 %) and tropospheric methane lifetime (<0.2 %). The annual mean tropospheric O3 burden decreases (−1.5 % to 325 Tg); however, higher-latitude surface O3 concentrations decrease by as much as 20 %."

Diekmann;Kei Yoshimura,Assessing the potential of free-tropospheric water vapour isotopologue satellite observations for improving the analyses of convective events,"Despite its importance for extreme weather and climate feedbacks, atmospheric convection is not well constrained. This study assesses the potential of novel tropospheric water vapour isotopologue satellite observations for improving the analyses of convective events. We find that the impact of the isotopologues is small for stable atmospheric conditions but significant for unstable conditions, which have the strongest societal impacts (e.g. storms and flooding). 
 Satellite-based observations of free-tropospheric water vapour isotopologue ratios (HDO / H2O, expressed in form of the δ value δD) with good global and temporal coverage have become available recently. We investigate the potential of these observations for constraining the uncertainties of the atmospheric analyses fields of specific humidity (q), temperature (T), and δD and of variables that capture important properties of the atmospheric water cycle, namely the vertical velocity (ω), the latent heating rate (Q2), and the precipitation rate (Prcp). Our focus is on the impact of the δD observations relative to the impact achieved by the observation of q and T, which are much more easily observed by satellites and are routinely in use for atmospheric analyses. For our investigations we use an Observing System Simulation Experiment; i.e. we simulate the satellite observations of q, T, and δD with known uncertainties and coverage (e.g. observations are not available for cloudy conditions, i.e. at locations where the atmosphere is vertically unstable). Then we use the simulated observations within a Kalman-filter-based assimilation framework in order to evaluate their potential for improving the quality of atmospheric analyses. The study is made for low latitudes (30° S to 30° N) and for 40 d between mid-July and the end of August 2016. We find that q observations generally have the largest impacts on the analyses' quality and that T observations have stronger impacts overall than δD observations. We show that there is no significant impact of δD observations for stable atmospheric conditions; however, for very unstable conditions, the impact of δD observations is significant and even slightly stronger than the respective impact of T observations. Very unstable conditions are rare but are related to extreme events (e.g. storms, flooding); i.e. the δD observations significantly impact the analyses' quality of the events that have the largest societal consequences. The fact that no satellite observations are available at the location and time of the unstable conditions indicates a remote impact of δD observations that are available elsewhere. Concerning real-world applications, we conclude that the situation of δD satellite observations is very promising but that further improving the model's linkage between convective processes and the larger-scale δD fields might be needed for optimizing the assimilation impact of real-world δD observations."

Wofsy;Ritesh Gautam,Constructing a measurement-based spatially explicit inventory of US oil and gas methane emissions (2021),"We review, analyze, and synthesize previous peer-reviewed measurement-based data on facility-level oil and gas methane emissions and use these data to develop a high-resolution spatially explicit inventory of US basin-level and national methane emissions. This work provides an improved assessment of national methane emissions relative to government inventories in support of accurate and comprehensive methane emissions assessment, attribution, and mitigation. 
 Accurate and comprehensive quantification of oil and gas methane emissions is pivotal in informing effective methane mitigation policies while also supporting the assessment and tracking of progress towards emissions reduction targets set by governments and industry. While national bottom-up source-level inventories are useful for understanding the sources of methane emissions, they are often unrepresentative across spatial scales, and their reliance on generic emission factors produces underestimations when compared with measurement-based inventories. Here, we compile and analyze previously reported ground-based facility-level methane emissions measurements (n=1540) in the major US oil- and gas-producing basins and develop representative methane emission profiles for key facility categories in the US oil and gas supply chain, including well sites, natural-gas compressor stations, processing plants, crude-oil refineries, and pipelines. We then integrate these emissions data with comprehensive spatial data on national oil and gas activity to estimate each facility's mean total methane emissions and uncertainties for the year 2021, from which we develop a mean estimate of annual national methane emissions resolved at 0.1° × 0.1° spatial scales (∼ 10 km × 10 km). From this measurement-based methane emissions inventory (EI-ME), we estimate total US national oil and gas methane emissions of approximately 16 Tg (95 % confidence interval of 14–18 Tg) in 2021, which is ∼ 2 times greater than the EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Our estimate represents a mean gas-production-normalized methane loss rate of 2.6 %, consistent with recent satellite-based estimates. We find significant variability in both the magnitude and spatial distribution of basin-level methane emissions, ranging from production-normalized methane loss rates of < 1 % in the gas-dominant Appalachian and Haynesville regions to > 3 %–6 % in oil-dominant basins, including the Permian, Bakken, and the Uinta. Additionally, we present and compare novel comprehensive wide-area airborne remote-sensing data and results for total area methane emissions and the relative contributions of diffuse and concentrated methane point sources as quantified using MethaneAIR in 2021. The MethaneAIR assessment showed reasonable agreement with independent regional methane quantification results in sub-regions of the Permian and Uinta basins and indicated that diffuse area sources accounted for the majority of the total oil and gas emissions in these two regions. Our assessment offers key insights into plausible underlying drivers of basin-to-basin variabilities in oil and gas methane emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating measurement-based data when developing high-resolution spatially explicit methane inventories in support of accurate methane assessment, attribution, and mitigation. The high-resolution spatially explicit EI-ME inventory is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10734299 (Omara, 2024)."

This architecture provides a promising solution to overcome the limitations of classical AI methods and contributes to open up new possibilities for combining physical knowledge with deep learning models. 
 This work proposes a hybrid approach that combines physics and artificial intelligence (AI) for cloud cover nowcasting. It addresses the limitations of traditional deep-learning methods in producing realistic and physically consistent results that can generalise to unseen data. The proposed approach, named HyPhAICC, enforces a physical behaviour. In the first model, denoted as HyPhAICC-1, a multi-level advection dynamics is considered a hard constraint for a trained U-Net model. Our experiments show that the hybrid formulation outperforms not only traditional deep-learning methods but also the EUMETSAT Extrapolated Imagery model (EXIM) in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results. In particular, we illustrate that the hybrid model preserves more details and achieves higher scores based on similarity metrics in comparison to U-Net. Remarkably, these improvements are achieved while using only one-third of the data required by the other models. Another model, denoted as HyPhAICC-2, adds a source term to the advection equation, it impaired the visual rendering but displayed the best performance in terms of accuracy. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid physics–AI architecture provides a promising solution to overcome the limitations of classical AI methods and contributes to open up new possibilities for combining physical knowledge with deep-learning models."

Podladchikov,"Accelerated pseudo-transient method for elastic, viscoelastic, and coupled hydro-mechanical problems with applications","The Accelerated Pseudo-Transient (APT) method is an efficient way to solve partial differential equations, particularly well-suited for parallel computing. This paper explores the APT method's effectiveness in solving elastic, viscoelastic, and hydro-mechanical problems, focusing on quasi-static conditions in 1D, 2D, and 3D. The study examines the best numerical settings for fast and accurate solutions. The paper shows how the APT can handle complex problems in high-resolution models. 
 The Accelerated Pseudo-Transient (APT) method is a matrix-free approach used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), characterized by its reliance on local operations, which makes it highly suitable for parallelization. With the advent of the memory-wall phenomenon around 2005, where memory access speed overtook floating-point operations as the bottleneck in high-performance computing, the APT method has gained prominence as a powerful tool for tackling various PDEs in geosciences. Recent advancements have demonstrated the APT method's computational efficiency, particularly when applied to quasi-static nonlinear problems using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). This manuscript presents a comprehensive analysis of the APT method, focusing on its application to quasi-static elastic, viscoelastic, and coupled hydro-mechanical problems, specifically those governed by quasi-static Biot's poroelastic equations, across 1D, 2D, and 3D domains. We systematically investigate the optimal numerical parameters required to achieve rapid convergence, offering valuable insights into the method's applicability and efficiency for a range of physical models. Our findings are validated against analytical solutions, underscoring the robustness and accuracy of the APT method in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We explore the influence of boundary conditions, non-linearities, and coupling on the optimal convergence parameters, highlighting the method's adaptability in addressing complex and realistic scenarios. To demonstrate the flexibility of the APT method, we apply it to the nonlinear mechanical problem of strain localization using a poro-elasto-viscoplastic rheological model, achieving extremely high resolutions – 10,0002 voxels in 2D and 5123 voxels in 3D – that, to our knowledge, have not been previously explored for such models. Our study contributes significantly to the field by providing a robust framework for the effective implementation of the APT method in solving challenging geophysical problems. Importantly, the results presented in this paper are fully reproducible, with Matlab, symbolic Maple scripts, and CUDA C codes made available in a permanent repository."

Reick;Reiner Schnur;Axel Kleidon;Martin Claussen,The new plant functional diversity model JeDi-BACH (version 1.0) in the ICON Earth System Model (version 1.0),"We introduce the new plant functional diversity model JeDi-BACH, a novel tool that integrates the Jena Diversity Model (JeDi) within the land component of the ICON Earth System Model. JeDi-BACH captures a richer set of plant trait variations based on environmental filtering and functional tradeoffs without a priori knowledge of the vegetation types. JeDi-BACH represents a significant advancement in modeling the complex interactions between plant functional diversity and climate. 
 While it is clear that vegetation takes part in shaping terrestrial climate through various interactions with the atmosphere, it is not so obvious what role plant functional diversity plays here. So far a tool for investigating this question in land-atmosphere simulations was missing. The new tool JeDi-BACH (version 1.0), described here, closes this gap by combining the Jena Diversity Model (JeDi) with the land component JSBACHv4 of the ICON Earth System Model (version 1.0). In practice, the low-diversity plant parametrization of JSBACH employing plant functional types (PFTs) was replaced by the trait-based high-diversity vegetation description of JeDi. The novelty of JeDi is that the composition of terrestrial ecosystems emerges dynamically from environmental filtering based on functional trade-offs. Thereby, in contrast to the PFT approach, a richer set of plant strategies adapted to the ruling environmental conditions is obtained without a priori knowledge of the vegetation distribution. Besides documentation of this new implementation of JeDi, the paper also presents results from first exploratory simulations with interactive land-atmosphere coupling. We find a systematic dependence of terrestrial climate on diversity. Moreover, when investigating the reaction to changes in trait parameters, we find that at low diversity, climate depends strongly on the particular composition of vegetation, while at high diversity terrestrial climate proves to be rather resilient due to a dynamic re-organization of the plant community structure. Apparently, the many more dynamic degrees of freedom of the highly diverse vegetation in JeDi-BACH make this model behave very differently (less tunable) than conventional land components based on only a few PFTs. Besides fundamental research on the relation between diversity and climate, JeDi-BACH may be useful for the investigation of non-analogue climates (e.g., paleoclimate) where we lack knowledge on the structure and distribution of vegetation."

However, concerns arise over emerging contaminants, such as microplastics (MPs), which remain largely unregulated. Despite their common use in Australia, the transfer of MPs from biosolids to agricultural soils remains largely unknown. Herein, we have investigated the abundance, characteristics, and transport of MPs resulting from biosolids application in two Queensland agricultural sites. MP concentrations were significantly higher in biosolid-amended soils (average of 1137 MPs/kg) than in reference sites (average of 36 MPs/kg), correlating with the volume, time since application, and frequency of biosolids application. MPs > 25 μm were predominantly polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly(methyl methacrylate) fragments (up to 85%). Fibers constitute only 15–30% of MPs and mainly in larger sizes (average 1011 μm), whereas fragments (average 188 μm) and beads (average 72 μm) had smaller size ranges. Despite analytical challenges using Raman spectroscopy, detected smaller MPs (1–25 μm) were fragments composed of polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly(vinyl alcohol). This study provides the first report of MPs down to 1 μm in Australian agricultural soils. Our findings suggest a need to assess the long-term impact of MPs in biosolids on soil health and food safety.

In this work, we developed an analytical framework that combines liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with acidic triiodide-chemiluminescence analysis to characterize the composition and fate of total N-nitrosamines (TONO) and their precursors along the treatment trains of eight WWTPs in New York. Through the parallel application of LC-HRMS and chemiluminescence methods, the TONO scores for 41 N-nitrosamines containing structurally diverse substituents on their amine nitrogen were derived based on their solid-phase extraction recoveries and conversion efficiencies to nitric oxide. Correcting the compositional analysis of TONO using the TONO scores of target N-nitrosamines refined the assessment of the reduction or accumulation of TONO and their precursors across treatment steps in WWTPs. Nontargeted analysis prioritized seven additional N-nitrosamines for confirmation by reference standards, including three previously uncharacterized species: N-nitroso-tert-butylphenylamine, N-nitroso-2-pyrrolidinmethanol, and N-nitrosodesloratadine, although they only served as minor components of TONO.

Mercury speciation profiles in flue gas are different among these sources, leading to significant variations in local atmospheric Hg deposition. To quantify the impacts of Hg emissions from CFPPs and CPs on local-scale atmospheric Hg deposition, this study determined concentrations and isotopes of ambient gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), particulate-bound mercury (PBM), and precipitation total Hg (THg) at multiple locations with different distances away from a CFPP and a CP. Higher concentrations of GEM and precipitation THg in the CFPP area in summer were caused by higher Hg emission from the CFPP, resulting from higher electricity demand. Higher concentrations of GEM, PBM, and precipitation THg in the CP area in winter compared to those in summer were related to the higher output of cement. Atmospheric Hg concentration peaked near the CFPP and CP and decreased with distance from the plants. Elevated GEM concentration in the CFPP area was due to flue gas Hg0 emissions, and high PBM and precipitation Hg concentrations in the CP area were attributed to divalent Hg emissions. It was estimated that Hg emissions from the CFPP contributed 58.3 ± 20.9 and 52.3 ± 25.9% to local GEM and PBM, respectively, and those from the CP contributed 47.0 ± 16.7 and 60.0 ± 25.9% to local GEM and PBM, respectively. This study demonstrates that speciated Hg from anthropogenic emissions posed distinct impacts on the local atmospheric Hg cycle, indicating that Hg speciation profiles from these sources should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of emission reduction policies. This study also highlights the Hg isotope as a useful tool for monitoring environmental Hg emissions."

Understanding the aging process is crucial for evaluating MPs’ environmental behaviors and risks, but tracing the aging process remains challenging. Here, we propose a multimodal deep learning model to trace typical aging factors of aged MPs based on MPs’ physicochemical characteristics. A total of 1353 surface morphology images and 1353 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra were achieved from 130 aged MPs undergoing different aging processes, demonstrating that physicochemical properties of aged MPs vary from aging processes. The multimodal deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting the major aging factors of aged MPs. The multimodal deep learning model improves the model’s accuracy by approximately 5–20% and reduces prediction bias compared to the single-modal model. In practice, the established model was performed to predict the major aging factors of naturally aged MPs collected from typical environment matrices. The prediction results aligned with the aging conditions of specific environments, as reported in previous studies. Our findings provide new insights into tracing and understanding the plastic aging process, contributing more accurately to the environmental risk assessment of aged MPs."

Although atmospheric bases like dimethylamine (DMA) and ammonia (NH3) can enhance IA particles formation, their different efficiencies and spatial distributions make the dominant base-stabilization mechanisms of forming IA particles unclear. Herein, we investigated the IA–DMA–NH3 nucleation system through quantum chemical calculations at the DLPNO–CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ(-PP)//ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd) + aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level of theory and cluster dynamics simulations. We provide molecular-level evidence that DMA and NH3 can jointly stabilize the IA clusters. The formation rates of IA clusters initially decline before rising from the MBL to the FT, owing to variations in mechanism. In the MBL, IA–DMA nucleation predominates, while the contribution of IA–DMA–NH3 synergistic nucleation cannot be overlooked in polar and NH3-polluted regions. In the lower FT, IA–DMA–NH3 nucleation prevails, whereas in the upper FT, IA–NH3 nucleation dominates. The efficiency of IA–DMA–NH3 nucleation is comparable to that of IA-iodous acid nucleation in the MBL and sulfuric acid-NH3 nucleation in the FT. Hence, the IA–DMA–NH3 mechanism holds promise for revealing the missing sources of tropospheric IA particles."

However, the specific role of water in these reactions remains unclear. In this study, we innovatively propose that H2O-driven surface lattice oxygen activation in γ-MnO2 significantly enhances low-temperature NH3–SCR. The proton from water dissociation activates the surface lattice oxygen in γ-MnO2, giving rise to a doubling of catalytic activity (achieving 90% NO conversion at 100 °C) and remarkable stability. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal that spontaneous proton diffusion to the surface lattice oxygen reduces the orbital overlap between the protonated oxygen atom and its neighboring Mn atom. Consequently, the Mn–O bond is weakened and the surface lattice oxygen is effectively activated to provide excess oxygen vacancies available for converting O2 into O2–. Therefore, the redox property of Mn–H is improved, leading to enhanced NH3 oxidation-dehydrogenation and NO oxidation processes, which are crucial for low-temperature NH3–SCR. This work provides a deeper understanding and fresh perspectives on the water promotion mechanism in low-temperature NOx elimination."

The inventory is verified by implementing emission data into a global atmospheric transport model to predict OPFR concentrations in the global environment and comparing modeled concentrations with field sampled data. The results indicate that the inventory is reliable except for the pristine polar region, where the emission inventory and modeled concentrations underestimate OPFR levels in the atmosphere, likely resulting from ignorance of chemical reactions and the secondary derivative of parent OPFRs during their global long-distance atmospheric transport in the model.

Here, an artificially antibiotic-resistant bacterial community (ARBC) combined with five different constructed antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) with single antibiotic resistance, namely, kanamycin (KAN), tetracycline (TET), cefotaxime (CTX), polymyxin B (PB), or gentamicin (GEM), was studied for the stress response to photocatalysis. With photocatalytic inactivation, the transfer and diffusion of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the ARBC decreased, and fewer multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) emerged in aquatic environments. After several days of photocatalytic inactivation or Luria broth cultivation, >90% ARB were transformed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria by discarding ARGs. Bacteria with double antibiotic resistance were the dominant species (99%) of residual ARB. The changes in ARG abundance varied, decreasing for the GEM and TET resistance genes and increasing for the KAN resistance genes. The change in the antibiotic resistance level was consistent with the change in ARG abundance. Correspondingly, point mutations occurred for the KAN, CTX and PB resistance genes after photocatalytic inactivation, which might be the reason why these genes persisted longer in the studied ARBC. In summary, photocatalytic inactivation could reduce the abundance of some ARGs and inhibit the emergence of MDRB as well as block ARG transfer in the bacterial community in aquatic environments. This work highlights the advantages of long-term photocatalytic inactivation for controlling antibiotic resistance and facilitates a better understanding of bacterial communities in real aquatic environments."

We identified a total of 54 PFAS compounds (spanning 34 classes and containing seven novel PFAS) with total PFAS concentrations of 0.03–21.21 mM. Among seven novel PFAS, four PFAS met persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity criteria, and another PFAS had the highest ToxPi score among the identified 54 PFAS. Moreover, the predominant PFAS varied significantly in the studied foams and differed markedly from those used in other countries. After the TOP assay, nontarget analysis uncovered 1.1–55.5% more PFAS precursors and 8.25–55.5% more fluorine equivalents compared to traditional target analysis combined with TOP assay. Specifically, three double-bond perfluorinated alcohols were identified for the first time as end products of the TOP assay.

However, when candidate ILs fall into the extrapolation zone of ML models, predictions may become unreliable, leading to poor decision-making. In this study, we introduce a “representation uncertainty” (RU) approach to quantify prediction uncertainty by employing four IL representations: molecular fingerprint, molecular descriptor, molecular image, and molecular graph. We develop four types of ML models based on these representations and calculate RU as the standard deviation of predictions across these models. Compared to traditional model uncertainty (MU), which is based on hyperparameter variations within a single representation, RU outperforms MU in identifying unreliable predictions across four IL property data sets: viscosity, toxicity, refractive index, and CO2 absorption capacity. Furthermore, we develop ensemble models from the four types of models, which show superior predictive performance compared with that of individual models. Using the RU approach, we screened 1420 ILs and identified 37 promising candidates with low viscosity, low toxicity, and high CO2 absorption capacity. The predictive performance of our ensemble model, along with the effectiveness of the RU-based approach, was experimentally validated by testing the CO2 absorption capacity of 14 ILs. This study not only offers a more reliable method for screening and designing ILs, accelerating the discovery process, but also introduces a new perspective on developing ensemble models with enhanced predictive performance."

 Photoenzymes are light-powered biocatalysts that typically rely on the excitation of cofactors or unnatural amino acids for their catalytic activities1,2. A notable natural example is the fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), which uses light energy to convert aliphatic carboxylic acids to achiral hydrocarbons3. Here, we report a way to design a non-natural photodecarboxylase based on the excitation of enzyme-bound catalytic intermediates, instead of relying on cofactor excitation4. Iminium ions5, transiently generated from enals within the active site of an engineered class I aldolase6, can absorb violet light and function as single-electron oxidants. Activation of chiral carboxylic acids, followed by decarboxylation, generates two radicals that undergo stereospecific cross-coupling, yielding products with two stereocenters. Using the appropriate enantiopure chiral substrate, the desired diastereoisomeric product is selectively obtained with complete enantiocontrol. This finding underscores the active site's ability to transfer stereochemical information from the chiral radical precursor into the product, effectively addressing the longstanding problem of rapid racemization of chiral radicals. The resulting ‘memory of chirality’ scenario7 is a rarity in enantioselective radical chemistry."

 Global warming is rapidly shifting climate conditions away from what societies and ecosystems are adapted to. While the magnitude of changes in mean and extreme climate are broadly studied, regional rates of change, a key driver of climate risk, have received less attention. Here we show, using large ensembles of climate model simulations, that large parts of the tropics and subtropics, encompassing 70% of current global population, are expected to experience strong (>2 s.d.) joint rates of change in temperature and precipitation extremes combined over the next 20 years, under a high-emissions scenario, dropping to 20% under strong emissions mitigation. This is dominated by temperature extremes, with most of the world experiencing unusual (>1 s.d.) rates relative to the pre-industrial period, but unusual changes also occur for precipitation extremes in northern high latitudes, southern and eastern Asia and equatorial Africa. However, internal variability is high for 20 year trends, meaning that in the near term, trends of the opposite sign are still likely for precipitation extremes, and rare but not impossible for temperature extremes. We also find that rapid clean-up of aerosol emissions, mostly over Asia, leads to accelerated co-located increases in warm extremes and influences the Asian summer monsoons. Large-ensemble simulations suggest that strong regional trends in precipitation and temperature extremes will be common over the next two decades, even under stringent mitigation measures."

Here, the authors develop a methodology for the synthesis of cluster-ring-fused 3D aromatic heterocycles, which could find use in functional materials, via the palladium-catalyzed B–H activation of boron clusters. 
 Heteropolycyclic molecular systems, which are essential components in the fields of materials and pharmacology, frequently consist of 2D extended organic aromatic rings. Here, we introduce a type of inorganic-organic hybrid 3D conjugates by merging an aromatic boron cluster with a phosphine and a π-conjugated unit. To achieve this, a couple-close synthetic strategy via B–H activation of nido-carboranes with alkynes has been developed, which leads to diverse boron cluster-extended phosphoniums in a twisted structure with high yields under mild conditions. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the fusion between the boron cluster and the formed borophosphonium heterocycle facilitates electron delocalization throughout the structure. The unusual framework demonstrates distinct properties from bare boron clusters and pure aromatic ring-extended counterparts, such as improved thermal/chemical stability and photophysical properties. Thus, the boron cluster-based 3D conjugates expand the library of aromatic-based heterocyclics, showcasing great potential in functional materials. 2D π-conjugated systems incorporated with heteroatoms can suffer from stability issues and aggregation-induced quenching effects.

Here, the authors find that neonates and toddlers from economically disadvantaged backgrounds show accelerated brain development, with implications for language abilities in toddlerhood. 
 Environmental influences on brain structure and function during early development have been well-characterized, but whether early environments are associated with the pace of brain development is not clear. In pre-registered analyses, we use flexible non-linear models to test the theory that prenatal disadvantage is associated with differences in trajectories of intrinsic brain network development from birth to three years (n = 261). Prenatal disadvantage was assessed using a latent factor of socioeconomic disadvantage that included measures of mother’s income-to-needs ratio, educational attainment, area deprivation index, insurance status, and nutrition. We find that prenatal disadvantage is associated with developmental increases in cortical network segregation, with neonates and toddlers with greater exposure to prenatal disadvantage showing a steeper increase in cortical network segregation with age, consistent with accelerated network development. Associations between prenatal disadvantage and cortical network segregation occur at the local scale and conform to a sensorimotor-association hierarchy of cortical organization. Disadvantage-associated differences in cortical network segregation are associated with language abilities at two years, such that lower segregation is associated with improved language abilities. These results shed light on associations between the early environment and trajectories of cortical development.

 Kitaev chains in quantum dot-superconductor arrays are a promising platform for the realization of topological superconductivity. As recently demonstrated, even a two-site chain can host Majorana zero modes known as “poor man’s Majorana”. Harnessing the potential of these states for quantum information processing, however, requires increasing their robustness to external perturbations. Here, we form a two-site Kitaev chain using Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in proximitized quantum dots. By deterministically tuning the hybridization between the quantum dots and the superconductor, we observe poor man’s Majorana states with a gap larger than 70 μeV. The sensitivity to charge fluctuations is also greatly reduced compared to Kitaev chains made with non-proximitized dots. The systematic control and improved energy scales of poor man’s Majorana states realized with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states will benefit the realization of longer Kitaev chains, parity qubits, and the demonstration of non-Abelian physics.

 The rainfall variabilities of the West African and South American summer monsoons, pivotal for local and global climate systems, are strongly influenced by tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies. This study investigates the impacts of two recently identified Atlantic Niño types, central and eastern Atlantic Niño (CAN and EAN), on these monsoon systems using observational data and numerical experiments. During boreal summer, EAN events exhibit increased rainfall over West Africa compared to CAN events, indicating a strengthened West African summer monsoon. Enhanced moisture flux convergence from eastern Atlantic warming drives these wetting conditions during EAN events. Conversely, CAN events have a more pronounced influence on South American monsoon rainfall during austral summer, causing a rainfall anomaly dipole between the Amazon and eastern Brazil, suggesting an eastward shift in the South American summer monsoon rainfall belt. These rainfall changes are linked to cyclonic circulation anomalies over the southwest Atlantic Ocean, attributed to central Atlantic warming during CAN events. Furthermore, a statistical model assesses hindcast skills of rainfall variability in the two summer monsoon regions, affirming the benefits of separating Atlantic Niño into CAN and EAN events for improved seasonal climate predictions."

Our study reveals a robust intensification of winter precipitation across the US, except in the Southern Great Plains, where changes are very small. By the end of the 21st century, winter precipitation is projected to increase by about 2–5% K−1 over most of the US. The frequency of very wet winters is also expected to increase, with 6–7 out of 30 winters exceeding the very wet threshold under the different scenarios.

 Little is known about biological processes controlling inorganic phosphate (PO4) in groundwater ecosystems. Here we present analyses of groundwater samples from the Hetao Basin, China that show an increasing contribution of microbial cycling to groundwater PO4 from oxic to anoxic conditions along a flow path with phosphate-bound oxygen isotopes (δ18OPO4). Under oxic conditions, although 25–47% of the dissolved PO4 inherited the initial source signal of igneous apatite, groundwater δ18OPO4 reflected a pronounced impact of intracellular enzymatic cycling. Under anoxic conditions, dissolved PO4 carried a nearly exclusive equilibrium isotope signal, which was probably due to (i) release of PO4 with an equilibrium δ18OPO4 from Fe(III) oxides, as a result of Fe(III) reduction in the presence of Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing bacteria; and/or (ii) cumulative microbial cycling of dissolved PO4 with increasing groundwater residence time. Our study highlights that PO4 in groundwater is tightly microbially cycled under a wide range of redox conditions and microbial cycling contributes to the release of PO4 in groundwater.

 Land restoration is becoming increasingly popular as a climate change mitigation and adaptation measure. It is suggested that resulting vegetation changes can impact the local surface temperature through biophysical processes such as albedo warming and evaporative cooling. Yet, the potential effect of land restoration on the local surface temperature in Africa remains uncertain. In this study, we use Terra MODIS time series of vegetation, albedo, and land surface temperature to determine vegetation-temperature relationships at a continental scale. We show that vegetation-albedo and vegetation-temperature relationships do not only vary spatially across Africa but also temporally over different time scales, with strong cooling effects in semi-arid environments. Furthermore, we predict that land restoration can decrease local land surface temperature by around 0.2 Kelvin on average. This study gives a more detailed insight into where future land restoration provides additional positive climate impacts, and where land restoration may instead warm the local environment.

 Sea surface currents are of significant importance in various scientific and maritime applications. There are several measurement techniques available to study surface currents, however, they have limitations in spatial coverage and resolution. This study presents a proof-of-concept for a new measurement principle that relies on the difference between a ship’s speed relative to water and land. The approach involves estimating the ship speed vector relative to water from optical satellite imagery of Kelvin wakes. This ship speed vector is subtracted from the ship speed over ground, which is determined from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, to estimate the surface current. A case study in the Strait of Gibraltar was performed using two months of Sentinel-2 imagery, which yielded 81 visible Kelvin wakes over 25 images. Surface currents were estimated in directions parallel and perpendicular to the ship’s sailing line for each Kelvin wake. The estimated currents were validated with respect to surface currents derived from High-Frequency Radars (HFRs) and modelled currents from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The uncertainty in the two surface current components was estimated using triple collocation. After removing 12 data points with large ship course variability, standard deviations of 0.14 and 0.16 m s−1 were estimated for the surface currents along and across the sailing line, respectively. Despite limitations in measurement frequency due to satellite revisit times, cloud cover and Kelvin wake visibility, this new method can provide accurate estimates of sea surface currents in regions with high vessel density."

 High-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are essential for precise geographic analysis. However, obtaining high-resolution DEMs in regions with dense vegetation, complex terrain, or satellite imagery voids presents substantial challenges. This study introduces a deep learning approach using three-dimensional (3D) terrain features combined with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to reconstruct DEMs. The 3D terrain features, such as valley and ridge lines, exhibit topographic relief patterns and provide constraints for CGANs to reconstruct DEMs. Experiments conducted in the Loess Plateau of Shaanxi confirmed the performance of the proposed method, demonstrating marked improvements in the accuracy of DEM reconstruction compared to models based on two-dimensional (2D) terrain features. The elevation accuracy of the reconstructed DEMs by the proposed method is 5.30 m, which is higher than that of the 2D terrain features method (18.90 m) by 71.96 %. Meanwhile, the proposed method shows a 15.78 % and 17.64 % improvement in elevation accuracy and slope accuracy, respectively, when reconstructing a 5 m high-resolution DEM from a 30 m low-resolution DEM. The proposed method can be flexibly used for reconstructing, repairing, and filling voids in DEM data."

 Assessing the quality of UAV-HSIs (Unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral images) is crucial for evaluating sensor performance, identifying distortion types, and measuring data inversion accuracy. Due to the absence of reference images, UAV-HSI quality assessment leans towards no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), offering versatile applications. NR-IQA methods of remote sensing images using machine learning techniques have emerged, however, NR-IQA methods for UAV-HSIs containing multi-type and multiple distortions have not been developed. This paper introduces an NR-IQA method for UAV-HSI, employing machine learning techniques. We summarize and simulate distortion types in UAV-HSIs, constructing a quality assessment dataset based on 23 original high-quality and 806 simulated degraded UAV-HSIs. Extracting 129 features encompassing texture, color, transform domain, structural, and statistical aspects, we form seven feature sets through random and filtered feature selection algorithms. Ten machine learning quality assessment models are trained using this dataset and feature sets. The results showed that the model with the highest evaluation accuracy was extra trees (ET) (R2 = 0.928, RMSE = 0.326, RPD = 3.601), using feature set 1 that fuses Tamura texture, color, wavelet transform, and mean subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficient for a total of 11 features, the PLCC and SROCC of its predicted and true quality scores reached 0.963 and 0.925, respectively. In addition, the random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) also had high evaluation accuracies (R2 > 0.9 and RPD > 2.5). These findings underscore the applicability of our proposed machine learning-based NR-IQA method to assess the quality of the UAV-HSIs containing noise, blur, strip noise, and multiple distortions. Additionally, this study serves as a reference for selecting features and models for other hyperspectral image quality assessments."

 This study introduces an alternate spatial-temporal modeling-assisted InSAR time-series analysis method for mine subsidence mapping, aiming to address the large deformation gradients and decorrelation issues. The approach employs the iterative Modeling-Assisted Phase Unwrapping (MA-PU) algorithm for spatial phase unwrapping, and integrates it with temporal models to derive the deformation time-series. Four different inversion procedures are implemented to derive the time-series based on pixel types. The MA-PU method’s effectiveness in handling phase gradients is validated with simulations and real data analysis, showing superiority over non-model-based methods. The incorporation with temporal modeling and time-series inversion demonstrates advantages over time-series inversion alone in dealing with rank-deficiency issues within subsidence zones. The approach is applied to the West Cliff Colliery, Australia, using 23 ALOS-1 data. Results have been compared with GNSS data for validation. Obtained accuracy is approximately 16 mm, with a correlation of 0.99 between the two measurements, showing generally better performances compared to other methods. The comparison result suggest that this approach provides a more robust solution for monitoring mine subsidence in complex scenarios."
