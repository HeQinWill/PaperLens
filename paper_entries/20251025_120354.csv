10.1088/1748-9326/ae03d9,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注印度电动汽车电池的回收利用，以及在实现净零排放目标下，如何通过回收电池中的关键材料来支持可持续的电动汽车转型。论文侧重于预测未来电动汽车电池的报废量，以及通过回收利用能够获得的材料量。与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关联。,[],Poulomi Bhattacharya;Kartik Nair;Md Sarwar Ali;Ritika Verma;Anjali Singh,Projection of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries in India considering net-zero targets: a step towards circularity,"India’s expanding road transport network has significantly improved connectivity but contributes 14% of energy-related emissions. Electrification is central to India’s net-zero target by 2070, but this transition will generate substantial electric vehicle (EV) battery waste. Currently, waste management infrastructure for recycling and recovering critical battery materials (e.g. lithium, cobalt, nickel, phosphorous) is growing at an optimum pace with the help of government policy support and overwhelming participation from the private sector. This study estimates EV battery waste until 2050 and evaluates the quantum of critical battery minerals (e.g. lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, copper and phosphorous) recovered by battery waste under three distinct scenarios: • Business-As-Usual. Continues current EV sales trends (2014–2023) to project future adoption. • Transformative Scenario. Targets 30% EV sales by 2030, with segment-wise penetration (e.g. two-wheeler (2W)/three-wheeler (3W): 35%, cars: 12–25%, buses/trucks: 30%). • Accelerated Scenario. Aligns with NITI Aayog’s (NITI Aayog is a policy think tank of the Government of India, providing directional and policy inputs) net-zero targets, aiming for 100% 2W/3W, 30%–70% in other segments by 2030. And two sub-scenario of battery-chemistry: a nickel–manganese–cobalt (NMC)–dominant case (98% NMC and 2% lithium iron phosphate (LFP)) and a LFP–dominant case (20% NMC and 80% LFP). The study projects the volume of end-of-life battery waste using a Weibull distribution, capturing variations in service life across vehicle segments. Covering six key segments—2W, 3W, private and commercial cars, buses, and trucks. The study estimates EV battery waste generation to reach 37–80 GWh annually by 2030, growing further sevenfold by 2040 and tenfold by 2050. Recovered materials from end-of-life batteries could supply 28%–43% of India’s critical battery material needs by 2030 to 2050, emphasising the need for robust recycling systems to support a sustainable, circular EV transition. This article recommends circular economy-based policies and practices that combine producer responsibility with time-bound collection and recycling targets, minimum recycled content requirements, battery passport traceability and clear rules for the movement and valuation of end-of-life batteries."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae09bb,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注北极地区由于永久冻土融化导致的温室气体（二氧化碳和甲烷）排放问题，以及这些排放与气候变化之间的关系。虽然涉及大气成分（二氧化碳和甲烷），但其重点在于生态系统碳循环和气候反馈，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。研究方法主要依赖涡度协方差通量塔的地面观测数据。,"['carbon dioxide', 'methane', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'eddy covariance flux tower']",Grant Falvo;Edward A G Schuur;Eugénie S Euskirchen;Susan M Natali;Oliver Sonnentag;Haley Alcock;Kyle Arndt;Colin Edgar;Gabriel Hould-Gosselin;Jacqueline Hung;Justin Ledman,"Record 2024 winter carbon emissions coincide with record warmth across boreal forest, tundra, and wetland ecosystems","The warming Arctic could accelerate climate change as permafrost soil carbon is released as greenhouse gas emissions from boreal forest, tundra, and wetland ecosystems. Record climate conditions are increasingly common, with the 2023–2024 winter (September–April) documented as having the warmest land surface air temperatures on record for the Arctic region. However, corresponding impacts on ecosystem greenhouse gas fluxes typically take several years to diagnose, creating a knowledge gap between contemporary climate events and these fluxes. Here we synthesized near real-time data from 19 eddy covariance flux tower sites across the Arctic through the summer of 2024. This analysis revealed record net carbon dioxide and methane emissions occurring in winter, coinciding with warm 2023–2024 winter conditions. The increasing recognition of the importance of winter in shaping ecosystem carbon balance is still challenged by the difficulty of collecting data, with far more carbon flux measurements available in summer as compared to year-round. Improving the observation network’s extent and ability to deliver near real-time updates could provide immediate knowledge about the speed and strength of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate change. This increased awareness could help nations adapt their emissions policies aimed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0ae8,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文探讨了碳-气候反馈机制，重点关注陆地和海洋碳汇对二氧化碳浓度升高和气候变暖的响应。论文强调了利用地球观测技术，特别是卫星观测，来监测碳通量和温室气体浓度变化的重要性，尤其是在热带、高纬度和南大洋等脆弱地区。通过构建统一的多平台观测系统，可以提高地球系统模型的准确性，预警气候反馈和临界点，并为气候减缓策略提供信息，这与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['Carbon fluxes', 'Greenhouse gas partial columns', 'Earth Observations', 'Carbon-climate feedbacks', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition (CO2)', 'Climate monitoring']",Dustin Carroll;Nicholas C Parazoo;Nicole S Lovenduski;Michael Keller;David S Schimel;A Anthony Bloom,Observing system needs for understanding carbon–climate feedbacks,"Carbon–climate (CC) feedbacks — arising from response of land and ocean carbon sinks to elevated CO2 and climate warming — are critical yet highly uncertain drivers of Earth’s climate trajectory. Processes such as permafrost thaw, tropical forest dieback, reduced ocean uptake, and intensifying climate extremes are already weakening natural carbon sinks, with potential to amplify warming and accelerate crossing of tipping points. Detecting and quantifying these dynamics requires sustained, high-resolution, spatially-comprehensive Earth Observations. Drawing on outcomes from a 2024 community workshop, we identify three core priorities for advancing CC feedback monitoring: (1) frequent, long-term measurements of carbon fluxes and stocks at sub-continental scales; (2) improved flux detectability using greenhouse gas partial columns; and (3) targeted monitoring of poorly-observed vulnerable regions, such as the tropics, high latitudes, and the Southern Ocean. We argue that a unified, multi-platform observing system, built on lower-cost, proven technologies and orbits and focused on high-risk observation gaps, would significantly reduce uncertainties in Earth System Models, provide early warnings of feedbacks and tipping points, inform climate mitigation strategies, and enhance transparency in carbon monitoring."

However, biodiversity is not uniformly distributed across countries. Adequately addressing this crisis requires a scientific basis for selecting protected land that considers both ecological benefits and impacts to humans. We use the global change analysis model to evaluate land use tradeoffs of four land protection cases under two climate cases. We find that biodiversity-specific land protection up to 39% globally can reduce land use constraints and food prices compared to protecting 30% of land uniformly in each country (’30 × 30’ initiative). Valuing terrestrial carbon for climate change mitigation reduces land conversion pressure and can complement protection strategies. Global impacts to agriculture of additional land protection are small, but regional impacts vary and may be considerable. Overall, biodiversity-specific land protection has greater potential than a uniform target to meet both ecological and human needs."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0f40,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注厄尔尼诺-南方涛动(ENSO)对全球热浪传播的影响，通过构建气候网络来量化ENSO不同阶段（厄尔尼诺、拉尼娜和中性阶段）对热浪时空连接的调控作用。研究重点在于热浪的传播路径、距离以及与大气环流（如Rossby波和地势高度异常）的联系。虽然该研究与大气现象有关，但它主要侧重于气候动力学和热浪传播机制，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)', 'heatwave propagation', 'climate network', 'teleconnections', 'Rossby wave trains', 'geopotential anomalies']",Xinlong Zhang;Weiping Wang;Ping Shen,"ENSO-driven extreme heat propagation: network topology and pathways across El Niño, La Niña, and neutral phases","The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates global heatwave propagation through teleconnections, yet its phase-dependent control over spatiotemporal connectivity remains unclear. Here we develop a multi-scale climate network framework integrating geographic thresholds (2500 km) and directional event synchronization to quantify ENSO’s dual regulation of short- and long-range heatwave linkages across the Pacific–Indian Ocean domain. Analyses of 1979–2023 reanalysis data reveal El Niño amplifies trans-Pacific heatwave synchronization by 60% compared to neutral conditions, driven by Rossby wave trains facilitating >4000 km propagation. Conversely, La Niña confines heatwave propagation to regional scales through persistent anticyclonic circulation patterns, suppressing inter-basin linkages by 40% as regional systems prevent trans-oceanic propagation. Network topology shows El Niño’s bimodal distance distribution (peaks at 1000 km and 3000–4000 km) versus La Niña’s exponentially decaying pattern. Dynamical analysis links these patterns to phase-locked 850 hPa geopotential anomalies, demonstrating ENSO’s scale-selective control over extreme heat propagation."

In this paper we present the application of a free, open-source investment decision support tool we have developed, the MaritimeGCH, applied for the Greek fleet. We quantify the effect of two main interventions for a cost-effective carbon abatement, under the recent EU environmental regulations: the implementation of mature on-ship emission reduction technologies and transition scenarios to cleaner fuels. While significant emissions are achievable, even ambitious interventions fall short of fully decarbonizing the sector by 2050. This suggests that a more unified set of policy solutions are needed to achieve the national commitments."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae11c8,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注全球变暖背景下欧洲地区极端干旱（flash drought）的频率、范围和区域变化。它使用水文模型模拟土壤湿度，并分析不同升温幅度下干旱事件的发生情况。虽然气候变化与大气环境有关，但该研究的重点是土壤湿度和干旱，而不是大气成分、空气质量或遥感观测技术，因此与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['drought', 'soil moisture', 'climate change', 'global warming', 'hydrological model']",Devvrat Yadav;Rohini Kumar;Jignesh Shah;Vishal Thakur;Martin Hanel;Oldrich Rakovec,Increasing spatial extent and frequency of flash drought in Europe with each degree of global warming,"Flash droughts, characterised by sudden and severe development of dry soil moisture conditions, have detrimental impacts on agriculture and ecosystems. Since reliable projections of any kind of drought are crucial for drought risk mitigation, studying how these flash droughts evolve as warming increases becomes essential. Herein, we analyse changes in flash drought frequency, geographic extent, and regional variability across Europe under incremental global warming levels of 1 ∘C, 1.5 ∘C, 2 ∘C and 3 ∘C. Soil moisture simulations are obtained using the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM), which has been forced with the bias-corrected meteorological data from ISIMIP3b (Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3b). We use a percentile-based method to determine the rapid decline in soil moisture conditions during the growing season. Our results show that Northern and Central Europe are expected to see more frequent flash drought events at higher warming levels above 1.5 ∘C. As temperatures increase, new areas experience flash drought in Central Europe. In contrast, the increase in frequency and area is less in the Mediterranean. Across Europe, we expect the mean frequency of flash droughts to increase from around 3 events each decade at 1 ∘C to 5 events at 3 ∘C. The median value of the spatial area covered in flash drought is expected to increase from around 30% at 1 ∘C to close to 44% at 3 ∘C. Each degree of increase in warming is expected to add around one more flash drought event each decade and more than 6% of the area across Europe under flash drought. The threshold of 1.5 ∘C marks a significant increase in the area affected by flash droughts, highlighting the importance of adhering to the Paris Agreement targets and adaptation measures to counter such flash drought conditions and safeguard the agricultural economy, food security, and ecosystems."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1246,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注交通运输领域的能源消耗问题，探讨了出行时间和能源效率之间的关系。研究发现，人们的平均出行时间相对稳定，因此降低未来能源消耗的关键在于减少每小时出行的能源使用量。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关联。,"['energy consumption', 'transportation', 'travel time', 'efficiency', 'travel behavior']",Majdi Hunter-Batal;William Fajzel;Kevin Manaugh;A Ross Otto;Eric D Galbraith,Energy use per hour is key determinant of future transport energy consumption,"Transportation is a growing component of global energy consumption. Improvements in efficiency over time have reduced the energy used per kilometre travelled, but so far this has not reversed the increasing energy consumption per person. Instead, due to a complex interplay of factors—including changes in the built environment, shifts in transport modes, and human behaviour—average travel distances have increased, effectively negating efficiency gains. These adaptive dynamics have made it difficult to predict future energy consumption in travel. Here, we present data on remunerated and personal travel covering over half the global population, which supports a simple predictive heuristic based on energy use per unit of travel time, rather than distance. We find that total travel time among 43 countries converges to 1.3 ± 0.2 h d−1 and is invariant with per capita income across two orders of magnitude. This implies that psychological, social, and economic factors lead people to travel for similar daily durations, regardless of wealth, culture, geography, or transport technology, and that built environments and lifestyles co-evolve with economic and technological development to preserve stable travel times despite increasing travel speeds. Therefore, significant decreases in future energy consumption can only be achieved by reducing the average energy used per hour of human travel."
10.5194/acp-25-13687-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要都明确表明其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。论文利用中国DQ-1激光碳卫星的XCO2观测数据，结合高分辨率传输模型和贝叶斯反演系统，建立了一套量化和检测城市地区CO2排放的系统。研究重点关注化石燃料CO2排放的监测和约束，并探讨了卫星测量、传输模型和生物圈通量的不确定性对排放反演的影响。此外，该研究还分析了生物圈通量对局部XCO2增强的影响，并提出了改进模拟精度的方法。因此，该论文与空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等大气环境遥感技术领域高度相关。,"['XCO2', 'DQ-1 satellite', 'Fossil fuel CO2 emissions', 'Urban areas', 'Biospheric flux', 'Bayesian inversion', 'Transport model', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Jinchun Yi;Yiyang Huang;Zhipeng Pei;Ge Han,Urban Area Observing System (UAOS) simulation experiment using DQ-1 total column  concentration observations,"The inventory overestimated emissions in Beijing and Riyadh by 10–20 % and underestimated emissions in Cairo by 10–30 %. The biosphere flux has a 20–40 % impact on emissions in Beijing during certain periods. Moreover, using night-time and day-time biosphere flux data separately can improve the simulation accuracy of the same orbit by 20–70 % compared to using daily average data. 
 Satellite observations of the total column dry-air carbon dioxide (XCO2) have been proven to support the monitoring and constraining of fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions at the urban scale. We utilized the XCO2 retrieval data from China's first laser carbon satellite dedicated to comprehensive atmospheric environmental monitoring, DQ-1, in conjunction with a high-resolution transport model and a Bayesian inversion system, to establish a system for quantifying and detecting CO2 emissions in urban areas. Additionally, we quantified the impact of uncertainties from satellite measurements, transport models, and biospheric fluxes on emission inversions. To address uncertainties from the transport model, we introduced random wind direction and speed errors to the ffCO2 plumes and conducted 104 simulations to obtain the error distribution. In our pseudo-data experiments, the inventory overestimated fossil fuel emissions for Beijing and Riyadh, while underestimating emissions for Cairo. Specifically, we simulated Beijing and leveraged DQ-1's active remote sensing capabilities, utilizing its rapid day-night revisit ability. We assessed the impact of daily biospheric fluxes on ffXCO2 enhancements and further analyzed the diurnal variations of biospheric flux impacts on local XCO2 enhancements using three-hourly average NEE data. The results of a case study indicate that a significant proportion of local XCO2 enhancements are notably influenced by biospheric CO2 variations, potentially leading to substantial biases in ffCO2 emission estimates. Moreover, considering biospheric flux variations separately under day and night conditions can improve simulation accuracy by 20 %–70 %. With appropriate representations of uncertainty components and a sufficient number of satellite tracks, our constructed system can be used to quantify and constrain urban ffCO2 emissions effectively."

Our study assesses the effect of two widely used emission inventories of these species on ozone and the methane lifetime. Our results indicate tropospheric ozone and methane lifetime differences of around 4 % even though both emission inventories aim at representing present-day conditions. We further attribute the differences to emissions of individual sectors, e.g. land traffic. 
 This study assesses the influence of anthropogenic emission inventories of ozone (O3) precursor species (i.e. NOx, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs)) prescribed in the simulations of the two phases of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) on tropospheric O3, hydroxyl radical (OH), and the methane (CH4) lifetime. We performed two transient simulations for the period 2000–2010 with the chemistry–climate model EMAC, one prescribing the emission inventory of CCMI-1 and the other that of CCMI-2022. Using the tagging approach, we attribute the differences of O3, OH, and the tropospheric CH4 lifetime to individual emission sectors. It is, to our knowledge, the first application of the tagging approach to attribute changes of the simulated CH4 lifetime to individual emission sectors.The emission inventory used for CCMI-2022 leads to a 3.7 % larger tropospheric O3 column and to a 3.2 % shorter tropospheric CH4 lifetime compared to CCMI-1 in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropospheric O3 column is 4.5 % larger, and the tropospheric CH4 lifetime 4.3 % shorter. Differences in tropospheric O3 are largely driven by changes of emissions from the anthropogenic non-traffic and land transport sectors in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the primary contributors are emissions from anthropogenic non-traffic, biomass burning, and shipping. These sectors also play a significant role in reducing the simulated tropospheric CH4 lifetime. However, the contribution of a particular sector to changes in O3 does not necessarily align with its impact on the CH4 lifetime."

In addition to upward-propagating planetary wave 2 (PW2), westward PW2 generated in-situ by barotropic–baroclinic instability, contributed to the vortex split. Unstable PW2 growth resulted from nonlinear wave-wave interactions and over-reflection. Vortex destabilization occurred as the anomalously poleward-shifted vortex reversed to easterlies. 
 On 25 September 2002, the Southern Hemisphere experienced its first and only major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW02) since routine upper-atmospheric observations commenced in 1957. This event was marked by a sudden splitting of the polar vortex. While previous studies focused on tropospheric waves and vortex preconditioning, the role of in situ-excited planetary waves (PWs) remains unexplored. The current study addressed this gap by examining the impact of in situ-generated PWs on SSW02. As the onset approached, the displaced polar vortex elongated and split into two. The explosive amplification of zonal wavenumber (ZWN) 2 PWs (PW2) at 10 hPa was driven not only by upward-propagating PW2 from below but also by westward- and downward-propagating PW2 excited in the mid-to-upper stratosphere. This spontaneous PW2 generation was associated with barotropic–baroclinic instability, triggered by easterlies descending from the polar lower mesosphere. An unusual poleward shift of the polar vortex facilitated the development of easterlies by directing ZWN1 PWs (PW1) into the polar stratosphere, where they deposited strong westward momentum. This poleward displacement was attributed to anomalous easterlies in the equatorial upper stratosphere. PW2 amplification via instability involved two mechanisms: (i) PW1 breaking generated smaller-scale waves through a nonlinear energy cascade while inducing instability that amplified those waves, and (ii) over-reflection of upward-propagating PW2. A nonlinear energy cascade initiated PW2 amplification, with over-reflection contributing immediately before the onset. Instability-driven wave growth and equatorial easterlies in the upper stratosphere also appear in other vortex-splitting SSWs, suggesting their broader significance in SSW dynamics."

This study examines aerosol composition and size distribution over the eastern China seas across four seasons, revealing how anthropogenic pollutants interact with natural aerosols. The strong effects of these interactions on nitrogen partitioning, dust composition, and sea salt chloride depletion are quantified, with implications for understanding nutrient deposition and coastal ozone chemistry. 
 Marine aerosols play important roles in climate, marine biogeochemistry, and coastal air quality. Over the eastern China seas adjacent to densely populated East Asia, aerosols are mutually affected by anthropogenic pollution and natural emissions. However, the impacts of anthropogenic–natural interactions on aerosol composition and properties are not well constrained, due to limited systematic observations. Here we characterized the composition of size-resolved aerosols over this region across four seasonal cruise campaigns, identifying major aerosol sources and influencing processes. Aerosol mass concentrations typically show trimodal distributions, with fine-mode mass dominating in spring and winter, due to strong influences of continental pollution. However, in 50.9 % of samples, continental secondary aerosols are highly aged, lacking a fine-mode NO3- peak. Gaseous HNO3 evaporated from continental secondary aerosols and anthropogenic NOx react with natural dust and sea spray aerosols (SSAs), forming coarse-mode NO3-, which contributes 43.2 % and 12.7 % of total NO3-, respectively. This shifts NO3- from fine to coarse mode, altering the spatial pattern of nitrogen deposition and its ecological effects. Additionally, 27.7 % of SSA Cl− is depleted on average, reaching 40.8 % in summer; this is an important source of reactive halogens that affect ozone chemistry. Shipping emissions contributed to more than 20 % of SO42- in spring and summer before the International Maritime Organization's 2020 regulation, but this contribution probably decreased by one order of magnitude thereafter. This analysis highlights the importance of anthropogenic–natural interactions over coastal seas, underscoring the need for further studies to assess their subsequent environmental impacts."

By combining atmospheric simulation and machine learning, we show that shipping emissions increase ozone levels by an average of 3.5 ppb nationwide, with large differences depending on location and season. Our findings highlight that controlling shipping emissions together with land-based sources is critical for improving air quality. 
 With the Two Phases of Clean Air Actions in China, the shipping sector has emerged as a significant source with substantial emission reduction potential compared to land-based anthropogenic sectors. Therefore, understanding the contribution of shipping emissions to ozone (O3) pollution is therefore essential for advancing China's air pollution control efforts. In this study, a coupled framework including a chemical transport model with machine learning techniques was developed to systematically investigate the interannual and seasonal impacts of shipping emissions on O3 concentrations across China during the period from 2016 to 2020, and explore mechanisms by which shipping emissions influence O3 formation. Results indicate that shipping emissions increase O3 concentrations by a five-year average of 3.5 ppb nationwide, exhibiting significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity across different regions and seasons. Although significant differences exist between the emissions of ocean vessels and inland vessels, their contributions to O3 formation are becoming increasingly comparable. Solely controlling shipping emissions may has limited impact on O3 mitigation. Instead, coordinated reductions targeting both shipping and land-based anthropogenic sources, along with region-specific and targeted emission control strategies, are critical for achieving substantial improvements in O3 pollution mitigation."

We suggested that anthropogenic source dominated the OA origins, and the gas-phase and particle-phase oxidation processes are conducive to the formation of sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds, respectively. 
 Understanding the chemical composition and quantifying the sources of organic aerosols (OA) are crucial for assessing their formation and human-related effects, yet individual mass spectrometry techniques still struggle to reveal the effects of sources and atmospheric processes on OA composition at the molecular level. In this study, we combined for the first time a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), a thermal-desorption aerosol gas-chromatograph-mass spectrometer (TAG-MS), and an electrospray ionization high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer (HR-MS) to analyze OA at a background site in South China from bulk to molecular levels. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis based on AMS data and organic tracers from TAG-MS showed that the low-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA1) was mainly contributed by biomass burning-related OA (BB-OA) and gas-phase secondary OA (gas-pSOA), while the high-oxidization degree of more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) was mainly due to isoprene-derived secondary OA. Using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach constrained by PMF source contributions to offline HR-MS data, we identified molecules associated with each PMF-resolved factor. The NMF resolved cooking-related OA (C-OANMF) factor exhibited the highest O/C ratio but the lowest double bond equivalent (DBE) value, whereas the BB-OANMF factor was characterized by the greatest aromaticity and a high abundance of nitroaromatics. For secondary processes, sulfur additions played a more significant role in gas-pSOA than in secondary inorganic aerosol-related OA (SIA-OA). Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the sources and formation of different AMS components, reveals the impact of different sources on the molecular composition of OA, and underscore the prominent impact of anthropogenic emissions and their photo-oxidation on ambient OA in areas with low particulate matter pollution but high O3 levels."

The overall results provide the observation-based molecular evidence that marine emissions may play a significant role in the formation of aromatic and aliphatic organic sulfur and nitrogen aerosols in the South China Sea. 
 Marine atmospheric organic aerosols play a pivotal role in regulating global climate dynamics and influencing marine biogeochemical cycles. Compared to the extensive research on marine isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), the origins of marine aromatic and aliphatic organic aerosols remain elusive. Here, organosulfates (OSs) and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) were measured in PM2.5 collected in Sansha (the South China Sea), a region with minimal anthropogenic pollution, to investigate the potential impact of marine emissions on their formation. The proportion of aliphatic and aromatic OSs in the total OSs was higher in Sansha than in other Chinese cities investigated. The abundances of biogenic OSs correlated with both total aliphatic OS and NOC abundances, as well as with total aromatic OS and NOC abundances. Two typical SOA tracers (C6H5O4S− and C7H7O4S−), which are formed via the atmospheric oxidation of marine benzene and toluene, were found to increase with rising chlorophyll a and isoprene levels in surface seawater. Additionally, the impact of long-range transport and ship emissions on the abundances of OSs and NOCs was found to be insignificant. These results together with mantel test analysis suggest that marine-derived precursors may substantially contribute to the formation of aliphatic and aromatic OSs and NOCs in the Sansha region. Overall, this study provides the observation-based molecular evidence that marine biogenic emissions may play a significant role in the formation of aromatic and aliphatic organic aerosols in the South China Sea."

Error analysis reveals seasonal variation with lower accuracy in autumn/winter, and increased uncertainty with lower Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI. 
 A global AOD retrieval product from the Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) has been proposed. We have validated the AOD from the early stages of on-orbit operation and achieved high accuracy, but we lack an understanding of the retrieval accuracy over longer time scales from a systematic validation and analysis of POSP-retrieved AOD. The objectives of the current study are: (1) To ensure the reliability of POSP AOD products and explore the potential factors influencing their performance; (2) To provide a valuable reference for the enhancement of these products in future developments. To achieve these objectives, POSP AOD products have been validated using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements (over 276 sites) as reference. The results from 19 314 collocations show a high accuracy, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.914, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.085, and the fraction within the expected error (EE) of 78.5 %. In addition, the validation at individual sites indicates that the performance of POSP products is better than that of MODIS (Deep Blue and Dark Target) AOD. Further error analysis indicates that the accuracy of POSP AOD exhibits a clear seasonal variation, being lower in the autumn and winter than in the spring and summer. Additionally, the uncertainty in AOD increases as NDVI decreases. Globally, the spatial variability of the quarterly averaged AOD has been analysed. The results show that the validation metrics of POSP and MODIS AOD are comparable. However, over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, POSP AOD is in better agreement with MAIAC AOD, while over other regions, it is in better agreement with DB/DT AOD."

Chalov,The Northern Eurasian Riverbank Migration  multi-tool dataset (NERM),"This study presents a unique multi-tool dataset on riverbank migration across Northern Eurasia, covering 140 000 km of river channels over a period of up to 70 years. Using satellite imagery and field observations, we identify key drivers of bank erosion at a large spatial scale and highlight the role of river discharge and permafrost. The dataset enhances understanding of river channel dynamics and supports the development of predictive models for river channel evolution and erosion risk assessment. 
 Riverbank erosion monitoring and modeling have a long-standing tradition in Earth system science. The current body of research primarily relies on observations at the basin and site levels. We endeavored to compile a comprehensive dataset of riverbank migration observations using a variety of measurement techniques, with both field-based and remote sensing data. The dataset comprises information from 12 extensive river basins situated in Northern Eurasia, encompassing rivers that drain into the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and Pacific oceans, and the Caspian Sea, specifically the catchments of the Vistula, Volga, Ural, Ob, Nadym, Yenisey, Lena, Indigirka, Yana, Kolyma, Amur, and Kamchatka rivers. The rivers included in the dataset vary in terms of environmental conditions and have average discharges of between 0.3 and 19 700 m3 s−1. This study examined approximately 140 000 km of rivers in Northern Eurasia, covering small, medium, and large rivers, with data from up to 70 years of water classifications obtained from satellite images, including those from Landsat and Keyhole, across 626 772 river channel segments. The dataset collected average and maximum bank retreat rates (m yr−1), average areas of bank retreat (m2 yr−1), and gross bank-erosion sediment yield (t yr−1). It also recorded possible drivers, encompassing both hydrological and catchment factors like permafrost, natural land zones, and geology. Our study showed that river discharge and permafrost distribution are the primary indicators of riverbank erosion in Northern Eurasia. These data will enhance comprehension of bank erosion processes and their underlying factors, thereby facilitating the development of more accurate predictive models of river channels. The dataset is available open access via the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15965461) (Chalov et al., 2025a)."

This long record helps understand local climate change and supports future environmental research. 
 This study presents a comprehensive long-term dataset of ground-based atmospheric observations collected at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO), Sweden, between August 2009 and April 2025. The dataset includes measurements of temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitations, wind speed, gust and direction, and solar irradiance. It offers high-resolution insight into local weather patterns and seasonal variations, making it a valuable resource for climate monitoring and regional environmental studies. Preliminary analysis reveals a warming trend of ∼0.15 °C.yr-1, with significant seasonal contrasts: the most pronounced increase occurs in winter (203.3 % above the annual trend, so winters are becoming milder), followed by autumn (80.1 %), spring (62.3 %), and summer (32.9 %). Precipitation trends show a significant decrease over the study period. Anomalies such as the particularly cold winters in 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 or the particularly warm winter in 2019–2020 are highlighted and linked with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phases.

The new model is evaluated against data from three different tracer gas experiments, and the promising results are an important first step towards also using DERMA for short-range dispersion modeling. 
 The Danish Emergency Response Model of the Atmosphere (DERMA) is a Lagrangian puff model originally developed for long-range dispersion modeling, at distances longer than roughly 50 km from the source. The model is used operationally as part of Danish emergency preparedness for the prediction of atmospheric dispersion in case of nuclear accidents, airborne spread of animal diseases, and ash from volcanic eruptions.  To be able to simulate dispersion on shorter spatial scales, a new description of turbulent diffusion has been developed and implemented in DERMA, combining a stochastic particle approach with a classic puff model.  Furthermore, updates have been made to the parameterizations of the turbulent wind fluctuations and Lagrangian timescales, the boundary layer height, and the initial plume rise due to heat release.  These improvements allow a more realistic description of turbulent diffusion near the release location, while an updated version of the existing turbulence description is used at longer distances.  The new version of DERMA is evaluated against three different tracer gas experiments: the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX), the Øresund experiment, and the Kincaid experiment.  The results indicate that the new particle-puff hybrid approach gives more accurate predictions, especially on shorter spatial scales, while a small improvement is also observed for long-range dispersion."

 Optical holography has undergone rapid development since its invention in 1948, but the accompanying speckles with alternating dark and bright spots of randomly varying shapes are still untamed now due to the intrinsic fluctuations from irregular complex-field superposition. Despite spatial, temporal and spectral averages for speckle reduction, holographic images cannot yet meet the requirement for high-homogeneity, edge-sharp and shape-unlimited features in optical display and lithography. Here we report that holographic speckles can be removed by narrowing the probability density distribution of encoded phase to homogenize optical superposition. Guided by this physical insight, an Adam-gradient-descent probability-shaping (APS) method is developed to prohibit the fluctuations of intensity in a computer-generated hologram (CGH), which empowers the experimental reconstruction of irregular images with ultralow speckle contrast (C = 0.08) and record-high edge sharpness (~1000 mm−1). These well-behaved performances revitalize CGH for lensless lithography, enabling experimental fabrication of arbitrary-shape and edge-sharp patterns with spatial resolution of 0.54λ/NA.

 Tuning the electronic properties of nanocatalysts via doping with monodispersed hetero-metal atoms is an effective method used to enhance catalytic properties. Doping CuO nanoparticles with monodispersed Co atoms using different reductants affords catalysts (CoBCu/Al2O3 and CoHCu/Al2O3) with strikingly different electronic structures. Compared to CoHCu/Al2O3, the CuO nanoparticles in CoBCu/Al2O3 have longer and weaker Cu-O bonds, with a lower 1s → 4pz antibonding transition and higher 4p → 1s bonding transition (as demonstrated from HERFD-XANES and valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy). The weaker Cu-O bonds in CoBCu/Al2O3 lead to superior redox activity of the CuO nanoparticles, evidenced from operando XAFS and in-situ near ambient pressure-near edge X-ray absorption fine structures studies. Such superior redox properties of CuO in CoBCu/Al2O3 result in a much reduced activation energy of CoBCu/Al2O3 compared to CoHCu/Al2O3 (40.0 vs. 63.5 kJ/mol), thus leading to an enhancement in catalytic performance in the selective catalytic oxidation of NH3 to N2.

 A microbe is pathogenic when it manages to survive in its host and, often, is able to proliferate. Thus, virulence entails coping with host defenses in parallel to dissemination and/or attack of the host. How the pathogen endures the attack by effectors of the immune response remains insufficiently understood. Here, we report that planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not immediately virulent in a Drosophila model of acute infection. Bacteria undergo a maturation step called priming, which is required for transition to virulence. Primed bacteria switch to a bacillus shape, only in vivo, proliferate and resist the action of a specific combination of antimicrobial peptides. This priming mechanism requires an interplay between two major effectors of the type IV pili (T4P), FimV and Vfr, which enhance lateral cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Interestingly, N-acetyl-muramic acid (NAM) abolishes the virulence of the injected bacteria, which become round, and prevents the localization of the T4P hub protein FimV at bacterial poles, and cAMP signaling. In contrast, N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) counteracts the action of NAM by promoting FimV polar placement. In fact, NAG alone accelerates the speed of P. aeruginosa priming in a PilJ-dependent manner. This suggests that the NAG sensed by microorganisms is a common signal that promotes virulence through a morphological switch, both in bacteria and pathogenic dimorphic yeasts.

Here, the authors report that covalent nanopore sensing enables the targeted detection of aldehydes in mixtures through reversible thiol–aldehyde chemistry, offering a route to portable and low-cost analysis. 
 Volatile organic compounds are choice analytes in a variety of contexts. For example, humans release over 4000 volatile organic compounds, many of which are diagnostic of life-threatening medical conditions. The analysis of combinations of a large number of potential analytes requires the application of costly, cumbersome technology. In this work, we show that covalent nanopore sensing can be used for the targeted detection of a reduced set of analytes in a mixture. In this case aldehydes, which constitute ~5% of human volatiles, can be selectively detected by using reversible thiol-aldehyde chemistry. Further, nanopore engineering permits high-resolution detection, which allows closely related aldehydes, including isomers, to be distinguished. Differential sensing of members of other chemical classes, such as mono alcohols, is also demonstrated by leveraging their enzymatic conversion into aldehydes. Our approach is compatible with the use of low-cost, portable, user-friendly diagnostic devices applicable to a wide variety of objectives, including pollutant monitoring, food and beverage testing and the quality control of pharmaceuticals, as well as disease diagnostics.

 Sea levels respond to climate change on timescales from decades to millennia. To isolate the sea-level contribution of historical and near-term GHG emissions, we use a dedicated scenario and modelling framework to quantify global and regional sea-level rise commitments of twenty-first century cumulative emissions. Under current climate policies, emissions until 2050 lock in 0.3 m (likely range 0.2–0.5 m) more global mean sea-level rise by 2300 than historical emissions until 2020. This additional commitment would grow to 0.8 m (0.5–1.4 m) for emissions until 2090, of which 0.6 m (0.4–1.1 m) could be avoided under very stringent mitigation. Resulting regional commitments would be around 10% higher than the global signal for the vulnerable Pacific region, mainly due to higher relative Antarctic contributions. Our work shows that multi-century sea-level rise commitments are strongly controlled by mitigation decisions in coming decades.

Nearly half of global maize and wheat-growing regions receive a substantial share of rainfall from terrestrial water sources and are at greater risk of water scarcity. 
 Water availability critically influences crop phenology and agricultural productivity. Here we use satellite-derived water isotope observations and physical models to trace atmospheric moisture origins for major global rain-fed crops from 2003 to 2019, distinguishing between oceanic and terrestrial sources. Our analysis shows that the fraction of rainwater originating from land (f) varies both geographically and seasonally, with an important threshold at ~36%. Regions with higher f, that is, more dependent on land-originating water, are more prone to insufficient rainwater supply and soil moisture deficits during the main growing season. Crops in these regions show higher sensitivity to hydroclimate—with reduced productivity in lower-rainfall years—and a higher likelihood of drought. Notably, more than 40% of global maize and 60% of winter wheat is grown in regions where rainfall depends heavily on land-originating moisture (f ≥ 36%), underscoring the vulnerability of key staple crops to hydroclimate stress. Our results highlight the importance of managing local land moisture sources and reveal where targeted water management strategies would be most expected to enhance agricultural resilience.

 Landforms created by flowing water with sediment have left deposits on the surface of Mars, allowing study of the ancient environment. These features could provide constraints on surface water activity and past habitability. However, only a few lab studies have investigated the appearance and behavior of sediment-rich flows at relevant Mars surface conditions. We conducted experiments in a Mars environment chamber to understand the rheology and deposit morphology of mud under atmospheric pressures from 5 to 1000 mbar and surface temperatures between 248 and 297 K. We found that sediment flows in the Noachian era, when most aqueous activity occurred, could behave similarly to Earth analogs, but only under certain climate conditions. However, in the Hesperian and Amazonian periods, the dominant physical regime changed due to global atmospheric loss. Sediment flows during these eras would not have been similar to Earth analogs, and would have been dominated by freezing, evaporative cooling, and boiling depending on the microclimate (local pressure and temperature). Thus, regional climate and compositional context are important factors for interpreting satellite remote sensing images of these features on Mars. The results suggest we may be able to discover the paleo-atmospheric pressure record on Mars by analyzing sediment flow morphology.

 Risk assessments of oil spills in the marine environment typically only address dissolved oil.

Here, we present a framework for quantifying exposure of dissolved and droplet oil on adhesive fish eggs and implement the framework in a well-established numerical model for ocean, oil and fish eggs. Utilizing the model for a case study with an oil spill in the habitat of the world’s largest haddock stock, Northeast Arctic haddock, shows that droplets for a given concentration cover a much larger domain than dissolved oil. Impact assessments not taking oil droplets into account may therefore severely underestimate the impact of oil spills and result in decisions with inappropriate weighting of societal benefits to ecosystem impacts. Finally, our results call for more experimental work on the impact of oil droplets on marine species. Oil droplets can spread in significant concentrations over a wider geographic region than dissolved oil and cause prolonged exposure of fish eggs by adhesion, according to an exposure framework and simulations of the Lofoten Islands, Norway."

 As a dominant component of the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNSFP) in the Three-North Region of China (TNR), farmland shelterbelts (FSs or windbreaks) play crucial roles in reducing wind erosion and soil degradation. However, large-scale FS products are currently unavailable, posing challenges for their monitoring and optimization. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning-based framework to extract FSs from Sentinel-2 data and analyze their spatial patterns in the TNR. This study produced the first 10-m resolution FS map and the first vectorized FS network for the TNR in 2022. Our results indicated that the total length of FSs was 915.09 ± 21.45 thousand km, while the total area was 1575.18 ± 58.75 thousand ha. Both FS length and area were highest in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, whereas the lowest values were observed in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qinghai. The average FS to farmland ratio, connectivity, and FS deviation angle were 2.83 % (± 0.11 %), 0.34, and 26°, respectively, highlighting potential for structural optimization. FSs were more concentrated, with well-structured spatial patterns in Northeast China and Xinjiang, while further construction efforts were needed in the Hetao Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and Hexi Corridor. The final FS map demonstrated robust performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the pixel-based user's accuracy was 79.20 % and the producer's accuracy was 79.39 %. The average object-based F1-score was 84.13 % and the average length-weighted F1-score was 89.62 %. Overall, this study provides fundamental data and valuable insights to support agricultural infrastructure assessment and optimization."

 Cloud and cloud shadow (CCS) detection is an integral pre-processing step in optical remote sensing workflows. Residual CCS can distort subsequent analyses, such as land use and land cover classification. The accuracy of operational cloud masks varies across ecoregions, with tropical regions being among the most error-prone. This study evaluates the performance of the EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) mission’s operational CCS masks over tropical western Kenya and proposes an improvement framework. Our assessment reveals shortcomings in the delineation of CCS objects and a frequent omission of small clouds. Additionally, pixels along the water-land interface and in wetlands are frequently misclassified. To address these shortcomings, we developed EnICCS (EnMAP’s Improved Cloud and Cloud Shadows), an open-source tool that improves upon operational masks using band indices, thresholding, and masking, followed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and a post-processing routine that enforces the physical positional relationships between clouds and their shadows. EnICCS outperforms EnMAP’s operational CCS masks for the given region. It achieves F1 scores of 0.93 for clouds and 0.79 for shadows compared to 0.80 and 0.58, respectively. Object delineation is improved by up to 30%. The lightweight framework is designed for execution on standard end-user machines.

 The Asian-Pacific Oscillation (APO), a seesaw teleconnection in upper-tropospheric temperatures over the Asian-North Pacific sector, significantly influences the Northern Hemispheric climate. Thus, it is important to explore factors affecting the APO variability and associated mechanisms. Using the reanalysis data from 1980 to 2020, this study reveals that the interannual variability of spring APO is significantly correlated to the preceding autumn sea ice concentration over the Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (CBSIC), with a correlation coefficient of −0.44. Namely, a reduction of autumn CBSIC is followed by a strengthened spring APO, and vice versa. This relationship is suggested to be linked by the North Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The reduced CBSIC in autumn can induce a low-level dipole pattern with an anomalous cyclonic circulation over the Bering Sea and an anomalous anticyclonic circulation to its south, conducive to SST cooling (warming) in the central-eastern (northwestern) Pacific. These SST anomalies persist and evolve into a horseshoe-shaped pattern in spring. The enhanced mid-latitude meridional SST gradient favors a northward shift of the subtropical jet stream, increasing (decreasing) the upper-tropospheric geopotential height over the mid-low latitudes of Asia (central-eastern Pacific), which aligns with the atmospheric situation of positive APO. Meanwhile, cold central-eastern Pacific SSTs induce anomalous subsidence, which links to anomalous ascent over Asia via a zonal vertical circulation. This configuration reduces (enhances) atmospheric heating over the central-eastern Pacific (Asia), resulting in a strengthened APO. This physical process derived from the reanalysis is visible in the ensemble simulations of Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Earth System Model version 1.5 (ACCESS-ESM1.5) that can reproduce the significant inverse relationship between autumn CBSIC and spring APO."

 The Mediterranean region is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change, which is expected to significantly impact densely populated coastal areas and alter the distribution and dynamics of its ecosystems. Recent research highlights an increasing frequency of extremes that are related to air temperature and precipitation. Taking into consideration that surface air temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century and mean precipitation is distinctly possible to decrease in dry, mid-latitude regions, we faced the challenge of analyzing four compound extreme climate indices over the Mediterranean region, during the period 1950–2018. These compound extreme climate indices – Cold/Dry (CD), Cold/Wet (CW), Warm/Dry (WD) and Warm/Wet (WW) - are defined by the exceedances of joint modes of air temperature and precipitation thresholds, using the 25th and 75th percentile to capture a broader range of extreme events. In this work, the means and the trends of the examined indices over the entire study period and for consecutive 30-year periods were quantified and evaluated. Additionally, the impact of the large teleconnection patterns, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and North Sea Caspian Pattern (NCP), on these extreme indices was assessed."
