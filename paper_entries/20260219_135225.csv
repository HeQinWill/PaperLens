Pendergrass;Laura Hyesung Yang;Ke Li;Hong Liao,Large and increasing stratospheric contribution to tropospheric ozone over East Asia,"Surface ozone pollution in East Asia is among the highest in the world and has risen steadily over the past two decades. Using aircraft observations and a global 3-D chemical transport model, we show that ozone in the lower atmosphere in East Asia has risen in part due to intensified transport from the upper atmosphere. This rising natural background limits the effectiveness of local pollution controls, with major implications for air quality policy. 
 Severe surface ozone pollution in South Korea and China in May–June is due in part to an elevated background subsiding from the free troposphere (750–350 hPa). Using IAGOS commercial aircraft observations and the GEOS-Chem model, we show that free tropospheric ozone over East Asia in May–June is the highest in the world and has increased from 68 ± 3 ppb (mean and interannual standard deviation) in 2000–2004 to 78 ± 4 ppb in 2015–2019. Free tropospheric ozone over East Asia is highest when carbon monoxide (CO) is low, both in the observations and GEOS-Chem, implying a large stratospheric influence on ozone. We find from GEOS-Chem that East Asia is a global hotspot for stratospheric downwelling of ozone and that this makes a major contribution to the free tropospheric ozone over the region in May–June. Stratospheric downwelling of ozone over East Asia in GEOS-Chem increased by 40 % from 2000–2004 to 2015–2019, which can explain the observed free tropospheric ozone increase over this period. Increased stratospheric downwelling over East Asia appears to be driven by a strengthening of the jet stream. The large and increasing stratospheric contribution to the surface ozone background over East Asia is a major impediment to meeting ozone air quality standards."

Nelson;Sophia Walther;Martin Jung;Fabian Gans;László Haszpra;Ana Bastos,Constraining a data-driven CO2 flux model by ecosystem and atmospheric observations using atmospheric transport,"We create a hybrid ecosystem-level carbon flux model using both eddy-covariance observations and observations of the atmospheric mole fraction of CO2 at three tall-tower observatories. Our study uses an atmospheric transport model (STILT) to connect the atmospheric signal to the ecosystem-level model. We show that this inclusion of atmospheric information meaningfully improves the model's representation of the interannual variability of the global net flux of CO2. 
 Global estimates of the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) from data-driven models differ widely depending on their underlying data and methodology. Bottom-up models trained on eddy-covariance data are most informative at the ecosystem-level. Top-down models, such as atmospheric inversions, produce regional and global results consistent with the observed atmospheric growth rate, accurately capturing the interannual variability (IAV) of NEE. Both approaches have limitations estimating NEE across scales: Bottom-up models can miss large-scale dynamics of NEE when aggregated globally. Top-down approaches have difficulty relating the large-scale atmospheric signal to biophysical processes at smaller scales. To address these limitations, we create a model that uses a hybrid combination of direct observations and atmospheric dynamics to integrate ecosystem-level eddy-covariance data and atmospheric CO2 mole fraction data into a single coherent ecosystem-level flux model.Aggregated globally, our new model estimates an annual sink with a low bias, and consistent IAV when compared with independent estimates. The IAV of the estimated NEE is closer in magnitude to an ensemble of atmospheric inversions, and our model produces a higher temporal coefficient of correlation with these data than state-of-the-art bottom-up data-driven models. This improvement in IAV is achieved without direct access to the observed variability of the atmosphere: the model is trained using only one year of daytime observations from 3 tall-tower observatories. No atmospheric information is available to the model during the production of global NEE estimates. This shows the efficiency of our method in synthesizing top-down information into bottom-up mapping of flux-environment relationships."

PM2.5 (particulate matter) decreased by 9.1-31.4 μg/m³ and PM10 by 9.8–42.9 μg/m³. Weather factors like humidity, air pressure, and rainfall influenced pollution, with tailored solutions needed for different regions. 
 Accurately quantifying the relative roles of anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions is essential for understanding long term changes in particulate matter (PM). Using ground observations from 40 cities, GEOS-FP meteorology, CEDS emissions, and monthly LightGBM models, this study assesses the drivers of PM2.5 and PM10 across the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions during 2015–2022. The models demonstrate strong predictive skill (R/R2=0.82/0.67 for PM2.5 and 0.81/0.65 for PM10), with consistently high performance across cities. Both pollutants exhibit significant decreasing trends over the study period. Counterfactual experiments show that emission reductions overwhelmingly dominate these improvements. PM2.5 emission driven changes intensify from −9.1 µg m−3 in 2016 to −31.4 µg m−3 in 2022, while PM10 reductions strengthen from −9.8 to −42.9 µg m−3. Meteorology driven contributions appear as positive net anomalies at the interannual scale (approximately +2–4 µg m−3 for PM2.5 and +0.5–3 µg m−3 for PM10), indicating that air quality improvements were achieved despite year to year meteorological influences. SHAP attribution highlights 2 m air temperature (T2M), humidity (QV2M), and key precursors as dominant predictors. Interaction diagnostics further indicate that meteorological conditions modulate the effectiveness of precursor emissions, without implying direct causal mechanisms. These results provide a comprehensive data driven assessment of the factors shaping PM evolution in two major urban clusters of China."

Oxygenated VOCs were the most abundant and showed strong daytime increases due to sunlight-driven chemistry.  Air-mass analysis showed that transport from Middle East strongly influenced aromatic VOC levels. Climate–chemistry modeling underestimated most VOCs, highlighting gaps in current emission and chemical processes. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation, yet multi-year observations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) remain limited. This study presents multi-year (April 2022–June 2024) high-resolution measurements of 76 VOCs using PTR-ToF-MS at a rural background site in Cyprus, combined with HYSPLIT air-mass analysis to examine the effects of regional transport on VOCs variability. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) dominated the VOCs burden (∼ 79 %), followed by aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and terpenes. Most VOCs exhibited clear diurnal patterns, observed highest during 08:00–14:00 UTC, varying by species, due to enhanced photochemical activity and temperature-driven emissions. Terpenes, particularly isoprene, increased exponentially with temperature upto 35–38 °C but decreased beyond this threshold, indicating heat-stress inhibition. Monoterpenes showed elevated levels both day and night, reflecting contributions from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. OVOCs, including acetone, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetic acid, showed sharp enhancement above 35 °C, consistent with intensified primary emissions and secondary formation under extreme heat. Aromatic hydrocarbons were mainly higher during winter, linked to combustion processes, but benzene levels were highest during summer particularly when temperature rose above 35 °C from evaporative and potential stress-related biogenic sources. HYSPLIT air-mass trajectory analysis revealed dominant contributions from Europe and Northwest Asia (∼ 68 %), transporting aged OVOCs, while Middle East winter inflows enhanced aromatic hydrocarbons. While WRF-Chem captured seasonal trends, most VOCs were underestimated, highlighting under-representation of emission sources and oxidation pathways in the model. Overall, the study emphasizes temperature and regional transport as key drivers of VOC variability in the Eastern Mediterranean."

We combine active and passive satellite aerosol products to dynamically estimate dust lidar ratios over a 12-year period. The results reveal pronounced and physically meaningful regional variability, improving aerosol characterization and supporting climate and air-quality applications. 
 North Africa and the Middle East encompass the most active dust sources on the planet. Due to the limited availability of ground-based aerosol observations across the deserts, spaceborne retrievals represent the most reliable source of information for monitoring dust particles over these vast areas. In the current study, we present a synergistic approach incorporating aerosol retrievals acquired by active (CALIOP) and passive (POLDER-3, MODIS) instruments mounted on satellites of the A-Train constellation. Our main objective is to dynamically (in terms of space and time) estimate the dust lidar ratio (LR) at 532 nm throughout a 12-year period (2006–2017) by collocating columnar aerosol optical depth observations (POLDER-3/GRASP, MIDAS) and vertically resolved dust aerosol profiles obtained by CALIPSO. According to our findings, the derived dust LRs reveal a clear spatial variability. The highest LRs are found over major Saharan source regions such as the Bodélé Depression and the Libyan Desert, while moderate to low values dominate the Arabian Peninsula. Enhanced values also appear across Central Asia, particularly over the Karakum and Kyzylkum deserts. The corresponding uncertainty fields demonstrate that LR estimates are most robust over regions with a larger number of dust cases, whereas higher uncertainties occur along transition zones – such as the Sahel and parts of Central Asia – where dust mixing or aerosol-type misclassification increases retrieval variability. A key objective of this work is to establish a robust methodology for deriving aerosol-speciated LRs using synergies between active and passive observations. Although focused here on dust over North Africa and the Middle East, the same framework can be readily applied to other CALIPSO aerosol subtypes – such as marine, polluted dust, or smoke – when implemented over regions where these aerosol types predominate. The advent of the EarthCARE satellite mission, along with the incorporation of new aerosol models into the forthcoming CALIPSO Version 5 aerosol retrieval algorithm, will serve as a reference for our calculations. In this context, our findings also highlight that a synergy of multisensor aerosol products with modelling tools can enhance the spatiotemporal representation of aerosol properties, such as the LR, further improving retrieval utility."

The climatology win based on approximately three million in situ observations collected over the past 75 years and interpolated into continuous temperature fields with a horizontal resolution of about 900 m and 32 vertical levels, providing monthly and daily fields from the surface to 400 m depth. 
 Ocean climatologies are essential for understanding the mean state and variability of marine systems, providing reference conditions for detecting anomalies, assessing ecosystem functioning and identifying long-term trends. In this study, we present the first high-resolution, four-dimensional temperature climatology for Northern Chilean Patagonia, a region characterised by the presence of a complex network of fjords and channels. The climatology was generated from approximately three million in situ observations collected over the past 75 years from multiple datasets. Using the Data Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVAnd) tool, temperature fields were reconstructed with a horizontal resolution of about 900 m and over 32 vertical levels, producing monthly fields from the surface to 400 m depth. The resulting climatology accurately reproduces the main spatial and seasonal temperature patterns reported in previous studies. Surface temperatures show strong summer gradients between the open Pacific and Northern Patagonia, while enclosed regions such as Reloncaví Sound, Comau and Puyuhuapi Fjords exhibit pronounced seasonal amplitude compared with the more stable Corcovado Gulf. Below surface, temperature gradients become smoother and the thermocline deepens in summer, typically ranging between 10 and 50 m. At 100 m depth, temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, but spatial variations are still observed, with Ancud Gulf and Reloncaví Sound being slightly warmer. This climatology provides a refined and physically consistent representation of the oceanographic structure of Northern Patagonia, offering an essential baseline for future modelling, monitoring and climate-change assessments in a region where satellite observations are limited by persistent cloud cover and complex topography.

Manz,Quantifying PFAS-Omics Burden Scores for Nontargeted Analysis Using Multidimensional Item Response Theory: An Exploratory Analysis of Novel and Legacy PFAS in Cord Blood,"Fetal development is a vulnerable period for exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). However, certified analytical standards do not exist for many PFAS, limiting our ability to quantify overall exposure burden to PFAS as a chemical class. PFAS-focused nontargeted analysis (NTA) enables detection of PFAS for which chemical standards may not exist. The overall objectives of this study were to provide a more comprehensive picture of PFAS exposure in cord blood, develop cumulative exposure burden scores for the PFAS detected, and evaluate differences in the infant’s PFAS burden score with respect to mother’s parity. We measured PFAS using targeted and NTA methods in cord blood samples collected between 2003 and 2006 in the HOME Study (Cincinnati, Ohio). Using NTA, we putatively identified 42 PFAS in cord blood, 4 of which were also detected in targeted analysis. We summarized an infant’s overall prenatal exposure burden to PFAS using item response theory methods. We constructed two scores, one based on PFAS concentrations from targeted analysis (“PFAS exposure burden scores”), and one based on relative abundance from NTA (“PFAS-omics scores”). As expected, infants with multiparous mothers had significantly lower PFAS exposure burden scores than those with nulliparous mothers, but these disparities were not present when comparing their PFAS-omics scores. Our results show that infants are exposed to a wide range of PFAS, including perfluorinated chemicals, polyfluorinated chemicals, and fluorotelomers, before birth. Further, PFAS-focused NTA can help estimate total exposure to PFAS. Lastly, reported disparities in PFAS exposure burden across parity may depend on the panel of assessed PFAS and their half-lives."

Diamond;Zhanyun Wang,Breaking Lock-ins to Enable a Green Pharmacy,"Environmentally hazardous pharmaceuticals continue to be produced, used, and released to the environment, despite growing recognition of the need for greener drug design. This study applies a “lock-in” analytical framework to examine how various interacting social, economic, political, and technological factors prevent the effective implementation of concepts such as “benign by design” in drug development. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including analysis of US and European clinical trial records, we identify two critical lock-ins: (1) misaligned timing of resources and expertise among key actors that prevents early integration of environmental safety and sustainability considerations in drug design, and (2) incentive structures that promote new drug development over the redesign of existing pharmaceuticals. Notably, this analysis identifies barriers to greening both future and existing drugs on the market. Building on Meadows’ framework for effective interventions in complex systems, we propose a strategic approach for breaking lock-ins and present specific recommendations for key stakeholder groups including policymakers, academia, small biotech, big pharma, and financial institutions. Addressing these lock-ins is essential to unlocking the full potential of green innovation in pharmaceutical development, while providing for patient access to essential medicines."

AMI undergoes rapid direct photodegradation (t1/2 = 14.5 min at pH 8.0), whereas SUL degrades 28 times more slowly (t1/2 = 407.7 min). Theoretical calculations revealed that the disparity originates from their primary photoexcitation mechanisms. AMI retains planarity and exhibits a strong π→π* transition, while torsional distortion in SUL results in a weak, partially forbidden n→π* transition, making SUL far more dependent on the photodegradation involving •OH, CO3•–, and self-sensitized 3SUL*. Experiments with NO3–, HCO3–, and Br– demonstrated pronounced acceleration of SUL photodegradation in natural and simulated waters, confirming the key role of indirect pathways for SUL and their minimal contribution to AMI. Six AMI and four SUL transformation products (TPs) were identified exclusively from direct photodegradation, arising from sulfone cleavage, ring oxidation, and N-dealkylation. Toxicity predictions showed that SUL photodegradation leads to detoxification, whereas AMI produces multiple transformation products with higher predicted toxicity. These findings demonstrate that −NH2 positional isomerism governs photoexcitation, indirect photoreactivity, and environmental risk."

Herein, we report a series of imidazolium-based mesoporous PILs for the removal of PFASs through multiple interaction mechanisms. Among them, PDB-F, synthesized via free-radical copolymerization of divinylbenzene (DVB) and 3-(4,4,4-trifluorobutyl)-1-vinyl-1H-3-imidazolium bromide (F-VBIm) at a 1:1 mol ratio, exhibited an exceptional adsorption capacity (2471.7 mg/g at 25 °C) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranking it among the most effective polymer-based adsorbents to date. Comprehensive structural characterization and performance studies revealed that the outstanding PFASs adsorption by PDB-F arises from the synergistic effects of electrostatic, hydrophobic, pore filling, and fluorophilic (F–F) interactions. Moreover, PDB-F demonstrated high efficacy in removing trace-level PFOA across different water matrices along with versatility for several common PFASs. Besides, PDB-F displayed good regeneration and remarkable reusability. This work offers valuable insights into the role of synergistic interactions in PFASs adsorption and lays the foundation for the rational design of high-performance adsorbents in the future."

However, its geochemical behavior in the presence of mackinawite (FeS), a ubiquitous mineral in reducing environments, remains poorly constrained. Here, we compared Re(VII) sequestration via coprecipitation and adsorption with FeS and elucidated the distinct reduction mechanisms involved. In the coprecipitation system, Re(VII) was reduced by S(-II) to form both ReS2 and ReO2, while in the adsorption system, Fe(II) served as the primary reductant, yielding ReO2 as the dominant product. These results demonstrate that Re redox transformation is highly dependent on the FeS formation pathway and the nature of available reductants. The H2S concentration threshold (∼10–11 M) above which ReS2 becomes the dominant phase was further defined, offering a predictive basis for Re sequestration under sulfidic conditions. This work enhances our understanding of Re fate in anoxic environments, informs its application as a paleoredox proxy, and contributes to Re recovery strategies in environmental and resource systems."

Peano curves, based on fractal geometry, are utilized to create unique patterns for positioning the anode and cathode, maximizing the electric field intensity and reactive species on the membrane surface. Applying a platinum-coated BPCPM prototype with an optimized fractal configuration, we have achieved a highly efficient cogeneration of HClO and H2O2 in dual-pulse flow-through electrofiltration operation with minimal energy consumption (0.17 kWh per m3 permeate). The BPCPM delivers 100% surface retention of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, facilitating a greater than 5-log reduction in bacterial viability and representing effective antibacterial activity. A scaled-up BPCPM reactor was evaluated for practical aquaculture wastewater reuse in crop irrigation. Over a 14 day period of operation, the modularized reactor exhibited a robust water flux and long-term biofouling resistance, demonstrating excellent BPCPM durability and scalability. The efficient removal of hazardous antibiotics and pathogens generated a nontoxic permeate, while also effectively supporting plant growth by enhancing nitrogen availability.

To accomplish this, Ru was adopted to decorate a Tb2Ce2O7+x solid solution in its lattice (Ru-TC) or on its surface (Ru/TC-DP). The addition of Ru promotes the formation of catalytically critical Ru–O–Ce/Tb interfacial bonds and abundant oxygen vacancies, both of which are more numerous in Ru/TC-DP. DFT calculations confirm that Ru lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy and the O2 adsorption energy, especially on Ru/TC-DP, enhancing the generation of reactive oxygen anions (O2–, O22–). Isotopic 18O2-TPSR-MS shows that Ru/TC-DP has a better capability to activate O2 than Ru-TC. Furthermore, Ru/TC-DP owns more surface Ru0 sites conducive to activating gaseous O2. Quasi in situ XPS revealed that Ru decoration promotes the dual Tb4+/Tb3+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycles, particularly with Ru/TC-DP. The excellent performance arises from synergy among three components: metallic Ru0 sites adsorb and weaken O2, Ru–O–Ce/Tb interfacial bonds act as electron transfer channels that drive −–O cleavage and stabilize oxygen vacancies, and the abundant vacancies serve as acceptors for activated oxygen species. This cooperative mechanism establishes an efficient cycle for continuous oxygen activation and lattice oxygen replenishment. Consequently, Ru/TC-DP exhibits remarkable soot combustion activity (T50 = 333 °C, TOF = 2.90 × 10–3 s–1). This work demonstrates that loading Ru onto the surface of Tb2Ce2O7+x provides a cost-effective strategy for designing high-performance soot combustion catalysts through multisite synergy."

This I– activation is markedly enhanced during the freezing of iodide-containing droplets, leading to substantial I2 production in both the gas and the aqueous phases. The production follows a Langmuir–Hinshelwood formalism, indicating a surface-mediated process at the frozen air–water interface. A detailed mechanistic investigation reveals that the production of I2 is driven by the hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formed at the frozen interface, which subsequently oxidize I–. We attribute the formation of OH· and H2O2 to the high electric field possibly induced by the Workman–Reynolds freezing potential. This work identifies a previously unrecognized nighttime formation mechanism of I2 in atmospheric snow and ice, which has implications for atmospheric multiphase chemistry in cold environments."

Whereas this can lower emissions of toxic organic chemical and therefore human and wildlife exposures in countries with consumer economies, manufacturing countries and those involved in the handling of waste are “virtually importing” emissions and exposures. Here, we illustrate the feasibility of characterizing toxic chemical emissions, exposures, and health risks embodied in international trade using the example of the fungicide chlorothalonil applied in the cultivation of bananas in Costa Rica, which are exported to Europe and North America. The international virtual flow of chlorothalonil embodied in the banana trade is in the 100s of tonnes per year and exceeds by many orders of magnitude the flows via long-range atmospheric transport and as residue in the traded commodity. Quantifying the flows of toxic chemicals embodied in international trade in chemicals, products, food, feed, and waste, and the resulting exposure and health effects, is key to revealing the responsibility of consumers for the risk associated with toxic chemical use."

However, knowledge of the emission of imidazoles (IMs) in nitrogen-containing BrC and their transformation remains limited. This study investigated the emissions of IMs from 11 solid fuel combustions and subsequent photochemical evolution. The reaction pathways and light absorption of IMs were estimated through quantum chemical calculations. The potential toxicity of IMs for aging products was predicted with machine learning. The results showed that emission factors (EFs) of IMs were higher from biomass burning (BB) than from coal combustion (CC). Maize stalks exhibited the highest ∑IMs EFs, while anthracite coal showed the lowest ones. Alkyl IMs (Alk-IMs) and benzene-ring IMs (Bn-IMs) dominated the ∑IMs in BB (85%) and CC (52%). During aging, Alk-IMs underwent •OH substitution reactions, forming poorly oxygenated hydroxyimidazole derivatives (O/N = 0.5). Conversely, based on density functional theory calculations, •OH oxidation of Bn-IMs and carboxyl IMs occurred more easily, forming highly oxygenated imidazole derivatives (O/N = 1–2) with carboxyl groups. The light absorption of these highly oxygenated derivatives decreased by 17–28%, while their health risk probability increased by 1.12–2.27 times compared to those of their precursors. These findings improved our understanding of the residence time and interaction with other pollutants of IMs."

The conditions for this phenomenon remain poorly understood: while rupture complexity is often attributed to fault heterogeneity, back‐propagating fronts have also been reported on simple faults. Here, we employ earthquake simulations with slip‐rate and state‐dependent friction to reveal that back‐propagating fronts arise spontaneously during unilateral rupture propagation on frictionally homogeneous faults, when the rupture exceeds a critical length about 100 times larger than the nucleation dimension. We propose simple theoretical arguments suggesting that back‐propagating fronts are an intrinsic feature of unilateral ruptures under velocity‐weakening friction. These conditions preclude self‐similar crack‐like solutions with constant stress drop; instead, ruptures alternate between pulse and crack‐like modes, with back propagation generated at pulse‐to‐crack transitions. The crack‐to‐pulse transition is driven by restrengthening and happens when the local slip rate decreases below a specified threshold. An analytical criterion for the extent of back propagation shows that they are enhanced by low rupture velocities and stress drops, and observational examples of back propagation on simple faults are consistent with these requirements. Our study presents a simple, fundamental model for back‐propagating earthquakes, suggesting that they may be more prevalent than previously recognized."

A dawn–dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial‐range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic‐range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection‐related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail‐aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near −1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range.

We observed an abrupt change in the lightning propagation path to ground, which resulted in an aborted attachment process and a different ground connection point, 200 m away from the expected one. This change was likely due to the self‐choking effect of large negative space charge that was suddenly introduced by the intense streamer burst ahead of the lower end of the descending negatively‐charged channel. Further, the unique UV images show that positive and negative streamer zones are an order of magnitude longer than previously thought."

Using observational data sets and CMIP6 simulations, here we quantify how long‐term warming and the AC contribute to changes in seasonal onset across Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes during 1950–2014. While long‐term warming drives a widespread advance of summer onset, regional, and latitudinal contrasts arise primarily from AC variations. In North America and northern Asia, these cycle changes offset the warming‐induced advance and contribute at magnitudes comparable to long‐term warming, highlighting their critical role in shaping regional climate responses. Based on single‐forcing experiments and a simplified surface energy balance model, we further show that greenhouse gases enhance damping and reduce effective heat capacity, advancing the AC phase, whereas aerosol forcing increases effective heat capacity and weakens damping, thereby delaying summer onset."

We show that the PDV in the last millennium is dominated by two modes of preferred time scales: multi‐decadal mode (50–70‐yr) and bi‐decadal mode (20–40‐yr). The former is prevalent during quiescent volcanic period; however, the latter is more common during periods with intensive volcanic activities.

Utilizing four global climate models (GCMs), CAM5, CAM6, ECHAM6, and NICAM‐SPRINTARS, alongside a common regional emission inventory (SMoG‐India‐v1) and global Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) for emissions outside India, we assess the perturbations in shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and net radiative fluxes resulting from aerosol emissions. Our analysis reveals a multi‐model mean aerosol net ERF of −1.66 W/m2 at the top of atmosphere (TOA), indicating significant cooling driven by a substantial negative SW ERF (−4.59 W/m2) dominated by aerosol‐cloud interactions (ERFACI), partially offset by net positive LW ERF (+2.93 W/m2). At the surface, the net ERF indicates pronounced cooling of approximately −10.95 W/m2, driven by both SW aerosol‐radiation interaction (ERFARI; −8.31 W/m2) and SW ERFACI (−5.40 W/m2), with a positive LW ERF (+2.65 W/m2). Atmospheric absorption, the difference between ERF at TOA and the surface, shows a net absorption of +9.29 W/m2, dominated by SW absorption from direct aerosol‐radiation interactions (SW Atm.Abs.ARI), contributing +8.99 W/m2, with LW absorption from aerosol‐cloud interactions (LW Atm.Abs.ACI) adding +1.83 W/m2. These findings highlight the dominant role of aerosol‐cloud interactions in cooling at both TOA and the surface and the significant contribution of direct aerosol interactions to atmospheric absorption over the Indian region. This underscores the need to consider both aerosol effects in climate models to improve regional climate predictions and support effective mitigation and adaptation strategies."

To clarify its mechanisms, we measured gaseous and particulate concentrations of PAHs in the East China Marginal Sea (ECMS) to develop an improved model integrating thermodynamic interactions between PAHs and distinct aerosol carbonaceous fractions. Aerosol samples were thermally divided into 6 carbonaceous fractions: OM1 to OM4 (organic matter), EC1 and EC2 (elemental carbon). A systematic surrogate method was employed to simulate the absorption/adsorption process of PAHs in each fraction, and a computational enumeration framework coupled with the Abraham solvation parameter model was implemented for model parameterization. Compared to conventional models, this model improved the prediction accuracy for logarithmic gas‐particle partitioning coefficient (log KP) by 34%. It also clarified that OM3 exhibits the strongest absorption capacity, likely driven by polar‐induced interactions between this fraction and PAHs, whereas PAH adsorption onto the EC1 and EC2 proceeded homogeneously. Additionally, the model identified adsorption onto elemental carbon as the dominant partitioning mechanism for 3‐ and 4‐ring PAHs, while for 5‐ring PAHs, the contribution of absorption into OM3 becomes comparable to that of adsorption. The prediction deviations of log KP for 3‐ring PAHs by this model suggested that adsorption onto inorganic aerosol constituents may also influence their gas‐particle partitioning. This study elucidated the interactions between PAHs and different carbonaceous fractions in aerosols and advanced mechanistic understanding of the gas‐particle partitioning."

The Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau, dominated by alpine grasslands, is subjected to extensive grazing by livestock. Apart from some control experiments, the regional impact of livestock species on alpine grassland has been overlooked, mostly due to the spatial mismatch between statistical livestock data and grassland biomass data. Using cross‐scale feature extraction and random forest models, we developed a 1 km × 1 km gridded long‐term grazing intensity data set distinguishing between herbivore types between cattle and sheep from 2000 to 2019. We used the propensity score matching method to identify the impact of grazing intensity and herbivore types on aboveground biomass on the Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau. The data set demonstrated strong spatio‐temporal consistency with county‐level statistics, with R2 values above 0.9 and Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) ranging from 0.93 to 0.98. The interannual trends of sheep (mainly Tibetan sheep) and cattle (mainly yaks) were largely opposite, with a significant decline in the sheep‐to‐cattle ratio in 42% of areas. At high grazing intensity, the aboveground biomass increase rate was slower, and aboveground biomass decreased more rapidly with an increasing sheep‐to‐cattle ratio. These findings advance our understanding of the spatio‐temporal dynamics of grazing intensity on the Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau and provide new insights into how grazing intensity and herbivore composition jointly shape alpine grassland productivity at the landscape scale."

 Cross-coupling of aryl boronic esters forms a cornerstone of how chemists make molecules. More recently, enantiomerically enriched boronic esters have shown great promise in modular synthesis as versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of diverse molecules. A significant challenge in this area is to employ boronic esters for the catalytic construction of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds, especially those where the reaction site is a stereogenic carbon center. Addressing this challenge would not only expand the utility of boronic esters in the modular synthesis of organic frameworks, but also prove more broadly beneficial in the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules.1 In this connection, we have developed a stereospecific C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling reaction catalyzed by a copper acetylide complex. This reaction operates with four-coordinate boron “ate” complexes while remaining inert to simple functional groups including boronic esters, and thereby enables efficient strategies for modular synthesis of complex molecules.

 Dielectric polymers used in electrical energy storage require a combination of key metrics, including a high dielectric constant (K), low loss and high breakdown strength (Eb), all while being capable of operating at high temperatures1–6. Decades of research into polymer–inorganic composites have achieved only limited success in reaching these goals5,7,8. Here we introduce high-temperature immiscible blends of two dipolar polymers that, through nanophase separation, self-assemble into three-dimensional all-polymer nanocomposites. The resulting nanostructures induce coiled-chain morphology and large conformation changes, which, combined with relatively low rotational barrier and high dipole moments of both polymers, yield ultrahigh dielectric responses (K > 13) while maintaining a low loss (tanδ approximately 0.002) across a wide temperature range. Simultaneously, the nanostructured interfaces act as barriers for mobile charges, markedly reducing conduction losses at high fields and temperatures. The all-polymer three-dimensional nanocomposites with concurrently high K, high Eb and low loss deliver unprecedented discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures (18.7 J cm−3, 15.1 J cm−3 and 8.6 J cm−3 at 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively). The approach is applicable to other immiscible dipolar blends, demonstrating its universality and tunability. This work addresses the urgent needs in electrical energy storage and provides a new paradigm towards high-energy-density polymer dielectrics over a broad temperature range.

 Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) pollution is a cause of eutrophication globally1. However, recent datasets indicate that some ecosystems may be experiencing widespread oligotrophication—declining N availability—which is suggested to be a response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)2. Plant N isotope (δ15N) chronologies have served as primary evidence for oligotrophication, but there is wide disagreement whether rising CO2 or temporal changes in N deposition explain these patterns3–6. Here we construct δ15N tree-ring chronologies using archived samples from Sweden’s 23.5-million-hectare forest area from 1961 to 2018. The study area spans a 1,500-km latitudinal distance where N deposition varies fourfold, but where rising CO2 is spatially uniform. Our data show declining δ15N chronologies throughout Sweden, including forests in the far north where atmospheric N deposition rates are very low. Linear mixed-effects models showed that rising CO2 is the strongest predictor of δ15N values, whereas N deposition variables, temperature and forest basal area had lower explanatory power. Our findings suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 is causing oligotrophication in boreal forests, which has implications for predicting their future role as sinks in the global carbon cycle7–9.

Bishop,The natural architecture of oyster reefs maximizes recruit survival,"Survival of reef-building oysters peaks at specific combinations of fractal dimension and height that reduce predation, showing how optimal three-dimensional habitat geometry can guide more effective ecosystem restoration. 
 The three-dimensional architecture of natural habitats is a key determinant of species biodiversity, harvestable biomass and resilience to disturbance1,2. Indeed, some species, including trees, corals and oysters, alter resource availability and modify biotic and abiotic pressures through their own three-dimensional structures—thereby enhancing their own survival3,4. However, which aspects of the three-dimensional architecture of these ecosystem engineers shape ecosystem dynamics and species survival are rarely examined by empirical studies, leaving much of the broader ecological and conservation impact of ecosystem engineering underexplored4–6. Here we show that oyster reefs have combinations of geometric variables that maximize recruit survival, which is a key factor influencing oyster reef growth and persistence. Using three-dimensional habitat designs that capture the full spectrum of natural oyster reef architectures, as well as a geometric theory7 that links habitat surface area, fractal dimension and height, we show that oyster settlement and survival are greatest at particular combinations of fractal dimension and height that minimize predation. Our study provides a template for understanding optimal three-dimensional habitat configurations for habitat restoration projects that are proliferating globally, without targeting key architectural features of habitat space that maximize restoration success8,9. Survival of reef-building oysters peaks at specific combinations of fractal dimension and height that reduce predation, showing how optimal three-dimensional habitat geometry can guide more effective ecosystem restoration."

Holehouse,Accurate predictions of disordered protein ensembles with STARLING,"The deep learning model STARLING can generate accurate ensembles of intrinsically disordered regions of proteins using only protein sequence as input. 
 Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (collectively IDRs) are found across all kingdoms of life and have critical roles in virtually every eukaryotic cellular process1. IDRs exist in a broad ensemble of structurally distinct conformations. This structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function2–4. Here we combine advances in physics-based force fields with the power of multi-modal generative deep learning to develop STARLING, a framework for rapid generation of accurate IDR ensembles and ensemble-aware representations from sequence. STARLING supports environmental conditioning across ionic strengths and demonstrates proof of concept for the interpolative ability of generative models beyond their training domain. Moreover, we enable ensemble refinement under experimental constraints using a Bayesian maximum-entropy reweighting scheme. Beyond ensemble characterization, STARLING sequence representations can be used in multiple ways. We showcase two examples: first, STARLING lets us perform ensemble-based search for ‘biophysical look-alikes’. Second, we demonstrate how these latent representations can be used to accelerate ensemble-first sequence design from weeks or hours per candidate to seconds, enabling library-scale designs. Together, STARLING dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties, complementing bioinformatic protein sequence analysis. We evaluate the accuracy of STARLING against extant experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function and aid the interpretation of experimental data. The deep learning model STARLING can generate accurate ensembles of intrinsically disordered regions of proteins using only protein sequence as input."

 Organic batteries using abundant and recyclable organic electrode materials provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to commercial lithium-ion batteries1–5, which rely on resource-limited mineral-derived inorganic electrode materials6–8. However, the practical use of organic batteries has been severely hindered by the intrinsic insulation and dissolution of organic electrode materials9,10. Here we report practical organic batteries using an n-type conducting polymer cathode, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), which exhibits excellent mixed ionic and electronic transport and low solubility. The PBFDO cathode maintains its n-doped state throughout the electrochemical processes and exhibits stable and reversible redox characteristics, high electrical conductivities and significant lithium-ion diffusion coefficients, without the need for additional conductive additives. Consequently, ultrahigh-mass-loading polymer cathodes, with mass loadings up to 206 mg cm−2, are realized, delivering a high areal capacity of 42 mAh cm−2 and demonstrating robust cycling stability. Furthermore, practical 2.5 Ah lithium–organic pouch cells were fabricated, achieving an impressive energy density of 255 Wh kg−1. Notably, the conducting polymer cathode operates efficiently over a wide temperature range from −70 °C to 80 °C and demonstrates excellent flexibility and safety, marking considerable potential for applications in extreme conditions and wearable electronics.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is frequently associated with metastatic relapse, even at an early stage1. Here we assessed an individualized neoantigen mRNA vaccine in 14 patients with TNBC following surgery and after neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. In peripheral blood of nearly all patients, high-magnitude, vaccine-induced, mostly de novo T cell responses to multiple neoantigens were detected that remained functional for several years. Characterization of individual patients revealed that a large proportion of these T cells developed into two subsets: a late-differentiated phenotype with markers indicative of ‘ready-to-act’ cytotoxic effector T cells, and T cells with a stem cell-like memory phenotype. Eleven patients remained relapse-free for up to six years post-vaccination. Recurrence occurred in three patients: the individual with the weakest vaccine-induced T cell response relapsed, but achieved complete remission on subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy; another patient had a tumour with low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression with MHC class I-deficient cells growing out under vaccination; and the third patient was BRCA-positive and had a recurrence from a genetically distinct primary tumour. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of individualized RNA vaccines in TNBC, document persistence of vaccine-induced, functional neoantigen-specific T cells and provide insights into possible immune escape mechanisms that will guide future approaches. In a phase 1 trial, personalized mRNA vaccines tailored to individual tumour mutations in triple-negative breast cancer induced robust, long-lasting T cell responses and improved prognosis."

 The severity of malaria varies substantially between individuals, but the mechanisms that underlie these differences remain unclear. Because erythrocytes have a key role in malaria biology, genetic variants associated with the development of these cells could inform the mechanisms that determine disease severity. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis of the association of the variant rs112233623-T with erythrocyte properties, and examine its role in modulating malaria severity. This variant is associated with increased levels of haemoglobin A2, increased erythrocyte size and reduced erythrocyte number1,2. It is found in an erythroid enhancer of CCND3, which encodes cyclin D3—a cell-division activator that enhances the pentose phosphate pathway and thereby helps to counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS)3. We show that rs112233623-T disrupts a binding site for the transcription factor SMAD3, weakens enhancer activity and, in erythrocyte precursors (erythroblasts), is associated with reduced CCND3 expression and inhibition of the G1–S cell-cycle transition, concomitant with a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and an increase in their size. Using population genetic methods, we observe signatures of positive selection for rs112233623-T in the genetic history of Sardinia, a region in which malaria was once prevalent. Furthermore, we show that parasite growth is impaired in cultured Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes from rs112233623-T carriers, and that this impairment correlates with ROS levels. This mirrors our observations in erythrocytes from individuals who are deficient in the pentose-phosphate-pathway enzyme G6PD—a trait associated with protection against malaria in some settings—and highlights a common ROS-based mechanism of malaria resistance. Our results suggest that a reduction in CCND3 in erythroblasts constitutes a mechanism of resistance to malaria, and could enable therapeutic interventions. Population-level analyses and in vitro experiments show that a specific genetic variant of cyclin D3 inhibits the growth of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes, and suggest that its high frequency in Sardinia was driven by past endemic malaria."

 The brain displays the richest repertoire of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating mRNA translation1–11. Among these, alternative splicing has been shown to drive cell-type specificity and, when disrupted, is strongly linked to neurological disorders12–17. However, genome-wide measurements of mRNA translation with isoform sensitivity at single-cell resolution have not been achieved. To address this, we deployed Surveying Ribosomal Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling (Ribo-STAMP) coupled with short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing in the brain18. We generated the first isoform-sensitive single-cell translatomes of the mouse hippocampus at postnatal day 25, discovering cell-type-specific translation of 3,857 alternative transcripts across 1,641 genes and identifying isoforms of the same genes undergoing differential translation within and across 8 different cell types. We defined high and low translational states in CA1 and CA3 neurons, with synaptic and metabolic genes enriched in high states. We found that CA3 exhibited higher basal translation compared with CA1, as confirmed by metabolic labelling of newly synthesized proteins and immunohistochemistry of translational machinery components. This accessible platform will expand our understanding of how cell-type-specific and isoform-specific translation drives brain physiology and disease.

 Cytoplasmic dynein-1, a microtubule (MT)-based motor protein, requires dynactin and a coiled-coil adaptor to form the processive dynein–dynactin–adaptor (DDA) complex1,2. The roles of MTs and dynein regulator lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) in DDA assembly have remained elusive. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structural basis of MT- and LIS1-mediated DDA assembly. We show that an adaptor-independent dynein–dynactin complex spontaneously forms on MTs with an intrinsic 2:1 stoichiometry in a highly efficient manner, driven by parallel alignment of dynein tails upon MT binding. Adaptors can wedge into and exchange within the assembled MT-bound dynein–dynactin complex; these processes are enabled by relative rotations between dynein and dynactin and facilitated by the dynein light-intermediate chains that assist the adaptor ‘search’ mechanism. Although LIS1 is dispensable for efficient DD(A)–MT assembly, its presence expands the conformational landscape of DD(A) assemblies on MTs. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that LIS1 bridges dynactin p150glued and dynein in both the closed Phi-like and open prepowerstroke states, stabilizing low-MT-affinity intermediates that tether dynein molecules in proximity to MTs and prime them for subsequent DD(A) assembly through alternative pathways. These findings demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the dynein transport machinery and the coordinated roles of MTs and LIS1 in DDA assembly. Cryo-electron microscopy suggests a model in which microtubules, rather than adaptors in the cytoplasm, act as the primary platform for dynein–dynactin assembly, while LIS1 stabilizes low-microtubule-affinity intermediates near the pre-assembled complexes."

 Neurodevelopmental disorders that arise from de novo mutations in chromatin-remodelling genes lack targeted treatments. Snijders Blok–Campeau syndrome (SNIBCPS)1, which is caused by pathogenic variants in CHD3, manifests with intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviours and motor deficits2. Whether somatic gene correction can reverse such phenotypes in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that modelling the recurrent CHD3 variant p.R1025W in a humanized mouse model (Chd3hR1025W/+) recapitulates key features of SNIBCPS, including reduced CHD3 protein levels and abnormalities in social communication, cognition and motor coordination. We engineered a TadA-embedded adenine base editor (TeABE) and delivered it brain-wide using a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) system and achieved efficient on-target A•T-to-G•C correction across multiple cortical and hippocampal regions with minimal bystander activity. This intervention restored CHD3 levels and ameliorated behavioural abnormalities in vivo. Furthermore, intrathecal dual AAV delivery in nonhuman primates resulted in widespread neuronal transduction and efficient TeABE reconstitution, a result that supports its translational feasibility. These findings establish in vivo base editing as a viable therapeutic approach for CHD3-related neurodevelopmental disease. More broadly, they demonstrate that precise single-base correction in the postnatal brain can restore protein dosage and function, thereby offering a framework for the treatment of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders.

 The prevalence of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is rising globally, yet effective treatments remain limited1. Here we found that systemic or hepatocyte-specific ablation of the gene encoding glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (Gpnmb)—a top upregulated gene in MASH—protected mice from diet-induced MASH. Notably, MASH progression was driven specifically by the secreted GPNMB ectodomain (G-ECD), rather than full-length GPNMB. Serum G-ECD levels showed a strong positive correlation with MASH severity in human patients. Using an unbiased screen of a cell-surface-displayed transmembrane protein library, we identified related to receptor tyrosine kinase (RYK) as a functional receptor for G-ECD. Hepatocyte-specific Ryk ablation protected mice against MASH and abolished the pathogenic effects of G-ECD. Mechanistically, G-ECD binding to RYK activated ERK1/2 signaling, resulting in transcriptional activation of PPARγ-CD36 and SREBP1C pathways that promote hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis. Multiple therapeutic strategies targeting the GPNMB–RYK axis—including vaccination, short hairpin RNA, neutralizing antibody and N-acetylgalactosamine small interfering RNA—effectively prevented and treated MASH in preclinical models. Our findings identify the GPNMB–RYK axis as a new pathogenic ligand–receptor pathway and a promising therapeutic target for MASH.

 The central nervous system is surrounded by three interconnected membranes referred to as the meninges, which host a diverse immune network1–3. Within the skull-interfacing dura mater are venous sinuses, large veins that are traditionally viewed as passive blood drains for the brain and skull4,5. However, these structures also constitute an important neuroimmune interface6–8. Here we used intravital microscopy to gain mechanistic insight into this interface and reveal that dural sinuses and their endothelial cells form a highly dynamic surface that continually restructures to regulate blood flow, fluid movement and immune surveillance. We show that sinuses are not passive conduits, but instead undergo RAMP1-dependent constriction and dilation mediated by smooth muscle, resembling arterial behaviour. Moreover, the superior sagittal sinus in mice is bifurcated into upper and lower chambers that contribute to intracranial pressure regulation. Both chambers are lined by specialized, highly fenestrated sinus endothelial cells (SECs) that permit movement of fluids, macromolecules and microorganisms between the sinus lumen and leukocyte-rich perisinus space. To safeguard this permeable interface, SECs dynamically open and close intercellular boundaries in a RAMP2-dependent manner. Transcranial RAMP2 antagonism impaired SEC boundary dynamics and reduced immune cell trafficking along the sinus wall during homeostasis and systemic viral infection. Disruption of SEC dynamics during infection compromised local antiviral immunity and promoted pathogen entry into the meninges. Together, these findings establish dural sinuses as dynamic venous structures that regulate fluid exchange and support immune surveillance and antiviral defence. Microscopic imaging and biochemical studies show that sinuses in mouse and human form a highly dynamic surface that regulates fluid movement and immune cell surveillance via RAMP1-dependent regulation of smooth muscle contraction and RAMP2-dependent regulation of the sinus endothelial barrier."

 Long-term preservation of digital information is vital for safeguarding the knowledge of humanity for future generations. Existing archival storage solutions, such as magnetic tapes and hard disk drives, suffer from limited media lifespans that render them unsuitable for long-term data retention1–3. Optical storage approaches, particularly laser writing in robust media such as glass, have emerged as promising alternatives with the potential for increased longevity. Previous work4–16 has predominantly optimized individual aspects such as data density but has not demonstrated an end-to-end system, including writing, storing and retrieving information. Here we report an optical archival storage technology based on femtosecond laser direct writing in glass that addresses the practical demands of archival storage, which we call Silica. We achieve a data density of 1.59 Gbit mm−3 in 301 layers for a capacity of 4.8 TB in a 120 mm square, 2 mm thick piece of glass. The demonstrated write regimes enable a write throughput of 25.6 Mbit s−1 per beam, limited by the laser repetition rate, with an energy efficiency of 10.1 nJ per bit. Moreover, we extend the storage ability to borosilicate glass, offering a lower-cost medium and reduced writing and reading complexity. Accelerated ageing tests on written voxels in borosilicate suggest data lifetimes exceeding 10,000 years.

 Telecommunication systems are evolving towards ultrawide bandwidth and low latency, supporting wired and wireless links and their non-blocking interconnection1. However, a long-standing bandwidth mismatch between fibre communication and its wireless counterpart arises from fundamental disparities in signal architectures and hardware constraints2,3, which prevent high-speed and compatible transmission across the two domains. This challenge further complicates unified system design and hinders the realization of high-throughput-density, congestion-free fibre–wireless links under wideband-access scenarios4. Here we present an ultra-wideband (UWB) integrated photonics scheme that facilitates fibre–wireless communication over a shared-bandwidth infrastructure. Built on electro–optic (EO) and optic–electro (OE) conversions featuring 3-dB operational bandwidths exceeding 250 GHz and cross-architecture adaptability, our system demonstrates unprecedented data transmission capabilities in both wired and wireless links. Using the same set of devices and powered by the proposed complex bidirectional gated recurrent unit (complex-biGRU) algorithm, ultrahigh single-lane data rates of 512 Gbps for short-reach fibre and, for the first time to the authors’ knowledge, 400-Gbps high-speed wireless transmission have been achieved. Furthermore, high-density access is enabled by an all-optically assisted ultra-broadband wireless scheme. Real-time multichannel 8K video transmission is successfully demonstrated across 86 channels, seamlessly using a spectral range from 138 to 223 GHz.

These trends require moving beyond evaluating for mere moral performance, the ability to produce morally appropriate outputs, to evaluating for moral competence, the ability to produce morally appropriate outputs based on morally relevant considerations. Assessing moral competence is critical for predicting future model behaviour, establishing appropriate public trust and justifying moral attributions. However, both the unique architectures of LLMs and the complexity of morality itself introduce fundamental challenges. Here we identify three such challenges: the facsimile problem, whereby models may imitate reasoning without genuine understanding; moral multidimensionality, whereby moral decisions are influenced by a range of context-sensitive relevant moral and non-moral considerations; and moral pluralism, which demands a new standard for globally deployed artificial intelligence. We provide a roadmap for tackling these challenges, advocating for a suite of adversarial and confirmatory evaluations that will enable us to work towards a more scientifically grounded understanding and, in turn, a more responsible attribution of moral competence to LLMs. This Perspective offers a roadmap for tackling the challenges of the facsimile problem, moral multidimensionality and moral pluralism in large language models."

 The cellular nucleotide pool is a major focal point of the host immune response to viral infection. Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool enable animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness1–5. Here we identify Clover, a bacterial anti-phage defence system that overcomes this trade-off by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of phage restriction by Clover in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal, p3diT (5′-triphosphothymidyl-3′5′-thymidine), that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defence and immune-mediated toxicity. Biochemical and structural studies show that the bacterial dGTPase CloA is activated by virally produced dTTP and inhibited by 5′-triphosphothymidyl-3′5′-thymidine produced by its regulatory partner CloB, and thereby balances antiviral defence and immune-mediated toxicity."

 Centromeres ensure accurate chromosome segregation, yet their DNA evolves rapidly across eukaryotes leaving the origins of new centromere architectures unclear1–4. The brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exemplifies this long-standing puzzle. Its centromeres shifted ancestrally from large, repeat-rich, epigenetically specified forms to the compact, genetically defined ‘point’ centromeres1,5. How this transition occurred has remained unresolved6. Here we identify evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres that provide a resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres. Proto-point centromeres contain a single centromeric nucleosome positioned over an AT-rich core, accompanied by relaxed organization and sequence variability of flanking cis-elements. In two species, these proto-point centromeres lie within retrotransposon-derived repeat clusters, linking ancestral repeat-rich centromeres to genetically encoded ones. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate that proto-point and point centromeres evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres. These results identify long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons, specifically Ty5 sequences, as the genetic substrate for point-centromere evolution and provide a mechanistic route by which an epigenetic centromere can become genetically specified. More broadly, they show how selfish elements can be co-opted to perform essential chromosomal functions.

 Paternal care is rare among mammals and the neural mechanisms governing its emergence are poorly understood1. We leveraged the natural paternal behaviour of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)2,3, and integrated brain-wide cFos mapping, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, virally mediated gene perturbation and environmental manipulation to dissect the neural basis of natural variation in male parenting. Here we find that socio-environmental conditions drive individual variation in male alloparenting such that postweaning social isolation increases paternal care whereas social living in higher density groups increases infanticide. This natural variation in care corresponds to neural activity in the medial preoptic area and changes in correlated activity across brain regions. Within the medial preoptic area, expression of agouti signalling protein (Agouti) in neurons is increased by group housing and is negatively associated with care, and overexpression of Agouti reduces care and enhances infanticide in previously tolerant mice. Naturalistic manipulations further reveal that Agouti integrates long-term housing conditions rather than food availability or hunger. Our findings reveal that variation in male paternal care reflects context-dependent regulation of conserved hypothalamic and melanocortin signalling mechanisms rather than the presence or absence of paternal capacity. Expression of agouti signalling protein in neurons in the medial preoptic area is increased by group housing and negatively associated with care, and overexpression of Agouti reduces care and enhances infanticide in previously tolerant mice."

 Asgard archaea were pivotal in the origin of complex cellular life1. Heimdallarchaeia (a class within the phylum Asgardarchaeota) are inferred to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. Limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution2,3, including their role in eukaryogenesis. Here we use massive DNA sequencing of marine sediments to obtain 404 Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia and several novel lineages. Analyses of their global distribution revealed they are widespread in marine environments, and many are enriched in variably oxygenated coastal sediments. Detailed metabolic reconstructions and structural predictions suggest that Heimdallarchaeia form metabolic guilds that are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmark proteins of an aerobic lifestyle, including electron transport chain complex (IV), haem biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species detoxification. Heimdallarchaeia also encode novel clades of respiratory membrane-bound hydrogenases with additional Complex I-like subunits, which potentially increase proton-motive force generation and ATP synthesis. Thus, we propose an updated Heimdallarchaeia-centric model of eukaryogenesis in which hydrogen production and aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. This expanded catalogue of Asgard archaeal genomic diversity suggests that bioenergetic factors influenced eukaryogenesis and constitutes a valuable resource for investigations into the origins and evolution of cellular complexity.

 HIV-1 integrase (IN) promotes encapsulation of viral genomic RNA into mature viral cores, and this function is a target for ongoing antiretroviral drug development efforts1–3. Here we determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a primate lentiviral IN in a complex with RNA, revealing a linear filament made of IN octamer repeat units, each comprising a pair of asymmetric homotetramers. The assembly is stabilized through IN–RNA interactions involving mainly the IN C-terminal domains and RNA backbone. The spacing and orientation of the IN filament repeat units closely matched those of consecutive capsid (CA) hexamers within the mature CA lattice. Using cryo-EM images of native purified HIV-1 cores, we refined the structure of the IN filament as it propagates along the luminal side of the CA lattice. Each IN tetramer within the filament nestled in a CA hexamer, engaging closely with the major homology regions. Substitutions of residues involved in IN–CA contacts yielded eccentric virions with RNA nucleoids located outside of the cores. Collectively, our results establish the structural basis for the HIV-1 IN–RNA interaction and reveal that IN forms an RNA-binding module on the luminal side of the mature CA lattice.

 Feed algorithms are widely suspected to influence political attitudes. However, previous evidence from switching off the algorithm on Meta platforms found no political effects1. Here we present results from a 2023 field experiment on Elon Musk’s platform X shedding light on this puzzle. We assigned active US-based users randomly to either an algorithmic or a chronological feed for 7 weeks, measuring political attitudes and online behaviour. Switching from a chronological to an algorithmic feed increased engagement and shifted political opinion towards more conservative positions, particularly regarding policy priorities, perceptions of criminal investigations into Donald Trump and views on the war in Ukraine. In contrast, switching from the algorithmic to the chronological feed had no comparable effects. Neither switching the algorithm on nor switching it off significantly affected affective polarization or self-reported partisanship. To investigate the mechanism, we analysed users’ feed content and behaviour. We found that the algorithm promotes conservative content and demotes posts by traditional media. Exposure to algorithmic content leads users to follow conservative political activist accounts, which they continue to follow even after switching off the algorithm, helping explain the asymmetry in effects. These results suggest that initial exposure to X’s algorithm has persistent effects on users’ current political attitudes and account-following behaviour, even in the absence of a detectable effect on partisanship. Among users initially on a chronological feed, 7 weeks of exposure to X’s algorithmic feed in 2023 shifted political attitudes and account-following behaviour in a more conservative direction compared with those remaining on a chronological feed, whereas switching the feed setting in the opposite direction, from algorithmic to chronological, had no effect."

 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of healthcare- and antibiotic-associated infection and has a 30% recurrence rate1–5. Previous vaccine strategies against CDI failed to reduce pathogen burden, a prerequisite for preventing C. difficile transmission and recurrence6–11. These vaccines were administered parenterally, which induced a systemic immune response, rather than a mucosal response in the colon, the site of infection. Here we compare protection and colonization burden between mucosal (rectal) and parenteral (intraperitoneal) administration routes of a multivalent, adjuvanted vaccine combining inactivated C. difficile toxins and novel surface antigens. We found that mucosal immunization, but not parenteral, clears C. difficile from the host. Unique correlates of decolonization included faecal IgG responses to vegetative surface antigens and a colonic, T helper type 17 (TH17)-skewed tissue-resident memory T cell response against spore antigen. Importantly, mucosal vaccination protected against morbidity, mortality, tissue damage and recurrence. Our results demarcate notable differences in correlates of protection and pathogen clearance between vaccine administration routes and highlight a mucosal immunization regimen that elicits sterilizing immunity against CDI.

 Acral melanoma, which is not ultraviolet-associated, is the type of melanoma reported most commonly in several non-European-descent populations1–3, including in Mexican people4. Latin American samples are substantially under-represented in global cancer genomics studies5, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures6–8. To address this, we characterized the genome and transcriptome of 123 acral melanoma tumours from 92 Mexican patients—a population notable because of its genetic admixture9. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. Although most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations. The tumours with activating BRAF mutations had a transcriptional profile more similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, indicating that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared with other tumours arising in these locations. Transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with recurrence-free and overall survival. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.

 In the past decade, moiré materials have revolutionized how we engineer and control quantum phases of matter1,2. They are versatile platforms for strongly correlated electronic phenomena3,4 and support new ferroelectric5,6, magnetic7 and superconducting states8. Among incommensurate materials9, moiré materials are aperiodic composite crystals10,11 whose long-wavelength superlattices enable tunable properties without chemically modifying their layers. So far, nearly all reports of moiré materials have investigated van der Waals heterostructures assembled far from thermodynamic equilibrium (T < 150 °C)1,2. Here we introduce a conceptually new approach to synthesizing high-mobility moiré materials in thermodynamic equilibrium. We report a new family of foliated superlattice materials (Sr6TaS8)1+δ(TaS2)8 that are exfoliatable, incommensurate-lattice, van der Waals crystals. Lattice mismatches between alternating layers generate moiré superlattices, analogous to 2D moiré heterobilayer superlattices, which are coherent throughout these crystals and tunable through synthesis conditions without altering their chemical composition. Quantum oscillation measurements map the complex Fermiology of these moiré metals12–14, showing that the Fermi surface of the structurally simplest moiré metal comprises more than 40 distinct cross-sectional areas. This is naturally understood by proposing that these bulk moiré metals encode electronic properties of higher-dimensional superspace crystals in ways paralleling well-established crystallographic methods for incommensurate lattices15,16. More broadly, our work demonstrates a scalable synthesis approach potentially capable of producing large-area moiré materials for electronics applications and evidences a new material design concept for accessing phenomena proposed in higher dimensions17–21.

 Colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PeNC) has long been synthesized using the hot-injection method and room-temperature ligand-assisted reprecipitation as the prominent techniques1,2. However, both methods have challenges for industrial-scale production3–5: the hot-injection method requires high temperatures, an inert gas environment and rapid cooling, which raise safety concerns, whereas ligand-assisted reprecipitation can exhibit limited productivity on scale-up. Here we present a cold-injection method based on pseudo-emulsion, enabling scalable synthesis of PeNCs with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, ~100%) and enhanced stability by injecting precursor solution below 4 °C. In the cold-injection method, PeNCs grow through the assembly of fully coordinated plumbates out of the pseudo-emulsion with the assistance of a demulsifier. We discovered that slow assembly of polybromide plumbates, assisted by cold temperature, is essential for defect suppression, resulting in reproducible, stable and pure-green-emitting PeNCs with near-unity PLQY. Furthermore, this method enables efficient large-scale production, achieving 20-l-scale synthesis with remarkable batch weight while maintaining near-unity PLQY. Our findings represent a substantial advancement in synthesis of high-quality PeNCs, offering potential for broad applications in display and lighting industries.

 Cancer cells activate the integrated stress response (ISR) to adapt to stress and resist therapy1. ISR signals converge on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which controls cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs that are involved in metabolic adaptation, survival and growth2,3. However, whether the ISR–ATF4 axis influences anti-tumour immune responses remains mostly unknown. Here we show that loss of ATF4 decreases tumour progression considerably in immunocompetent mice, but not in immunocompromised ones, by enhancing T cell-dependent anti-cancer immune responses. An unbiased genetic screen of ATF4-regulated genes identifies lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as the principal ATF4-dependent effector that impairs anti-tumour immunity by favouring infiltration with immunosuppressive interstitial macrophages. Furthermore, we find that LCN2 promotes T cell exclusion and immune evasion in preclinical mouse models, and correlates with decreased T cell infiltration in patients with lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Anti-LCN2 antibodies promote robust anti-tumour T cell responses in mouse models of aggressive solid tumours. Our study shows that the ATF4–LCN2 axis has a cell-extrinsic role in suppressing anti-cancer immunity, and could pave the way for an immunotherapy approach that targets LCN2. The transcription factor ATF4 and its effector lipocalin 2 (LCN2) have a key role in immune evasion and tumour progression, and targeting the ATF4–LCN2 axis might provide a way to treat several types of solid tumour by increasing anti-cancer immunity."

Here, the authors use intravital imaging to show that pyrimidinergic calcium signaling links tubular injury to fibroblast activation, and that blocking this pathway reduces fibrosis 
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem, with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. Fibrosis is the final common pathway of organ damage in CKD, so understanding how this arises during kidney injury is critical for building a holistic picture of the pathogenesis. Here, using gene expression data, intravital microscopy in mice and realistic cell models, we uncover evidence of a signaling pathway linking tubular pyrimidine metabolism and injury-evoked extracellular uridine diphosphate (UDP) release to activation of the P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6R) in surrounding fibroblasts. We show that P2Y6R activation triggers intracellular calcium rises, which stimulate fibroblast proliferation, migration, and conversion towards a myofibroblast phenotype. Conversely, genetic knockout or pharmacological blockade of the P2Y6R reduces fibrosis in mice with CKD. Thus, we reveal that pyrimidinergic calcium signaling couples fibroblast responses to changes in tubular metabolism in disease states, and represents a potential new target for therapeutic intervention.

The authors trap its ceramide-bound and drugbound states, revealing the catalytic and drug-inhibition mechanisms, providing basis for antifungal drug development. 
 Fungal inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase is an essential enzyme complex that catalyzes a critical step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. It is the molecular target of potent antifungal aureobasidin A (AbA). Despite its therapeutic relevance, the lack of structural and mechanistic insights into IPC synthase function and inhibition has impeded rational antifungal drug development. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IPC synthase in two distinct functional states: a ceramide-bound form and an AbA-inhibited complex. Our study reveals a conserved heterodimeric architecture formed by Aur1 and Kei1, stabilized through extensive protein-protein and lipid-mediated interactions. Within catalytic Aur1, we identify a membrane-embedded reaction chamber harboring a conserved H-H-D catalytic triad (H255, H294, and D298) essential for IPC synthesis. Structural comparisons illuminate the mechanism of ceramide recognition and reveal how AbA acts as a competitive inhibitor by occupying the substrate-binding pocket. Further analyses identify key residues involved in AbA binding and explain the molecular basis of drug resistance. Together, these findings advance the mechanistic understanding of fungal IPC biosynthesis and inhibition, and establish a foundation for developing new antifungal drugs targeting IPC synthase.

 The compact CRISPR-Cas12f system is promising for AAV-delivered gene therapy, but its application has been constrained by restrictive PAM recognition (e.g., TTTR) and suboptimal editing efficiency. Through bacterial library screening and mammalian cell validation, we engineer evoCas12f, an optimized variant incorporating five key mutations, that dramatically expands PAM recognition to NTNR/NYTR. This advancement reduces median distance between two neighbouring PAM sites to 2 nucleotides in the human genome. It also demonstrates 1.4-fold enhanced activity at TTTR sites compared to wild-type Un1Cas12f1, achieving up to 91% editing efficiency. Remarkably, evoCas12f enables efficient generation of homozygous mutations in F0 generation mice, even at non-canonical PAM sites. We further adapt this system for robust transcriptional activation and precise base editing with a well-defined editing window. As a compact yet highly efficient platform, evoCas12f represents a significant advance in CRISPR technology, enabling multiplexed editing for high-resolution targeting applications and expanding possibilities for therapeutic genome engineering.

 The physics of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has long been a subject of significant research interest. Long-range magnetic order in the strict two-dimensional limit, whose discovery circumvented the Mermin-Wagner theorem, has rapidly emerged as a research focus. However, the demonstration of a non-trivial topological spin textures in two-dimensional limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the out-of-plane electric field breaks inversion symmetry while simultaneously modulating the electronic band structure, enabling electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction for creation and manipulation of topological spin textures in monolayer CrI3. The realization of ideal two-dimensional topological spin textures may offer not only an experimental testbed for probing the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless mechanism, but also potential insights into unresolved quantum phenomena including superconductivity and superfluidity. Moreover, voltage-controlled spin-orbit interaction offers a novel pathway to engineer two-dimensional spin textures with tailored symmetries and topologies, while opening avenues for skyrmion-based next-generation information technologies.

 We have recently demonstrated the ability of using self-driving laboratories for AI-driven searches of organic emitters for solid-state lasing devices. Our past workflow featured solubility challenges for such large molecular moieties. In this next-generation study, we return to the drawing board to explore a family of compounds that are much solution processable and composed of a set of electronic cores that provide a broader color response. Out of 252 potential candidates, and with guidance from DFT calculations, we selectively perform a comprehensive study exploring 51 fluorene-based A-B-A-type organic laser oligomers, armed with our self-driving lab. The candidates range from simple hydrocarbon molecules to complex heteroatom-mixed molecules. As a result of this study, we highlight diketopyrrolopyrrole and benzodiazole derivatives for their largely red-shifted emissions. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of color change arising from heteroatom permutation, fluorine addition, thiophene coupling, and a combination of fluorine addition and thiophene coupling. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) measurements in the solid state further corroborate the lasing potential of selected candidates, reinforcing their suitability for future device applications. The computational study with density functional theory confirms the experimental results. Organic lasers, known for their colour purity, are emerging as next-generation light emitters.

 Classical electromagnetism forms the foundation of modern technology. In condensed matter systems, the Berry phase acquired by conduction electrons acts as an emergent electromagnetic field, facilitating phenomena analogous to classical electromagnetism, such as the Lorentz force and electromagnetic induction, and paving the way for next-generation spintronics. Magnetic skyrmions, spin vortices with non-trivial topology, serve as a key platform for such devices. For example, non-trivial transport responses are recognised as being induced by the emergent Lorentz force and the emergent electromagnetic induction. Despite remarkable progress in skyrmion physics, emergent reactance, in which the phase of an applied AC current is modified by emergent electromagnetism, has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report emergent reactance in a micro-fabricated device of the prototypical skyrmion-hosting material, MnSi. Our findings reveal that the internal deformation degrees of freedom in skyrmions are an important factor for efficient generation of the emergent reactance. From lock-in transport measurements of a skyrmion lattice in MnSi, the authors find a delay in the voltage response of the Hall effect and resistivity, arguing that its deformation leads to inertial skyrmion lattice dynamics and emergent reactance."

 The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is a computationally challenging decision problem central to many industrial applications. For SAT problems in cryptanalysis, circuit design, and telecommunication, solutions can often be found more efficiently by representing them with a combination of exclusive OR (XOR) and conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses. We propose a hardware accelerator architecture that natively embeds and solves such hybrid XOR–CNF problems using in-memory computing hardware. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm and demonstrate, both experimentally and through simulations, how it can be efficiently implemented with memristor crossbar arrays. Compared to the conventional approaches that translate XOR–CNF problems to pure CNF problems, our simulations show that the accelerator improves computation speed, energy efficiency, and chip area utilization of in-memory accelerators by  ~ 10 × for a set of hard cryptographic benchmarking problems. Moreover, the accelerator achieves a  ~ 10 × speedup and a  ~ 1000 × gain in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art SAT solvers running on CPUs.

 Off-season landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific show evidence of increased frequency between 1981–2022. We identify convectively coupled equatorial Rossby waves (CCERWs) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) as key physical modulators of off-season landfalling TC frequency, while long-term asymmetric Pacific warming drives systematic spatial reorganization of cyclogenesis. Our analysis reveals that over 70% of off-season landfalling TCs form during supportive CCERW phases, with fourfold higher daily formation probability—significantly stronger coupling than during the peak TC season. Physical mechanism analysis demonstrates that CCERWs create “windows of opportunity” for cyclogenesis. Positive IPO phases correlate strongly with landfalling TC frequency but show no relationship with non-landfalling systems, suggesting preferential steering-flow modulation. Long-term asymmetric Pacific warming appears to contribute to a systematic westward shift in TC genesis locations, bringing more cyclones coastward. These multi-scale physical mechanisms provide new insights into off-season TC behavior during periods of reduced preparedness."

 Mangrove forests offer nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation by storing atmospheric CO2, while also supporting biodiversity, livelihoods, and coastal protection. Yet, they face increasing threats from deforestation, salinity, and extreme weather events. Here, we assessed and explored the resilience of Sundarbans mangrove forests and associated drivers using satellite-derived vegetation indices, biodiversity, and environmental data, within a structural equation modeling framework. We found 1–8 major perturbations at 250-meter spatial resolution, with the lowest resilience to disturbance or stress in the central and southeastern zones of the Sundarbans. Approximately 610 to 990 km² (~10-15% of the total Sundarbans area) of mangrove forests exhibited declining resilience. The functional composition of maximum canopy height (MCH) was the strongest driver of mangrove forest resilience (β= 0.61), followed by specific leaf area (SLA; β= 0.56) and precipitation (β= 0.44). Structural diversity (β= 0.22), though weakly associated, mediated the positive association of species richness with resilience. Perturbation frequency had a significant negative direct (β= −0.29) and total (β= −0.33) association on resilience, whereas temperature exhibited only a total negative association (β= −0.20). Based on these findings, we hold that for enhancing mangrove forest resilience against disturbances and stressors, (re-)establishment and conservation efforts should focus on maintaining site-specific dominant species with tall canopy height and specific leaf area —supplemented by a few complementary species— to increase structural diversity and facilitate recovery rates. Mangrove forest resilience in Sundarbans is supported by tall canopy height and large specific leaf area during perturbations, 2000-2024, as indicated by vegetation indices, biodiversity, and environmental data analysis."

 Phyllosphere microbiomes are crucial for maintaining plant growth and health, but their responses to global change remain largely unclear. Based on a precipitation gradient and N addition experiment in a semiarid grassland on the Mongolian Plateau, this study explored phyllosphere microbial diversity and stability. Across the two host plant species (Artemisia frigida, Leymus chinensis), decreased precipitation altered phyllosphere microbial community composition only. Increased precipitation reduced bacterial diversity and affected bacterial and fungal community composition. However, N addition significantly decreased bacterial, fungal, and protistan diversity, altered their community composition, and weakened phyllosphere microbiome network complexity and stability in both host plant species, suggesting that N addition had a stronger influence on phyllosphere microbial communities than changing precipitation. Our findings of strong sensitivity of phyllosphere microbial diversity and stability to N enrichment provide mechanistic understanding of changes in phyllosphere microbiomes and consequent plant growth and productivity under future global change scenarios. Nitrogen enrichment reduces phyllosphere microbial diversity and network stability in grasslands and exerts a stronger effect than changing precipitation, based on precipitation gradient and nitrogen addition experiments on the Mongolian Plateau."

 The absence of plate tectonics and the young surface age (0.3-1 billion years) of Venus have led to diverse geodynamic models for Venus. The energetics of the Venusian interior drives these models; however, the lack of direct constraints on surface heat flow hampers their quantitative assessment. Here we present a global heat flow map for Venus, as well as estimates of the total heat loss, obtained from an inversion of geophysical data, including lithospheric effective elastic thickness, crustal thickness, and radioactive heat production. Heat flow on Venus is lower and less geographically structured than on Earth, with an average of 31 mW m—2, but with highs associated to rifts systems reaching values typical of active terrestrial areas. The obtained total heat loss is 11-17 TW, similar to estimates of the total radioactive heat production. Therefore, at present, Venus proportionally dissipates much less heat than Earth. A global heat flow map for Venus, along with estimates of the total heat loss, reveals overall lower heat flow compared to Earth, as well as localized peaks linked to rifting activity, as derived from an inversion of geophysical data."

 A view that tidewater glacier fronts are important feeding grounds for marine predators is becoming widespread, although there is little direct evidence of their foraging activities and diet in these areas. Here, we conducted a spatial analysis of the stomach contents of ringed seals to investigate their diet and its relationship with glacier fronts, making the most of the unique opportunity provided by Inuit hunting, which allows obtaining stomachs with hunted locations. Our results showed that seals captured near glacier fronts consumed more prey than those captured farther away, particularly feeding on polar cod. Furthermore, the prey composition varied among capture locations, suggesting varied foraging strategies reflecting prey availability. Our study indicates that seals feed intensively at glacier fronts, emphasizing the potential for recent climate-induced glacier retreat to deprive seals of key foraging grounds, leading to changes in their behavior, diet, and habitat use. Ringed seals captured near glacier fronts consume more prey than those captured farther away, according to spatial analysis of stomach contents in collaboration with Inuit hunters."

 High-resolution remote sensing data are essential for monitoring forest health and detecting changes such as tree mortality. This study evaluates low-level segmentation methods for delineating standing dead trees (SDTs) using widely available true-color (RGB) aerial orthoimagery, independent of near-infrared (NIR) or LiDAR data. The analysis was conducted across eight forest sites in northern Poland, dominated by coniferous species such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.).Four representative superpixel-based algorithms were tested — Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC), its zero-parameter variant (SLIC0), scale-adaptive superpixels (adaptels), and a spatially regularized watershed transform (waterpixels). All methods represent preprocessing approaches designed to reduce image complexity and preserve meaningful spectral–spatial structures prior to object-based image analysis (OBIA). In addition, the impact of converting imagery to the perceptually uniform CIELAB color space was assessed to enhance spectral separability and reduce illumination effects. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated against a manually verified reference dataset of 1,200 SDT crowns using multiple quality metrics.The results indicate that the adaptels algorithm, particularly when combined with the CIELAB color transformation, achieved the most balanced performance across all evaluation metrics, defined by a simultaneous reduction of segmentation fragmentation and boundary generalization errors while maintaining high overall detection accuracy. This combination proved to be an efficient and cost-effective solution for SDT segmentation using standard RGB orthophotos. The findings highlight the potential of perceptually uniform color transformations as practical tools for scalable, reproducible, and low-cost forest monitoring. The study also provides a reference database of standing dead trees to support further research and future integration with deep learning-based detection frameworks."

 The Arctic Ocean is among the world’s most hazardous maritime regions, where sea ice, uncharted bathymetry, and limited emergency infrastructure threaten vessel safety. Recent advances in remote sensing now provide critical spatial data that can mitigate these risks. This study proposes a GIS-based framework for monthly Arctic navigation risk assessment by integrating sea ice, bathymetry, satellite communication, and accessibility to rescue and evacuation infrastructure. Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), risks were evaluated from September 2022 to April 2023 with ICESat-2 observations. Five vessel classes were analyzed, from non-icebreaking ships to those with maximum icebreaking capacities of 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m, and 2.8 m. The resulting maps delineate monthly risk zones and reveal spatial and temporal variability across the Arctic. These outputs provide decision support for safer routing, operational preparedness, and policy development. The framework also demonstrates practical relevance for e-Navigation systems and advances methodological approaches to maritime risk assessment."

 Identifying local and regional air pollution events in developing regions remains challenging due to the lack of monitoring infrastructure. This study applied an integrated monitoring approach (combining low-cost sensors (LCS), reference-grade data, mobile measurements and satellite observations) to characterize the influence of residential wood combustion (RWC) and wildfire smoke on particulate pollution in two cities of central Chile during 2022–2023. LCS data proved to be a reliable indicator of particulate pollution, providing a relative measure of PM2.5 concentrations and effectively flagging extreme events. They revealed strong winter pollution episodes, with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding those recorded at coastal reference-grade stations. An atypical PM2.5 peak exceeding 100 μg/m3 in February 2023 was linked to long-range transport of smoke from severe wildfires in central-south Chile, through a combination of aerosol optical depth, fire radiative power and HYSPLIT trajectories. Winter field measurements of black carbon (BC) and particle number (PN) provided additional source-specific insights. On average, fixed-site BC showed a morning peak (BC370 = BC880 = 4.69 μg/m3), associated with traffic, and an evening peak (BC370 = 6.16 μg/m3; BC880 = 4.39 μg/m3) associated with strong RWC contributions (Ångström exponents >1.1). Mobile monitoring along a 31-km route on nine evenings revealed large spatial variability in BC880 (mean ± standard deviation: 8.79 ± 9.58 μg/m3) and PN (3.00 ± 1.91 × 104 #/cm3), driven by source proximity, combustion practices, meteorology and topography.

 The Southern Sichuan city group in China has experienced severe PM2.5 pollution in recent years, especially in Luzhou. Elucidating the key drivers of PM2.5 is essential to curb further deterioration of PM2.5. This study used Machine Learning (ML) models combined with Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to explore the impact of various drivers (including meteorological factors, chemical components, and sources) on the formation of PM2.5 in Luzhou from January to December, 2023. Secondary ions (NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+) were identified as the most influential species, particularly under polluted conditions, thereby amplifying PM2.5 accumulation. Meteorological factors, especially low temperature and high humidity, further exacerbated pollution episodes by suppressing dispersion and favoring secondary aerosol formation. Source apportionment showed that secondary (46.5%) and industrial emissions (22.2%) were the primary sources overall, but the influence of industrial and combustion sources intensified markedly during heavy pollution periods. These findings point to secondary aerosol formation, amplified by unfavorable meteorology, as the principal driver of PM2.5 pollution in Luzhou. Therefore, the results provide scientific evidence for prioritizing precursor emission controls and implementing timely interventions during stagnant cold weather to curb severe haze events."

 In this study, we examined 364 space leaders in 18 negative natural cloud-to-ground lightning strokes whose stepped leaders created new channels to ground. All strokes were captured on ultra-high-speed video cameras operating at frame rates ranging from 400k to 783k frames per second. Additionally, broadband electromagnetic field measurements were available for a subset of these strokes. The median space leader inception-to-attachment-point length and retrograde propagation speed towards the pre-existing leader channel (PELC) were 8.2 m and 4.0 x 106 m/s, respectively. Space leader lengths were longer and retrograde propagation speeds faster for return strokes with higher peak currents. This is likely due to the relative proximity of space leader inception points to the PELC, which makes the electric field produced by the PELC line charge density one of the primary factors in determining space leader characteristics. Space leader characteristics were weakly related to their inception altitude. We observed bursts of very high frequency (VHF) emissions preceding, by around 0.5 – 1 μs, electric field leader-step pulses; visible-frequency-range luminosity pulses started during the step pulses. The median downward leader propagation speed for all 18 strokes was 4.3 x 105 m/s; leader propagation speeds were generally faster for return strokes with higher peak currents. Also, leaders appeared to accelerate (on their way to ground) at altitudes lower than about 200 and 1000 m above ground level for strokes in the 10 – 60 and 84 – 228 kA peak current ranges, respectively."

Lanza,On the accuracy of optical disdrometer measurements,"•Optical disdrometers were calibrated using generated water drops of various sizes. •Calibration with metallic spheres is inappropriate for testing optical disdrometers. •A relevant bias was observed in the measurement of drop size and fall velocity. •The measurement bias varies both along and across the instrument's sensing area. •Integral properties are largely underestimated especially at low rainfall intensity. 
 Disdrometers are widely used to measure the microphysical properties of precipitation, synthesised by the drop size and fall velocity distribution, and to infer integral properties like rainfall intensity, kinetic energy, visibility and radar reflectivity. Although often used to validate other methods of inferring precipitation products, including radar, satellite and opportunistic sensors, the accuracy and reliability of disdrometer measurements are rarely quantified. This study is the first to traceably and systematically quantify the instrumental bias of optical disdrometer measurements in the laboratory. We tested two widely used optical transmission disdrometers, the OTT Parsivel2 and the Thies LPM, using a raindrop generator that was specifically developed for calibrating non-catching precipitation measurement instruments. We also conducted tests using metallic spheres and demonstrated that the calibration obtained using artificial particles is not appropriate for optical disdrometers. The instruments investigated significantly underestimate drop size by up to 20%, with peaks of up to 40% for the Thies LPM when using the internal post-processing algorithm. The OTT Parsivel2 overestimates fall velocity by about 5 to 10%, while the Thies LPM underestimates it by up to 15%. Slight linear trends of the percentage relative bias with drop size are observed for both drop diameter and fall velocity. However, adjustment of field measurements may be challenging, given the large dispersion observed. The mean bias and dispersion of drop size and velocity measurements vary along and across the laser beam, especially for the Thies LPM, with differences of up to 30% observed between drops falling at the opposite edges of the beam. Integral properties are largely underestimated, particularly at low rainfall intensity, although performance improves as intensity increases. These results highlight the importance of laboratory calibration to assess and quantify the instrumental bias of disdrometer measurements prior to their use in research or operational applications, especially when used to calibrate meteorological radars or to compare integral measurements with those of other instruments that measure precipitation in situ. While they provide relevant information about individual drop size and velocity, optical disdrometers need to be further improved before they can compete reliably with traditional rain gauges in measuring rainfall intensity."

Using a facile yet versatile template-guided growth strategy, vertically aligned Au-Ag nanowire arrays are directly fabricated on 1D nano/microneedles, 2D elastic films, and 3D porous architectures. On 2D substrates, the arrays act as FlexoSERS interfaces with high sensitivity, uniformity (RSD = 7.2%), and durability, maintaining stable SERS signals under 100% strain and after 2500 cycles. On 3D porous sponges, the NWs serve as dry bioelectrical electrodes, enabling stable electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring with long-term stability. Continuous ECG recording, combined with deep learning analysis, enables accurate classification between sleep and wake states. Meanwhile, the EMG signals capture subtle motor activities such as finger bending, typing, and clicking.

Here, we identify an electrically responsive yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)/phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3)/neuropilin-1 (NRP1) signaling axis in sensory neurons. Electrical stimulation enhances YAP1-pSTAT3 interaction, promotes pSTAT3 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, and up-regulates NRP1 to support growth of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)–positive sensory fibers. Guided by these findings, we engineered a bifunctional piezoelectric patch composed of poly(vinylidene difluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] and regenerated silk fibroin@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (RSF@P:P), coupling mechanically induced electrical cues with dynamic lubrication. Under ultrasound activation, the P(VDF-TrFE) layer generates localized electrical signals that facilitate sensory-nerve and vascular ingrowth, while the RSF@P:P layer undergoes piezoelectric-triggered gel-sol transition to form a low-friction interface and reduce adhesion. In rat and Bama minipig models, the patch markedly enhanced tendon regeneration and decreased adhesion scores by ~50%. These findings establish a neuroelectrically guided strategy for enhancing tendon healing."

Certain tumors remain addicted to aneuploidy. Paradoxically, artificially induced aneuploidy in normal cells elicits cellular stresses and decreases cell fitness. How aneuploidy initially emerges during tumorigenesis is thus unclear. Using human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a model, we show that aneuploid ESCs form immature teratomas with an enrichment of mesenchymal tissues. Specifically, chromosome 8 (chr8) gain, a prevalent form of aneuploidy in human cancers, promotes the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in teratomas and MSC proliferation in vitro. We further show that human embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, tumors of mesenchymal origin, lack dominant driver mutations but frequently harbor chr8 gain. Our study suggests a plausible mechanism for aneuploidy emergence during tumorigenesis, links specific aneuploidy to the mesenchymal lineage, and paves the way for identifying vulnerabilities of aneuploid MSCs, which may have important roles in tumorigenesis."

We reconstructed a high-resolution, time-calibrated Y-chromosome phylogeny, revealing multiple male-biased expansions associated with Neolithic cultural innovations in South China. These expansions markedly shaped the paternal ancestry of both South China and mainland Southeast Asia. Founding lineages linked to Hmong-Mien and Tai-Kadai speakers were traced, revealing notable growth during the Middle Neolithic. Phylogeographic structure, network analyses, and haplogroup distributions indicate complex demographic interactions that established the genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers in Southeast Asia. These findings highlight recurrent southward migrations of Chinese farmer-related groups and their enduring influence on the paternal genetic landscape of ancient and present-day Southeast Asians."

To evaluate the effects of miRNA gene mutations, we took advantage of a large collection of somatic mutations identified in miRNA genes in >10,000 The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer samples and compared them with the corresponding miRNA sequencing data. Using different analytical approaches and rigorous statistical criteria, we revealed that a substantial fraction of mutations is deleterious for the proper functioning of miRNA genes affecting the level of mature miRNAs, isomiR profiles (precision of DROSHA/DICER1 cleavage), and/or 5p/3p miRNA strand balance. We also showed that most mutations, especially those identified as deleterious, destabilize the structure of miRNA precursors. The analysis showed that many miRNA gene mutations can damage miRNA genes and, if located in disease-related miRNA genes, may be pathogenic variants."

Architectural disruption of this spatial structure is pathologic. Unfortunately, two-dimensional (2D) histopathology—the gold standard for pathological understanding of many liver diseases—can misrepresent or leave gaps in our understanding of complex 3D structural features. Here, we used immunostaining, tissue clearing, microscopy, and computational software to create 3D multilobular reconstructions of both nonfibrotic and cirrhotic human liver tissue. We found that spatial architecture in human cirrhotic liver samples with varying etiologies had sinusoid zonal dysregulation, reduction in glutamine synthetase–expressing pericentral hepatocytes, regression of central vein networks, disruption of hepatic arterial networks, and fragmentation of biliary networks, which together suggest a pro-portalization/decentralization phenotype in cirrhotic tissue. Further implementation of 3D pathological analyses may provide a deeper understanding of cirrhotic pathobiology and inspire treatments for liver disease."

Here, we identify an exonuclease REXO4, which collaborates with RNaseH1 endonuclease to degrade R-loops in an “endo/exo-cleavage coupling” manner. Specifically, REXO4 directly degrades the RNA strand in R-loops from the end or internal nick through its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and stimulates RNaseH1 endonuclease activity. The genome-wide R-loop regions regulated by REXO4 highly overlap with those regulated by RNaseH1, and REXO4 overexpression counteracts genome-wide R-loop accumulation caused by RNaseH1 deficiency. Furthermore, REXO4-deficient tumors display elevated R-loop mutation burden, and tumor patient-derived mutations in REXO4 enzymatic region all impair R-loop cleavage activity. Besides, we identify a compound 17 (named REXO4-IN-17) capable of inhibiting REXO4 nuclease activity. Interfering with REXO4 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating and G4 stabilizing chemotherapeutic drugs and activates cGAS-mediated antitumor immunity.

The mechanism and predictability of MJO propagation remain elusive, partly because relevant multiscale processes are poorly understood. Here, we reveal chaotic MJO propagation arising from cross-scale nonlinear interactions, based on 4000-member ensemble simulations of two MJO events with a global cloud-system–resolving model. Against conventional linear thinking, multiple regimes with distinct timings of MJO propagation emerge under a single atmosphere-ocean background. The emergence of regime bifurcation depends critically on the equatorial asymmetry of climatological sea surface temperature. Selection of the bifurcated regimes is probabilistic, influenced by whether tropical-extratropical interplay promotes moistening associated with westward-propagating tropical waves over the western Pacific. These results contribute to a more complete MJO conceptual model and help foresee when coherent MJO propagation emerges."

By modulating the VCM output, the robot achieves jumping, full-stroke vibration for terrestrial locomotion and small-stroke vibration for aquatic propulsion. Terrestrial tests demonstrate rapid motion on granular media, continuous jumping, and load carrying. The robot also uses passive tilted fins that convert reciprocating motion into steerable aquatic thrust, realizing an inertia-driven multidirectional propulsion mechanism.

In this study, we generated region-specific brain organoids (cortical, striatal, and midbrain), each integrated with human microglia, to fill this critical gap. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABABreceptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism. Using chemogenetics to activate this midbrain-striatal circuit, we observed increased calcium signaling in microglia involving GABABreceptors. Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring anSCN2Anonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Microglia displayed heightened calcium responses toSCN2Amutation–mediated neuronal hyperactivity and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed not only by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABABreceptors but also by knockout of theGABBR1gene in microglia. Collectively, our findings establish an advanced platform that can be used to dissect human neuroimmune interactions in subcortical regions and to evaluate previously undiscovered therapies, highlighting the important role of microglia in shaping critical circuitry related to neuropsychiatric disorders."

Significant increases in SFW occurred during 1979 to 2024, with more than a twofold increase observed in most regions. We estimate that over half of the observed increase is attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Internal modes of climate variability strongly influence SFW in several regions, including Equatorial Asia, which experiences 43 additional intraregional SFW days during El Niño years. Furthermore, SFW is strongly correlated with regional fire-sourced PM2.5in multiple regions globally. These findings highlight the growing challenges posed by SFW for firefighting coordination and human health."

Through subnanometer-resolved photon imaging of linear molecular chains, coherent purely excitonic (0–0) emission patterns reveal the wave function’s relative phases, while incoherent vibronic (0–1) emission maps the squared wave function amplitudes. This near-field technique enables the reconstruction of wave functions for both bright superradiant states and optically dark subradiant states inaccessible by conventional far-field optics. Furthermore, the submolecular resolution of the vibronic maps allows for the contributions of different vibrational symmetries, namely, Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller modes, to be distinguished. Our findings establish a unique approach for the excitonic wave function reconstruction and open a route for exploring exciton dynamics and interactions in molecular systems."

These “tephra seismites,” embedded in unconsolidated, organic-bearing lake sediment, increase in occurrence and dimensions toward known faults and indicate the occurrence of a local hidden fault segment. Through incorporating peak ground acceleration modeling, we found that the spatial distribution of tephra seismites directly relates to the ground shaking induced by near-field fault ruptures. We used the variability in tephra seismites within the stratigraphic record and tephrochronology to better constrain the recurrence intervals and magnitudes of paleoearthquakes from both the Hamilton Basin and adjacent Hauraki Basin fault systems. Our methodology is globally applicable in volcanic and tectonic regions where liquefaction structures are preserved among (hidden) faults."

Here, we describe the design and preclinical feasibility of a pediatric heart valve stent that spontaneously adapts to growth via a springlike mechanism imparted by the superelastic properties of nitinol. Studies in piglets demonstrated appropriate constraint of the device to small diameters (8 to 9 millimeters) upon implantation, acute valve function, and the ability of the stent to proportionately expand with growth up to 13 millimeters after 6 weeks without subsequent interventions after implantation. We expect that the growth-adaptive stent concept could be broadly leveraged to eliminate surgeries and invasive procedures as young patients grow."

Dvorin,Transmembrane proteins mediate basal complex assembly and individual daughter cell formation in malaria parasites,"Asexual reproduction of malaria parasites requires the basal complex, the equivalent of a eukaryotic contractile ring. Despite its central role, basal complex biogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we use expansion microscopy and DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography to investigate three transmembrane basal complex proteins inPlasmodium falciparum—basal complex transmembrane protein 1 (BTP1), BTP2, and basolateral expansion boundary (BLEB). Parasites lacking BTP2 are still enveloped by membranes but fail to separate from each other, resulting in multiorganellar mutants. We isolate the defect to a specific step during basal complex development and demonstrate that the contractile ability remains intact. By revisiting BLEB, we identify a distinct plasma membrane region that is excluded from daughter cells and associated with the basal complex. Integrating these findings, we propose a three-step model for basal complex biogenesis that highlights the specific role of BTP2 and suggests a role for the BLEB-associated membrane. This study offers a mechanistic framework for how multiple daughter cells are formed simultaneously and highlights the importance of transmembrane proteins for cell division."

The mechanisms behind RGC vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. We developed a patient-specificOpa1V291D/+knock-in mouse model to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal metabolism in ADOA. We observed thatOpa1V291D/+mice exhibited anatomical and functional RGC abnormalities recapitulating the ADOA phenotypes. Reduced optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein levels were noted inOpa1V291D/+mice, accompanied by decreased protein stability. Moreover, mitochondrial function was compromised, as indicated by reduced Complex I activity, increased oxidative stress, and diminished adenosine triphosphate production in the retinas ofOpa1V291D/+mice. Spatial metabolomics revealed energy deficits in the inner retina and heightened glycolysis in the outer retina. Immunostaining showed decreased expression of glycolytic proteins in the ganglion cell layer. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing disclosed significant down-regulation of energy-production genes in RGCs, while other retinal cell types remained unaffected. These findings emphasize the specific vulnerability of RGCs to bioenergetic crises, connecting disrupted energy homeostasis to their degeneration. By increasing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/reduced form of NAD+(NADH) redox ratio through the overexpression of mitochondrial-targetedLactobacillus brevisNADH oxidase (MitoLbNOX) in RGCs, we demonstrated improved RGC function and survival through enhanced energy metabolism and reduced oxidative stress. These findings confirm that disrupted energy metabolism leads to RGC degeneration and emphasize the enhancement of the NAD+/NADH redox ratio as a promising treatment strategy to protect RGCs from degeneration in ADOA."

InArabidopsis, one of them, F-BOX-LIKE17 (FBL17), stands out for playing a key role in DNA replication, DNA damage, and, more recently, for the control of cell size.FBL17null mutants exhibit severe cellular defects leading to lethality. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FBL17 operate remain poorly understood. Here, we show that FBL17 interacts with different components of the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED1/E2F module and is involved in the protein turnover of E2Fa and E2Fb. However, mutations inE2FaorE2Fbdo not alleviate the severefbl17phenotype but worsen it. By contrast, it is the accumulation of the transcriptional repressor E2Fc that causesfbl17mutant lethality. Our results highlight a key role for FBL17 in modulating the transcriptional control of E2F target genes ensuring precise control of cell cycle progression and avoiding uncontrolled DNA damage response."

Chase,Degradation of fish food webs in the Anthropocene,"Global change reshapes biodiversity through shifts in species composition, richness, and body size. How these shifts combine to alter higher-level ecological processes within food webs can have important implications for entire ecosystems. However, the strength and direction of these shifts will depend on combinations of ways that species and trait compositions change through time. We combine long-term data from ~15,000 freshwater and marine fish communities (1949–2019) with information about their size, diets, and trophic status to evaluate how food webs change through time at local spatial scale. We found that selective species turnover driven by body size reductions is associated with widespread alteration to fish food web topology and function, including increased connectance and generalism, leading to higher predation pressure and increased prey vulnerability. Food webs were also less modular. These changes extend across food web trophic structures, causing a cascading shift in the proportion of species across trophic levels. Our study highlights complex biodiversity responses to confluent changes across multiple facets."

While synthetic DNA networks have been engineered primarily using sequence programmability, exclusive reliance on this dimension constrains signaling range and integrated regulation. Here, we report an allosteric DNA computing framework enabling the simultaneous integration of sequence programmability with conformational dynamics for integrated multilevel signal processing. By encoding conformational signals within polythymidine loops (0 to 40 nucleotides), this system executes loop-dependent logic operations with expanded signaling ranges. Moreover, catalytic allosteric hairpin assemblies achieve ~30-fold signal amplification with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Concurrently, allosteric DNA neural networks discriminate conformational signals based on loop lengths (7 to 15 nucleotides) at two-nucleotide resolution. Crucially, microRNA-responsive versions of this framework regulate gene expression, thereby bridging conformational signaling with genetic control regulations in vivo. Collectively, this work establishes a conformational signal-processing paradigm for adaptive DNA computing, paving the way for advanced synthetic biology and precision therapeutics."

This imbalance contributes to mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Despite promising preclinical studies supporting therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring redox balance and thereby rescuing brain bioenergetic deficits, clinical outcomes and efficacy remain limited. Progress has been hindered by the incomplete understanding of NAD+subcellular cycling, as well as a lack of in vivo biomarkers measuring target engagement of redox status and mitochondrial function. Thus, this review examines molecular mechanisms of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)–related bioenergetic deficits, current and emerging NAD-targeted therapies, and recent advances in the development of neuroimaging biomarkers, emphasizing personalized and mechanism-driven approaches."
