In this study, ultraviolet (UV)-aged PBS-NPs and PBAT-NPs are found to have a higher propensity to accumulate within the body of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) by prolonging the defecation interval, which could induce severe neuronal damage compared to pristine NPs. The increased accumulation of biodegradable nanoplastics (BNPs) and subsequent impairments of neurobehavior are highly attributed to their reduced particle size and altered surface properties, including changed chemical bonds and functional groups after photoaging. Aged BNPs also cause more severe damage to GABAergic neurons and neurotransmitter receptors, resulting in disrupted neuronal homeostasis and behaviors. Overall, BNPs of both PBS and PBAT components show no significant differences in biological accumulation and mechanisms of neural damage, highlighting the commonalities and characteristics of the adverse effects of petroleum-based BNPs on the nervous system. Our study opens up the exploration of the health impacts of photoaging and the degradation state of BNPs that are increasingly present in the environment."

Marshall,Energetic Constraints on Baroclinic Eddy Heat Transport With a Beta Effect in the Laboratory,"Hypotheses involving energetic constraints and the down‐gradient diffusion of heat in eddy parameterization theories are tested by estimating baroclinic eddy transports in rotating annulus laboratory experiments. Particle Imaging Velocimetry measurements are supplemented by numerical simulations to estimate variables not measured directly. The results with a topographic beta effect broadly support Fick's first law, and are consistent with the GEOMETRIC framework in which eddy buoyancy flux is constrained by total eddy energy. With the topographic beta effect, a relatively simple relation is observed between the eddy buoyancy flux and the total eddy energy, with the ratio quantifying the eddy transport efficiency. This efficiency decreases in more complex flow regimes with larger rotation rates, associated with the changing energy partition between eddy available potential energy and eddy kinetic energy. In the absence of a topographic beta effect, more complicated dependencies are found, suggesting roles for other variables."

We simulate the transient as an antisunward‐ and dawnward‐moving slab of hot tenuous solar wind plasma and weak magnetic field strengths on magnetic field lines connected to the bow shock. The slab elicits large‐amplitude outward bow shock motion with a stronger jump in plasma and magnetic field parameters on the trailing than the leading edges of this motion. The outward bulge in the bow shock bounds a magnetosheath region containing a hot tenuous plasma with weakened magnetic field strengths and flows deflected away from the Sun‐earth line. The magnetopause bulges outward into this magnetosheath region to distances beyond the nominal bow shock. Despite the large amplitude magnetopause motion, perturbations at geosynchronous orbit are miniscule. Model predictions compare well to the observed characteristics of foreshock transients and their effects on the magnetosphere."

However, recharge is one of the least understood hydrologic processes. Here we show how event‐scale rainfall recharge thresholds vary over a year using a novel network of subterranean drip loggers installed in caves, mines, and tunnels to observe groundwater recharge events. These cannot be used to directly estimate groundwater recharge volumes, but instead detail temporal aspects, such as the rainfall amount required to trigger recharge. We describe how these thresholds vary over time and space from a range of geological, environmental, and climatic conditions. At our Southeast Australian sites, median rainfall recharge thresholds of 10–20 mm in 48 hr were needed to activate recharge. Rainfall events of this magnitude are infrequent, they are expected to change with climate change, and they are fundamentally important for informing groundwater recharge."

Using large eddy simulations (LES) of the daytime convective boundary layer (CBL), we quantify random errors in UAS measurements that occur due to insufficient statistical convergence of the time average to the true ensemble mean. Random errors in first‐order moments increase as the CBL becomes increasingly unstable, and are largest near the surface for most quantities. Errors are on the order of 2–6 m s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$ for wind speed, 15–60° ${}^{\circ}$ for wind direction, 0.2–3 K for potential temperature, and 0.1–1 g kg−1 ${\text{kg}}^{-1}$ for specific humidity, with errors in turbulent fluxes on the order of 50%–100%.

Based on TC and convection intensity, the eight‐hour period is categorized into three stages with distinct microphysical features: pre‐mature, mature and post‐mature. During the mature stage, both ice‐phase and warm rain processes are active, resulting in a distribution pattern where most convective cells (CCs) contain high concentrations of small raindrops with a few exhibiting extremely large raindrops, and making raindrop size distributions (DSDs) fall between “continental‐like” and “maritime‐like”.

Using data from the THEMIS mission, we calculate the average Hall length LHall $\left({L}_{\text{Hall}}\right)$ and its spatial distribution near the equatorial plane. Our findings reveal that LHall ${L}_{\text{Hall}}$ significantly exceeds the ion inertial length, which suggests that the Hall term's contribution to generalized Ohm's law is significantly greater than the convective term. In this case, the magnetic field lines are able to slip through the plasma, something that conventional magnetohydrodynamic models cannot adequately describe. We explore how such slippage facilitates the development of substorm perturbations that do not require changes in magnetic field topology.

Implications for Flux Measurements,"Top‐down entrainment shapes the vertical gradients of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes, influencing the interpretation of eddy covariance (EC) measurements in the unstable atmospheric surface layer (ASL). Using large eddy simulations for convective boundary layer flows, we demonstrate that decreased temperature gradients across the entrainment zone increase entrainment fluxes by enhancing the entrainment velocity, amplifying the asymmetry between top‐down and bottom‐up flux contributions. These changes alter scalar flux profiles, causing flux divergence or convergence and leading to the breakdown of the constant flux layer assumption (CFLA) in the ASL. As a result, EC‐measured fluxes either underestimate or overestimate “true” surface fluxes during divergence or convergence phases, contributing to energy balance non‐closure. The varying degrees of the CFLA breakdown are a fundamental cause for the non‐closure issue. These findings highlight the underappreciated role of entrainment in interpreting EC fluxes, addressing non‐closure, and understanding site‐to‐site variability in flux measurements."

The results indicated that the ROLO‐RCF (RObotic Lunar Observatory model with correction factor)‐modified method was capable of reliably calculating nocturnal aerosol optical depths (AODs) and the Ångström exponent (AE440–870 nm) measured from the CE318‐T photometer, which was validated with synchronous observations of a lidar. The AOD day/night transition coherence test has firmly demonstrated the reliability of nighttime AODs obtained from a photometer at night‐to‐day and day‐to‐night time intervals. Both spectral AOD values and AE440–870 nm exhibited prominent diurnal variations, and nocturnal AODs showed a good continuity with daytime AODs in a wide range of moon's illuminations. The maximal AOD500 nm, PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations under a heavy dust event on 9–10 June, 2023 were 3.07, 2,800 and 9,400 μg/m3, respectively, and corresponding AE440–870 nm, fine‐mode fraction, and ratio of PM2.5/PM10 were 0.01, 0.17 and 0.24, respectively, implying the dominance of large desert dust particles in Ayvaj. The percentage departures of AOD500 nm showed systematically negative values (−22% ∼ −5%) during daytime and positive values (+6% ∼ +25%) in nighttime and corresponding AE440–870 nm ranged within ±25%, attributable to the frequent intrusion of dust events. Both daytime and nighttime AODs showed a similar monthly variation characteristic, and average AOD values (AOD440 nm of 0.25 ∼ 0.51) in prevailing dust seasons were generally greater than the ones (AOD440 nm of 0.16 ∼ 0.45) in September and October. In contrast, the monthly average AE440–870 nm exhibited an opposite pattern. The overall average daytime and nighttime AOD440 nm values were 0.327 ± 0.187 and 0.381 ± 0.135, respectively, and corresponding AE440–870 nm were 0.472 ± 0.192 and 0.467 ± 0.200, respectively, suggesting that coarse‐mode dust particles were the main contributors to total aerosol loading in Ayvaj. In summary, this paper has verified that the CE318‐T photometer had a unique capability to measure nocturnal aerosol optical parameters under a wide range of lunar phase cycles in Ayvaj. Such significant diurnal variability of dust AODs and AE440–870 nm disparity should be included in regional climate models to simulate its diurnal radiative effect in the future work."

In this study, we use isotopic observations in Antarctica to assess the skill of the isotope‐enabled atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ6, nudged to ERA5 above the boundary layer (1980–2023 period). The model has no significant bias for time‐mean temperature and snow accumulation over the ice sheet. Sensitivity test on parameterized supersaturation strength highlights its opposite effect on precipitation δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O and d‐excess. Selecting an intermediate supersaturation strength resulted in a minimal bias for surface snow δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O across the continent, with a reduced but systematic positive bias in surface snow d‐excess (∼ ${\sim} $5‰). We then assessed seasonal and diurnal isotope variability with daily precipitation and continuous vapor isotopes at Dumont d’Urville (DDU, coastal station) and Concordia (inland station). On a seasonal scale, LMDZ6iso accurately reproduces the seasonal cycle of precipitation δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O and d‐excess at both stations. Moving from statistical evaluation to physical analysis, we use the individual process contributions to boundary‐layer water vapor isotopes to identify the main drivers controlling the clear‐sky isotopic daily cycles. At Concordia, daily isotope variations are mainly driven by surface sublimation, whereas at DDU they are driven by surface sublimation and advection by the katabatic flow. Our results suggest that to further improve water isotopes in LMDZ6iso, fractionation during surface sublimation should be included and fractionation at condensation for low temperature should be better constrained."

Here the authors show that targeting ACER3, a ceramidase upregulated in cholestatic liver, alleviates liver injury in mice by enhancing bile acid sulfation to reduce bile acid overload through unsaturated ceramide-activated LXRβ signaling. 
 Bile acid overload critically drives the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury (CLI). While ceramide metabolism has garnered increasing interest in liver research, the role of ceramides in CLI remains unclear. This study investigates the function of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3)-catalyzed hydrolysis of unsaturated ceramides in CLI. Using clinical specimens, this work finds that ACER3 expression is upregulated in the cholestatic liver and positively correlated with the severity of CLI in patients. Acer3 ablation increases ceramide(d18:1/18:1) and attenuates bile duct ligation-induced CLI in female mice with reduced hepatic necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, it does not significantly impact CLI in male mice. Moreover, ceramide(d18:1/18:1) treatment attenuates CLI in wild-type female mice. Similarly, ACER3 knockdown and ceramide(d18:1/18:1) treatment prevent lithocholic-acid-induced cell death in human-liver-derived HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, ceramide(d18:1/18:1) binds the ligand binding domain of the liver X receptor β, acting as an agonist to activate its transcriptional functions. This activation upregulates sulfotransferase 2A1-catalyzed bile acid sulfation, normalizes bile acid metabolism, and restores lipogenesis, thereby reducing bile acid overload in hepatocytes to attenuate CLI. Our findings uncover the role of ceramide(d18:1/18:1)-liver X receptor β signaling in mitigating bile acid overload in the cholestatic liver, offering mechanistic insights and suggesting therapeutic potential for targeting ACER3 and ceramide(d18:1/18:1) for CLI. Ceramide metabolism has garnered increasing attention in liver diseases, but its role in cholestatic liver injury remains unclear.

To investigate this, here we take the example of monsoon cereal production in India, which has steadily shifted towards climate-sensitive rice and away from alternative cereals (finger millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum). We find that variations in harvested area are significantly associated with current and past price fluctuations for all cereals except rice. This suggests that farmer decisions based on economic factors may exercise great influence in determining variations in harvested area. We also show that optimized allocations of harvested area can reduce climate-induced production loss by 11% or improve farmer net profit by 11% while maintaining calorie production and cropland area. Such improvements would be possible by reducing harvested areas dedicated to rice and increasing areas allocated to alternative cereals. Our findings show that strategies using harvested area to address cereal yield fluctuations and improve farm profits could complement ongoing efforts to improve alternative cereal yields and stabilize cereal production. Production stability depends on both yield and harvested area. Swapping rice for climate resilient cereals such as millets, maize, and sorghum in India could reduce climate-induced losses by 11% and increase farmer profits by 11%, achievable through targeted economic incentives."

Here, the authors present a structure-based approach to stabilize ChREBPα/14-3-3 interactions, suppressing ChREBPβ and protecting β-cells from glucolipotoxicity, showcasing ‘molecular glues’ as tools to control difficult to target transcription factors. 
 The Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor (TF) with two major splice isoforms (α and β). In chronic hyperglycemia and glucolipotoxicity, ChREBPα-mediated ChREBPβ expression surges, leading to insulin-secreting β-cell dedifferentiation and death. 14-3-3 binding to ChREBPα results in cytoplasmic retention and suppression of transcriptional activity. Thus, small molecule-mediated stabilization of this protein-protein interaction (PPI) may be of therapeutic value. Here, we show that structure-based optimizations of a ‘molecular glue’ compound led to potent ChREBPα/14-3-3 PPI stabilizers with cellular activity. In primary human β-cells, the most active compound retained ChREBPα in the cytoplasm, and efficiently protected β-cells from glucolipotoxicity while maintaining β-cell identity. This study may thus not only provide the basis for the development of a unique class of compounds for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes but also showcases an alternative ‘molecular glue’ approach for achieving small molecule control of notoriously difficult to target TFs.

 Expansion microscopy enhances the microscopy resolution by physically expanding biological specimens and improves the visualization of structural and molecular details. Numerous expansion microscopy techniques and labeling methods have been developed over the past decade to cater to specific research needs. Nonetheless, a shared limitation among current protocols is the extensive sample processing time, particularly for challenging-to-expand biological specimens (e.g., formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections and large three-dimensional specimens). Here we present BOOST, a rapid and robust expansion microscopy workflow that leverages a series of microwave-accelerated expansion microscopy chemistry. Specifically, BOOST enables a single-step 10-fold expansion of cultured cells, tissue sections, and even the challenging-to-expand FFPE sections under 90 minutes. Notably, BOOST pioneers a 10-fold expansion of large millimeter-sized three-dimensional specimens, previously unattainable to the best of our knowledge. The workflow is also easily adaptable based on stable and common reagents, thus boosting the potential adoption of expansion microscopy for applications.

Here, authors show that maternal high-fat diets trigger immune-metabolic dysregulation, elevating neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites in fetal brains, and blocking these pathways rescues social deficits in male mice, highlighting preventive strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders. 
 Diet-related maternal obesity has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders in progeny. Although the precise mechanisms and effective interventions remain uncertain, our research elucidates some of these complexities. We established that a prenatal high-fat diet triggered maternal immune activation (MIA), marked by elevated serum lipopolysaccharide levels and inflammatory-cytokine overproduction, which dysregulated the maternal tryptophan metabolism promoting the accumulation of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites in the embryonic brain. Interventions aimed at mitigating MIA or blocking the kynurenine pathway effectively rescued the male mice social performance. Furthermore, excessive kynurenine metabolites initiated oxidative stress response causing neuronal migration deficits in the fetal neocortex, an effect that was mitigated by administering the glutathione synthesis precursor N-Acetylcysteine, underscoring the central role of maternal immune-metabolic homeostasis in male mice behavioral outcomes. Collectively, our study accentuated the profound influence of maternal diet-induced immuno-metabolic dysregulation on fetal brain development and provided the preventive strategies for addressing neurodevelopmental disorders.

 The Eurasian ice sheet complex (EIS) was the third largest ice sheet complex at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Although temporal and spatial evolution of the EIS during the last glacial cycle has not been well-established, strong evidence indicates the existence of nearly ice-free conditions during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3). Between MIS 3 and the LGM, the EIS likely experienced substantial expansions. These expansions were accompanied by decreasing boreal summer insolation, a slight reduction in greenhouse gases, and millennial-scale abrupt shifts between stadial and interstadial conditions. Using the state-of-the-art Earth system model AWI-ESM with asynchronously coupled dynamic ice sheets, we performed transient simulations focusing on this period. Our study shows that the formation of the EIS resembles a bifurcation transition. Only in case of a relatively weak background Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a sufficiently large thin ice/snow cover develops to accommodate a subsequent ice volume growth as Northern Hemisphere summer insolation further decreases. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments show a large non-linearity in surface mass balance changes in response to varying temperature and precipitation, indicating a high sensitivity of the EIS buildup. Our study highlights the large complexity and strong non-linearity of the Earth system induced by internal climate feedbacks, particularly the interactions between ice sheets and other climate components."

 Radiative transfer (RT) theories formulate vegetation radiative transfer models (RTMs) that link the biophysical properties of vegetation with remote sensing signals. Compared to classical RT theories, the recollision probability theory (also known as p-theory) is distinctive as it predicts some optical properties of vegetation canopies using fewer spectral invariants and simpler mathematical functions. This theory commonly employs an effective recollision probability (pE) that is assumed to spectrally independent for vegetation-photon interactions, to describe the absorptive and reflective properties of a vegetation canopy at any wavelength. Most p-theory studies approximate pE using the canopy-average recollision probability at different locations within the canopy, enabling its estimation based on canopy structural properties. However, the canopy-average recollision probability and pE different meanings. As an effective parameter, pE should be obtained by fitting the p-theory formulations, as done in previous studies using simulated and measured canopy optical properties for specific canopies. These studies have empirically shown that pE generally increases with canopy leaf area and exhibits some spectral variability. Building on this empirical evidence, we explore an analytical expression for pE and its dependence on leaf optical and canopy structural properties.In this study, we link the recollision probability theory with the classical Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory, a two-stream RT theory which predicts canopy optical properties by solving the corresponding differential equations. By using the KM theory as applied in the SAIL model, we derive the analytical expression for the absorptance of vegetation canopies illuminated by diffuse radiation. This absorptance is then used to derive pE based on its relationship with absorptance in the p-theory. In this way, we express pE as a function of leaf albedo (ωl) and canopy leaf area index (LAI, L). Our findings demonstrate that, for a given canopy, pE could be approximated as a function of LAI (pL) by using Taylor series expansion. This approximation aligns with Stenberg's, 2007 canopy-average recollision probability, although the two have different meanings and are derived using different approaches. More importantly, we demonstrate that pE increases with leaf albedo and that the difference between the LAI-based and true spectrally-dependent pE scales with 1−ωl·L, reaching up to 0.15. Consequently, the use of LAI-based pE in the p-theory could lead to some errors in simulating canopy absorptive and reflective properties. This study bridges two widely used RT theories and presents an estimation of pE. We provide an analytical expression for spectrally-dependent pE for turbid canopies, and mathematically demonstrate how it can be approximated by spectrally-independent pL. These findings clarify the rationale and limitations of assuming spectral invariance in the p-theory."

 Aerosols chemical components from different sources significantly affect climate change and air quality. In this study, we developed a satellite-based aerosol component retrieval method based on multiple solution mixing mechanism (MSMM) to extract global aerosol component from POLDER polarimetric satellite observations from 2008 to 2012. The MSMM calculates the complex refractive index using the Lorentz-Lorenz relation and constrains the solute fraction with κ-Köhler theory to retrieve the following components: black carbon (BC), ammonium nitrate-like inorganic salts (AN), dust (DU), sea salt (SS), water-soluble organic matter (WSOM), water-insoluble organic matter (WIOM), and aerosol water content (AW). By analyzing the spatial distribution and seasonal characteristics of the seven aerosol components over a five-year period, we captured the significant patterns of each aerosol component over global anthropogenic and natural hotspot emission regions. The five-year average and the seasonal patterns of each component during 2008 show significant changes, consistent with our expectations and previous studies. The pattern of global brown carbon (BrC), which is estimated by the possible tracer substances, is correlated with the fire radiative power. After analyzing the time series changes of each component in different regions for five years, we fine that the fine-mode fraction of aerosol component mass concentration in the central-eastern region of China declined about 6.05% from 2008 to 2010, which is closely related to the strong implementation of environmental protection policies. Also, we find the global aerosol component mass fraction in 2012 shows anomalies, especially a significant increase in the AW component, which is explained by the high frequency of extreme weather. The aerosol components retrieved by the MSMM are comparable with MERRA-2, with the correlations up to 0.94 for BC and 0.88 for DU in representative regions. More comprehensive species of aerosol components can be obtained using the MSMM method than MERRA-2, which can be applied to future satellite observations with higher spatial resolution."

 The response of vegetation to drought is a crucial aspect of understanding ecosystem adaptation to climate change. Response time (RT) to drought serves as a key metric to quantify vegetation anomalies induced by drought events. However, it remains unclear from the perspective of event. Therefore, we quantified the RT of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to meteorological drought across various vegetation types and climatic zones in China. Additionally, we analyzed the spatial distribution of vegetation loss during response periods and the factors influencing RT. Our findings indicated that the primary RT of LAI and GPP to Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was short-term (<4 months), with LAI's longer RT concentrated in southern China. In contrast, the spatial distribution of GPP's RT largely opposed that of LAI. Grasslands exhibited notably different RT spatial distributions compared to other vegetation types. Additionally, we found LAI experiencing greater losses than GPP during response periods. For RT of both LAI and GPP, near-surface temperature (TEM) emerged as the paramount influencing factor, with RT significantly increasing with rising TEM. Secondary factors included surface solar radiation (SSRD) and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), but LAI and GPP showed distinct differences in their biased dependence on SSRD and VPD respectively. Most regions displayed a significant positive correlation between RT of LAI and GPP with TEM, and a negative correlation with SSRD. The study clarifies the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation response to drought and provides a scientific basis for water resource allocation and future drought prevention and mitigation to reduce drought's negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems."
