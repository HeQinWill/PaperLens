This study aims to further explore the underlying biomechanism and modifying effects of maternal genetic regulators. Among 1944 mother-child pairs from the Shanghai Birth Cohort, meet-in-the-middle, mediation, and enrichment analyses were combined with the early pregnancy untargeted metabolome to explore potential biological links between prenatal ALAN exposure and early life growth. Maternal polygenetic risk scores (PRS) for glucose- and lipid-metabolism-related phenotypes were constructed and dichotomized (high/low) to examine gene-environment interactions. We identified 35 mediating metabolites between prenatal ALAN exposure and growth outcomes, which were enriched in neural signal transduction-related pathways and associated with the circadian rhythm. The effects of ALAN exposure on fetal and child growth were more pronounced among mothers with high PRS levels for fasting glucose, HbA1c, and triglycerides. To sum up, prenatal ALAN exposure may be associated with reduced weight and adiposity gains during the first 1000 days. These associations may be partly explained by disturbances in maternal circadian rhythms and appeared more pronounced among mothers with high genetic predispositions to glucose and triglyceride levels."

Biomass burning (BB) is a major BrC emission source, yet insufficient understanding of long-term emission trends from different sources and their underlying drivers hinders the accurate assessment of regional climate and environmental effects, as well as the development of targeted mitigation strategies. We integrated provincial socioeconomic data, remote sensing data, and source-specific emission factors to quantify the magnitude, spatial variations, and trends (1980–2023) of BrC emissions from BB in China. Furthermore, we analyzed the period-specific drivers and projected future emissions under different policy scenarios. The BrC emissions rose and then fell (1980–2023), peaking in 2014 at 433 (95% CI: 323–635) Gg, with an increasing contribution from open emissions. The major emission regions migrated from areas with intensive indoor biomass use (e.g., South-Central China) to those with main crop-producing regions (e.g., Northeast China). Agricultural expansion, energy structure changes, and policy controls are the primary factors driving emission variations, while the main drivers of indoor and open emissions varied across different periods. Projections of the baseline scenario indicate that open emissions should be paid more attention, given their continued contribution (94%, 2035). Maintaining existing control efforts may lead to a slight increase in emissions (11%) due to growing straw output and control uncertainties. More rigorous control of straw-burning policies and differentiated management strategies could decrease emissions."

Although catalytic oxidation is promising for their simultaneous removal, competitive adsorption and the selective reactivity of oxygen species limit its synergistic efficiency. Herein, Lanthanum (La) was introduced to modulate the electron localization at tetrahedral (Td) and octahedral (Oh) sites in CoMn2O4, thereby governing the distribution and reactivity of oxygen species, accompanied by an overall shift in surface acid–base properties. The large ionic radius and low electronegativity of La3+ induce pronounced lattice distortion and charge redistribution, particularly in tetrahedral sites of La0.1Co catalyst, activating otherwise inert CoTd-O units for efficient O2 activation and rapid replenishment of oxygen vacancies under high temperature conditions. Simultaneously, La doping weakens MnOh-O bonds at octahedral sites and stabilizes Mn4+ to enhance lattice oxygen mobility and reactivity. This dual activation enhances electrophilic attack on aromatic rings and promotes C–H bond activation, governing the oxidation of toluene and acetone. The overall optimization of  surface acid–base properties mitigates competitive adsorption and facilitates the degradation of reaction intermediates. Notably, for mixed VOCs removal, La0.1Co lowers the T90 for toluene by 45 °C and increases the specific reaction rate of toluene oxidation compared to pristine CoMn2O4. This work provides insights and modification strategies for designing efficient catalysts tailored to both single- and mixed-component VOCs."

We implemented an improved mechanistic scheme in a chemical transport model, integrating physically based stomatal and mesophyll conductance algorithms with an integrated leaf area index (LAI) database to enhance the simulations of global Hg0 dry deposition. Compared with traditional semiempirical parametrizations, the new scheme more accurately reproduced diverse literature-derived field observations, particularly in Asia and the Amazon region. The model estimated a global vegetation-mediated Hg0 dry deposition flux of 2257 Mg yr–1, with hotspots in tropical rainforests and industrialized regions of Asia driven by enhanced vegetation activity and intensive regional anthropogenic emissions. These results demonstrate that our mechanistic model representations, evaluated by the diverse literature-derived field observations, can substantially reduce uncertainties and improve the understanding of atmosphere–biosphere Hg cycling."

Bastos,Reduced Vegetation Uptake During the Extreme 2023 Drought Turns the Amazon Into a Weak Carbon Source,"In 2023, the biogeographic Amazon experienced temperature anomalies of 1.5°C above the 1991–2020 average from September to November. These conditions were driven by high sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, together with reduced moisture advection from the Atlantic, causing large vapor pressure and water deficits in the second semester of 2023. Here, we evaluate the response of the Amazon carbon cycle to this extreme event across different spatial scales. We combined atmospheric CO2 mole fractions and eddy covariance flux data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO, −2.1441, −58.99), low‐latency simulations by Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), an atmospheric inversion, and remote sensing data. We find that in 2023 the Amazon region was, including fires, a net carbon source of 0.01–0.17 PgC. Fire emissions (0.15 [0.13–0.17] PgC) were within typical variability of the 2003–2023 period, thus we attribute the weak carbon source to reduced vegetation uptake during the dry season (August–October). A stronger‐than‐normal vegetation uptake early in the year (January–April), consistent across data streams and spatial scales, mitigated the total carbon losses by the end of the year. We find a shift from carbon sink to source in May and a peak source in October. Our findings show a reduced vegetation carbon uptake over the Amazon region, leading to a weak carbon source that contributed up to 30% of the net carbon loss in the tropical land in 2023."

J. Falkena,"On Storm Tracks, Weather Regimes, and a Wave Breaking Recipe","The mid‐latitude atmospheric circulation is often described as a combination of low‐frequency variability, such as weather regimes (WRs) that can persist for weeks, and high‐frequency variability, including synoptic systems that shape our daily weather. In the North Atlantic, regimes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation influence the jet stream and affect surface climate. Here we investigate the dynamics governing the interaction between these timescales, and how it is mediated by Rossby Wave Breaking (RWB) events. A simplified equation is derived to explore which processes contribute to RWB through a meridional overturning of high‐frequency potential vorticity, providing a dynamical recipe for when and where wave breaking occurs. We show that slowly varying regimes steer the tracks of high‐frequency systems, which in turn determine whether the frequency of cyclonic or anticyclonic RWB is enhanced or suppressed. The recurrence of same‐type RWB in a similar position can ultimately shape the mean structure of WRs. By linking the structure of WRs to the dynamics of wave breaking, our framework provides a dynamical basis for interpreting variability in midlatitude circulation."

Plane;Julián Villamayor;Alfonso Saiz‐Lopez,Shifts in Atmospheric Composition Since the Preindustrial Era Modified the Transport and Deposition of Mercury,"The atmospheric lifetime of mercury (Hg) determines its global spread and the delivery of this toxic pollutant to remote ecosystems. Previous studies have generally assumed that the chemical lifetime of elemental mercury (Hg0) has remained constant across historical time periods, mirroring present‐day (PD, 2010–2019) conditions. However, since preindustrial times (PI, 1850) anthropogenic emissions have altered the concentrations of key oxidants that affect the Hg0 lifetime, including bromine radicals (Br), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and ozone (O3). Here, we use chemistry‐climate modeling to analyze the changes in Hg redox chemistry between PI and PD and consequent impacts on Hg transport and deposition. While increasing concentrations of OH and O3 lead to 16% faster Hg0 oxidation in the PD Northern Hemisphere, the increased partitioning of Br to reservoir species slows Hg0 oxidation by 20% in the Southern Hemisphere compared to PI. On the global scale, these competing mechanisms lead to an overall buffering of the tropospheric chemical lifetime of Hg0. The shift from PI to PD atmospheric composition drives 15% more Hg deposition to tropical and subtropical fisheries, which are the major global source of toxic methylmercury for human exposure. The PI atmosphere was more conducive to the spread of Hg to the remote Southern Hemisphere extratropics, impacting the interpretation of historical records of Hg deposition from natural archives and the supply of Hg to the Southern Ocean marine sediment sink. This study reveals the previously overlooked role of changing atmospheric composition in aggravating human Hg exposure risk via altered deposition patterns."

Hereby we statistically investigate for the first time Es responses to variations of the northern polar vortex (represented by NAM index) using long‐term ionosonde observations over Japan (44 years) and Australia (34 years). The analysis reveals clear polar vortex modulation of Es, with increasing/decreasing foEs on low/high NAM days over Japan and decreasing foEs over Australia on low NAM days with a time lag of 5–7 days. This hemispheric asymmetry is largely attributed to nearly anti‐phase wind shear responses in two hemispheres. Our results demonstrate the modulation of deep connection between stratosphere dynamics and ionospheric irregularities, emphasizing the importance atmosphere‐ionosphere coupling. It suggests that the NAM index could be used to increase the accuracy of Es layer prediction and serve as indicator for assessing the risk of Es layer occurrence in advance. This has practical implications for fields such as radiocommunications and over‐the‐horizon radar."

Using best‐track data (1951–2023), this study reveals a significant pre‐landfall acceleration of TCs along the South China coast, with translation speed increasing by 35.5% and 16.4% during the 24 hr prior to landfall for eastbound and westbound cases, respectively. This acceleration is primarily contributed by the normal component of the translation vector. For westbound TCs, translation speed and its normal component increase with intensity, particularly at typhoon strength and above. Numerical simulations and diagnostic analyses attribute the acceleration to horizontal advection and diabatic heating, primarily driven by land‐induced asymmetric flow and convection. These findings strengthen the current understanding of TC motion dynamics and support more effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies as TCs approach coastal regions."

We examined temporal variations in pulse‐like infrasound activity, seismoacoustic amplitudes, and spectral characteristics. Pulse‐like infrasound activity gradually became intermittent and waned at the end of the day. Seismic‐infrasonic amplitude ratio decreased, while the infrasound frequency index increased with time. These results suggest less interaction with water due to drying out of the vent. Satellite observations also show increased ground surface temperatures inside the crater from 13 to 14 July. Numerical simulation suggests a significant topographic effect on the waveform and spectrum of the pulse‐like infrasound, which should be considered before interpreting the source process."

Anthropogenic aerosols modulate the cloud albedo by impacting the relative dispersion (ε) of cloud droplet size distributions (CDSDs), known as the dispersion effect. This effect can be either suppressive or enhancing, introducing considerable uncertainties in polluted continental clouds. Here, we developed in situ measurements in polluted East China and simultaneously measured the CDSDs and aerosol properties. A wide range of ε from 0.20 to 0.78 with a mean value of 0.43 was observed. Machine learning analysis shows that aerosol number concentration and hygroscopicity dominate the changes of ε in polluted continental stratiform clouds under weak vertical velocities (<0.5 m s−1) and low liquid water content (∼0.1 g m−3) conditions. Overall, the dispersion effect enhances the aerosol indirect effect by ∼11%. These results highlight the importance of aerosol properties in evaluating ACI in polluted environments."

Using long‐term observations from three mid‐latitude sites, we show that deep convection (DC) consistently enhances nighttime surface ozone and is often accompanied by modest increases in ultrafine particle concentrations. Within the BL, the condensational growth of these transported ultrafine particles may contribute up to 60% of total cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Mass flux calculations suggest that short‐lived convective cores (∼30 min) account for ∼2% of total vertical air mass transport relative to steady entrainment, increasing to ∼13% when the trailing stratiform regions are included. These results show that DC provides an episodic but efficient pathway linking the free troposphere and BL, influencing oxidant budgets, CCN variability, and climate forcing. Accurately representing this process in climate models may help reduce uncertainties in climate projections, under both preindustrial and present‐day conditions."

Yet observations indicate that intense substorms can also be directly driven, though the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. For the first time, global observations strongly indicate that substorm triggering is linked to enhanced dayside‐driven convection and Region 1 FAC, supported by simulations. At 17:17UT during the May 2024 superstorm, a shock‐compressed southward interplanetary magnetic field enhanced sunward convection and auroral currents. These rapidly extended to the nightside, initiating substorm expansion within 6 min. Simulations reproduce this response, revealing that dayside‐driven convection of closed field lines depleted nightside flux and thinned the current sheet. This lowered onset threshold and triggered substorm expansion with negligible flux loading. Following onset, nightside flux loading became significant as a reconnection X‐line formed near 10 Earth radii, extended azimuthally, and supported a global substorm current wedge."

The suitability of mangrove habitats depends strongly thier the water chemistry. Here, we show how global warming and rising atmospheric CO2 will reduce dissolved oxygen and increase CO2 in mangrove waters. Observations from 23 mangrove‐lined estuaries worldwide revealed that most sites already experience mild (34%–43% of the time) or severe (6%–32%) hypercapnic hypoxia, that is, high CO2 and low oxygen conditions. Hypercapnic hypoxia mostly occurs during low tide, at low‐salinity sites, and in warm tropical regions. Climate change will decrease oxygen concentrations by 5%–35% and increase CO2 concentrations by 8%–60% in mangrove waters by 2100. Overall, hypercapnic hypoxia events will occur more frequently, last longer, and become more severe. These shifts will reduce mangrove biodiversity and deteriorate habitat quality for commercially valuable fish. The strongest impact is expected in tropical developing countries."

Understanding how surface temperatures during such events are regulated by soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T) remains limited due to challenges in partitioning total evapotranspiration (ET). Here, high‐frequency turbulence methods are used to partition observed ET at 32 National Ecological Observatory Network sites across the contiguous United States. Heatwaves were defined as at least three consecutive days with daily maximum air temperature exceeding the site‐specific 90th percentile of the 2019–2021 record. Across 268 identified events, the T/ET ratio decreased by 32% ± 16% relative to the non‐heatwave baseline of 0.65, with greater reductions at lower biomass sites. The T/ET ratio was typically suppressed below non‐heatwave conditions during the early and middle stages of the heatwave (first two‐thirds of event duration), but was on average higher than non‐heatwave baseline levels during late stages (final third) due to extremely low soil evaporation. Of the studied heatwaves, 71% of these had surface temperatures above 38°C in their late stage; however, heatwaves sustaining higher evaporation fluxes (upper tertile of observed fluxes) during the late stage were associated with relative surface temperature anomalies that were on average 45% lower than those of heatwaves with lower evaporation fluxes (lower tertile). The commensurate surface cooling induced by higher transpiration was only 2% during heatwaves, suggesting that transpiration has a limited ability to mitigate extreme surface temperatures. This study allows for improved prediction of ecosystem feedbacks under extreme thermal stress."

There is a lack of studies focusing on antibiotic resistance in coral reef regions and environmental reservoirs in Central America. This study followed modified World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Tricycle Surveillance protocols for the environmental sector to address these gaps. Water samples were collected from key areas in the lower Belize River, including above and below the Belize City, an open fish market, and sewage lagoon outfall, and coral reefs. Water samples underwent qPCR analysis for a suite of antibiotic resistance gene classes (sul1, sul2, ermF, tetA, and blaSHV), intI1, and 16S rRNA. Additionally, a subset of samples were tested for extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL) E. coli and underwent shotgun sequencing. Results show that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were highest and most diverse near Belize City, particularly near the treatment lagoons and open fish market. The coral reef regions had lower levels of antibiotic resistance though not void of their presence. This study is an application of a modified Global Tricycle Surveillance protocol integrated with qPCR‐ and metagenomics‐based characterization of environmental antibiotic resistance in understudied areas. Notably, data from this study indicated that ESBL‐E. coli could potentially be used as a screening tool for environmental antibiotic resistance, as it was only present at sites that had the highest levels of ARGs."

Here the authors show with mouse models that tumor-derived Wnt ligands activate liver stromal fibroblasts to facilitate hyaluronan accumulation in the microenvironment, promoting gastric cancer liver metastasis. 
 The majority of gastric cancer cells proliferate in a Wnt ligand-dependent manner. To investigate this, we generated mice harboring Kras, Tgfbr2, and Trp53 (KTP) as well as with the same mutations plus Wnt1 expression (WKTP) in gastric mucosa. While KTP mice develop gastric metaplasia, WKTP mice develop dysplastic tumors, highlighting the role of ligand-dependent Wnt signaling in primary tumorigenesis. Organoids derived from WKTP mice form liver metastases following splenic transplantation, whereas KTP organoids do not. Notably, Apc disruption fails to induce metastasis of KTP cells, suggesting that stromal Wnt signaling promotes metastasis. Mechanistically, tumor-derived Wnt ligands cooperate with TGFβ signaling to induce Has2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to hyaluronan accumulation in the metastatic microenvironment. Strikingly, hyaluronidase expression in WKTP cells significantly suppresses liver metastasis. Here we show the critical role of ligand-dependent Wnt signaling and Has2-mediated hyaluronan deposition in metastasis, offering potential therapeutic strategy against gastric cancer metastasis.

 Anecdotal reports about smoking that might prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection inspire the search for nicotine and its pyrolysis products as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro). This effort leads to the discovery of 3-vinylpyridine as an MPro inhibitor. 3-Vinylpyridine resembles part of nirmatrelvir in binding to MPro but does not involve a critical interaction with residue E166, whose mutation has led to resistance to nirmatrelvir. Integration of the two molecules, followed by a medicinal chemistry campaign, produces several molecules with better in vitro potency than nirmatrelvir. Two lead molecules, YR-C-136 and SR-B-103, display better pharmacokinetic characteristics than nirmatrelvir in virus-challenged male mice and much better antiviral efficacy in virus-challenged female mice. Both molecules maintain high potency in inhibiting the nirmatrelvir-resistant MPro (E166V/L50F) variant. They also exhibit a broad and highly potent antiviral spectrum against most pathogenic coronaviruses. With high in vivo potency, both molecules are potentially standalone pan-antivirals for coronaviruses and may serve as countermeasures for future coronavirus outbreaks. Here the authors identify nicotine-derived inhibitors of the SARS-CoV−2 main protease that outperform Paxlovid in cells and mice, remain effective against resistant variants, and show broad activity against multiple human coronaviruses."

Here the authors show distinct timing between caudal orbitofrontal and cingulate signals, that orbitofrontal stimulation increases avoidance, and that physiological responses mirror behavior. 
 Mood disorders are associated with complex disruptions in brain networks, including those associated with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). Differential functions of these regions, especially the functions of the far-caudal OFC, are incompletely understood. We trained macaques to perform an approach-avoidance task and recorded cOFC and pACC neuronal activity and autonomic/somatic responses during performance, including during electrical microstimulation (EMS) of the cOFC. The cOFC was sensitive to both positive and negative stimuli, whereas the pACC was significantly more active during aversive outcomes. cOFC EMS increased avoidance, suggesting a causal cOFC function in cost-benefit decision-making. The cOFC activity led pACC activity during the decision period, supporting cOFC network prominence. Autonomic and somatic responses were positively correlated with behavioral patterns, consistent with a coordinated body-brain involvement during emotionally significant decision-making. We suggest that dysfunction of this network could potentially contribute to the etiology of mood disorders. The roles of orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex in emotional decisions remain unclear.

 Conventional storage and retrieval of nucleic acid specimens, particularly unstable RNA, rely on costly cold-chain infrastructure and inefficient robotic handling, inhibiting large-scale nucleic acid archives needed for global genomic biobanking. We introduce a scalable room-temperature storage system with minimal physical footprint that enables database-like queries on encapsulated, barcoded, and pooled nucleic acid samples. Queries incorporate numerical ranges, categorical filters, and combinations thereof, advancing beyond previous demonstrations of single-sample retrieval or Boolean classifiers. We evaluate this system on ninety-six mock SARS-CoV-2 genomic samples barcoded with theoretical patient data including age, location, and diagnostic state, demonstrating rapid, scalable retrieval. We further demonstrate storage and sequencing of human patient-derived nucleic acid samples, illustrating applicability to clinical genomic analysis. By avoiding freezer-based storage and retrieval, this approach scales to millions of samples without loss of fidelity or throughput, enabling large-scale pathogen and genomic repositories in under-resourced or isolated regions of the US and worldwide.

Here, the authors identify stable sites whose disruption is linked to blood cancers, aging, and cardiovascular risk. 
 The abundance, dynamics, and context-dependent heterogeneity of DNA methylation, where a pattern considered abnormal in one cell type may be normal in another, complicate the identification of early methylation changes that drive or signal disease development. This complexity can obscure early markers of increased disease risk, making it challenging to detect and intervene in disease processes at their inception. Here, we report 31,744 CpG loci exhibiting highly consistent methylation profiles in the blood of young, healthy individuals. We assess alterations at these epigenetically stable loci in 8,886 individuals across 29 diverse cohorts, including those with hematological cancers (n = 3159), cardiovascular complications (n = 2788), and healthy controls (n = 2939). Our findings reveal methylation pattern disruption in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, correlating with clonal burden dynamics and mutation frequency throughout leukemia treatment. In non-cancer cohorts, we observe that methylation levels at epigenetically stable loci become increasingly variable with age, a shift linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk and lower survival rates. This study highlights DNA methylation instability as a blood-based biomarker for both hematological cancer and cardiovascular disease and uncovers a mechanistic link between methylation dynamics and the expansion of maladaptive hematopoietic clones.

 Fast atmospheric particulate nitrate and sulfate formation under high-humidity conditions has been extensively observed; however, the underlying chemical mechanisms and their relative contributions remain poorly understood. This study examined the characteristic high-humidity events (HHEs) in southern China during spring, providing field observation evidence for the crucial role of NO2-driven multiphase reactions in particulate nitrate and sulfate formation. Our findings revealed efficient nitrate formation during early HHEs, likely facilitated by enhanced NO2 uptake via disproportionation reaction. As humidity increased and fog formed, S(IV) oxidation competitively consumed NO2 and N(III), causing rapid sulfate formation. The resulting N(III), produced from the oxidation of S(IV) by NO2 (aq), further oxidizes S(IV) effectively in droplets due to its slow liquid-gas mass transfer rate. A state-of-the-art multiphase box model demonstrated that NO2 uptake and SO2 oxidation by NO2/N(III) represent dominant formation pathways during HHEs, accounting for 45.4% and 63.6% of the total nitrate and sulfate production, respectively. These results highlight the critical importance of NO2-driven multiphase chemistry in particulate pollution under high-humidity environments."

 The Arctic-Boreal region is vulnerable to rapid climate change. Thawing of the permafrost and extended warm periods are expected to turn the region into a hotspot of enhanced CH4 emissions. We estimated CH4 fluxes by assimilating atmospheric CH4 mixing ratio data from a regional network into a global atmospheric inverse model, resulting in a mean uncertainty reduction of ~68% across the domain and improved agreement with observations. From 2010 to 2021, the Arctic-Boreal region emitted 45.4 ± 0.7 TgCH4 y−1 ( ~ 7% of global emissions), with no significant overall trend. However, on the regional scale a positive trend emerged in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Arctic-Boreal wetland emissions increased during warmer years, suggesting possible future increases as warming continues. Emissions varied regionally, with western Russia showing higher fluxes. Changes in winter hydroclimate significantly influenced emissions in the Western Siberian Lowlands, likely by enhancing the availability of soil moisture through snowmelt in spring. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for both temperature effects and changes in wetness, when assessing Arctic CH4 future emissions."

 Understanding near-trench interseismic deformation at subduction zones is crucial for assessing the hazards of giant earthquakes, especially trench-breaking tsunamigenic earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. However, interseismic locking preceding such trench-breaking tsunamigenic events remain poorly constrained due to the limited sensitivity of onshore geodetic observations. Here, we present seafloor geodetic observations along the southwestern Kuril trench, a region with the potential for large coseismic ruptures reaching the trench, as inferred from historical tsunami records. Our results show high slip-deficit rates near the trench during 2019–2024 and suggest that a slip deficit of 20.5–30.0 m may have accumulated over the past ~400 years, considering the long-term low seismic activity in this region. These findings imply future recurrence of a megathrust earthquake (Mw ~8.8) with rupture reaching the Kuril trench. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of seafloor geodetic monitoring for seismic and tsunami hazard assessment at subduction zones.

 The cause of mare asymmetry between the lunar nearside and farside remains a long-lasting conundrum. Due to scarcity of directly sourced deep samples, the formation mechanism of this phenomenon has not been well constrained. Here we characterized a class of rare impact glass beads with extremely high TiO2 (16–25 wt%) and FeO (25–35 wt%) in the Chang’e-5 regolith. Petrological modeling indicates that the precursor rock of these glass beads cannot be formed through normal magmatic evolution, but rather has a deeper mantle origin. Phase diagram calculations show that the precursor rock has a typical mineral assemblage similar to ilmenite-bearing cumulates. Based on different residual anorthite proportions, the restored Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) original crystalline mineral assemblage is predicted to contain ~15–20 vol% ilmenite, significantly higher than the average predicted levels. Therefore, the nearside ilmenite-bearing cumulates may have higher ilmenite abundance than farside, causing increased partial melting and more abundant volcanism. Lunar mare asymmetry could be explained by a higher nearside ilmenite content which would cause increased partial melting and volcanism relative to the farside, according to observations and petrological modelling of high-Ti glass impact beads in Chang’e-5 samples."

 Long-term monitoring of urban infrastructure deformation is critical for city safety. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) enables precise layover scatterer separation via elevation-based imaging, serving as a key tool for urban monitoring. However, traditional TomoSAR methods are inefficient for new time periods due to repetitive computations and complex inversion algorithms, failing to meet rapid monitoring demands. This study proposes a dynamic inheritance-enhanced TomoSAR Imaging method using dual-task deep learning model. First, a dynamic scatterer sample set is constructed for new periods by efficiently screening and inheriting historical scatterer classes and elevation parameters. Next, the DT-TomoSARNet network is developed to simultaneously perform scatterer classification and elevation regression through a dual-task collaborative mechanism, optimized by a hybrid loss function that adaptively adjusts task weights. Finally, the Historical-constrained-BF algorithm leverages historical data constraints to rapidly update large-scale linear deformation velocities and thermal amplitudes. Experiments using 2015–2024 COSMO-SkyMed long time-series data from Shenzhen City demonstrate that the proposed method effectively inherits historical parameters, achieving a maximum weighted F1-score of 0.97 and a minimum average absolute error of 1.438 m in scatterer classification and elevation regression tasks. Furthermore, the global processing time is reduced to just one-sixth of that required by the traditional BF method, while maintaining high accuracy in physical parameter estimation. This method significantly enhances the applicability of TomoSAR for long-term dynamic urban deformation monitoring."

 Accurate delineation and mapping of forest burned areas (FBAs) are critical for assessing fire-induced ecological effects and informing post-fire management strategies. Although medium-resolution sensors (10–30 m) have advanced FBA detection, such detection at a finer spatial resolution remains challenging due to various confounding factors like cloud/terrain shadows and phenology-induced spectral confusions. To mitigate these false alarms, an accurate detection framework was developed, integrating active fire (AF) data with Sentinel-2 multi-temporal imagery. Potential candidates are identified using optimized spectral features across single- and dual-temporal scales. These candidates are subsequently refined by synergizing AF data and the novel smoothed Enhanced Burned Area Index (EBAI) imagery to enhance detection sensitivity. The EBAI leverages the temporal-spectral variations of FBAs, characterized by abrupt deviations from pre-fire reflectance and short-term post-fire anomalies, to highlight burned signals and suppress false alarms. Applied to the Amur River Basin, we generated the first 10-m resolution monthly FBA product (ARB_FBA) for 2020–2023. Validation with independent reference units demonstrated low commission errors (7.65–8.46%), low omission errors (9.43–13.02%), and high Dice coefficients (89.94–91.21%). ARB_FBA outperformed global products (GABAM, FireCCI51, and MCD64A1) by delivering more accurate, detailed, and extensive burned areas. Results indicated marked fluctuations in FBA, ranging from a minimum of 3.83 × 105 ha in 2021 to a peak of 1.08 × 106 ha in 2023. The 2023 surge was associated with record-breaking heatwaves and forest management deficiencies, while areal peaks confirmed spring (March to May) as the highest-risk period.

We extracted and incubated ambient PM2.5 samples in simulated lung fluids (SLFs) modeling extracellular healthy lung fluid (modified Gamble's solution, MGS) versus intracellular acidic lung fluid (artificial lysosomal fluid, ALF). Organic compounds and microorganisms were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. The results show fluid-dependent bioaccessibility and changes: seven most abundant organic compounds (e.g. malic acid) are exclusively bioaccessible in MGS, whereas four organics (e.g. 4-nitrophenol) are bioaccessible only in ALF. High-risk toxins like nicotine, skatole, and N,N-dimethylacetamide show high bioavailability in both fluids. While ALF extracts minimal microorganisms, MGS exhibits higher release for some pathogens including Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Acinetobacter. After 96-h cultivation, MGS exhibits greater compositional shifts in both organic compounds (carboxylic acids, amine compounds, and pyridines) and microbiota (ten different genera including Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas) than ALF, owing to more pronounced microbial activities in neutral pH. In MGS, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were positively associated with carboxylic acids, amines, and aromatics, indicating putative microbe–organic interactions that require mechanistic confirmation. These fluid-specific patterns suggest that identical PM2.5 exposure may yield different health impacts from pollutants and microorganisms depending on an individual's pulmonary microenvironment. This study underscores the importance of incorporating bioaccessibility into PM2.5 risk assessments."

 Ozone (O3) pollution in eastern China has been worsening in recent years despite the implementation of effective control measures. Reactive chlorine plays a key role in regulating O3 formation by modulating atmospheric oxidative capacity. However, its impact on O3 formation in the context of land-sea interaction and long-range transport has not been fully explored in eastern China. In this study, we combined a chemical transport model (CTM) with meteorological and O3 observations, as well as backward trajectory analyses, to identify a typical long-range O3 transport episode in eastern China in autumn 2018. Three representative cities—Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Shenzhen—experienced significant regional transport impacts. During the typical transport episode, chlorine emissions aggravated O3 pollution, with peak increases exceeding 10, 12, and 8 μg m−3 in Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Shenzhen, respectively. Marine-derived chlorine dominated this contribution, accounting for 55.8%, 63.3%, 69.5% of the total chlorine impact in the above three cities. These findings highlight the critical role of chlorine emissions, particularly from marine sources, in enhancing coastal O3 levels."

 Although smaller particles are considered more harmful to human health, the need for independent management of PM1.0 remains debated. In this study, PM2.5 and PM1.0 samples were collected for 15–20 days per season during 2020–2021 at an urban site in Seoul (SE) and a background site on Baengnyeong Island (BN), South Korea, to monitor PAHs and metals. Both sites showed higher Σ13 PAH concentrations in winter (SE: 12.6 for PM2.5 and 9.59 for PM1.0; BN: 9.37 and 5.58 ng/m3), while Σ10 metal concentrations increased in winter (SE: 769 and 373; BN: 660 and 340 ng/m3) and fall (SE: 503 and 248, BN: 403 and 223 ng/m3). Backward trajectory analysis identified northeastern and northern China and North Korea as major source regions. BN frequently experienced CHMs episodes associated with air masses transported from North Korea. SHAP results revealed that seasonal variables were primary drivers of CPAHs, whereas particle size was the dominant factor influencing CHMs. Cancer risk associated with PAHs was higher at SE (6.7 × 10−8 and 4.7 × 10−8), whereas that from heavy metals was higher at BN (1.0 × 10−5 and 5.6 × 10−6). Risk normalized by PM mass was significantly higher for PM2.5, indicating a more efficient enrichment of PAHs and heavy metals in the PM1.0-2.5 fraction. PAH sources were similar across sites and particle sizes, while metal sources varied with particle size and meteorological conditions. Overall, enhancing the current PM2.5-based management framework by incorporating PM1.0 characteristics is recommended to better protect human health risks."

 The vertical airflow velocity directly governs the growth and development of clouds. Accurately retrieving this velocity represents one of the pivotal and challenging aspects in cloud dynamics research. Unfortunately, no existing method can precisely retrieve the continuous vertical airflow velocity within clouds. To tackle this problem, this study assesses the feasibility of employing particles at the left end of the power spectrum as tracer particles by incorporating the intensity and critical threshold of tracer spectral points. Through an analysis of the impacts of turbulence, wind shear, and beam width on particles in various phases, the spectral width threshold is further established. Ultimately, the applicable conditions for the small particle tracing method are clearly defined. Additionally, based on power spectrum skewness and temperature, a method for retrieving vertical airflow velocity through spectral separation in a bimodal structure is proposed. The combination of these two methods can overcome the limitations inherent in single retrieval method and yield the vertical airflow velocity within the cloud's vertical structure under specific conditions."

 This research highlights the role of the summertime southward intrusion of the Siberian air mass in intensifying extreme precipitation over East Asia. We identify a recurrent cold-core anticyclone over Siberia termed the Summer Siberian High (SSH) and define its southward expansion as the Summer Cold Surge (SCS). Our analysis reveals that the frequency of SCS events has nearly doubled since the early 2000s. This increase is attributed to a regime shift in the precursor circulation, characterized by the intensification of thermally enhanced, quasi-stationary anticyclones over the Ural Mountains. Dynamically analogous to the winter cold surge, the SCS transports cold and dry air into East Asia. The interaction between this cold intrusion and the warm, moist flow from the Western North Pacific Subtropical High enhances low-level baroclinicity and frontal convergence, thereby intensifying heavy rainfall. These findings underscore the growing climatological importance of high-latitude systems during summer and suggest that understanding SCS dynamics is crucial for predicting extreme precipitation in a warming climate."

 As one of the prominent oceanic regions exhibiting high interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST), the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans have been found to exert strong impacts on January–February-March (JFM) rainfall in southern Tanzania. The JFM rainfall is found to be significantly linked to the subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole (SIOD)-like SST pattern over the southern Indian Ocean and southern Atlantic Ocean Tripole (SAOT)-like SST structure over the southern Atlantic Ocean. This relationship is linearly independent of the effects of El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean dipole. The presence of a weakened Mascarene high associated with the negative SIOD phase leads to southerly wind anomalies across the Mozambique Channel, which enhances moisture transport into southern Tanzania and rainfall over the region. The SAOT, on the other hand, excites a zonal elongated wave train-like pattern that induces large-scale cyclonic circulation over the southern Indian Ocean. Subsequently, the western flank of the cyclonic circulation excites southerly wind anomalies traversing through the Mozambique Channel towards the study region, leading to rainfall over the study region. Moreover, the observed wave train-like pattern is echoed in the upper levels, but the anticyclonic center over southern Australia expands further towards northern Madagascar. At this position, the associated anticyclonic wind anomalies reach southern Tanzania to create a divergence condition, enhancing rainfall conditions. Finally, the joint SIOD and SAOT indices show enhanced contribution to the rainfall, explaining about 28% of rainfall variability."

 Sea fog is a hazardous weather phenomenon that poses significant risks to maritime operations. To describe its dynamic morphological evolution, this study introduces the concept of fog shaping—a process governed by cloud liquid water (CLW) advection coupled with thermodynamic transport. Using both idealized and real-case numerical simulations, we examine the role of CLW advection in driving fog shaping over the Yellow Sea. A key finding in idealized simulations is that CLW advection contributes 61%–93% of the total effect under horizontally uniform sea surface temperature, strongly promoting downwind fog propagation. This process is further enhanced by cold-air advection to accelerate spatial expansion. Based on these results, we propose a conceptual framework in which fog shaping is governed by the balance between advective transport (CLW/cold-air advection) and local thermodynamic processes (turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, microphysical phase transitions). The framework distinguishes three shaping patterns: rapid downwind expansion (Type-A), quasi-translational motion (Type-B), and bidirectional development (Type-C). Three-dimensional simulations of two real events validate the framework. The 25 March 2018 case shows rapid northern expansion (Type-A) driven by dominant CLW advection. For the 10 May 2018 case, one experiment reveals that quasi-translational motion (Type-B) resulting from a quasi-equilibrium between advective removal and local CLW generation, while another exhibits bidirectional development (Type-C) due to a surplus of local upwind generation combined with dominant downwind CLW advection. These results underscore the critical role of CLW advection in fog shaping."
