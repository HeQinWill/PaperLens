10.1088/1748-9326/ade45e,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究德国家庭对节约用水的态度以及对各种节水政策的看法。研究方法是通过在大型调查中嵌入随机信息处理，来评估信息对人们节水态度和政策接受度的影响。研究结果表明，受访者普遍对节约用水持积极态度，并且认为自己比周围的人更关心节水问题。此外，大多数受访者接受对用水大户提高水价等节水政策，但不接受智能水价和频繁涨价。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Manuel Frondel;Delia Niehues;Valerie Peetz;Stephan Sommer;Lukas Tomberg,Attitudes toward water conservation: evidence from a large sample of households in Germany,"Based on randomized information treatments that were embedded in a large survey among more than 6000 single-family homeowners from Germany, we investigate the malleability of attitudes toward water conservation and a variety of conservation policies. The empirical results indicate that respondents generally have a positive attitude toward water conservation. Information treatments that included balanced or negatively biased information about the necessity of water conservation only moderately reduced this positive attitude. In addition, we find that respondents attribute a higher level of concern for water conservation to themselves than to people in their personal environment and the population in general. Conservation policies, such as price increases for heavy consumers, are accepted by the majority of respondents and perceived as fair, whereas smart water tariffs and frequent price increases are largely rejected."

These events are closely linked to low soil moisture (SM) and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and have significant impacts on the Amazon ecosystem. In this study, we examine CDHW and concurrent low-SM/high-VPD events in the Amazon from 1981 to 2024, with a particular focus on the record-breaking drought of 2023–2024. Our findings reveal that CDHW events generally coincide with low-SM/high-VPD conditions, with most occurring during the well-documented droughts of 1983, 1997–1998, 2010, 2015–2016, and 2023–2024. The 2023–2024 period stands out with a record-high number of compound events and the most extensive coverage, with CDHW and low-SM/high-VPD conditions affecting 50% of the Amazon region during the austral springs of 2023 and 2024. The results also indicate that both CDHW and low-SM/high-VPD events have become more frequent, prolonged, and widespread in the Amazon since 2000. The Mann–Kendall tests also reveal an increasing trend of +0.5 events per year for CDHW and +0.6 for low-SM/high-VPD. Additionally, our findings highlight that the 2023–2024 period is not only marked by record-breaking CDHW events but also by unprecedented concurrent low-SM/high-VPD conditions."

Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as a promising technique to improve traditional forecasts based on chemistry-transport models (CTMs). However, challenges remain in (1) representing the complex physics of the PM2.5 pollution processes including the emission, transport, and chemical conversion of the pollutants, and (2) probing the interpretability of DL models for trustworthy forecasts and mitigations. Here we learn U-Net deep networks from a reanalysis dataset—the data fusion information by blending available pollutant observations and CTM simulations in China—to represent the best available physics of PM2.5 pollution in this region, and then assess this representation using interpretability methods. This hybridization between CTM and U-Net results in robust improvements by over 30% against the baseline CTM forecasts in root mean square error over 1391 stations of the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre network. Interpretability analysis demonstrates physical consistency, manifesting the roles of wind fields and precursor pollutants in modulating PM2.5 concentration variations through dispersion and chemical processes. A decline in the emission importance from 2013 to 2020 suggests the potential of the deep networks to capture the evolving PM2.5 pollution processes and growing emission uncertainties under China’s continuous significant emission reduction in this period. Such a combination of learning of physics and interpretability analysis is valuable for PM2.5 forecasts that are accurate yet trustworthy for effective pollution mitigation."

The concept of compound events has gained increasing attention in recent literature, offering opportunities to enhance disaster understanding, while also presenting challenges and open issues for modern risk assessment frameworks. This study investigates the capability of existing disasters/extreme events databases (Emergency Events Database EM-DAT, Severe Weather Data Inventory SWDI, and Canadian Disaster Database CDD) to capture compound event dynamics, and assess the accuracy of reported impacts. We found that SWDI, a national dataset for the USA, reports a high number of compound events versus single events, always higher than 50%, except for wildfires, and its structure allows for accurately identify spatially compounding events. This percentage in EM-DAT, a global dataset, is always lower than 50%, except for storms. A good match in events occurrences can be observed between the three databases, however the agreement in terms of deaths and injures varies depending on the databases compared. Finally, the work highlights the limitations of existing databases in representing the multidimensional nature of risks, and the cascading impacts that emerge from compound hazards. Reclassifying disasters from a compound event perspective not only enriches our knowledge of hazard dynamics, but also provides actionable pathways for improving risk assessment, informing adaptive policies, and enhancing resilience to the growing complexity of environmental challenges."

Norway’s strong EV supporting policies has led to an explosion of EVs and reduced direct emissions, but with rural-urban differences and undocumented upstream impacts. We investigated how the material composition and life cycle GHG emissions of Norwegian vehicles have evolved between 2000 and 2023 by integrating spatiotemporal vehicle data with a vehicle life cycle assessment model. The average life cycle GHG emissions per vehicle-km (vkm) of a newly registered car have significantly decreased (−49% since 2000) thanks to the decrease in use phase emissions (−89% since 2000). However, component-related emissions have increased (+81% since 2000) due to electrification and a trend towards large vehicles. Changes in the fleet are slow: EVs constituted 24% of the stock in 2023 and average life cycle GHG emissions per vkm have barely declined (−8% since 2000). EVs are concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas, while remote areas have few EVs, illustrating the unequal spatial distribution of electric mobility. Our study highlights the challenges related to EV penetration and emphasizes the need to expand to additional indicators beyond direct GHG emissions for a comprehensive understanding of EVs’ role in climate change mitigation."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade8ff,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注极端天气事件对森林生态系统碳循环的影响，特别是干旱和高温复合事件如何降低生态系统的碳吸收能力和恢复能力。研究通过分析欧洲多个站点的碳通量数据，发现生态系统的持续性与水文条件密切相关，极端天气事件会导致生态系统持续性的下降，表明生态系统受到了胁迫。这项研究侧重于生态系统对气候变化的响应，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon flux', 'net ecosystem exchange (NEE)', 'forest ecosystems', 'drought', 'heatwaves', 'soil moisture']",Tristan K E Williams;Álvaro Moreno Martínez;Francesco Martinuzzi;Miguel D Mahecha;Gustau Camps-Valls,Sub-seasonal forest carbon dynamics lose persistence under extremes,"Extreme weather events pose a growing threat to the stability of terrestrial ecosystems, and understanding how ecosystems respond remains a critical challenge. This study explores how extreme weather conditions affect the persistence of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in forest ecosystems. Using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, we quantify persistence and assess changes in carbon flux stability under stress. By analysing high-frequency carbon flux data across multiple European sites, we reveal that ecosystem persistence is tightly linked to hydrological conditions, particularly soil moisture. Moreover, we show that large drops in persistence can signal periods of ecosystem stress. Our findings show that drought–heat compound events can diminish resilience and prolong recovery times, with temperate and boreal forests lacking heat or drought adaptations emerging as especially vulnerable. Furthermore, these stress pulses alter carbon dynamics long after the event, suggesting physiological damage that heightens sensitivity to future weather fluctuations. Overall, identifying changes in persistence could signal potential ecological destabilisation, providing key insights into how terrestrial ecosystems might cope with intensifying climate extremes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade900,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是海洋脱氧现象以及通过二氧化碳移除（CDR）技术对海洋氧气含量的影响。虽然与大气中的二氧化碳浓度有关，但其重点在于海洋环境而非大气环境的直接遥感监测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）的关联性不强。,[],Estela A Monteiro;David P Keller;James R Christian;Jasmin G John;Michio Kawamiya;Roland Séférian;Jerry Tjiputra;Andrew Wiltshire;Andreas Oschlies,Degrees of reversibility of ocean deoxygenation in an atmospheric carbon dioxide removal scenario,"Over the last century, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, among other greenhouse gases, and resulting climate change have greatly impacted the ocean. Observed impacts include lower oxygen solubility and changes in ocean stratification, circulation and biological activity. To reduce the carbon burden in the atmosphere in the future and thereby mitigate anthropogenic climate change, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques have been increasingly studied and tested. However, information on the impact of CDR on oceanic oxygen is still scarce. In the current study we explore dissolved oxygen responses from an idealized CDR implementation, with atmospheric CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down simulations following the CDR model intercomparison project protocol. We find that over the timescale of a few centuries, the degree of recovery of marine oxygen, after atmospheric CO2 has returned to pre-industrial levels, differs for different water depths. Oxygen concentrations strongly recover in the upper ocean, achieving a near reversibility within 97%–99% across models, and even overshoot pre-industrial levels at depths of 100–600 m. Conversely, oxygen responses show a long-lasting deoxygenation signal in the deep ocean, with a much smaller initial recovery signal by the end of the experiment. The main factor driving oxygen changes in the deep ocean is indicated by the apparent oxygen utilization, related to changes in circulation and ventilation, as inferred by the simulated age of deep water masses. According to our models and despite the effective recovery of oxygen in the upper ocean, the effects of time lags and hysteresis on deep ocean responses could lead to longstanding and deleterious impacts on redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes and on marine biota throughout the ocean."
10.1088/1748-9326/adeb9d,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是碳移除（CDR）策略在不同时间尺度上的气候效应权衡，以湿地恢复为例进行了案例研究。论文评估了湿地恢复在移除二氧化碳的同时，可能增加甲烷排放所带来的短期和长期气候影响。研究比较了不同的气候影响评估方法，包括全球增温潜势（GWP）和技术增温潜势（TWP），旨在揭示CDR措施可能存在的潜在气候权衡。虽然涉及到了大气成分（二氧化碳、甲烷），但其重点在于气候影响评估和策略比较，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'climate change', 'wetland restoration', 'methane emissions', 'global warming potential']",Stavroula S Sartzetakis;Tianyi Sun;Yangyang Xu;Emily A Ury;Ilissa B Ocko;Brian Buma,Evaluating temporal trade-offs in climate effects from carbon dioxide removal strategies across different metrics: a case study on wetland restoration,"Strategies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, known as carbon dioxide removal (CDR), are being pursued given the urgency of climate change. However, CDR measures may unintentionally increase emissions of other climate forcers. If emissions of potent short-lived climate forcers (like methane) are increased, the CDR mechanism could potentially worsen climate change in the near-term despite benefiting the climate in the long-term. This temporal trade-off can be easily overlooked when employing the standard climate metric used for assessments— carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) using a 100 year global warming potential (GWP)—because it solely conveys the long-term warming impacts of a pulse of emissions. A more sophisticated assessment method is needed to reveal potential temporal trade-offs in climate benefits—important information for effective decision making. In this study, we compare three climate impact assessment approaches of increasing complexity to evaluate temporal trade-offs in climate benefits from CDR strategies: (1) the standard CO2e using GWP approach with both 20 and 100 year time horizons (GWP20 and GWP100, respectively, or dual-valued CO2e); (2) a variation of GWP that considers the climate impact of continuous emissions over time (known as technology warming potential (TWP); and (3) reduced complexity climate models. We use wetland restoration as a case study because studies have shown that it may remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while also increasing methane emissions. Analyzing eleven rewetting scenarios, we find that all approaches identify temporal tradeoffs. The TWP and reduced complexity climate model results are largely consistent and reveal drawbacks of the dual-valued CO2e that considers pulse rather than continuous emissions. Given the accessibility of the TWP approach relative to reduced complexity climate models, we recommend its use for most stakeholders. Overall, our findings emphasize the need to thoroughly assess potential climate trade-offs of CDR measures across all timescales."

However, traditional linear correlation methods are insufficient for capturing reliable causal linkages, making causal discovery algorithms a more appropriate solution. Causal effect measures suggest that tropical climate anomalies exert strong driving and mediating influences during boreal summer, while the Asian climate anomalies exhibit greater sensitivity. Causal analysis identifies seven direct drivers of MLYR precipitation: pressure anomalies over northwest Pacific, Northeast Asia, mid-latitude eastern Pacific, Ural Mountains, southwest Pacific, Scandinavia and Greenland. Additionally, we uncovered the further causal pathways linking MLYR precipitation with tropical Pacific and Antarctic Oscillation signals. These results identify the detailed mediations through the direct drivers of MLYR precipitation, which are crucial to capture its remote precursors. Our findings reveal the physical attributions of MLYR precipitation from the global climate, which may improve its operational prediction skills, and even broaden the precursors of East Asian summer monsoon."

Satheesh;Krishnaswamy Krishna Moorthy,Australian bushfire emissions result in enhanced polar stratospheric clouds,"We study the impact of the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires on stratospheric chemistry and polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) dynamics. Our results show that the stratospheric intrusion of bushfire aerosols significantly increases nitric acid in the lower stratosphere, thereby increasing the PSC volume during the Austral winter. Notably, rapid ice PSC nucleation on nitric acid trihydrate particles leads to unusually high ice PSC volumes, highlighting the response of PSCs to an enhanced stratospheric aerosol scenario. 
 Extreme bushfire events amplify climate change by emitting greenhouse gases and destroying carbon sinks. They also cause economic damage, through property destruction, and even fatalities. One such bushfire occurred in Australia in 2019–2020, and this event injected large amounts of aerosols and gases into the stratosphere and depleted the ozone layer. While previous studies have focused on the drivers behind ozone depletion, the bushfire impact on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), a paramount factor in ozone depletion, has not been extensively investigated so far. Therefore, this study focuses on the effects of bushfire aerosols on the dynamics and stratospheric chemistry related to PSC formation and its pathways. An analysis from Aura's Microwave Limb Sounder revealed that the enhanced hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide significantly increased nitric acid (HNO3) in the high-latitude lower stratosphere in early 2020. This resulted in an anomalously high areal coverage of PSCs with ice, exceeding 3 standard deviations with respect to background period. Based on Lagrangian backward-trajectory analysis, we find that a predominant fraction (79 %) of the liquid–nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) mixture formed via the ice-free nucleation pathway. These NAT particles subsequently acted as nuclei for ice formation, accounting for 95 % of the observed ice PSCs. This rapid conversion from NAT to ice likely contributed to the strong positive anomaly in ice PSC. This highlights the primary formation pathways of ice and liquid–NAT mixtures and possibly helps us to simulate PSC formation and denitrification process better in climate models. These findings will contribute significantly to a deeper understanding of the impacts of extreme wildfire events on stratospheric chemistry and PSC dynamics."

The time variability of tropospheric ozone is mainly driven by anthropogenic emissions. In this paper, we study the distribution and time variability of ozone from harmonized ground-based observations from five different measurement techniques. Our findings provide clear standard references for atmospheric models and evolving tropospheric ozone satellite data for the 2000–2022 period. 
 Tropospheric ozone trends from models and satellites are found to diverge. Ground-based (GB) observations are used to reference models and satellites, but GB data themselves might display station biases and discontinuities. Reprocessing with uniform procedures, the TOAR-II working group Harmonization and Evaluation of Ground-based Instruments for Free-Tropospheric Ozone Measurements (HEGIFTOM) homogenized public data from five networks: ozonesondes, In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) profiles, solar absorption Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer measurements, lidar observations, and Dobson Umkehr data. Amounts and uncertainties for total tropospheric ozone (TrOC; surface to 300 hPa), as well as free- and lower-tropospheric ozone, are calculated for each network. We report trends (2000 to 2022) for these segments using quantile regression (QR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) for 55 datasets, including six multi-instrument stations. The findings are that (1) median TrOC trends computed with QR and MLR trends are essentially the same; (2) pole-to-pole, across all longitudes, TrOC trends fall within +3 to −3 ppbv per decade, equivalent to (−4 % to +8 %) per decade depending on site; (3) the greatest fractional increases occur over most tropical and subtropical sites, with decreases at northern high latitudes, but these patterns are not uniform; (4) post-COVID trends are smaller than pre-COVID trends for Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude sites. In summary, this analysis conducted in the frame of TOAR-II/HEGIFTOM shows that high-quality, multi-instrument, harmonized data over a wide range of ground sites provide clear standard references for TOAR-II models and evolving tropospheric ozone satellite products for 2000–2022."

Fry,Development and validation of a NOx+ ratio method for the quantitative separation of inorganic and organic nitrate aerosol using a unit-mass-resolution time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor equipped with a capture vaporizer (CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM),"It is of increasing importance to monitor nitrate pollution that can harm ecosystems. However, commonly used aerosol monitoring equipment cannot distinguish inorganic from organic forms of nitrate, which may have different consequences for the environment. We describe a method to differentiate types of nitrates that can be applied to ambient monitoring to improve understanding of its formation and impact. 
 Particulate nitrate is a major component of ambient aerosol around the world, present in inorganic form, mainly as ammonium nitrate, and also as organic nitrate. It is of increasing importance to monitor ambient particulate nitrate, a reservoir of urban nitrogen oxides that can be transported downwind and harm ecosystems. The unit-mass-resolution time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor equipped with capture vaporizer (CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM) is designed to quantitatively monitor ambient PM2.5 composition. In this paper, we describe a method for separating the organic and ammonium nitrate components measured by CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM based on evaluating the NO2+/NO+ ratio (NOx+ ratio). This method includes modifying the ACSM fragmentation table, time averaging, and data filtering. By using the measured NOx+ ratio of NH4NO3 and a plausible range of NOx+ ratio for organic nitrate aerosol, the measured particulate nitrate can be split into inorganic and organic fractions. Data pre-treatment filters concentrations of particulate nitrate below 0.6–2.0 µg m−3, depending on the time averaging. The method detection limit, when considering ±10 % absolute uncertainty of organic nitrate fraction, is found to be 2 µg m−3 (120 min averaging) to 10 µg m−3 (10 min averaging) for total particulate nitrate concentration and 10 % (120 min) to 20 % (10 min) for organic nitrate fraction. We show that this method is able to distinguish periods with inorganic or organic nitrate as major components at a rural site in the Netherlands. A comparison to a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer equipped with a standard vaporizer (SV-HR-ToF-AMS) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) method shows similar response of increasing particulate organic nitrate fraction with uncertainties mainly from sensitivity to fragmentation table correction when obtaining the NO2+ signal. We propose that researchers use this NOx+ ratio method for CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM (adapting the appropriate fragmentation table and data pre-treatment for each specific application) to quantify the particulate organic nitrate fraction at existing monitoring sites in order to improve understanding of nitrate formation and speciation."

 A novel reference absorption instrument based on photothermal interferometry – the dual-wavelength photothermal aerosol absorption monitor PTAAM-2λ – and scattering measurements are used to characterize filter photometer artifacts in measurements of absorption coefficients of soot- and dust-dominated aerosol samples within laboratory and ambient campaigns. We provide, for different aerosol types, reference values of the multiple-scattering parameter, quantifying the artifact introduced by the interaction between the light, the particles, and the filter.The Aethalometer AE33 and the Continuous Light Absorption Photometer (CLAP) were characterized during a laboratory campaign where different soot and mineral dust samples were measured. Furthermore, ambient measurements during a campaign in Granada, Spain, were used to characterize the AE33 and MAAP (Multiangle Absorption Photometer), a pseudo-reference absorption instrument.The laboratory campaign showed significant wavelength dependence of the calibration parameter, the multiple-scattering parameter C. The C of the AE33 at 450 and 808 nm was 4.08 and 3.95 and 6.25 and 5.27 for propane soot and diesel soot, respectively. For the CLAP, the C was 5.10 and 4.26 and 6.79 and 5.80 for propane and diesel soot, respectively. For the different mineral dust samples analyzed in the laboratory, the C at 450 nm ranged between 2.74 and 3.03 for the AE33 and between 2.50 and 2.80 for the CLAP. The ambient measurements at Granada showed an overall C of 4.72 at 450 nm and of 3.90 at 808 nm for the AE33. The results for both the AE33 and the CLAP show a dependence with the particle size, with fine particles having the highest C values and with the C being reduced and leveling off for larger particles. Both the laboratory and the ambient measurements of the AE33 showed overlapping results.The cross-sensitivity to scattering was smaller for the CLAP than for the AE33. The values of the cross-sensitivity parameter ms at 450 and 808 nm were 3.0 % and 1.5 % for the AE33 and 2.4 % and 0.9 % for the CLAP.The intercomparison of the MAAP with the PTAAM-2λ during the ambient campaign in Granada showed that the MAAP overestimates the absorption coefficients for 47 % at 637 nm and features a  cross-sensitivity to scattering of 2.4 %."

An integrated compensation algorithm was designed to account for the effects of UAV motion, attitude changes, and rotor-induced airflow on wind speed measurements. Comparative experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed compensation algorithm. 
 A hexacopter unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) was fitted with a three-dimensional sonic anemometer to measure three-dimensional wind speed. To obtain accurate results for three-dimensional wind speeds, we developed an algorithm to correct biases caused by the rotor-induced airflow disturbance, UAV movement, and attitude changes in the three-dimensional wind measurements. The wind measurement platform was built based on a custom-designed integration kit that couples seamlessly to the UAV, equipped with a payload and the sonic anemometer. Based on an accurate digital model of the integrated UAV–payload–anemometer platform, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to quantify the wind speed disturbances caused by the rotation of the UAV's rotor on the anemometer during the UAV's steady flight under headwind, tailwind, and crosswind conditions. Through analysis of the simulated data, regression equations were developed to predict the wind speed disturbance, and a correction algorithm for rotor disturbances, motions, and attitude changes was developed. To validate the correction algorithm, we conducted a comparison study in which the integrated UAV flew around a meteorological tower from which three-dimensional wind measurements were made at multiple altitudes. Comparison between the corrected UAV wind data and those from the meteorological tower demonstrated excellent agreement. The corrections result in significant reductions in wind speed bias caused mostly by the rotors, along with notable changes in the dominant wind direction and wind speed in the original data. The algorithm enables reliable and accurate wind speed measurements in the atmospheric boundary layer made from rotorcraft UAVs."

Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies overlook evolving industry recycling practices and often disregard key impact categories, such as water consumption, toxicity, and resource depletion potential. Previous studies also do not evaluate battery recycling methods within the current supply chain context, specifically accounting for prevailing battery waste composition, final cathode material outputs, and varying geographic locations of recycling stages. This study compares conventional hydrometallurgy (CHR), truncated hydrometallurgy (THR), and pyrometallurgy (PR) recycling in North America, Europe, and China. This work considers each method’s recycling efficiency and the additional primary materials required to produce the new NMC811 CAM. Leaching and materials extraction contribute the most to the environmental footprint of recycling. Skipping metals’ extraction in THR leads to the lowest carbon footprint, water consumption, and toxicity. Compared to China, recycling and manufacturing in North America reduce the carbon footprint and freshwater toxicity of the NMC811 CAM by 16% and 30%, respectively. Careful selection of the recycling and production locations can reduce the environmental impact of a modern EV NMC811 battery pack by 792 kg CO2-eq and 11,355 L of water, respectively."

Here, we report that quinones’ Eh is a pivotal factor in determining their capacity to facilitate long-distance electron transfer and remote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Among a series of quinone molecules with Eh from −0.50 to 0 V, quinones from Eh = −0.25 V to −0.14 V exhibit high efficiency to mediate long-distance electron transfer excreted by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 for ROS generation. Mechanistic investigations show that quinones with Eh ≥ −0.25 V can act as terminal electron acceptors from microbial respiration. In-situ imaging results show that all reduced quinones could mediate electron transfer with a distance of 2.0–6.8 mm. Moreover, quinones with Eh ≤ −0.14 V could transfer carried electrons to oxygen molecules to generate ROS. Accordingly, 21.1% to 37.4% of redox-active moieties in aquatic and terrestrial organic matters were capable of efficiently mediating electron transfer from microbes to oxygen for ROS generation. We suggest that Eh distribution of organic matter is a pivotal parameter in the complex redox interactions between microbes, organic matter, and oxygen, thereby affecting biogeochemical processes in Earth’s surface systems."

However, the viability of this storage remains uncertain due to the unclear behavior of indigenous microorganisms in the presence of H2, which could influence the gas composition. While modeling can inform H2 dynamics, reactor-scale experiments are needed for validation. In our study, we used a high-pressure reactor to simulate injecting 2% H2 into a gas storage aquifer currently used for natural gas (CH4, 1% CO2), utilizing formation water and rock samples from the aquifer. Our research led to a kinetic model that analyzes the interactions among gas, water, rock, and microbial activities. We found that microorganisms consumed H2 and caused alkalinization, which inhibited further microbial growth and respiration. This suggests that after an initial decrease in H2 concentration, the gas storage may be stabilized in deep aquifers. Reducing CO2 levels is vital as CO2 can hinder alkalinization and enhance sulfate-reducing, methanogenic, and acetogenic activities. Notably, while H2-utilizing microorganisms were predominant, both methanogens and sulfate-reducers showed significant activity. Overall, our findings provide insights into the potential for underground H2 storage in deep aquifers, guiding future research and energy storage applications."

Herein, we investigated Cd behavior during the aging of Fh-BCs-Cd coprecipitates synthesized by using different BCs: pristine BC, graphitized BC (BCP), BC enriched with oxyl groups (BCO), and ash-removed BC (BCM). The incorporation of pristine BC, BCP, and BCO significantly reduced the transformation rates (K) of coprecipitates (K = 0.06–0.22 × 10–2 day–1). In contrast, Fh-BCM-Cd (K = 0.53 × 10–2 day–1) underwent a similar transformation to Fh-Cd (K = 0.71 × 10–2 day–1), forming hematite with the {104} facet and goethite with the dominant facet of {110} and incorporating 11.61% of Cd into these minerals.

Here, we constructed the first cell atlas of oyster gills at single-cell resolution level, identifying a total of 18 cell types. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of gills from oysters with high and low Cu accumulation revealed the cellular regulatory network underlying intraspecific differences in metal accumulation. For the first time, Cu-specific accumulating copperphilic cells in the oyster gills were identified, and a direct correlation was confirmed between copperphilic cell abundance and Cu content (R2 = 0.92). Trajectory analysis of cell differentiation revealed stage-specific gene module switching in metal-related cells, in which oxidative stress responses were activated in the early phase, while ion transport regulation dominated in the mature phase. Differentiation of Cu accumulation efficiency was mainly influenced by neuroendocrine-immune cells in gills maintaining physiological homeostasis, copperphilic cells selectively silencing intercellular communication, as well as ionocyte-mediated ncWNT pathway reprogramming. These results indicate a synergistic strategy by which oyster gills with high Cu accumulation enhance stress pathways (e.g., LT/RANKL) to mitigate Cu toxicity.

A single current circulation simultaneously drives ion migration for the nitrate concentration (desalination) and electron transfer for the NO3–RR, thereby achieving a 26.4% reduction in energy consumption. Moreover, enhanced nitrate removal and improved ammonia selectivity was realized by the synergistic effect between desalination and NO3–RR.

While the toxicological impacts of MPs are increasingly recognized, their influence on animal behavior─particularly feeding preferences─remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated whether animals can discriminate between MP-contaminated (“dirty”) and uncontaminated (“clean”) food sources and whether such preferences can be shaped by experience. Using the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that individuals preferentially consumed clean bacterial prey over MP-contaminated prey via olfactory cues mediated by the odr-10 gene. Strikingly, prolonged multigenerational exposure to MP-contaminated prey led to a reversal of this preference: the progeny of exposed worms developed a learned attraction to dirty food, a phenomenon absent in associative learning-deficient mutants (lrn-1). Soil microcosm experiments confirmed that MP contamination influenced predator foraging behavior with nematodes migrating toward cleaner prey patches. Our findings reveal that microplastic pollution can reprogram predator feeding preferences through associative learning and transgenerational inheritance, with broad implications for trophic dynamics and the ecological impact of plastic contamination."

In this study, we investigated the effect of an ether group on the OH radical-initiated oxidation of dioctyl ether (DOE), a linear C16 compound with an ether group located in the center of the carbon chain, under high NOx conditions. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber, and gas- and particle-phase products were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography, electron and chemical ionization mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and derivatization-spectrophotometry. Nitrate, hydroxynitrate, and hydroxycarbonyl ether products are analogous to those formed from the reaction of the corresponding alkane; however, the dominant product was octyl formate formed exclusively by reactions involving the ether group. Measured product yields were used with structure–activity relationships for OH and alkoxy radical reactions and literature branching ratios for the corresponding alkane reaction to determine the effect of the ether group on the branching ratio for nitrate vs alkoxy radical formation and to develop a simple model that predicted product yields in reasonable agreement with measurements. Compared to the corresponding alkane, the presence of the ether group increases OH reactivity, decreases the nitrate yield, and reduces the SOA yield by enhancing the formation of alkoxy radicals that decompose rather than isomerize to form low-volatility multifunctional products."

This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of MCs in eight Yunnan Plateau lakes in China, focusing on their relationships with environmental factors. Water samples (n = 63) were collected during summer and winter seasons and analyzed for MC concentrations along with a suite of environmental variables. Results revealed significant seasonal and spatial variations in MC concentrations, with higher levels in eutrophic lakes Dianchi, Erhai, and Xingyunhu. Notably, mean MC concentrations in Lake Dianchi during summer and Erhai during winter exceeded the World Health Organization’s provisional guideline of 1 μg/L for drinking water. Seasonal analyses revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms: MC concentrations in summer were positively correlated with total phosphorus, total nitrogen, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, reflecting the influence of eutrophication on cyanobacterial growth. While solar radiation intensity (SRI) exhibited a dual role: moderate SRI in winter was associated with higher MC levels, whereas higher SRI in summer suppressed MC production, likely due to photoinhibition or MC degradation. Strikingly, water temperature showed no significant correlation with MC concentrations, suggesting that high solar radiation in the Yunnan Plateau may override temperature-dependent effects on cyanobacterial growth. These findings highlight the importance of nutrient management and the regulatory role of solar radiation in regulating MC production in high-altitude lakes.

After 4 weeks of exposure, zebrafish ovaries exhibited polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like changes, including polycystic ovaries, reduced spawning rates, and elevated androgen levels. Moreover, ETO was transmitted to offspring via maternal ovaries, significantly increasing larval mortality and deformity rates while reducing their locomotor activity. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed oxidative stress responses, disrupted unsaturated fatty acid and glutathione metabolism, and damage to ovarian granulosa cells and the zona pellucida, as confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescence staining. Combined multiomics analysis demonstrated that ETO exposure exacerbated ovarian oxidative stress, impaired the functional structure of ovaries, and disrupted follicular cell maturation via hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway.

Previous studies have focused on single horizontal eddy‐induced transport effect or regional studies, yet assessments of the impact of stirring and trapping effects on salt transport at the global scale are incomplete. Here, we show that upper ocean salt transport due to eddy stirring and trapping effects displays a strong zonal dependence on the global ocean, with the former playing a dominant role over the analysis period. The zonal accumulation of meridional salt transport reaches a maximum of −4.52 psu·Sv (×106 psu·m3·s−1) in the Southern Ocean. Equivalent freshwater transport is poleward in the near‐equator region and equatorward in the near‐polar region, consequently causing freshwater to converge in the middle of the subtropical gyre. The divergence of salt transport further suggests that eddies transport salt out of the maximum sea surface salinity regions. Strong seasonal variations in salt transport occur mainly in eddy‐enriched regions such as the western boundary currents and the Southern Ocean. The relative contribution of eddy stirring and trapping effects to oceanic meridional salt transport can reach approximately 23.6%.

 Cognitive functions for navigation and memory rely on emergent properties of neural ensembles in the hippocampus, such as activity replay1–5 and theta sequences6–9. Yet, whether and how these phenomena generalize across species with distinct navigational demands and neurophysiological properties remain unclear. Here, we wirelessly recorded neural activity from large populations of cells and local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely flying bats engaged in free, spontaneous foraging behavior. During rest, we identified time-compressed forward and reverse replay of multiple flight trajectories coinciding with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Yet, replays occurred predominantly at locations that were both spatially and temporally distant from the replayed behavior, and their speed scaled with trajectory length, challenging existing models of replay mechanisms. During flight, neural ensembles exhibited fast representational sweeps, where the decoded location cyclically moved ahead of the bat’s position. In contrast to reports in rodents, sweeps occurred in the absence of theta oscillations and were instead phase-locked to a prominent motor behavioral rhythm - the bat’s wingbeat cycle. This suggests that behaviorally-relevant sensorimotor rhythms can interact with hippocampal ensemble dynamics in a highly structured manner. Combined, our findings challenge existing models of ensemble dynamics in the mammalian hippocampus and highlight the importance of comparative studies under ethologically relevant conditions for elucidating brain function."

Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-29 highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus11. The minor recombinant region, spanning spike (S), shows 96.5% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus NA/09. Infection has rapidly spread, infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears very frequent and sequence identities of samples from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A near cat-specific deletion in the domain 0 of S is present in >90% of FIP cats. It is unclear as yet whether this deletion is directly associated with disease development and may be linked to a biotype switch12.

 Antarctic bed topography influences how the overlying ice sheet responds to climate change and provides a record of long-term glacial history. However, knowledge of the processes that governed the development of the landscape before glacial inception and how this modulated subsequent ice-sheet evolution remains limited. Here we use radio-echo sounding to reveal extensive flat surfaces beneath the ice margin between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land, East Antarctica. When their elevations are isostatically adjusted for unloading of the present-day ice load, these surfaces cluster at 200–450 metres above sea level and dip gently in an offshore direction. We show that the surfaces are fragments of a once-contiguous coastal plain formed by fluvial erosion, which dates from between the separation of East Antarctica from Australia (~100–80 Ma) and the onset of Southern Hemisphere ice-sheet glaciation (~34 Ma). The preservation of these landforms indicates a lack of intense, selective erosion of the surfaces throughout Antarctica’s glacial history. Fast-flowing ice has instead been directed through inherited tectonic structures and fluvial valleys, leading to the incision of overdeepened subglacial troughs between the flat surfaces and thus modulating the responsiveness of the ice sheet to climate change. Extensive flat surfaces observed beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet margin were formed by fluvial erosion and have modulated the ice-sheet response to climate change, according to an analysis of radio-echo sounding data."

The discovery explains leakage and switching losses in GaN power devices and points to defect-guided design strategies. 
 Dislocations significantly influence carrier transport in semiconductors. While segments orthogonal to the channel act as scattering centers impeding conduction, electrically active dislocation cores can facilitate carrier transport. However, the mechanisms governing carrier transport along dislocation cores remain unclear. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for the separate transport mechanisms of electrons and holes mediated by threading screw dislocations and threading edge dislocations in gallium nitride. Critically, we demonstrate that devices with a higher total dislocation density exhibit less degradation due to current collapse, owing to a larger proportion of edge dislocations mitigating electron trapping caused by screw dislocations. Screw dislocations promote electron leakage via horizontal potential barriers and vertically connected shallow states, while edge dislocations enhance hole transport through extended trap levels interacting with buffer defects. These findings clarify the long-standing debate on carrier-specific dislocation transport mechanisms and offer critical insights for defect engineering, epitaxial growth optimization, and the development of dislocation-enhanced semiconductor devices.

This study reveals that when sensing host albumin, C. albicans, even avirulent strains, can trigger an alternative pathogenicity pathway via transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming. 
 Pathogenicity mechanisms of the yeast Candida albicans involve filamentous growth, adhesion, invasion, and toxin production. Interestingly, clinical isolates, and other Candida spp., can cause infection independent of filamentation or toxin production. These strains and species often are characterized as avirulent ex vivo, yet this does not correlate with their potential to cause infection. We hypothesized that specific host factors, which trigger pathogenicity in vivo, are absent in in vitro infection models and thereby clinical isolates can seem avirulent ex vivo. We investigated how albumin, the most abundant protein in humans, impacts infection and cytotoxic potential of C. albicans in vitro. The presence of albumin induces otherwise non-damaging and non-filamentous clinical isolates to cause host cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, avirulent deletion mutants deficient in filamentation, adhesion, or toxin production are restored in their cytotoxicity by albumin. This involves transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming of C. albicans, increasing biofilm formation and production of the oxylipin 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, driving host cell cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study uncoveres a pathogenicity mechanism by which C. albicans causes epithelial cytotoxicity independent of its conventional virulence mechanisms. This alternative pathogenicity strategy helps to explain the avirulence of clinical isolates ex vivo, when they are separated from the host environment.

 The rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, particularly gram-negative bacteria, highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutics. Drug-resistant infections now contribute to approximately 5 million deaths annually, yet traditional antibiotic discovery has significantly stagnated. Venoms form an immense and largely untapped reservoir of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial potential. In this study, we mined global venomics datasets to identify new antimicrobial candidates. Using deep learning, we explored 16,123 venom proteins, generating 40,626,260 venom-encrypted peptides. From these, we identified 386 candidates that are structurally and functionally distinct from known antimicrobial peptides. They display high net charge and elevated hydrophobicity, characteristics conducive to bacterial-membrane disruption. Structural studies revealed that many of these peptides adopt flexible conformations that transition to α-helical conformations in membrane-mimicking environments, supporting their antimicrobial potential. Of the 58 peptides selected for experimental validation, 53 display potent antimicrobial activity. Mechanistic assays indicated that they primarily exert their effects through bacterial-membrane depolarization, mirroring AMP-like mechanisms. In a murine model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection, lead peptides significantly reduced bacterial burden without observable toxicity. Our findings demonstrate that venoms are a rich source of previously hidden antimicrobial scaffolds, and that integrating large-scale computational mining with experimental validation can accelerate the discovery of urgently needed antibiotics.

 Recent advances in memory technologies, devices, and materials have shown great potential for integration into neuromorphic electronic systems.

One key challenge is determining which devices and materials are best suited for specific functions and how they can be paired with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor circuitry.

Once-daily obeldesivir treatment was efficacious against RSV in a non-human primate model. 
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations. Although prophylactic options are available, there are no effective oral therapeutics for RSV infection. Obeldesivir (ODV) is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analog GS-441524, which is converted intracellularly to its active nucleoside triphosphate and inhibits the RSV RNA polymerase. Here we report the potent antiviral activity of ODV against geographically and temporally diverse RSV A and B clinical isolates (EC50: 0.20–0.66 μM). Resistance selection studies with ODV and GS-441524 against RSV identify a single amino acid substitution, I777L, in the L polymerase with reduced susceptibility (3.3-3.8-fold) to ODV and GS-441524, indicating a high barrier for resistance development. In an African green monkey RSV infection model, once-daily oral ODV doses of 30 or 90 mg/kg initiated ~24 hours post-infection significantly reduces log10 viral RNA copies/mL × day area under the curve by 69–92% in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Together, these preclinical data support the clinical evaluation of ODV for the treatment of RSV infection.

 Global surface temperatures since the 1980s, when near-global satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) measurements became available, are presumed to be well known. Satellite-era warming trends in four commonly used global (land and ocean) temperature reconstructions agree closely, yet whether SST datasets also agree is unclear. Here we show that trends in four widely used SST datasets show first-order differences, with 1982–2024 60° S to 60° N trends ranging from 0.108 to 0.184 °C per decade. These large discrepancies are perplexing given the agreement between global temperature datasets and the fact that 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered by ocean, but are legible upon recognizing that global temperature datasets use two SST fields whose trends agree more closely than those of the four SST datasets. Considering the trend uncertainty across SST datasets widens the range of plausible global temperature trends and impacts interpretations of recent record global temperatures, with implications for observational and model-based climate studies.

This work presents a strategy that integrates biological wastewater treatment with photothermal technology to improve its resilience to low temperatures. 
 Biological wastewater treatment (BWT) is critical to safeguard the aqueous environment. However, enzyme activities in microbial metabolism are inhibited by low temperatures, making BWT implementation in cold environments challenging. Here we propose a strategy to endow BWT facilities with low-temperature operation resilience by integrating photothermal technology with BWT using photothermal carriers (PTCs). Specifically, α-Fe2O3@polyaniline was coated onto a high-conductivity SiC ceramic matrix on a PTC, forming functional partitions for bacterial colonization. The upper layers of the PTCs have an interlaced porous structure and photothermal functions, which provided stable energy conversion and light shielding. The heat conducted downward formed a mesophilic, lightless zone in the lower PTC layers, resulting in high thermal conduction and bioaffinity. Consequently, anammox bacteria, a key biome for sustainable BWT, can be enriched in these PTCs, as evidenced by a 21.4% increase in abundance and a 2.2-fold increase in biomass. With the use of PTCs in a BWT facility under 0.6 kW m−2 illumination, the nitrogen removal performance at low temperature (15 °C) was 5.8 times higher than the case without the use of PTCs. Overall, this work shows how solar energy can be used to enhance the resilience of BWT to low temperatures, improving the applicability of BWT in cold regions.

 Latitudinal variations in the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio of particulate organic matter are well-established, but vertical (depth) variations within the euphotic zone remain largely unexplored. Here, we found that C:N ratios (mol:mol) of three size fractions of particulate organic matter exceeded the canonical Redfield ratio of 6.6 within the low-nutrient upper euphotic zone in the stratified northwest Sargasso Sea. In larger particles ( >20 μm), these ratios reached as high as 10–16. Elevated C:N ratios in all size fractions of particles (0.3 to >20 μm) in the upper euphotic zone coincided with the accumulation of glucose-rich carbohydrates. In contrast, particles within or below the nitracline, within the lower euphotic zone (~90–140 m), exhibited C:N ratios of <6.6 and contained comparatively less carbohydrate and greater amounts of amino acids. Additionally, patterns in the composition of individual carbohydrate monomers suggest that the vertical variations originate from both primary production and degradative processes. These variations in particle composition over depth will affect the stoichiometry in models of primary production, microbial remineralization, and carbon export.

 Evaluating heavy metals bioavailable is crucial for comprehensive soil contamination assessment but challenging at large scales due to complex and resource-intensive analytical procedures, and the amount of dissolved metal in soils represents the relative solubility and potential mobility of cadmium, which is a key factor determining bioavailability. Here, we developed a geochemical-integrated machine learning framework using multi-source data to predict cadmium speciation distribution in European and Chinese non-industrial topsoils. Average total cadmium content in Chinese topsoils (0.41 mg kg−1) was ~10.8% higher than the Europe, while average dissolved cadmium content (113.2 μg L−1) was ~16.8% higher. Mechanistic interpretation revealed that lower pH, soil organic matter, and amorphous ferrihydrite contents mainly attributed to the higher bioavailability in China. The framework, coupled with knowledge transfer bridging the knowledge gap between geochemical processes and crop uptake, would facilitate the informed decision-making and targeted remediation measures for sustainable agricultural practices and long-term environmental health.

 The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the FY-4B satellite is the world's first and currently the only operational hyperspectral thermal infrared sounder in geostationary orbit, with the unique advantage of continuously scanning the atmosphere over East Asia on an hourly basis during both daytime and nighttime. Compared to previously established low-Earth orbit satellite sounders, developing and applying Level 2 atmospheric products from FY-4B/GIIRS are still in the exploratory stage. In this study, we present an optimal sequential physical retrieval system (OSPRS) for retrieving high-accuracy atmospheric strong absorbers, including water (H2O), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) from FY-4B/GIIRS. OSPRS first selects a subset of sensitive spectral channels for each variable based on column- and pressure-related sensitivity. It then determines the optimal retrieval sequence consisting of multiple retrieval steps, aiming to reduce the nonlinearity of each inversion problem and the influence of interfering variables on the primary retrieval targets. Finally, OSPRS employs the optimal estimation method as the retrieval operator to perform the retrieval at each step, outputting the profiles of the primary retrieval targets and critical scientific diagnostic information. We confirm the improved accuracy of OSPRS through Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE). We compare OSPRS with existing products and evaluate them based on high-quality in situ data from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive H2O, the ground-based Pandonia Global Network O3, and solar absorption Fourier transform infrared CO measurements. The results show that the mean absolute error, linear fitting slope, and correlation coefficient between OSPRS's H2O, O3 and CO and in-situ or ground-based measurements are superior to those of existing products.

 Continuous low-intensity tillage is promoted as a sustainable farming practice; however, a single year of high-intensity tillage can significantly diminish its environmental and agronomic benefits. Monitoring these tillage dynamics requires accurate spatial and temporal data, and satellite observations offer a valuable tool for this purpose. However, their accuracy varies, and the role of ground datasets in improving that accuracy is not well-characterized. This study has two components: first, we analyzed tillage changes in a unique roadside survey collected by the same analysts in Kansas, USA, over 2011–2019 and 2022 across 1,209 fields totalling ∼27,000 ha. Annually, 4,269 ha (16 %) disadopted low-intensity tillage, but this was offset by an increase in adoption, with fields totaling 5,878 ha under low-intensity tillage in 2022 that had been under high-intensity tillage in 2011. The second component tested the ability of remote sensing to align with this detailed, human-labeled survey of tillage intensity. We extracted 14 spectral indices from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, texture metrics from the Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and environmental factors from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and SSURGO soil dataset. We evaluated multiple composition techniques and machine-learning models and found that the Random Forest model trained with bimonthly composited images provided the best accuracies of tillage intensity (0.65) and tillage change (0.57), aligning with or surpassing previous studies. By examining crop tillage dynamics over a longer period and across more heterogeneous landscapes, this study provides a more comprehensive analysis to mapping tillage practices at broader temporal and spatial scales."

 Geospatial modeling aims to integrate multiple geospatial data sources and geoprocessing functions based on user application demands to address complex geospatial challenges. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in semantic understanding and task planning, their limited geospatial domain knowledge still hinders their efficiency in geospatial modeling. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate geospatial knowledge with the inherent semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs, enabling their effective application in specialized geospatial domains. In this study, we introduce GeoGraphRAG, a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach tailored for geospatial modeling. Specifically, GeoGraphRAG utilizes LLMs as intelligent agents to identify user demands, retrieve relevant subgraphs from external graph knowledge base, and injects both structural and semantic information into the LLM. Through the graph-driven solution planning phase, GeoGraphRAG automatically generates modeling solutions and geospatial code in response to specific user demands. The proposed method is evaluated against different baseline approaches across various LLMs based on the benchmark dataset designed for geospatial modeling, and a representative application scenario is presented to illustrate its practical effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the injection of graph-structured knowledge improves both the efficiency and interpretability of LLM-based geospatial modeling, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) emissions and depositions have been linked to negative effects on human health and biodiversity. National monitoring networks have documented large spatial variation of NH3 concentrations related to agricultural activities, including livestock pollution. Little is known about spatial and temporal variation of livestock-related ammonia concentrations in areas where residential and nature areas are located nearby intensive livestock farming. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal variability of ambient ammonia in such a mixed land-use area within the Netherlands.A dense air quality network was set up with 71 sites spanning over 1027 km2 within rural and semi-urban (small towns) areas, and nature reserves. Ambient ammonia concentrations were measured monthly with passive samplers from March 2022 to February 2024.Ammonia measurements showed large spatial and temporal variation. Spatial variation was related to the number of livestock farms in a 3000m buffer around sites and inverse distance to the nearest farm. Mean concentrations were 13.6 μg/m3 (rural), 9.6 μg/m3 (semi-urban) and 5.1 μg/m3 (nature sites). Seasonal patterns, highest in spring and lowest in winter, were similar in rural, semi-urban and natural sites. The highest concentrations were observed in March 2022, coinciding with manure application and stable weather conditions. Temporal variability related to temperature, rainfall, manure application, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. Multivariate models explained 52–80 % of the temporal variance component, depending on time period.

 Chromium (Cr) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) poses a significant environmental health risk. However, current exposure assessments are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the neglect of bioaccessible fractions (Bio-Cr). In this study, we developed an advanced method to evaluate high-spatial resolution population-weighted exposure of PM2.5-bound Cr and its bioaccessible fraction (Bio-Cr). By integrating the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and Land Use Regression (LUR) model through an uncertainty-weighted approach, the coupled model overcomes the limitations of individual models. The method was applied to a Chinese megacity. It captured distinct spatial heterogeneity in Cr and Bio-Cr distributions, with hotspots aligning with industrial and high-traffic areas. The coupled model revealed a pronounced belt-like distribution of Cr concentrations in central urban areas, with a peak value of 0.016 μg/m3, and Bio-Cr concentrations were generally lower, reaching up to 0.011 μg/m3. The population-weighted exposure assessment indicated that high-exposure areas for both Cr and Bio-Cr were primarily located in densely populated urban districts, with exposure risks significantly exceeding the citywide average, highlighting the necessity of targeted pollution control strategies. Additionally, this study introduced a bioavailability species allocation coefficient for Bio-Cr simulation in CMAQ, providing a new perspective for simulating bioaccessible metal concentrations in chemical transport models. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate CMAQ and LUR models for high-resolution simulation of bioaccessible metal concentrations. The coupled model provided a framework for estimating bioaccessible heavy metal exposure, offered a scientific basis for epidemiological and health impact research."

 This study comprehensively investigates nighttime aerosol characteristics across East Asia, addressing a critical gap in current research, as most existing studies focus exclusively on daytime conditions. It systematically examines variations in column-integrated optical properties, vertically resolved extinction profiles, and aerosol-type distributions in six representative regions of East Asia, including Mongolia (MG), Beijing (BJ), Korea (KR), Japan (JP), Hong Kong (HK), and Taiwan (TW). Significant regional differences were identified, with northern regions (MG, BJ, KR, and JP) displaying consistent day-night aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent values. In contrast, southern regions (HK and TW) exhibit pronounced discrepancies. All regions exhibit smoother nighttime extinction profiles than during the daytime. However, northern regions showed sharper vertical decay, while southern regions exhibited secondary peaks attributed to transported smoke aerosols. Additionally, CALIPSO revealed peaks of vertical aerosol distribution at nighttime compared to daytime. Such abnormal phenomenon was then proved to be the more sensitivity of nighttime Lidar signal to upper thin aerosol layers. After removing this bias, the vertical distribution of aerosol types at nighttime is found to be generally consistent with that during the daytime. Meteorological analysis in BJ suggests consistency in AOD-PM relationships between day and night, highlighting temperature as the dominant factor driving seasonal variations in AOD–PM2.5 correlations, followed by relative humidity. The findings provide valuable insights into nighttime aerosol characteristics, supporting future research on diurnal aerosol radiative forcing."

Finally, deep learning methods were further introduced to explore the quantitative correlation between SCCs and SCW. Key findings include: (1) Strong consistency between satellite-identified SCCs and high-reflectivity zones observed by ground-based radar; (2) The algorithm effectively detects convective clouds at various developmental stages, achieving an identification accuracy of 85 %; (3) Spatiotemporal analysis reveals that more than 90 % of severe convective weather (SCW) occurs within the coverage of SCCs and a 40 km buffer zone surrounding their boundaries, although the presence of SCCs does not necessarily lead to SCW; (4) By applying deep learning, the model attained a mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) score of 78 % in segmenting severe convective weather within SCCs.

By analyzing the high-speed videos, we identified several characteristics similar to those observed in cloud-to-ground flashes.Two types of intracloud flashes were identified according to the polarity of the leader propagating along the cloud base. Their duration was estimated by the camera and by an electric field sensor. By comparing these data, the accuracy of high-speed videos in determining intracloud flash durations was evaluated."

We combined isotope labeling, computed-tomography three-dimensional models, behavioral field experiments, and mathematical models to show thatSquamellariaplant hosts reduce conflict among their multiple ant symbiont species by offering nesting sites (domatia) divided into compartments with separate entrances. As long as compartmentalization is maintained, different symbiont species can peacefully coexist, but experimental removal of compartment walls leads to deadly conflicts. Modeling suggests that compartmentalization optimizes nutritional benefits by increasing the time during which domatia harbor large ant colonies. These results reveal a conflict-reduction mechanism that allows hosts to take advantage of unrelated symbionts, which may be widespread in multipartner mutualisms."

The microrobot exhibits strong in vitro motility through narrow two-dimensional and complex three-dimensional networks and, in vivo, achieves outstanding kidney penetration, uniform distribution, and >48-hour retention while resisting flow shear and immune clearance, with excellent biosafety. Their ability to retain functionality and sustain propulsion within the confined and complex kidney vasculatures and interstitial spaces underscore their potential for long-term, active delivery in confined biological environments. The picoeukaryote-based biohybrid microrobot system represents a major advancement in active drug delivery, especially tailored to the challenging microenvironments of the kidney."

Despite its advantages in inhibiting multidrug-resistant bacteria and eliminating biofilms, phage therapy suffers low phage vitality, limited ocular retention, and lack of anti-inflammatory abilities toward ocular infections. Here, wearing phages individually with an adhesive drug-loadable nanohelmet is reported to advance phage therapy. The nanohelmet is formed by depositing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid–modified chitosan on negatively charged phage head through electrostatic interactions, followed by codepositing anti-inflammatory agents via physical adsorption. Nanohelmet formation shows a negligible influence on phage vitality and is applicable to helmet diverse phages. Because of the cationic nature and the presence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence, such nanohelmet exhibits a double-lock adhesion fashion to ocular surface, prolonging phage retention after instillation. Together with sustained drug release, helmeted phages potently inhibit bacteria, eliminate biofilms, and effectively suppress localized inflammation. In mice with multidrug-resistant pathogen-induced keratitis, helmeted phages achieve superior therapeutic efficacies, even compared to clinical therapeutics."

The Cape Verde Islands are located 600 km off the coast of Africa and are characterized by arid environments and high-salinity soils. Here, we find thatArabidopsis thalianaplants native to these islands accumulate glucuronyl-mannose that protects them from salt stress. We map the ability to produce this metabolite to an α glycosidase family 38 gene that we namedGH38cv. Plants carrying mutant alleles of GH38cv do not present defects on growth, fitness, or biotic resistance under standard laboratory conditions but show better germination rates, longer roots, better hydric status, and higher fitness than nonmutated plants when exposed to salt stress. Notably, deleterious mutations in GH38cv have evolved independently on two separate islands within the Cape Verde archipelago, illustrating an example of parallel evolution for salt tolerance in this environment. Our findings reveal a knowledge-driven method to develop salt-resilient crops, which could be attractive to both conventional and organic agriculture."

Long intergenic noncoding RNA LINC00473 in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can induce stress resilience in a sex-dependent manner, but its role in cognition is unknown. We characterized decision-making behavior in male and female mice in the neuroeconomic paradigm Restaurant Row following virus-mediated expression of LINC00473 in mPFC. Mice foraged for food among varying temporal costs and subjective value while on a limited time budget. Without affecting primary deliberative decisions, LINC00473 selectively influenced re-evaluative choices in a sex-dependent manner. This included changing how mice (i) cached value with the passage of time and (ii) weighed prior mistakes, which underlie the computational bases of sensitivity to sunk costs and regret. These findings suggest that a common value function is shared between these neuroeconomic processes and reveal a bridge between molecular drivers of stress resilience and psychological mechanisms underlying sex-specific proclivities in negative rumination."

Here, we demonstrate that BAP1 suppresses CRC progression primarily by deubiquitinating and stabilizing von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). BAP1 undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) at Lys51, Lys61, Lys187, and Lys205, enhancing its interaction with pVHL and promoting pVHL stabilization. Loss of this modification through UFL1 depletion or reconstitution with a UFMylation-defective BAP1 mutant (4KR) impairs pVHL stabilization and promotes tumor progression in CRC cell line–based and patient-derived xenograft models. Clinically, down-regulation of UFL1 and BAP1 correlates with reduced pVHL level and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. These findings identify a previously unrecognized posttranslational mechanism regulating BAP1 activity and highlight UFMylation as essential for maintaining pVHL tumor-suppressive function. Targeting BAP1 UFMylation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in CRC and other cancers with wild-typeBAP1andVHL."

T follicular helper (TFH) cells drive germinal center (GC) responses by providing help to B cells, whereas T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells regulate them. Both mature GC–located TFHand TFRcells are widely characterized by the expression of ICOS and PD-1. However, although human TFRcells share many phenotypic characteristics with TFHcells, we found that ICOS and PD-1 are up-regulated differently in each. Although TFHcells express these proteins synchronously during maturation, they define three maturation stages in TFRcells. TFRcells in an intermediate maturation stage express ICOS, and it is only at the last stage of differentiation that both molecules are expressed at high levels. Although most TFRcells within the B cell follicle are PD-1−, the TFRwithin the GC are ICOS+PD-1+.

An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions."

Although humans lack the capacity to regenerate entire limbs, digit tip regrowth and joint cartilage repair following joint distraction suggest latent regenerative potential. Using mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we quantified anabolic indices of cartilage extracellular matrix proteins and identified 69 smRNAs correlated with cartilage regeneration in osteoarthritis—six concordantly regulated across species (human, axolotl, zebrafish, and bichir)—including microRNA 21 (miR-21). miR-21 enhanced the expression of key cartilage formation genes, reduced cartilage degradation, and suppressed cytokine secretion from human cartilage and chondrocytes.

Notably, the energy efficiency (2.976 millimoles per kilojoule) exceeds all the previously reported values, enabling net carbon dioxide–negative emissions powered by common sustainable electricity. An electrically driven release of lattice oxygen bridges the decomposition of the lanthanum oxycarbonate intermediate generated from carbon dioxide activation and the reduction of the resultant nickel oxide species by deposited carbon from methane dissociation, thus inhibiting excessive nickel oxidation and lanthanum(III) oxide carbonatation.

The prevailing view suggests that trenchward continental motion drives slab overthrusting, causing the flat slab to expand oceanward. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism: underthrusting of the subducting plate through forward propagation of the flat-slab hinge. We directly evaluate both hypotheses through a kinematic analysis of trench and flat-slab motions using a global flat subduction database cast into multiple absolute plate motion models. Our results indicate that flat-slab expansion reflects distinct end-member processes, with forward propagation emerging as the dominant mode. We present a framework for flat-slab propagation that emphasizes the dynamic interaction between lower-plate motion and slab pull from adjacent subduction zones, an interplay validated through numerical modeling. These findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the need to reconsider the role of lower-plate kinematics in flat-slab dynamics."

The cation ratio parameter, determined in small-scale experiments, remains effective at scales 200 times larger, allowing one-step, milligram-scale separation of (−) (6,5) with record-high enantiomeric purity. In addition, we develop a salt-switching multistage bottom-extraction strategy to isolate (+) (6,5) enantiomer.

These structures exhibit a substantial offset in their hDPP4 interaction interfaces, revealing a conserved hydrophobic cluster as a convergent signature of DPP4 binding within the MERS-HKU4 clade of merbecoviruses. Structure-guided mutagenesis demonstrates that favorable interactions are distributed across multiple receptor binding motif (RBM) regions, working synergistically to confer high-affinity hDPP4 binding. Swapping of the merbecovirus RBM regions indicate limited plasticity and interchangeability among these regions. In addition, we report cryo-EM structures of six merbecovirus S-trimers.

The Arctic climate is rapidly changing, and it is not known how the Arctic Ocean overturning circulation is responding. Here, we use a high-resolution ocean reanalysis, corroborated by observations, to show that a poleward expansion of warm Atlantic waters and corresponding sea-ice loss, a phenomenon referred to as an “Atlantification” of the Arctic, has caused a poleward shift of the dense water source regions in recent decades (1993–2020). This is manifested in enhanced surface water mass transformation in the Arctic Ocean, compensating for a reduction in the Nordic Seas. The associated strengthening of the Arctic Ocean overturning circulation has ensured that the transport of dense overflow waters across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge to the AMOC’s lower limb has remained stable.
