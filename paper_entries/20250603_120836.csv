We make use of new satellite datasets of isotopes in tropospheric water vapour to characterize processes controlling the monsoon convection. We find that comparing different water vapour isotopes reveals effects of rain–vapour interactions and air mass transport. 
 The West African Monsoon (WAM) is crucial for rainfall in West Africa, impacting socio-economic conditions. Its complexity arises from interactions between large-scale circulation, convective dynamics, and microphysical processes, making it challenging to disentangle individual contributions to the hydrological cycle.Recent advances in retrieving the isotopic composition of tropospheric water vapour from space promote the paired analysis of H2O and HDO to study atmospheric moisture pathways and processes. Using data from the satellite instruments IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer), AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument), along with the IMERG (Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM) precipitation product, we analyse the variability of H2O and HDO (given as δD) over West Africa at convective and seasonal scales. Key findings include the following: (1) monsoon convection over the Sahel induces an anti-correlation between H2O and δD in the mid-troposphere. This is due to dry intrusions from the Saharan upper troposphere into Sahelian squall lines, fostering rain evaporation and mid-tropospheric δD depletion. (2) Over the Guinea coast, convective precipitation is associated with moist and enriched signals, with surface evaporation from the tropical Atlantic reducing rain evaporation and δD depletion. (3) During the Sahelian monsoon peak, an anti-correlation between precipitation and δD forms year to year, indicating the amount effect in tropospheric water vapour. (4) In the Sahelian winter, when precipitation is minimal, {H2O, δD} signals point to mixing of dry air masses of different origins.This study is the first to apply comprehensive isotopic datasets from IASI, TROPOMI and AIRS to the WAM, demonstrating the utility of satellite-based {H2O, δD} pairs in detecting impacts of microphysical and dynamical processes on water vapour isotopic composition."

Pope;Adele L. Igel,Counteracting influences of gravitational settling modulate aerosol impacts on cloud-base-lowering fog characteristics,"We used an atmospheric model that simulates a single column to study the sensitivity of marine fog formed through the lowering of the base of a stratus cloud to meteorology and aerosols. We found that higher aerosol concentration reduces the likelihood and duration of fog but leads to denser fog. This overall trend was caused by multiple physical mechanisms depending on conditions. 
 One common process for marine fog formation is cloud base lowering (CBL), which is frequently observed, for example, off the coast of California and in Canada's Grand Banks, as well as other foggy ocean regions. While previous studies have extensively examined the meteorological controls on CBL fog, its microphysical characteristics have received comparatively less attention. We employ a single-column model to investigate the interplay among aerosols, microphysics, and CBL fog evolution under diverse meteorological conditions. We find that lower aerosol concentrations make fog formation more probable but that if fog does form, fog water concentrations are lower. Lower aerosol concentrations lead to earlier fog formation due to faster gravitational settling of larger droplets, which serves to flux moisture downward. Faster gravitational settling (among other mechanisms at low aerosol concentration) also suppresses entrainment at cloud top, which aids in keeping the liquid water path high. However, faster gravitational settling also limits the fog water concentration through faster liquid deposition to the surface.  It is these counteracting influences of gravitational settling that appear to cause both prolonged fog duration and suppressed fog water concentration. The relative strength of these counteracting influences depends on the environmental conditions."

Kanji;Ulrike Lohmann;Jan Henneberger,Quantified ice-nucleating ability of AgI-containing seeding particles in natural clouds,"We analyzed the ability of silver iodide particles (a commonly used cloud-seeding agent) to form ice crystals in naturally occurring liquid clouds at −5 to −8 °C and found that only ≈ 0.1 %−1 % of particles nucleate ice, with a negative dependence on temperature. By contextualizing our results with previous laboratory studies, we help to bridge the gap between laboratory and field experiments, which also helps to inform future cloud-seeding projects. 
 For decades, silver iodide (AgI) has been widely used for laboratory ice nucleation experiments and glaciogenic cloud-seeding operations due to its ability to nucleate ice at relatively warm temperatures (up to −3 °C). Despite being one of the most well-characterized ice-nucleating substances, gaps remain in the understanding of how its ice nucleation behavior in the laboratory translates to natural clouds. Here, we present, for the first time, measurements of the ice-nucleated fractions (INFs) of AgI-containing seeding particles, derived from in situ measurements of ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC) and seeding particle number concentrations during glaciogenic cloud-seeding experiments. The experiments were performed as part of the CLOUDLAB project, in which we used targeted cloud seeding with an uncrewed aerial vehicle to try to answer fundamental questions about ice-phase cloud microphysics. Data from 16 seeding experiments show strong linear correlations between ICNC and seeding particle concentration, indicating relatively constant INFs throughout each experiment. Median INFs (0.07 %–1.63 %) were found to weakly increase with decreasing cloud temperature at seeding height (range of −5.1 to −8.3 °C). We compare our results with previous key laboratory experiments and discuss the possible freezing mechanisms. This study can help to bridge the gap in understanding of AgI ice nucleation behavior between laboratory and field experiments which further helps to inform future cloud-seeding operations."

To fill gaps in sparse observations, we used an advanced ensemble of six machine learning models to reconstruct monthly oxygen maps from the surface down to 5902 m, covering 1960–2023. Our dataset reveals where and how fast oxygen loss is occurring, especially in deeper waters, and provides a reliable resource for studying climate impacts on oceans and guiding conservation efforts. 
 Oceanic oxygen levels, crucial for marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, have declined significantly over the past few decades, driven by climate change and posing severe environmental risks. However, historical dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements, especially below 2000 m, remain sparse, limiting comprehensive annual and seasonal analyses. Here we introduce the BEM-DOR framework, a Bayesian-optimized ensemble of six machine-learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Extremely Randomized Trees and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting) fused via dynamic weighting, to reconstruct global monthly DO distributions at 1°×1° resolution from the surface to 5902 m depth over 1960–2023. Validation against an independent dataset demonstrates that BEM-DOR outperforms existing products. Our dataset captures depth-dependent deoxygenation, with the most pronounced decline occurring between 150 and 200 m, and reveals dramatically accelerated oxygen loss in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic over the past decade. We quantify uncertainties from measurement errors, gridding processes, and model algorithms, providing the first long-term, high-resolution, uncertainty-quantified DO product from ocean surface to nearly 6000 m depth. The extension of DO data into the bathypelagic zone in this work is a significant contribution to deep ocean oxygen dynamics and global biogeochemical cycles."

The author relied on her 30 years of research experience in atmospheric numerical modelling. The presented model is the fruit of the author's research on physical processes at the surface–atmosphere interface and their numerical approximation and aims at improving numerical weather forecasting and climate simulations. 
 This work presents the land model Pochva. Pochva is a model of hydro-thermal processes at the Earth's surface and in the underlying medium. The model simulates the main hydro-thermal parameters of the surface, soil layer, vegetation, and snow cover. The soil process scheme accounts for diversity in the vertical profile of the soil physical parameters. The snow cover is processed in a multilayer scheme and its numerical algorithm allows solutions for both extremely thin and extremely thick layer cases. The model is characterized by a particular accuracy in simulating the water phase transitions in soil and snow and by the autonomy in the determination of the lower boundary condition in the soil column. The model can be used as a stand-alone land surface model driven by observed or analytical forcing data or coupled to an atmospheric model, which is either global or limited-area, in either the forecast regime or climatic regime. The results of coupling Pochva to the numerical weather prediction limited-area model Bolam are presented."

In this work, we present a piece of software that facilitates this work, specifically with regard to reactive processes. Existing tried-and-true codes are made available via this new interface, freeing up resources to focus on the new aspects of the problems at hand. 
 Alquimia v1.0 is a generic interface to geochemical solvers that facilitates development of multiphysics simulators by enabling code coupling, prototyping and benchmarking. The interface enforces the function arguments and their types for setting up, solving, serving up output data and carrying out other common auxiliary tasks while providing a set of structures for data transfer between the multiphysics code driving the simulation and the geochemical solver. Alquimia relies on a single-cell approach that permits operator splitting coupling and parallel computation. We describe the implementation in Alquimia of two widely used open-source codes that perform geochemical calculations: PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow. We then exemplify its use for the implementation and simulation of reactive transport in porous media by two open-source flow and transport simulators: Amanzi and ParFlow. We also demonstrate its use for the simulation of coupled processes in novel multiphysics applications including the effect of multiphase flow on reaction rates at the pore scale with OpenFOAM, the role of complex biogeochemical processes in land surface models such as the E3SM Land Model (ELM) and the impact of surface–subsurface hydrological interactions on hydrogeochemical export from watersheds with the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS). These applications make it apparent that the availability of a well-defined yet flexible interface has the potential to improve the software development workflow, freeing up resources to focus on advances in process models and mechanistic understanding of coupled problems."

Discussions have taken place on revising them. For instance, the European Commission is considering implementing the “essential-use” concept in the REACH Regulation to guide decision-making for phasing-out the use of the most harmful chemicals. By assessing 34 existing cases under the Stockholm Convention and 45 restrictions and 544 applications for authorization under the REACH regulation (as of November 2023), this study aims to capture how the essential-use concept may inform decision-making on exemptions and provide insights on its implementation. By conducting a detailed case study of the REACH restriction on intentionally added microplastics, this study also aims to explore how the existing data requirements in regulatory processes could be used in an essentiality assessment. Overall, this study suggests that the Stockholm Convention and the REACH Regulation already consider elements of the concept in their decision-making and that no drastic changes in the data requirements are necessary to apply the concept in decision-making processes."

Moreover, it is contributing to increased wildfires, which pose a distinct threat to cardiovascular and respiratory health, especially in the presence of other stressors. Living conditions can be a significant nonchemical stressor that alters physiology and impacts wildfire smoke responsiveness, especially when combined with ambient heat. To determine the combined impact of housing and temperature on behavioral health and the cardiopulmonary response to wildfire smoke (WS), female mice were split into enriched (EH) and depleted housing (DH) at normal (NT) and high temperatures (HT) for 20 weeks and assessed at baseline and after a single filtered air (FA) or WS exposure. Separate radiotelemetered mice were similarly housed for 4 weeks and then exposed to FA sham and then WS. EH mice had higher activity and body temperature and lower heart rate at NT, and these effects were blocked at HT. HT-DH mice had an increased heart rate variability following WS and increased arrhythmias. Interestingly, HT-EH caused increased anxiety-like behavior. Thus, although EH likely protects cardiopulmonary health, it might also negatively impact the behavior at HT in mice. As such, the living temperature and housing conditions should be carefully considered when assessing susceptibility to disease and environmental exposures."

Inhalation is a major exposure route, as evidenced by their detection in human lungs, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) among the most abundant particles in respiratory airways. However, the harmful effects of particle bioaccumulation remain unclear, as chronic effects are understudied. To assess long-term effects, specifically carcinogenic effects, BEAS-2B cells were exposed to PET-NPLs for 30 weeks. Genotoxicity, carcinogenic phenotypic hallmarks, and a panel of genes and pathways associated with cell transformation and lung cancer were examined and compared across three exposure durations. No significant effects were observed after 24 h or 15 weeks of exposure. However, a 30-week exposure led to increased genotoxic damage, anchorage-independent growth, and invasive potential. Transcriptomic analysis showed the upregulation of several oncogenes and lung cancer-associated genes at the end of the exposure. Further analysis revealed an increase in differentially expressed genes over time and a temporal gradient of lung cancer-related genes. Altogether, the data suggest PET-NPLs’ potential carcinogenicity after extended exposure, highlighting serious long-term health risks of MNPLs.

However, the mechanisms driving antibiotics-induced nanoplastics aggregation under environmentally relevant conditions remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on the aggregation of four environmentally relevant nanoplastics (pristine and aged polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene). At pH 5.0, both CIP and SMX significantly promoted nanoplastics aggregation, with CIP being more potent. CIP enhanced nanoplastics aggregation through charge shielding driven by electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding (HB), and charge-assisted HB (CAHB), whereas SMX promoted aggregation solely through molecular bridging involving HB and CAHB. At pH 7.0, only CIP facilitated aggregation, while neither antibiotic induced aggregation at pH 9.0. Aged polystyrene aggregated more readily than pristine polystyrene due to increased surface functional groups. Polyethylene and polypropylene showed weaker aggregation due to fewer surface functional groups. High organic matter (OM) levels (1.65 mg/L TOC) inhibited antibiotics-induced aggregation, whereas low OM levels (16.5 μg/L TOC) were more conducive. These findings highlight that antibiotic characteristics, pH, OM levels, plastic types, and environmental aging collectively influence nanoplastics aggregation, and improve the understanding of the fate and risk of nanoplastics in natural waters."

Using the high temporal resolution ERA5 data set, we identify eight land regions where ENSO's impact on boreal winter SAT exhibits a pronounced diurnal dependence: southern North America (SNA), southern Africa (SA), western Australia (WA), southeastern South America (SESA), eastern Africa (EA), India (IN), Maritime Continent (MC), and southeastern China (SEC). In SNA, SA, and WA, ENSO effects are pronounced only during the afternoon, coinciding with daily SAT maxima. Conversely, in SESA, EA, IN, MC, and SEC, ENSO's influence is significant for seasonal‐mean SAT minima. These diurnal variations are primarily driven by the ENSO‐induced cloud‐solar radiation effect, which modulates daytime land surface heating. Additionally, temperature advection and downward longwave radiation anomalies associated with ENSO‐driven atmospheric changes contribute to the SAT responses in SESA, EA, IN, MC, and SEC."

Here, a novel estimated anvil‐outflow stability (EAS) based on the minimum stability in the upper troposphere is proposed. At the Manus site, the results show that small and large values of the LRT‐based UTS and SUT both correspond to strong divergence and frequent occurrence of high‐level ice clouds. In contrast, smaller EAS corresponds to stronger convective outflows to produce likely more high‐level ice clouds, with a strong negative correlation. In tropics, EAS better explains the geographic distribution of high‐level cloud coverage (HCC) and its temporal variations than UTS and SUT. With a strong linear correlation, EAS is likely a simple useful predictor of HCC."

However, our understanding of atmospheric INPs, particularly their sources, emissions, and spatiotemporal variability, is incomplete. While the enhancement of atmospheric INP concentrations with rainfall has been previously shown, a mechanistic understanding of the process is lacking. Here, we link detailed precipitation observations with near‐surface atmospheric INP concentrations at a semiarid grassland site in Colorado. Considering the during‐precipitation air samples, INP concentrations positively correlate with cumulative rainfall kinetic energy and amount, suggesting that INP aerosolization is induced by raindrop and hailstone impact. By additionally analyzing the INP content of precipitation water, terrestrial source samples, and heat‐treated samples, we demonstrate that local plants are the most plausible source of rain‐induced INPs during a precipitation event. Should INPs aerosolized by precipitation rise to cloud height, they could influence cloud ice fraction and initiate precipitation resulting in an aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation feedback."

Particularly, we compare the mean El Niño/La Niña radiance anomalies in the tropics to the mean normal state over 2001–2022. Modifications to the energy budget's components (absorbed solar power and emitted thermal power) exceed 10% within the western and central Pacific—up to 20% for net power. Principal component analysis results further suggest that ENSO contributes approximately 34.0%, 44.9%, and 21.3% of the total variance in absorbed power, emitted power, and net power, respectively. Finally, a comparative study between observational data and the numerical simulations suggests that current climate models cannot quantitatively capture the signals of ENSO in Earth's REB even though some of them can reproduce dominant features.

In this study, the spatiotemporal characteristics of dust events at 1941 meteorological stations in China, encompassing 13 Köppen‐Geiger climate zones, were investigated. Floating dust frequency (FDF), blowing dust frequency (BDF), dust storm frequency, and related meteorological data were analyzed to assess dust activity from 1960 to 2020. Dust events decreased significantly from 1960 to 2020, and the BDF had the greatest rate (−0.13 d y−1), while the FDF had the greatest mean frequency (4.349 d y−1). The frequency of dust events (FDE) was two orders of magnitude greater in the cold desert climate when compared with the other climate zones, although the annual wind speed was not always greater. The FDE in the nondry climate zones ranged from 0.005 d y−1 in the Aw (tropical savanna climate) to 12.34 d y−1 in the ET (polar tundra). As a nondry climate zone, the ET had more frequent dust activity than some of the other dry climate zones. Dust events were generally most active in March, April, and May. However, the most active month could occur as early as January (e.g., 1963) and as late as June (e.g., in 1967). Results show that dust activity was associated with meteorological parameters in every climate zone and that the impact of human activities (e.g., overcultivation) on dust activity was non‐negligible.

This UNIPAR was integrated into the comprehensive air quality model with extensions (CAMx) to predict SOA mass and species over the Korean Peninsula during the Korea‐US Air Quality (KORUS‐AQ) campaign in 2016. CAMx‐UNIPAR v1.4 included 10 aromatics, alkanes with different carbon lengths and branching ratios, naphthalene, isoprene, terpene, and sesquiterpene. Simulations indicated that nearly 70% of the organic aerosol mass in Seoul was associated with SOA, and more than 50% of SOA was anthropogenic. Alkane SOA was the most prominent (35%–40%), followed by terpene SOA (15%–16%) and aromatic SOA (13%). During the haze event, a large concentration of SOA formed at both ground sites and high altitudes as measured from aircraft. Aromatic SOA was somewhat sensitive to humidity. Isoprene SOA was susceptible to humidity, but its contribution was small in South Korea. In Seoul, where the NOx was rich, the simulated terpene SOA increased with increasing NOx levels, but the anthropogenic SOA formation declined slightly. A clear diurnal pattern appeared for terpene SOA, showing high SOA formation at nighttime owing to the terpene reaction with nitrate radicals to form low‐volatile organonitrates. The reduced mixing height at nighttime limited concentrations of precursors and radicals in the high altitude, and this condition suppressed the biogenic SOA formation. Anthropogenic SOA was produced mainly in the daytime when OH radicals were abundant."

In addition, we integrated high‐time resolution aerosol composition data from AMS at six representative sites in China for more detailed insights. The mass concentration of Cl− across China is notably high (1.9 ± 2.7 μg m−3) in comparison to the global average (0.3 ± 1.0 μg m−3), with a distinguished N–S pattern (North > South) and a distinct seasonality (winter > other seasons). Three categories of Cl− diurnal variations were classified, suggesting the primary combustion emission and gas/particle partitioning are the main drivers for the dynamic variation of Cl−. The good correlation between Cl− and combustion tracers corroborates the assertion that coal and biomass combustion are the main anthropogenic sources of Cl− based on emission inventory. Furthermore, the quantified environmental impacts of Cl− on ammonium balances, aerosol liquid water content, and hygroscopicity were systematically explored. In extreme cases, the Cl− can enhance 100% ALWC during polluted periods, signifying its key role in impacting the physiochemistry of aerosols. The mutual promotion between Cl− and other environment effects was also found. In summary, this study enhances our understanding of the distribution, sources, and environmental effects of Cl− across China, indicating that Cl− should be systematically considered in elucidating environment effect of fine particles."

We use a comprehensive observational data set for a nearly two‐year long period to analyze the wind system and boundary layer evolution in this high‐altitude valley and determine the reason for this early wind reversal. Days with short UV wind predominantly occur during the warm season when the valley floor is free of snow and the convective boundary layer (CBL) grows well above the height of the surrounding ridges. UV wind persists throughout the day only on a few days during the warm season. We link differences in valley wind evolution to wind direction at upper levels at and above ridge height and propose forced channeling mechanisms to describe coupling between valley and upper‐level wind when the CBL grows above ridge height. The frequency distribution of upper‐level wind direction is such that channeling in the DV direction is favored, which explains the predominance of days with short UV wind. The deep CBL is supported by the presence of a deep weakly stably stratified residual layer with high aerosol content, which is regularly present over the mountain range during the warm season. On days when the CBL does not grow above ridge height, for example, when the valley floor is covered by snow, thermally driven UV wind is able to persist throughout the day independent of upper‐level wind direction."

Quantifying potential future hazards to dunes, which are influenced by both erosional wave‐driven and accretional wind‐driven processes, is complicated by an inability to forecast the exact sequencing and magnitude of future oceanographic and meteorological forcings. Here we use a stochastic weather emulator capable of generating time series of wind and wave properties to force a reduced complexity morphologic model to assess potential accretional and erosional dune volume changes over the next century. Stable beaches with low shoreline change rates are predicted to have net accretional dunes over the next century on average. Inclusion of background beach erosion rates and sea level changes instead drives more frequent net volumetric dune erosion. At decadal scales, volume changes of the dune are shown to be dominated by the magnitude of shoreline change rate in locations that are rapidly retreating. For stable and mildly eroding shorelines (<∼ $\ \sim $ −0.3 m/yr), both shoreline changes and changes in the still water level influence timescales of dune destruction. Sets of probabilistic simulations are used to show that gradual wind‐driven sediment gains can compensate for episodic wave‐driven losses over the long term. However, in the case of higher sea levels, more frequent dune collision results in less time for dune recovery in between major storms in which case tipping points in future dune states can occur."

The Three River Source Region (TRSR) is known as the “water tower of Asia” and is an important water source region for much of southeast Asia. Spatial and temporal distributions of water balance across the TRSR have been affected by recent changing climatic conditions. However, the status and variation of water balance under the influence of environmental factors remain unclear. We employed SOILWAT2, a daily time step ecosystem water model, along with 35 years of climate data from 29 meteorological stations to characterize the hydrological dynamics of the region. Our results revealed that 15 of the sites exhibited evidence of a net water source (precipitation > actual evapotranspiration) between 1981 and 2015. These stations were predominantly located at intermediate elevations (3,400–4,100 m) and low latitudes (<34°N), while stations at lower and higher elevations as well as higher latitudes were not sources because of moisture limitations by a dry climate. In contrast to a strong spatial pattern, we found no obvious temporal trend of the net water source.

 Flash droughts—characterized by their rapid onset—can cause devastating socioeconomic and agricultural damage. During such events, soil moisture depletion is driven not only by precipitation shortages but also by the elevated atmospheric moisture demand arising due to extreme heat. However, the role of extreme heat in shaping the evolution of flash droughts and their ecological impacts remains uncertain. Here we investigate the processes involved by analysing global reanalysis data from 1950 to 2022. We find that, when flash droughts are accompanied by extreme heat, they exhibit 6.7–90.8% higher severity and 8.3–114.3% longer recovery time than flash droughts without extreme heat. The presence of extreme heat during flash droughts accelerates soil moisture drawdown over high latitudes, where wet soils and enhanced radiation foster evapotranspiration. By contrast, it slows the absolute onset speed in subtropical transitional climate zones owing to evapotranspiration throttling. Our machine learning approach further reveals that hot flash droughts lead to sharper declines in ecosystem productivity, particularly in croplands, thereby threatening global food security. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced infrastructure and ecosystem resilience to hot flash droughts in a warming future.

 Metamorphic soles beneath ophiolites are thought to record subduction initiation. However, there is ambiguity about the tectonic and thermal mechanisms operative during subduction initiation, arising partly from uncertainty in the duration of sole metamorphism. Here we use chemical mapping and diffusion speedometry of garnet crystals from the metamorphic sole of the Samail Ophiolite (Oman and United Arab Emirates) to show that high-temperature (≥750 °C) metamorphism was rapid, lasting ≤1 Myr (potentially ≤100 kyr) at peak temperature conditions. The short durations are supported by zircon U–Pb ages and new garnet–whole-rock–zircon Lu–Hf data from the same rocks, contrasting with previous inferences for ≥8 Myr metamorphic durations. These observations are nominally consistent with the spontaneous sinking of a dense lower plate. However, the rapid metamorphic timescales cannot be accounted for solely by conductive thermal equilibration with juxtaposed oceanic mantle. One potential explanation is dissipative heating driven by relative motion across the nascent plate interface. This interpretation accounts for the timescales, the spatial pattern of metamorphism and the global similarities in sole pressure–temperature conditions independent of other geodynamic variables.

 TIM3, a T-cell inhibitory receptor, is expressed on exhausted T cells in the TME. Progressive loss of IL2-secretion is an early sign of diminished effector function in TILs, which raises the possibility of IL2 loss driving exhaustion of TILs. We show that endogenous IL-2 is required for the antitumor effect of anti-TIM3. Selective delivery of IL-2 to TIM3high TILs via an engineered anti-TIM3-Pro-IL2 fusion enhances anti-TIM3 efficacy, while reducing IL2 toxicity. IL2 activity is inhibited at the acidic pH of the TME, thus an IL2 mutein (IL2V2) with sustained activity at low pH is integrated into the construct. Mechanistically, TIM3-ProIL2V2 not only reactivates TIM3+ TILs but also facilitates the activation and expansion of TIM3- TILs, which in turn provide a sustained source of effector T cells. TIM3-ProIL2V2 is efficient in multiple tumor models, including tumors in humanized mice. TIM3-ProIL2V2 has the potential to overcome anti-PD-1/L1 resistance in cold cancers.

 Energy efficiency and quantum advantage are two important features of quantum devices. We here report an experimental realization that combines both features in a quantum engine coupled to a quantum battery that stores the produced work, using a single ion in a linear Paul trap. We begin by establishing the quantum nature of the device by observing nonclassical work oscillations with the number of cycles as verified by energy measurements of the battery. We moreover apply shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques to suppress quantum friction and improve work production. While the average energy cost of the shortcut protocol is only about 3%, the work output is enhanced by up to approximately 33%, making the machine significantly more energy efficient. We additionally show that the quantum engine consistently outperforms its classical counterpart in this regime.

 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an essential RNA modification that regulates gene expression and influences diverse cellular processes. Yet, fully characterizing its transcriptome-wide landscape and biogenesis mechanisms remains challenging. Traditional next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods rely on short-reads aggregation, overlooking the inherent heterogeneity of RNA transcripts. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) platforms offer direct RNA sequencing (DRS) at the resolution of individual RNA molecules, enabling simultaneous detection of RNA modifications and RNA processing events. In this study, we introduce SingleMod, a deep learning model tailored for precise detection of m6A modification on individual RNA molecules from DRS data. SingleMod innovatively employs a multiple instance regression (MIR) framework, leveraging extensive methylation-rate labels provided by the quantitative NGS-based method, and achieves ROC AUC and PR AUC of ~0.95 for single-molecule m6A prediction. Applying SingleMod to human cell lines, we systematically dissect the transcriptome-wide m6A landscape at single-molecule and single-base resolution, characterizing m6A heterogeneity in RNA molecules from the same transcript. Through comparative analyzes across eight diverse species, we quantitatively elucidate three distinct m6A distribution patterns correlated with phylogenetic relationships and suggest divergent regulatory mechanisms. This study provides a framework for understanding the shaping of epitranscriptome in a single-molecule perspective.

 Widespread expansion of agriculture and forestry has altered the surface of the Earth, the composition of the atmosphere, and as a result, the climate. Here we quantify the radiative forcing caused by the historical deforestation of an ecoregion in the U.S. Upper Midwest and the adoption of eight nature-based climate solutions. We combined regional forest inventory data with over three decades of remote sensing and in situ data from a replicated land use change experiment. Deforestation of the region caused net global warming (1626 ± 44 µW m-2), mainly from the 76 % reduction of ecosystem carbon stocks, but also from the 84 % reduction of the soil methane sink and the 115 % increase in soil nitrous oxide emissions. The associated albedo increase offset 24 % of this greenhouse gas induced warming. For the adoption of nature-based climate solutions, we found that conservation agriculture can provide -39 to -76 ± 31 µW m-2 of climate mitigation over a 100-year time period while short/medium length forestry rotations can provide more at -296 to -881 ± 44 µW m-2 and natural forest regeneration can provide the most at -1555 ± 44 µW m-2.

Joshua West,Landscape controls on water availability limit revegetation after artisanal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon,"Post-mining areas in the Madre de Dios region of Peru exhibit altered water infiltration dynamics that hinder revegetation, according to remote sensing, electrical resistivity imaging, and soil property measurements. 
 Deforestation from artisanal, small-scale gold mining is transforming large regions of the tropics, from lush rainforest to barren collections of tailings and ponds. Natural forest regeneration is slow due to dramatic soil changes, and existing reforestation strategies are failing. Here we combine remote sensing, electrical resistivity imaging, and measurements of soil properties to characterize post-mining areas in the Madre de Dios region, Peru. We find that the post-mining landscape has dramatically changed water infiltration dynamics, driving decreases in subsurface water availability and presenting a major barrier to revegetation. Mining tailings are extremely hydraulically conductive, allowing for 14.76 m day−1 infiltration relative to 0.074 m day−1 in primary forest soils, leading to lower average soil moisture and extreme temperatures (60 °C). Electrical resistivity imaging reveals a highly resistive, 1.5–2 m deep layer of dry sand across the mining landscape. Areas close to the water table (e.g., pond edges) show higher soil moisture, lower temperatures, and greater natural regeneration compared to topographically elevated tailings. Our results suggest that access to water should be prioritized when targeting reforestation sites, potentially requiring large-scale geomorphological reconfiguration. As gold mining is expected to expand, responsible practices and remediation strategies must account for the critical yet often overlooked role of water. Post-mining areas in the Madre de Dios region of Peru exhibit altered water infiltration dynamics that hinder revegetation, according to remote sensing, electrical resistivity imaging, and soil property measurements."
10.1038/s43247-025-02385-z,False,Communications Earth & Environment,这篇研究论文主要关注的是洪水灾害后，房屋所有者如何进行灾后适应，以及保险在其中的作用。研究使用了来自荷兰、比利时和德国的719名受洪水影响的房屋所有者的调查数据。论文探讨了金融、制度和心理因素对家庭适应的限制，发现保险赔偿与洪水后的私人适应行为相关，但当洪水造成的损失超过房屋重建价值的60%时，房屋所有者可能会认为私人适应措施效果不佳，从而转向搬迁到更安全的地区。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Thijs Endendijk;Daniela Rodriguez Castro;Lisa Dillenardt;Ravi Kumar Guntu;W.

Aerts,Flood experience and access to insurance contribute to differences in homeowners’ post-disaster adaptation in a cross-border region of Western Europe,"Homeowners are more likely to take flood adaptation measures after experiencing damage, mainly when supported by insurance, and this effect weakens with extreme damage, according to an analysis that uses survey data from 719 flooded homeowners in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. 
 The July 2021 floods in Europe stand out as one of the most devastating flood-related disasters to impact the continent in recent years, affecting multiple countries at once. As climate change intensifies, such cross-border disasters are expected to become more frequent. Here we use unique cross-country survey data from flooded homeowners to understand the patterns and limits of how households in different nations respond to shared flood crises. We find evidence of financial, institutional, and psychological limits to household adaptation. Insurance compensation is associated with private adaptation actions shortly after flooding. Households that suffered flood damage are more likely to mitigate future risks to their homes. Yet, this intention encounters limits for extreme flood damage. Once experienced flood damages exceed a threshold of around 60% of the home reconstruction value, homeowners begin to view private adaptation efforts as less effective, prompting a shift toward relocating to safer areas. Homeowners are more likely to take flood adaptation measures after experiencing damage, mainly when supported by insurance, and this effect weakens with extreme damage, according to an analysis that uses survey data from 719 flooded homeowners in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany."
10.1038/s43247-025-02404-z,False,Communications Earth & Environment,该研究论文主要关注冰川消融后，暴露的地表从净碳汇转变为碳源的过程。通过对格陵兰西南部一个部分冰川消融的流域进行水样采集和同位素分析，发现冰川融水中的活性溶解有机碳浓度较低，促进了新鲜碎屑沉积物的风化，从而导致二氧化碳的净封存。相反，土壤中的水反应增强了甲烷的生成和二氧化碳的产生，从而在有机碳再矿化时产生温室气体源。虽然涉及温室气体，但该研究侧重于地表过程和水文地球化学，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联性较弱。,"['carbon dioxide', 'methane', 'greenhouse gases', 'glacial meltwater', 'soil water']",A.

Bennett,Glacial retreat converts exposed landscapes from net carbon sinks to sources,"Weathering of fresh comminuted sediment during glacial to interglacial transitions can result in net carbon dioxide sinks, whereas enhanced methanogenesis in deglaciated soils acts as a source of greenhouses gases, according to a water sampling and isotope analysis in southwest Greenland. 
 Retreat of continental ice sheets exposes comminuted sediment in disequilibrium with non-glacial conditions. Weathering of this sediment may create climate feedbacks by altering exchange of greenhouse gases between atmosphere and landscapes. Here we show in a partially deglaciated watershed in southwest Greenland that glacial meltwater contains low concentrations of reactive dissolved organic carbon that enhances weathering of freshly comminuted sediment causing net sequestration of carbon dioxide. In contrast, soil water reactions enhance methanogenesis and carbon dioxide production and create greenhouse gas sources as organic carbon is remineralized. We suggest that a change from greenhouse gas sinks in glacial meltwater to greenhouse gas sources in soil water creates a switch from a negative to positive warming feedback during glacial-interglacial transitions, but a negative warming feedback may return with future anthropogenic warming, glacial retreat, and increased meltwater production. We anticipate changing weathering reactions following exposure also alter nutrient and radiogenic isotope exports.
