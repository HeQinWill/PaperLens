The reduced-complexity climate model MAGICC was used to quantify future national warming contributions for Ireland (a country with high per-capita CH4 emissions driven by large-scale dairy and beef production) under a business-as-usual pathway and three alternative scenarios: (1) TN, (2) a split-gas emission target, or (3) net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. TN implicitly ‘grandfathers’ CH4 emissions, ‘rewarding’ modest emission reductions even when per capita warming remains high, thereby shifting the mitigation burden and constraining the developmental space for low-income, food-insecure countries. Weaker CH4 emission reduction ambition, i.e. use of TN at the national level, is often justified on the basis of protecting global food security, because it can avoid ‘emission leakage’ from countries that export livestock products with below-average GHG intensities. However, this study demonstrates such justifications have little merit given that global trade in animal-sourced foods largely benefits wealthy markets, and often relies on imported feed, contributing to indirect land use change. The study concludes that the TN approach is not a robust basis for fair and effective national climate policy, and risks a potentially costly underestimation of both long-term CH4 mitigation and carbon dioxide removal in the context of national planning for an equitable, sustainable, food secure future."

Here we show that differential adaptive capacities, as a set of capabilities as well as assets, are distributed unevenly by gender leading to divergent choices between adaptation options in places and communities at risk. We demonstrate how gendered adaptive capacities impacts household in-situ adaptation and migration as adaptation to climate shocks. We use data from surveys of adults within rural households across localities in Mali, Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia in 2022 and 2023 (6656 respondents from 3328 households) and employ negative binomial regression analysis to investigate how gendered adaptive capacity impacts household adaptation to climate shocks. Results indicate that adaptive capacity significantly enhances household adaptation, with a pronounced gender gap observed across most capacity domains. This disparity limits household’s ability to respond effectively to climate shocks and poses a critical challenge for inclusive adaptation planning. Mobility also emerges as a critical strategy for increasing in-situ adaptation uptake. The findings imply that policies will be more effective if they address gender-specific challenges and support both migrants and immobile rural populations equitably. Recognising women’s roles in managing remittances and livelihoods is crucial for resilience, highlighting the importance of integrating a gender perspective into adaptation policies. This includes gender-equal access to education, professional organisations, legal protection, and the empowerment of women in adaptation initiatives."

Doherty;Ryan Eastman,"Building a comprehensive library of observed Lagrangian trajectories for testing modeled cloud evolution, aerosol–cloud interactions, and marine cloud brightening","In this study, we explore how marine clouds interact with aerosols. We introduce a novel approach to identify a reduced number of representative cases from a wide array of observed environmental conditions prevalent in the Northeast Pacific. We create over 2200 trajectories from observations and use cloud-resolving simulations to investigate how marine low clouds evolve in two different cases. It is shown that aerosols can delay cloud breakup, but their impact depends on precipitation. 
 As the evolution of marine low clouds is sensitive to the current state of the atmosphere and varying meteorological forcing, it is crucial to ascertain how cloud responses differ across a spectrum of those conditions. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to encompass a wide array of conditions prevalent in low marine cloud regions by creating a comprehensive library of observed environmental conditions. Using reanalysis and satellite data, over 2200 Lagrangian trajectories are generated within the stratocumulus deck region of the Northeast Pacific during summer 2018–2021. By using eight important cloud-controlling factors (CCFs), we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of data. This technique demonstrates that two principal components capture 43 % of the variability among CCFs. Notably, PCA facilitates the selection of a reduced number of trajectories (e.g., 54) that represent a diverse array of the observed CCF, aerosol, and cloud variability and co-variability. These trajectories can then be used for process model studies, e.g., with large-eddy simulations (LES), to evaluate the efficacy of marine cloud brightening. Two distinct cases are selected to initiate 2 d long, high-resolution, large-domain LES experiments. The results highlight the ability of our LES to simulate observed conditions. Although perturbed aerosols delay cloud breakup and enhance the cloud radiative effect, the strength of such effects is sensitive to “precipitation-aerosol feedback”. The first case is precipitating and shows the potential for “precipitation-driven” cloud breakup due to positive precipitation-aerosol feedback. The second case is non-precipitating with classic cloud breakup of the “deepening-warming” type, highlighting the impact of entrainment."

This long-range transport induces widespread haziness over southern India, lasting for days. We evaluated the occurrence of such transport episodes over southern India using observational methods and found that it suppresses the boundary layer height by approximately 40 % compared to clear days, while exacerbating the surface pollution by approximately 50 %–60 %. 
 Anticyclonic wind circulation is prevalent over India during the winter season, causing advection of air masses from northern India towards southeastern coastal Indian and the adjoining Bay of Bengal (BoB) regions. In this study, we use a synergy of satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based measurements to characterize the phenomenon of regional transport episodes (RTEs) and their impact on the boundary layer height and air quality over Chennai, a tropical South Asian megacity. The long-term satellite data and back-trajectory analysis enable us to detect the occurrence of RTE over Chennai, which persists for a duration of 2–4 d. The transported aerosol is generally located at altitudes of ∼ 1–3 km along the eastern coast of India. The duration of these RTEs in the winter season over Chennai accounts for ∼ 10 %–15 % of the days, which demonstrates an increasing trend over the last decade. Radiosonde analysis over the five sites located en route to the transport pathway illustrates distinct aerosol-associated warming (1–1.5 K) at altitudes corresponding to these elevated layers and hence a strong enhancement in lower-tropospheric stability during the RTE. In agreement, the regional aerosol/haze transport significantly reduces the boundary layer height to less than 1 km compared to haze-free (clear) days (∼ 2–2.5 km), mainly during the ensuing period of boundary layer evolution over the eastern coast. Consequently, an increase in PM2.5 concentration over Chennai is observed (∼ 50 %–60 %) during RTE compared to background days. This study provides robust observational evidence of the importance of regional transport of aerosols for the air quality of downwind megacities and warrants more observational and modeling studies in the future."

Robinson;Steven S. Brown;Pete M. Edwards,The determination of ClNO2 via thermal dissociation–tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy,"Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is a reservoir of chlorine atoms and nitrogen oxides, both of which play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. However, all ambient ClNO2 observations so far have been made by a single technique, mass spectrometry, which needs complex calibrations. Here, we present a laser-based method that detects ClNO2 (TD-TILDAS – thermal dissociation–tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectrometry) without the need for complicated calibrations. The results show excellent agreement between these two methods from both laboratory and ambient samples. 
 Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is a reservoir species of chlorine atoms and nitrogen oxides, both of which play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. To date, all ambient ClNO2 observations have been obtained by chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). In this work, thermal dissociation–tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectrometry (TD-TILDAS) is shown to be a viable method for quantifying ClNO2 in laboratory and field settings. This technique relies on the thermal dissociation of ClNO2 to create chlorine radicals, which undergo fast reactions with hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen chloride (HCl) that is detectable by the TILDAS instrument. Complete quantitative conversion of ClNO2 to HCl was achieved at temperatures > 400 °C, achieving 1 Hz measurement precision of 11 ± 1 pptv (3σ limits of detection of 34 ± 2 pptv) during laboratory comparisons with other ClNO2 detection methods. After blank and line loss corrections, method accuracy is estimated to be within ± 5 %. Performance metrics of TD-TILDAS during ambient sampling were a 1 Hz precision of 19 ± 1 pptv and 3σ limits of detection of 57 ± 3 pptv, which is directly comparable to previously reported ClNO2 detection by quadrupole CIMS. Thus, TD-TILDAS can provide an alternative analytical approach for a direct measurement of ClNO2 that can complement existing datasets and future studies. The quantitative nature of TD-TILDAS also makes it a potentially useful tool for the calibration of CIMS instruments. However, interpretation of ambient data may be complicated by potential interferences from unaccounted-for sources of thermolabile chlorine, such as ClNO, chloramines, and organochlorides."

 In this study, we analyzed the particle characteristics and cloud droplet growth properties of NaCl and CaCl2, which are powder-type hygroscopic materials applied in cloud seeding experiments, using the Korea Cloud Physics Experimental Chamber (K-CPEC) facility at the Korea Meteorological Administration/National Institute of Meteorological Sciences (KMA/NIMS) in South Korea. The aerosol chamber (volume 28.3 m3) enabled the observation of particle characteristics in an extremely dry environment (relative humidity (RH) < 1 %) that was clean enough to ignore the influence of background aerosols. The cloud chamber featured a double-structure design, with an outer (130 m3) and inner (22.4 m3) chamber. The inner chamber allowed the precise control of air pressure (1013.25–30 hPa) and wall temperature (−70–60 °C), facilitating cloud droplet growth through quasi-adiabatic expansion. In this study, a cloud chamber experiment was conducted to simulate both wet adiabatic and stable environmental lapse rate conditions. The experiments were initiated at low RH (< 60 %), and the variations in the cloud droplet concentration and diameter were observed as RH increased, leading to supersaturation (RH > 100 %) and subsequent cloud droplet formation. NaCl and CaCl2 powders showed distinct particle growth behaviors owing to the differences in their deliquescence and hygroscopicity. The rate of cloud droplet formation in the NaCl powder experiments was slower than that for CaCl2; however, the mean and maximum droplet diameters were approximately 2–3 and 10–20 µm larger, respectively. The particle diameter, including aerosols and droplets, varied from 1 to 90 µm, and large cloud droplets (30–50 µm) that served as the basis for drizzle embryo formation were also observed.

Consequently, microbial communities in many terrestrial and subsurface Earth environments could be exposed to elevated hydrogen concentrations. Hydrogen stimulates metabolic processes that reduce aqueous chemical species, such as bicarbonate or sulfate, that can exchange with solid mineral phases, but the controls on microbial hydrogenotrophy with mineral sources of electron acceptors are not fully understood. Herein, we applied laboratory experiments and biogeochemical modeling to study the response of a natural microbial community to an elevated partial pressure of hydrogen in the presence of carbonate minerals of varying composition, solubility, and size. Experimental incubations and simulation results showed that hydrogen consumption by microbial communities was initially dominated by sulfate reduction and, subsequently, transitioned to acetogenesis and methanogenesis. The rates of acetogenesis and methanogenesis were not correlated with the solubility of carbonate minerals. Instead, we observed strong linear correlations between the rates and surface area of carbonate minerals. Methane and acetate production slowed down in all incubations after about 2 weeks of incubation, although biogeochemical modeling predicted that the metabolic processes were not thermodynamically limited. Electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy showed that biofilms with diverse microorganisms grew on the carbonates during this period. The methane δ13C value significantly increased, consistent with slower growth at elevated pH. This work highlights that microbial communities form biofilm on carbonate mineral surfaces as a response to hydrogen and that biofilm formation could pose a strong kinetic limitation to hydrogenotrophic metabolism utilizing carbonate minerals."

Current antifouling strategies often fail to improve treatment performance, necessitating dual-functional solutions. Here, we integrated a simple electro-Fenton system into an anammox MBR to concurrently achieve sustainable fouling mitigation and enhanced nitrogen removal. At 0.05 mA/cm2, the system demonstrated: (1) exceptional hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation for foulant degradation and bacterial inactivation on membranes, and (2) highly selective electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3–) reduction to nitrite (NO2–, >90% selectivity) with minimal ammonium production. Implemented in an anammox MBR through cathodic iron mesh integration on the membrane module, it achieved remarkable performance over 151 days of operation: 84.1% longer fouling cycles, 93.9% nitrogen-removal efficiency, 19.4% energy savings, and 22.5% lower antifouling costs compared to the control. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the system’s dual benefits stem from synergistic •OH-mediated fouling control and enhanced nitrogen removal through selective NO3–-to-NO2– conversion coupled with NO2– recycling in the anammox process, boosting treatment efficiency by 9.1%. This work presents a groundbreaking and sustainable electro-Fenton approach that simultaneously addresses membrane fouling and enhances nitrogen removal, advancing energy-efficient anammox processes in mainstream wastewater treatment while inspiring multifunctional MBR antifouling strategies."

We identified 203 nonredundant nitrogenase iron proteins (NifH) and 140 diazotroph genomes. They were affiliated with diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa and could comprise half of the community. Methanotrophic Methylomonadaceae emerged as the most abundant and active diazotrophs in methane-rich groundwater systems. These microorganisms, along with diazotrophic methanogens, anaerobic methanotrophs, and methylotrophs, highlighted a strong linkage between nitrogen fixation and the methane cycle. In addition, sulfur-cycling diazotrophs, including chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic sulfur oxidizers and sulfate reducers, were ubiquitous and showed metabolic versatility in varying geochemical conditions. Proteomes further suggested active nitrogen fixation by both methane- and sulfur-associated diazotrophs.

Sandbar restoration, including active restoration (AR) and passive recovery (PR), is essential for maintaining riverine ecology integrity, especially in dam-regulated rivers where sandbars are susceptible to hydrological alterations. However, when and how to integrate AR and PR, considering both effectiveness and efficiency, remains a question.

Integration of PR and AR showed excellent resilience after floods. The optimal timing of integration comes when sandbar morphological stability index reaches a moderate level (<0.05) through PR and hydrological conditions are favorable (submergence periods < 60 days and inundation depths < 1 m).

This study reveals the crucial role of halogens in reducing leachate toxicity by examining the photodegradation of SDMPs in freshwater and seawater settings. Microplastics (MPs) extracted from three different commercial sunscreens, predominantly composed of methacrylate-based polymers, exhibited reduced photodegradation, leachate release, and leachate transformation in seawater. The diminished degradation in seawater can be attributed to halogens, especially bromide (Br–), which hinder photocatalytic oxidation by suppressing the activity of hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Consequently, leachates from SDMPs photoaged in seawater exhibited notably reduced cytotoxicity, as evidenced by minimal mitochondrial dysfunction involving mitochondrial dehydrogenases and membrane potential, fragmented mitochondria, and regulated metabolic processes. This included the alleviation of amino acid catabolism inhibition, coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis inhibition, glycolysis activation, and the enhancement of the compensatory antioxidant system. In the absence of halogen protection, photodegradation is predicted to produce oxidative byproducts such as hydroperoxides as toxic agents that induce cytotoxicity in the freshwater leachate. These findings underscore the critical influence of water chemistry on shaping the photodegradation and toxicity of SDMP leachates, emphasizing the necessity of conducting region-specific risk assessments for MPs in personal care products."

Here, we systematically explored the nanoscale formation, composition, and stability of Fe–As colloids in high-As contaminated groundwater following the addition of Fe salts under oxic conditions. Batch experiments show that total aqueous As is incorporated into settled particles upon adding Fe(II) and Fe(III). However, we also observe substantial release of Fe–As colloids (168–719 nm), which can remain stably suspended in water for more than 9 days. Higher colloid concentrations and stability occurred at lower molar Fe/As ratios (Fe/As < 5.8), suggesting that colloid-facilitated transport may dominate secondary As mobilization. Colloid characterization confirmed that low Fe/As ratios promote the formation of stable colloids enriched with surface-bound As, with electrostatic interactions stabilizing the colloids. Using advanced analytical and computational techniques, we elucidate the nanoscale structural properties of colloids, showing that As(V) inhibits Fe octahedral polymerization and favors the formation of smaller particles. These mechanistic insights are crucial for evaluating the long-term fate and transport of sequestered As and designing effective groundwater remediation strategies."

Giammar,Selenium(VI) Removal from Challenge Waters by Continuous-Flow-Through Iron Electrocoagulation,"Iron electrocoagulation (EC) is promising for selenium(VI) removal from water. This study investigated the performance of flow-through iron EC under environmentally relevant conditions. The influence of water composition on Se removal and the mechanisms by which water components affect Se removal were studied. The individual effects of major anions (bicarbonate, sulfate, and nitrate) and humic acid on selenate removal were examined under pH 8 anoxic conditions, at which selenate removal was previously demonstrated to be effective in a simple water composition. Bicarbonate inhibited Se removal by promoting the formation of less reactive iron solids (carbonate-containing green rust). Sulfate inhibited the oxidation and transformation of iron solids, thereby limiting their reactivity with selenate. Nitrate and humic acid had a smaller impact on Se removal compared to bicarbonate and sulfate. Building on the work with individual constituents, flow-through EC was applied to treat challenge waters that represent mining discharge, agricultural runoff, and flue-gas desulfurization wastewater. Sulfate and ionic strength were major inhibitors for Se removal in those waters, and an iron dose of 240 mg/L was required for effective Se removal. Pretreatment to remove sulfate improved the EC performance for Se removal from agriculture and mining wastewater, but it had little effect for flue-gas desulfurization wastewater. The impact of major anions and humic acid on solids formation, redox, and adsorption in flow-through EC processes provided valuable insights into removal mechanisms and practical guidance for predicting EC performance in real-world water treatment."

In this study, polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) and human serum albumin (HSA) were chosen as representative models of NPs and proteins, respectively. The photoaged PSNPs exhibited decreased particle size and increased surface oxidation, which not only promoted their binding with HSA but also led to preferential binding with the α-helix regions of HSA. Consequently, the α-helical content of the adsorbed HSA molecules on photoaged PSNPs decreased significantly, leading to a denaturation effect comparable to thermal treatment. Dissolved substances released from PSNPs had a negligible impact on HSA’s conformation. The denatured HSA activated additional endocytic pathways, notably enhancing SR-A1-mediated endocytosis of mouse monocyte macrophages (RAW 264.7), which thus promoted the cellular uptake of the photoaged PSNPs compared with pristine ones. This study suggests that photoaging may greatly alter the interactions of NPs with proteins, thereby influencing cellular uptake mechanisms, and then alter their potential biodistribution and biological effects in vivo."

The dominant acidifying influence arises from CF2 groups at C1 and C2 near COOH or SO3H. The unusually low pKa values for TFA, PFOA, and GenX reflect our low-MeOH, sorption-resistant NMR method.

Specifically, we collocated 10 sensors during the wet season and 20 sensors during the dry season, collecting one month of colocation data per season, covering a wide range of pollution levels and meteorological conditions. Quality-assured hourly concentrations from different PurpleAir units have shown good consistency, with pairwise R2 values generally exceeding 0.95. We developed empirical correction models by testing 29 multiple linear regression (MLR) forms and Random Forest models. Results showed that for hourly average PM2.5 concentrations measured by PurpleAir, a simple linear correction model achieved an accuracy (nRMSE) within 17–18% of hourly BAM measurements. More complex MLR models incorporating several meteorological variables and interaction terms improved accuracy (nRMSE) slightly, to ∼15%. Random Forest models slightly outperformed all MLR models, at 12–14% (nRMSE) accuracy relative to BAM. Our findings highlight that existing correction models─particularly those developed for U.S. cities and used in the PurpleAir map─are inadequate for Bangladeshi conditions.

Combining station observation with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model outputs, we demonstrate that the 2023‐like heavy precipitation event was exacerbated by anthropogenic enhanced moisture transport. External forcing increased the probability of extreme southeasterly moisture transport by approximately 1.3 (90% confidence interval: 1.0–1.8) times. Moreover, the total anthropogenic forcing likely increased the probability of similar precipitation events at least 1.7 times (1.0–3.1), with both greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols contributing positively.

The utilization of radar data assimilation greatly improves the simulated results comparing against observations, strengthening the robustness of analyses in this work. The simulation with AH effect produces the most accurate results compared to observations, exhibiting approximately 62% larger spatial extent of heavy rainfall (>30 mm) and twice the area of strong winds (>10.8 m s−1) compared to the non‐AH simulation. Additionally, the top 1% rain rates and surface winds from the AH‐included simulation are about 25% stronger and 23% greater, respectively, relative to the non‐AH counterpart. On the one hand, higher AH flux tends to enhance the values of convective available potential energy and vertical wind shear within urban areas on average, providing favorable thermodynamic environmental conditions for convective development. On the other hand, greater AH effect triggers stronger convective cell, leading to a more intense merged system. This cell plays a crucial role in the merger process and the formation of bow echo, but it does not persist sufficiently in the non‐AH simulation. A third sensitivity simulation, excluding the urban land cover, produces results comparable to those of the non‐AH simulation. This study quantifies the relative contribution of the AH effect to the evolution of convective systems and the associated weather‐related hazards over the Greater Bay Area, underscoring the significant impacts of AH forcing on the regional flow patterns and the corresponding convection dynamics."

Here, coastal tundra ecosystems, wildlife, and indigenous communities are highly vulnerable to sea‐ice loss in the Bering Sea, sea‐level rise, storm flooding, erosion, and collapsing ground from permafrost thaw caused by climate warming. These drivers interact in non‐linear ways to increase flooding, salinization, and sedimentation, and thus, alter ecosystem trajectories and broader landscape evolution. Rapid changes in these factors over decadal time scales are highly likely to cause transformative shifts in coastal ecosystems across roughly 70% of the outer delta this century. We project saline and brackish ecotypes on the active delta floodplain with frequent sedimentation will maintain dynamic equilibrium with sea‐level rise and flooding, slightly brackish ecotypes on the inactive floodplain with infrequent flooding and low sedimentation rates will be vulnerable to increased flooding and likely transition to more saline and brackish ecotypes, and fresh lacustrine and lowland ecotypes on the abandoned floodplain with permafrost plateaus will be vulnerable to thermokarst, salinization and flooding that will shift them toward brackish ecosystems. This will greatly affect bird nesting and foraging habitats, with both winners and losers. Already, some Yup'ik communities are facing relocation of their low‐lying villages. The societal challenges and consequences of adapting to these changing landscapes are enormous and will require a huge societal effort."

However, changes in SOS under future climate scenarios remain unclear. Therefore, this study uses remote sensing‐based SOS data sets and bio‐climatic variables to develop pixel‐level SOS simulation models through machine learning methods. Future SOS predictions for boreal forest regions are made using climate data from four emission scenarios: SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585. The results show that two machine learning models exhibit good simulation performance across the study area, with the RMSE for most pixels controlled within 9 days. Furthermore, predictions of future SOS based on these two models suggest that under all four emission scenarios, the SOS in boreal forest regions shows a significant advancing trend. Notably, as emission levels increase, the advancing trend in SOS becomes more pronounced. However, there are variations in the trends observed for different vegetation types. Our findings emphasize that the advancing trend in SOS differs under various emission scenarios and exhibits distinct vegetation type‐specific and spatial distribution patterns. These changes will have profound implications for biodiversity and ecosystem stability."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial yet underexplored regulators of inflammation, particularly in Cb pathogenesis. Employing a comparative transcriptomic analysis of THP-1 macrophages infected with 16 different microbes, we dissect a core set of immune-responsive lncRNAs such as MAILR, LINC01215, PACER, and MROCKI-common to human anti-pathogen responses, and distinguish them from lncRNAs specifically altered at early (1 h) time points in individual infections. In particular, our approach identifies lncRNA CYP1B1-AS1 as specifically upregulated in a spatiotemporal manner along with CYP1B1 in cis during Cb infection. Promoter assays confirm their co-regulation via a shared bidirectional promoter, while aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-lucia luciferase and nuclear translocation assays demonstrate that Cb infection activates AHR, driving their transcription. Knockdown of CYP1B1-AS1 or CYP1B1 alone disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis, increases ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and exacerbates apoptosis during infection. These findings position the CYP1B1-AS1/CYP1B1 axis as a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis under AHR signaling, supporting an intracellular environment that benefits Cb replication. Our results highlight the critical roles of lncRNAs in immune regulation and provide a valuable resource for future lncRNA research. In this work, authors utilise comparative transcriptomics to reveal lncRNAs that distinguish pathogen-specific from core macrophage responses.

 Obesity-related conditions are among the leading causes of preventable death and are increasing in prevalence worldwide. Body size and composition are complex traits that are challenging to characterize due to environmental and genetic influences, longitudinal variation, heterogeneity between sexes, and differing health risks based on adipose distribution. Here, we construct a 4-factor genomic structural equation model using 18 measures, unveiling shared and distinct genetic architectures underlying birth size, abdominal size, adipose distribution, and adiposity. Multivariate genome-wide associations reveal the adiposity factor is enriched specifically in neural tissues and pathways, while adipose distribution is enriched more broadly across physiological systems. In addition, polygenic scores for the adiposity factor predict many adverse health outcomes, while those for body size and composition predict a more limited subset. Finally, we characterize the factors’ genetic correlations with obesity-related traits and examine the druggable genome by constructing a bipartite drug-gene network to identify potential therapeutic targets.

 The upcycling of waste polyesters into high-value chemicals offers a sustainable and economically viable solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Herein, we report a general esterolysis strategy for the efficient depolymerization of polyesters to produce high-value ester products, utilizing a broad range of esters, including carboxylates, carbonates, and C/Si/Ti/P-based esters. Using the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate as a highly effective catalyst, polyethylene terephthalate is selectively converted into dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene carbonate with remarkable yields of 99% and 90%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that methanol, generated in situ via the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate-catalyzed hydrolysis of dimethyl carbonate, drives the cleavage of C–O ester bonds in polyethylene terephthalate. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability, achieving high conversion efficiencies across various mixed and colored commercial waste polyesters. The energy efficiency and versatility of this approach establish a transformative route to diverse high-value esters, advancing the development of circular plastic economies and sustainable chemistry.

Here, authors synthesized mirror-like, large-grained graphite films with minimal defects using Ni-Mo alloy melts, achieving high electrical and thermal conductivity and strong mechanical properties. 
 Graphite films with large grain sizes have been reportedly obtained by using metal as catalysts, but the obtained graphite is mostly heavily wrinkled, thus containing defects that degrade its properties. We report the synthesis of mirror-like and large-grained graphite films with only a few nano kinks and controllable dimensions, achieved by using flat Ni-Mo alloy melts of the same lateral dimensions as the metal foils used to make this alloy melt. The graphite film exhibited few nano kinks and a mirror-like appearance because the deliberate evaporation of much of the Ni produced a porous substrate, which in turn dramatically weakened the substrate-graphite film interaction before cooling. The mirror-like graphite appears to be 100% AB-stacked with millimeter-sized grains that are much larger than the multi-micron grain size of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and rivaled in size only by a small percentage of natural graphite. Our graphite films have an electrical conductivity of 2.25 × 104 S cm−1 at 300 K. Tensile loading of macroscale samples showed an average Young’s modulus of 969 ± 69 GPa and average fracture strength of 1.29 ± 0.203 GPa, and Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance revealed an average in-plane thermal conductivity of 2034.4 ± 68 W m−1·K−1.

 Citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), released from immune cells during early sepsis, drives a vicious cycle of inflammation through excessive NETosis and pyroptosis, causing immune dysfunction and tissue damage. To regulate this process, we develop a humanized CitH3 monoclonal antibody (hCitH3-mAb) with high affinity and specificity to target this process. In murine models, hCitH3-mAb reduces cytokine production, mortality and acute lung injury (ALI) caused by LPS and Pseudomonas aeruginosa while enhancing bacteria phagocytosis in the lungs, spleen, and liver. Using pre-equilibrium digital ELISA (PEdELISA), we identify an optimal therapeutic window for hCitH3-mAb in sepsis-induced ALI. In parallel, we explore the molecular mechanism underlying CitH3-driven inflammation. We find that in macrophages, CitH3 activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), triggering Ca2+-dependent PAD2 auto-citrullination and nuclear translocation, amplifying CitH3 production via a harmful feedback loop. The hCitH3-mAb treatment effectively disrupts this cycle and restores macrophage function under septic conditions. Together, these findings highlight both the therapeutic potential of hCitH3-mAb and provide a deep mechanistic insight into the CitH3–PAD2 axis in sepsis, supporting its further development for treating immune-mediated diseases.

 The Great Oxidation Event marks the first substantial increase in atmospheric oxygen on Earth. Despite the oxygenic photosynthesis that emerged hundreds of million years before this event, the specific biogeochemical mechanisms responsible for maintaining low oxygen levels for an extended period remain elusive. Here, we show the critical role of urea as a nitrogen source for cyanobacteria, the cascading impact of nickel on abiotic urea production, and their combined effects on the proliferation of cyanobacteria leading to the great oxidation event. Urea formation was experimentally evaluated under simulated Archean conditions and cyanobacterial growth was monitored providing urea as the nitrogen source. Our findings demonstrate that urea can be produced in the Archean cyanobacterial habitats with UV-C irradiation, shedding light on the controversy regarding the evolution of nitrogen-fixing enzymes in primitive cyanobacteria. We propose that environmental conditions in the early Archean, characterized by elevated urea and nickel concentration, may have hindered cyanobacterial expansion, contributing to the delay between the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the onset of the great oxidation event.

PM2.5 levels are significantly higher in census tracts with these operations than in those without: 28% higher in tracts with cattle operations and 11% higher in tracts with hog farms.

 Over the past decade, nearly ten satellites dedicated to atmospheric CO2 concentration monitoring have been launched, significantly advancing our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In 2022, China launched the DaQi-1 (DQ-1) satellite, which carries the Aerosol and Carbon Dioxide Lidar (ACDL)—the first spaceborne lidar sensor for CO2 monitoring. Relying on laser-based active sensing, ACDL serves as an important complement to existing passive optical CO2 satellite missions. This study aims to introduce the scientific community to the XCO2 retrieval methodology of ACDL and to release all available data from the satellite's first year in orbit. The first version of ACDL XCO2 products scheduled for release is called “v1.0”. Preliminary validation shows that the ACDL XCO2 product achieves an accuracy of 0.02 ± 1.4 ppm. At a 0.5° spatial resolution, monthly products provide valid observations for 87.6 % of global grid cells. This study also presents, for the first time, a comparison between total column XCO2 and partial column XCO2 above clouds, as well as diurnal differences in XCO2 concentrations. Furthermore, we demonstrate ACDL's capability to track temporal variations in atmospheric CO2 using time series from six representative regions. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including reliance on meteorological reanalysis data and uncertainties in spectroscopic parameters. In future product versions, we plan to improve data quality through enhanced denoising techniques and signal processing methods for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases. We hope that this initial analysis of the ACDL XCO2 product will spark broader interest and participation from the scientific community, thereby contributing fresh momentum to climate change research."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a critical driver of crop growth and a key indicator of agriculture monitoring. Efficient and accurate SM monitoring is essential for advancing sustainable agricultural practices. The zero-order radiative transfer model (τ-ω), widely used for SM estimation from passive microwave satellites, simplifies the characterization of vegetation-covered surfaces by neglecting multiple scattering effects. However, its canopy transmissivity calculations within this framework remain limiting. To address this gap, this study proposes a ratio-based approach to quantify vegetation transmissivity, capitalizing on unique features of passive microwave radiative transfer over vegetated surfaces. The method is then integrated into the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) and the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model, respectively, to improve the accuracy of SM retrieval. To mitigate the weather-related constraints of optical data, the study is further to investigate the integration of the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) into the enhanced models. Experimental results demonstrate that the ratio-based method effectively refines vegetation transmissivity estimations, thereby enhancing SM retrieval accuracy: For L-MEB model, R increased from 0.63 to 0.72 and RMSE decreased from 0.119 m3/m3 to 0.061 m3/m3; for SCA-H and SCA-V, R increased from 0.48 and 0.54 to 0.71 and 0.63, and RMSE decreased from 0.150 m3/m3 and 0.102 m3/m3 to 0.053 m3/m3 and 0.067 m3/m3, respectively.

 Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a carcinogenic pollutant and a key precursor of ground-level ozone (O3) and PM2.5. To improve the accuracy of ozone forecasting and source identification, it is necessary to carry out comprehensive statistics on the source emission of HCHO. In this study, a comprehensive anthropogenic HCHO emission inventory was established for the Central China, with Henan Province as a representative in 2019. Results show that HCHO emissions were 25.2 kt, with the main sources being on-road mobile, biomass burning, non-road mobile and solvent utilization, accounting for 36.4%, 25.4%, 14.1% and 12.1%, respectively. There were significant differences in the monthly emission characteristics of different sources. On-road mobile and solvent utilization emissions showed relatively stable in all months of the year and biomass burning was concentrated in June and October. The spatial analysis showed that HCHO emissions was mainly concentrated in densely populated, industrial and agricultural areas. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis showed that the uncertainty range for the total HCHO emission inventory was (−52.3%, 51.4%). In addition, the monthly trend of primary HCHO emission based on remote sensing inversion closely matches that of the emission inventory. Spatially, the high emission areas identified by remote sensing inversion were mainly located in the central and northern parts of Henan.

 As in most European countries, the impact of Air Quality policy in Belgium is monitored with an accurate but relatively sparse network of instruments measuring in situ the near-surface concentration of various pollutants. Assessment at unmeasured locations is based on interpolation techniques and/or numerical models. We demonstrate how today’s dedicated satellite data sets for AQ, and in particular Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOMI NO2 , can be used in conjunction with the near-surface data to assess AQ over the entire Belgian domain in an observational approach virtually independent from assumptions on (changing) emissions. Specifically, after temporal aggregation and spatial oversampling (1x1km2), these satellite data reveal policy-relevant spatial and temporal features, and a high correlation (r∼0.9) with the near-surface measurements where these are available, in particular when adjusting the latter for local representativeness with land-cover data. This tight relation allows for a pragmatic conversion of tropospheric columns to near-surface concentrations over the entire Belgian domain using Regression Kriging, yielding uncertainties (∼12%) well below the amplitude of the larger spatio-temporal features over Belgium. This synergistic product, named LEGO-4-AQ, is evaluated against the Belgian assessment model RIO, revealing good agreement (r∼0.85) but also interesting local deviations. Both satellite tropospheric vertical column densities and synergistic near-surface concentrations are found to have decreased by 3-10%/year over the period 2019-2024, with midday values at a 4x4km2 resolution now mostly below the WHO annual (all-day) exposure guideline of 10μg/m3.

Napolitano;Dani Khoury;Olivier Delhomme;Maurice Millet;Pierre Herckes,Aerosol interactions with fog in urban and sub-urban sites in northeastern France,"•Fog and PM samples were collected in Strasbourg and Geispolsheim in fall 2016. •Fog scavenged organic carbon moderately and elemental carbon selectively. •δ13CTC depletion observed in PM during fog and rain events. •Fog in 2016 showed higher pH and lower sulfate and nitrate than in the 1990s. •PM in Strasbourg showed lower δ13CTC values than in Bakersfield. 
 The Alsace region in northeastern France frequently experiences autumnal and winter radiation fog, which significantly affects air quality through the accumulation and transformation of atmospheric pollutants. Despite numerous studies on either fog chemistry or particulate matter (PM) in Strasbourg, no prior research has simultaneously examined the interactions between fog and PM in this region. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of fog and PM samples collected in Strasbourg and the nearby suburb of Geispolsheim in fall 2016, focusing on carbonaceous components (organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC)) and their stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13CTC). Fog water was analyzed for pH, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), δ13CTC, and major ions, while PM2.5 and PM10 samples were analyzed for OC, EC, total carbon (TC), and δ13CTC. Results reveal significant changes in fog chemistry since the 1990s, including elevated pH and reduced sulfate and nitrate concentrations. Moderate scavenging of OC and negligible EC scavenging occurred in Strasbourg, while Geispolsheim exhibited higher EC scavenging, potentially due to aerosol aging during regional transport. Fog and rain events were found to selectively remove isotopically enriched carbon, resulting in δ13CTC depletion of interstitial PM. This depletion may reflect size-dependent scavenging or removal of carbonate-enriched coarse particles. Comparisons with datasets from California and the Po Valley suggest that differences in fuel usage—particularly diesel prevalence in France—affect δ13CTC signatures. This study offers new insights into fog–aerosol interactions in urban environments and represents the first isotopic characterization of PM and fog in Strasbourg. Future work should focus on particle size distribution, carbonate content, and source apportionment to refine understanding of scavenging processes and carbon isotope fractionation in fog-influenced air masses."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108402,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注利用多个区域气候模型的集合，对意大利地区的降雨进行再分析，并评估这种集合方法对提高降雨模拟准确性的价值。研究重点在于提高降雨的空间结构、强度和频率的模拟效果，并减少偏差。虽然与大气环境相关，但它不直接涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等遥感技术，而是侧重于数值模型和降雨模拟。,"['precipitation', 'rainfall', 'reanalysis', 'convection-permitting models', 'multi-model ensemble', 'regional climate models']",Antonio Giordani;Paolo Ruggieri;Silvana Di Sabatino,Added value of a multi-model ensemble of convection-permitting rainfall reanalyses over Italy,"•Convection-permitting regional reanalyses produce realistic precipitation estimates. •Summer precipitation deviations are highly model-dependent. •A multi-model ensemble of reanalyses enlarges the simulated range of natural variability. •The ensemble improves the adherence to observed rainfall characteristics. •Spatial structures are better represented and frequency- and intensity biases reduced. 
 Regional convection-permitting meteorological reanalyses substantially improve the atmospheric representation compared to convection-parameterized counterparts. This holds particularly for multi-scale driven variables such as precipitation in terms of spatial structures, intensity and frequency rates, or the timing and peak of its summer diurnal cycle. However, the simulation of convective-related phenomena is highly model-dependent, implying the inability to sample the full range of natural variability with single-model experiments. This challenge is exacerbated for km-scale simulations owing to the intrinsic chaotic nature underlying convection. Multi-model ensembles of high-resolution climate models demonstrate to reduce the simulation errors associated with individual model outputs over Europe. When applied to retrospective estimates, such ensemble approach could then offer a comprehensive, homogeneous, and optimized assessment of past atmospheric states.This study presents the first multi-model ensemble of regional reanalyses over Italy considering four recently produced datasets to assess the added value of their joint use. These products are derived by dynamically downscaling the global reanalysis ERA5 with different numerical models: MERIDA_HRES, MOLOCH, SPHERA and VHR-REA_IT. The reference dataset for comparison is the pluviometer-based hourly analysis GRIPHO. The investigation over 2007–2016 includes the annual and seasonal variations in daily and hourly mean rainfall intensity and frequency, heavy precipitation occurrences, and their summer diurnal cycles. No single dataset systematically outperforms the others, and substantial inter-model variability is detected for summer precipitation. The ensemble improves rainfall statistical estimates compared to individual reanalyses by providing more realistic spatial patterns, enhanced skill, and reduced biases relative to observations. These findings have potential implications for downstream reanalysis applications."

 Climate change is driving more frequent and severe dry and wet heatwaves, yet a clear picture of how each type influences ozone (O3) production in areas characterized by intricate industry and geography are still lacking. This study examines O3 formation during heatwaves, focusing on interactions among meteorological factors, atmospheric chemistry, and pollutant emissions in a unique industrial area at the junction of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces of northern China in summer 2022 and 2023. This study integrates hourly data of temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SF), 115 VOCs, and other atmospheric pollutants, and quantifies the contribution of each factor using machine learning models combined with SHAP. Results show that SF is the main driver influencing O3, contributing 13.7 μg/m3 during dry heatwaves and 5.0 μg/m3 during wet heatwaves. RH and atmospheric diffusion conditions are distinct between the dry and wet heatwaves. PMF indicates that industrial emissions dominate O3 formation during dry heatwaves while biogenic VOCs dominate during wet heatwaves. For VOCs, during dry heatwaves the SHAP values for styrene, propene and isoprene were 9.1, 4.4 and 3.8 μg/m3, respectively, significantly affecting O3 formation; In wet heatwaves, styrene, propene and acetaldehyde dominate, with SHAP values of 6.7, 4.3 and 2.5 μg/m3 respectively. Diurnal analysis indicates that while styrene and propene boost O3 during daytime (9:00–17:00), their effects reverse in the early morning (6:00–8:00). In contrast, isoprene contributes positively (2.85 μg/m3) during dry heatwaves and negatively (−2.92 μg/m3) during wet ones. Overall, the study offers an efficient framework for understanding O3 formation in extreme weather and informs targeted pollution control strategies."
