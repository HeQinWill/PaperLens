10.1088/1748-9326/ae293b,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究的是海洋碱度增强（OAE）技术及其对全球海洋和大气的影响，涉及的是海洋碳循环和气候变化，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析、气溶胶反演）没有直接关系。,"['ocean alkalinity enhancement', 'carbonate chemistry', 'atmospheric CO2']",Tanvi Nagwekar;Christopher Danek;Miriam Seifert;Judith Hauck,"Alkalinity enhancement in subduction regions and the global ocean: efficiency, earth system feedbacks, and scenario sensitivity","Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) refers to the addition of alkaline material to the surface ocean, which shifts carbonate chemistry towards more oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2. This study compares global OAE with regionally focused deployment in subduction regions of the Southern Ocean, Northwest Atlantic, and Norwegian-Barents Sea. We conducted ensemble simulations using an emissions-driven Earth System Model (ESM) under high- (SSP3-7.0) and low-emissions (SSP1-2.6) scenarios. By 2100, subduction region OAE was nearly as efficient (SSP3-7.0: 0.71 ± 0.03, SSP1-2.6: 0.60 ± 0.04) as global deployments (SSP3-7.0: 0.73 ± 0.01, SSP1-2.6: 0.64 ± 0.03). However, the ESM simulations did not reproduce the efficient vertical carbon transport seen in a previous ocean-only study, as strong internal variability and climate feedbacks to OAE hampered deep ocean carbon storage. The excess ocean CO2 uptake and atmospheric CO2 reduction were scenario-dependent (15%–19% and 22%–41% lower under SSP1-2.6 compared to SSP3-7.0, respectively). The pathways of excess ocean CO2 uptake and atmospheric CO2 reduction diverged between the scenarios after the mid-2060s, when atmospheric CO2 peaked and then declined under SSP1-2.6, with a substantially larger relative land carbon loss in SSP1-2.6 than in SSP3-7.0 for regional OAE deployment. Furthermore, the emissions-driven ensemble simulations showed that climate feedbacks introduced substantial uncertainty in early decades of regional OAE efficiency, posing challenges for near-term monitoring, reporting, and verification. Reviewing our and previous model experiments revealed a strong linear relationship between added alkalinity and oceanic CO2 uptake and atmospheric reduction, highlighting that first-order effects of OAE on carbonate chemistry are well understood and consistently represented, while the effects of carbon and climate feedbacks (13%–20%) and scenario sensitivity are smaller but non-negligible. Overall, our study shows that subduction regions can be a viable option for OAE; however, their efficiency is limited by these feedbacks and scenario sensitivity, which must be accounted for in future regional OAE interventions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae2af5,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注陆地和海洋的二氧化碳移除技术，虽然涉及大气成分分析，但并非直接针对大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'bioenergy with carbon capture and storage', 'ocean alkalinity enhancement']",Anusha Sathyanadh;Homa Esfandiari;Timothée Bourgeois;Jörg Schwinger;Tommi Bergman;Antti-Ilari Partanen;Matvey Debolsky;Miriam Seifert;David Keller;Helene Muri,Efficacy of individual and combined terrestrial and marine carbon dioxide removal,"Limiting global temperature rise below 2 °C requires significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). This study assesses the CO2 sequestration and efficacy of two CDR approaches, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), applied individually and in combination. Using the Norwegian Earth System Model, simulations were designed to ramp up deployment of BECCS and OAE, to an additional area of 5.2 million km2 by 2100 for bioenergy feedstock for BECCS, and a CaO deployment rate of approximately 2.7 Gt yr−1 for OAE within the exclusive economic zones of Europe, the United States and China. The combined land–ocean CDR simulation revealed a largely additive carbon removal effect. Over 2030−2100, OAE sequestered 7 ppm of CO2 with an accumulated 82.3 Gt CaO, achieving a CDR effectiveness of 0.08 ppm (∼0.17 PgC) per Gt CaO, while BECCS reduced 16 ppm of CO2, with CDR effectiveness of 3.1 ppm per million km2 of bioenergy crops. Together, the carbon removal achieved by BECCS and OAE corresponds to anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 5.4 Gt CO2 yr−1 by 2100, slightly more than 60% of current global transport sector emissions. Notably, the efficiency of BECCS and OAE alone was unaffected by their concurrent deployment. Nevertheless, simulations revealed distinct non-linear interactions, such as declines in land and soil carbon sinks in the combined scenario. Furthermore, all simulations show negligible effects on the global annual mean temperature. These results highlight near-additive CDR responses even under net-negative emissions, but feedback on land and ocean carbon sinks must be considered when designing CDR portfolios. This study provides new insights into CDR portfolio design and Earth system feedback under an overshoot scenario, highlighting both their potential and the need for continued emissions cuts and supportive policies."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae2b87,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究中国东部地区温度极端值的百年尺度归因和约束投影，涉及气候变化和外部强迫因素，但未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析或气溶胶反演等。,"['temperature extremes', 'greenhouse gas forcing', 'aerosols']",Ting Hu;Ying Sun,Century-scale attribution and constrained projection of temperature extremes in eastern China,"Attribution of historical climate changes is particularly challenging for periods before the mid-20th century due to sparse and low-quality observational data, raising questions about which temporal scales best capture the climate system’s response to external forcings and can robustly constrain future projections. To address these issues, this study performs a multi-scale attribution analysis of temperature extremes over the period 1901–2020 and examines the robustness of attribution-based scaling factors across different time scales. Despite uncertainties in the early data, the newly developed homogenized observations show pronounced warming in both cold and hot extremes, along with a lengthening of the growing season during 1901–2020. These trends intensified markedly after the 1950s, with the magnitude of changes approximately doubling for some extreme indices. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models successfully reproduce the overall warming trends in observations, although they underestimate the magnitude of changes, particularly in the pre-1950 period. Using optimal fingerprinting, more than 70% of the observed changes are attributed to greenhouse gas forcing, with aerosols offsetting less than 35% of the greenhouse gas-induced warming. Attribution analysis conducted within a large-ensemble model framework across multiple time scales shows that the ranges of best estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for scaling factors decrease as the time period lengthens. The century-scale attribution yields the narrowest CIs and most robust best estimates, indicating the most robust detection results. Despite the robustness of century-scale results, scaling factors from 1951–2020 are selected to constrain projections due to more reliable observational constraints. Constrained end-of-century (2081–2100) projections show amplified increases of 20.3%–33.1% for most extremes compared to raw projections, highlighting the critical impact of attribution period selection and providing a transferable framework for regional climate risk assessment."

Outbreaks are typically far-reaching because infectious spores can disperse aerially over thousands of kilometres. Rapid response to an outbreak requires a timely and accurate estimate of disease risk. We constructed an integrated mechanistic model of stem rust infection driven by seven-day meteorological forecasts and near-real time disease surveillance to inform mitigation at the national scale. Focusing on Ethiopia as the largest wheat producer of sub-Saharan Africa, yet where food insecurity is high, we evaluate the predictability of wheat stem rust infections during the rain-fed seasons of 2015–2022. The epidemiological model performs well at predicting disease observations two weeks ahead of time, from cross-validation root-mean-square-error values were in the range 0.25–0.35, ROC skill score 0.58–0.68, and odds ratio skill score 0.78–0.90. Results of alternative model scenarios show the benefit of assimilating recent surveys and simulating spore dispersal to achieve a good prediction. When driven by seven-day weather forecasts, the model therefore provides up to 21 days to respond to likely stem rust infections and prevent epidemic spread and subsequent crop loss. The mechanistic form and large scale of the epidemiological model has utility beyond in-season predictions, particularly with respect to scenario testing for practical interventions. The results demonstrated that long-distance dispersal has an important role in the spread of stem rust in a region of diverse agro-ecology. The forecast system presented here can be adapted to other plant pathosystems where aerial dispersal is the primary risk of disease spread."

While networks are recognized as key elements in energy transitions, quantitative evidence on how network structures influence residential technology adoption is limited. We examine how local governance network structures influence solar-battery integration by analyzing renewable energy networks across eight U.S. states. Our analysis reveals that networks with higher levels of both coordination (measured through degree centrality) and cooperation (measured through clustering coefficients) are significantly associated with higher co-adoption rates. Policy entrepreneurs—stakeholders who invest resources to promote energy transitions—can accelerate co-adoption through two strategic approaches: strengthening central coordinators who share information across stakeholder groups, and fostering densely connected networks that build trust and reduce perceived adoption risks. Notably, cooperation networks show particularly strong effects compared to coordination mechanisms, as dense collaborative relationships prove especially important for technologies requiring complex integration and higher investment. These findings provide actionable strategies for accelerating clean energy adoption while advancing energy transition theory by quantitatively linking specific network characteristics to adoption outcomes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae318e,True,Environmental Research Letters,该论文研究了西南中国近年来加速的干旱趋势，并指出人为气溶胶强迫是主要驱动因素。论文涉及气溶胶对区域气候的影响，属于大气环境遥感技术的研究范畴，特别是气溶胶强迫和区域气候变化的监测与分析。,"['anthropogenic aerosol', 'atmospheric wave train', 'drying trend']",Leying Wang;Shangfeng Chen;Wen Chen;Qingyu Cai;Tianjiao Ma;Yuqiong Zheng;Linye Song,Recent accelerated drying in southwest China dominated by anthropogenic aerosol forcing,"Southwest China (SWC) has experienced a significant drying trend in recent decades, which poses considerable challenges for ecosystems, agriculture, and water resource management. While human activities and internal climate variability are recognized as important factors, their relative contributions and the underlying mechanisms in driving this drying trend remain unclear. Using detection and attribution analysis with multi-model ensemble simulations, this study reveals that anthropogenic aerosol forcing is the dominant driver of the recent accelerated drying in SWC, accounting for 77% (46% to 107% for one standard deviation) of all forcing. A reduction in aerosol emissions in Europe triggers an atmospheric wave train and results in a cyclonic anomaly in the upper troposphere over SWC, which suppresses upward motion and leads to less precipitation. Concurrently, an increase in aerosols over China results in local cooling and anomalous downward motion, creating conditions conducive to drought. Our findings highlight the substantial influence of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on regional climate change."

Nickel in Indonesia occurs in laterite ore deposits, and is extracted with open-pit mining, a process which induces land transformation of high carbon stock biomass sources such as forests. This study investigates the spatial and temporal impacts of nickel mining on land cover and biomass carbon stock by combining satellite imagery assessment with a national dataset of land cover classes and biomass carbon stock data from the national Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) dataset. Focusing on the concession area between 2013 and 2022, 217 nickel mining concession areas within Indonesia were analyzed. Our results revealed that nickel mining activities induced 53% of the forest land transformation within the concession area. By 2022, approximately 6.9 million tCO2 were emitted from the land use induced by nickel mining activities, more than double the amount in 2013. If continued unabated, the trend could reach 7%–12% of the allowable Nationally Determined Contribution target in Indonesia for the land use sector in 2030. Moreover, we observed delays in the official recognition of mining areas in the national land cover map, which relies on manual visual interpretation and potentially leads to misclassification. Additionally, several instances of mining outside officially designated concession zones were detected, indicating governance gaps and regulatory compliance issues. These findings highlight the need for disclosure by mining companies and stronger governance in monitoring and regulating mining extraction activities to address the environmental cost of the energy transition."

Considering the relationships between the emergence of these diseases and anthropogenic climate change, it has become imperative for health authorities to maintain detailed surveillance of key environmental variables that can trigger epidemic episodes. While disease transmission is generally conditioned by multiple socio-economic factors, environmental suitability for vectors and viruses to proliferate is a necessary—although not sufficient—condition that needs to be closely monitored. To this end, the Aedes-borne dIsease monitoring of environmental suitability (AIMES) system improves on the disease transmissibility framework of AeDES, the most up-to-date system of this kind in the current literature. AIMES broadens both the temporal and spatial scope of its predecessor, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of the environmental suitability index. It provides continuously updated monthly historical values derived from multiple observational references, enabling a robust quantification of the observational uncertainty."

When these events occur simultaneously, as compound hot-dry events, their impacts can be even more severe, particularly in dryland regions. Yet, their frequency, long-term dynamics, and driving factors remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage model-derived lake surface water temperature and satellite-derived surface area datasets to identify and analyze hot events, dry events, and compound hot-dry events in 2,338 lakes across global drylands from 1985 to 2020. We find that the occurrence of compound hot-dry event has significantly increased in 520 lakes, while 240 lakes have shown a significant decrease. Hot events and dry events individually increased in 1007 and 767 lakes, respectively. Furthermore, in most lakes, the temporal changes in compound hot-dry events are primarily driven by changes in dry event frequency, rather than hot events or their co-occurrence. These findings underscore the growing compound stress on dryland lake systems and emphasize the need for targeted adaptation and resilience strategies."

Fromm,Comment on “Thermal infrared observations of a western United States biomass burning aerosol plume” by Sorenson et al. (2024),"Dense, fresh wildfire smoke plumes associated with longwave cooling occur day and night. The cooling is attributable to large particulate matter in the smoke, not shielding of incoming solar radiation as previously hypothesized. 
 Sorenson et al. (2024) studied fresh smoke plumes from the proximal Dixie fire in northern California and concluded that the smoke cooled the air and Earth surface below the smoke by shielding of incoming solar radiation. The so-attributed cooling was immediate, sudden and on par with diurnal temperature variations. This comment takes issue with their conclusions, reasoning, and method. By examining the same case and others, it is shown that the observed cooling within the smoke plume is caused by plume particulates sufficiently large to intercept and thereby alter upwelling thermal infrared radiation. The evidence presented is the same satellite and radar data employed by Sorenson et al. (2024), but expanded with temporal animations. A key element of the new analysis is the demonstration of smoke-associated cooling at nighttime, a circumstance decoupled from the solar-shielding explanation. The refutation of the proposed solar-shield-cooling in fresh smokes is an essential refinement of the constraints on the radiative cause-effect in such conditions."

Aerosol formation was observed when air masses crossed over the continent whereas less newly formed particles were observed when the winds were from the sea. Aerosol formation was favoured by low condensation sink and sunny dry conditions. 
 Aerosol formation is an important contributor to climate in different environments. Coastal ecosystems are of special interest, since their habitat types and species can be highly diverse which can lead to high variability in fluxes of aerosol precursor vapours. Here, we present the first results from an atmospheric observatory established in 2022 at the Tvärminne Zoological Station (TZS) on the southern coast of Finland as a part of the Centre for Coastal Ecosystem and Climate Change Research (CoastClim). This work is focused on new particle formation (NPF) and how it is influenced by the coastal environment. NPF occurred at TZS roughly as often as at the well-established boreal forest site Hyytiälä, 230 km north-north-east of TZS. However, only one-third of the events occurred during the same days at both stations. Similarly to Hyytiälä, NPF events were most likely to be observed when clean air masses from the Norwegian Sea pass over the boreal forest region. To understand the special characteristics of aerosol formation at the coast, we also studied local intermediate ion formation (LIIF), which can tell us about aerosol formation potential in the vicinity of the measurement site. LIIF was more abundant over the continent compared to the marine sector and it was favoured by low condensation sink and sunny dry conditions. This study presents an overview of aerosol size distributions at TZS and provides a basis for future work, which will aim to understand the sources of coastal aerosol precursors and their links to coastal ecology and biogeochemistry."

The fusion propagates stratospheric limb information into the troposphere. The dataset shows increased information content and lower uncertainty, improving the study of stratosphere–troposphere ozone intrusions. 
 We present a new ozone dataset generated using the Complete Data Fusion (CDF) algorithm, which combines limb observations from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) aboard ESA's Envisat and nadir observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) aboard EUMETSAT's MetOp satellites during their overlapping operational period (2008–2011). The fusion aims to enhance ozone profile information in the Upper Troposphere–Lower Stratosphere (UTLS), particularly over the Himalayas – a key region for stratospheric intrusion events. The fused dataset, mapped onto the IASI–MetOp grid, includes ozone partial columns with associated uncertainty estimates (covariance matrices-CMs, averaging kernels-AKs, and a priori profiles). After tuning the algorithm on 2008 data, the product was validated for the 2009–2011 period against ozonesondes from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) stations across multiple latitude bands. Results show that the fused profiles improve vertical information content and reduce uncertainty, successfully propagating MIPAS information to lower altitudes even in regions lacking direct limb observations. While the dataset initially exhibited altitude- and latitude-dependent biases, primarily inherited from IASI, these were significantly reduced through bias correction. The final product is suitable for data assimilation and model evaluation, offering valuable support for atmospheric reanalyses and studies of troposphere–stratosphere exchange processes."

This repository provides a unique source of information for creating hyperspectral models for predicting photosynthetic traits and associated leaf traits in terrestrial plants. 
 Accurate assessment of leaf functional traits is crucial for a diverse range of applications from crop phenotyping to parameterizing global climate models. Leaf reflectance spectroscopy offers a promising avenue to advance ecological and agricultural research by complementing traditional, time-consuming gas exchange measurements. However, the development of robust hyperspectral models for predicting leaf photosynthetic capacity and associated traits from reflectance data has been hindered by limited data availability across species and environments. Here we introduce the Global Spectra-Trait Initiative (GSTI), a collaborative repository of paired leaf hyperspectral and gas exchange measurements from diverse ecosystems. The GSTI repository currently encompasses over 7500 observations from 397 species and 41 sites gathered from 36 published and unpublished studies, thereby offering a key resource for developing and validating hyperspectral models of leaf photosynthetic capacity. The GSTI database is developed on GitHub (https://github.com/plantphys/gsti, last access: 4 January 2026) and published to ESS-DIVE https://doi.org/10.15485/2530733, Lamour et al., 2025). It includes gas exchange data, derived photosynthetic parameters, and key leaf traits often associated with traditional gas exchange measurements such as leaf mass per area and leaf elemental composition. By providing a standardized repository for data sharing and analysis, we present a critical step towards creating hyperspectral models for predicting photosynthetic traits and associated leaf traits for terrestrial plants."

It highlights the use of global medium resolution clear sky true and false color imagery to detect changes in global surface water coverage, and helps to improve satellite water color retrievals in many new and recent water bodies. 
 We present an improved medium (250 m) spatial resolution land mask based on augmenting earlier results of Mikelsons et al. (2021) to reflect recent changes in global water surface coverage. This land mask update is critical for remote sensing of coastal oceans and inland waters as this is the first step to properly identify water pixels from land pixels for satellite data processing. We show that clear-sky false color imagery derived for monthly and yearly time periods can be effectively used to identify changes to the surface water coverage. In addition, we also use Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to derive more accurate boundaries of new water bodies with complex geometries. We demonstrate improved coverage from satellite ocean color and inland water property retrievals with the improved land mask, including a range of new inland water bodies, as well as changes to the extent of the existing water bodies. We find that majority of inland water surface changes are directly linked to human activities and list the changes to water surface areas and approximate time periods for these water bodies. The improved land mask (Mikelsons and Wang, 2025) (https://doi.org/10.17632/9r93m9s7cw.2) can also be used in the remote sensing of terrestrial, atmospheric, and cryospheric property products."

The analysis reveals stable and persistent eddytree structures linked to major ocean currents. It also shows that common eddygroup boundaries play a key role in how eddies split and merge, highlighting the reciprocal nature of these dynamic ocean processes. 
 The splitting and merging of mesoscale eddies constitute significant dynamical processes and remain a central subject of investigation in oceanographic research. An eddy is defined as a closed contour derived from satellite altimetry data that encloses a seed point (a local extremum), while a closed contour containing multiple eddies and seed points is identified as an eddygroup. The eddytree is a rooted hierarchical tree structure in which eddygroups and eddies are organized by spatial containment. An efficient global algorithm is developed for the identification of mesoscale eddies and eddygroups, and an eddygroup area-based ranking algorithm is further proposed for constructing eddytrees. Compared with existing approaches, the overall computational efficiency is enhanced by a factor of eleven. For eddy tracking, a particle-drift method is applied to track the splitting and merging between eddygroups and eddies at the terminal nodes of the eddytree, which are ultimately connected into eddy directed acyclic graphs (referred to as eddygraphs). Based on these methods, a 31-year (January 1993–December 2023) global dataset of mesoscale eddies and eddygroups, as well as a trajectory dataset of eddy splitting and merging, is constructed. These datasets provide valuable references for advancing research on ocean dynamics and climate variability. Furthermore, statistical analyses of the 31-year identification results reveal the existence of relatively stable and persistent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddytree structures within the ocean. These structures correspond closely with large-scale ocean circulation patterns: anticyclones dominate in regions of strong western boundary currents; boundaries between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddytrees emerge at confluence zones of warm and cold currents; and island wake regions exhibit von Kármán–type vortex-street structures. Finally, we normalize and characterize the morphological evolution of eddygroups and eddies during splitting and merging processes. The analysis shows that before merging, pairs of eddies typically take on egg-shaped morphologies, which remain after merging, with the smaller eddy corresponding to the sharp pole of the egg-shaped structure. Similarly, before splitting, eddies also exhibit egg-shaped forms, and after splitting, the smaller eddy corresponds to the sharp pole of the pre-split structure. During this process, the research found that the common parent eddygroup plays an important role in the morphology of the splitting and merging events, where the boundary of the resultant eddy after merging is a degeneration of the boundary of the two pre-merging eddies' common parent eddygroup, while before splitting, the boundary of the single eddy evolves into the common parent eddygroup of the two post-splitting eddies. This also reveals the reciprocal nature of the dynamic processes of eddy splitting and merging.

A main source of the data are observations with satellites that weigh the changing amount of water by its mass attraction effect. The data allow for assessing how groundwater as the most important freshwater resource for mankind and ecosystems is affected by climate variability, climate change and withdrawal by human activities. 
 Groundwater is one of the most important freshwater resources for ecosystems and mankind. Because of its fundamental role in the Earth's water and energy cycles, groundwater has been declared an essential climate variable by GCOS, the Global Climate Observing System. Similar to other subsurface states and fluxes, groundwater is difficult to monitor at the global scale, with sufficient spatial coverage and over climate-relevant time scales. The Global Gravity-based Groundwater Product (G3P) is a global observation-based data set of large-scale groundwater storage variations. G3P capitalizes on the unique capability of GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite gravimetry as the only remote sensing technology to monitor subsurface mass variations. In a mass balance approach, satellite-based, in situ observation-based and model-based water storage variations of snow water equivalent, root-zone soil moisture, glacier mass, and surface water storage are subtracted from GRACE/-FO terrestrial water storage anomalies to result in monthly variations of groundwater storage. For this combination, the individual compartmental storage data are spatially filtered to be consistent with the spatial resolution of terrestrial water storage from satellite gravimetry. The G3P data set presented here covers the period 2002 to 2023 with monthly resolution on a 0.5° global grid and includes propagated uncertainty information. We describe the details of the G3P data processing chain and of each contributing data stream, provide examples of spatial and temporal groundwater storage variations represented by the G3P data set, and present exemplary evaluation results against in situ groundwater observations for three large aquifer systems. G3P is a prototype for an operational global groundwater service, under development as a cross-cutting extension of the existing portfolio of the Copernicus Climate Change Service C3S. The G3P data set is available via GFZ Data Services at https://doi.org/10.5880/G3P.2024.001 (Güntner et al., 2024)."

To address this, we used a multiscale modeling framework that embeds a high-resolution cloud model into each grid cell of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model. This approach greatly improves the simulation of East Asian precipitation. 
 Traditional global climate models (GCMs) exhibit substantial biases in simulating precipitation over East Asia, largely due to uncertainties in convection parameterizations. To address this issue, we implement a Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which explicitly resolves convection in a cloud resolving model, into the atmospheric component of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model (CAS-ESM). Simulations using CAS-ESM with and without MMF reveal that the MMF implementation significantly reduces the wet bias around the Tibetan Plateau and the dry bias over South China and Southeast Asia. The intensity–frequency characteristics of precipitation are more realistically represented in the MMF version. In addition, the CAS-ESM with MMF better captures the monthly evolution of precipitation and simulates a more realistic seasonal migration of the East Asian rainband, albeit with a somewhat step-wise progression. Further enhancement is achieved by incorporating a convective momentum transport (CMT) parameterization, typically neglected in previous MMF implementations. This inclusion leads to a smoother northward migration of the rainband, more consistent with observations. Comparison with ERA5 reanalysis suggests that this improvement is associated with a more accurate simulation of the western Pacific subtropical high. These results demonstrate that MMF, especially when combined with CMT, substantially improves the simulation of East Asian precipitation. This modeling advancement offers a promising approach for evaluating regional precipitation responses to future climate change."

However, the impact of emerging contaminants on SCFA-producing processes remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed laboratory fermentation microcosms to investigate the effects of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on SCFA-producing bioprocesses and the underlying mechanisms. Our results revealed that TBBPA at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg TS significantly increased the accumulation of SCFAs. However, there was no significant difference in the increments of SCFAs between fermenters containing low (0.5 mg/kg TS) and high (5 mg/kg TS) levels of TBBPA. The yield of acetic acid, which was the predominant SCFA in fermenters with a TBBPA concentration of 5 mg/kg TS, was 1.3 times higher than that in the control group. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that TBBPA promoted substrate hydrolysis, particularly carbohydrates, due to differential interactions with organic matter. TBBPA also increased ATP levels, electron transport system (ETS) activity, and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion in enriched acidogenic and acetogenic communities, thereby enhancing microbial viability and metabolic activity. Microbial community analysis showed increased abundances of key SCFA-producing bacteria, particularly acetogens, alongside potential TBBPA degraders. Overall, this study reveals that TBBPA, despite being an environmental pollutant, can unexpectedly stimulate anaerobic fermentation via microbial adaptation and activity enhancement, offering a novel and sustainable perspective for optimizing sludge treatment and resource recovery."

Here, 1,016,590 quarterly concentration records for 277 toxicants from 367 monitoring points were integrated into an adaptive zonation and classification framework for mixture-oriented risk management. Ecological mixture risk was quantified with species-sensitivity-distribution models combined in a tiered concentration addition → response addition (CA → RA) scheme, while Monte Carlo simulations captured probabilistic carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic human health risks. These dimensions were merged into an environmental health risk index (EHRI; 0.42 ecology: 0.58 health). Quadrant analysis identified four coexposure patterns and showed that ≤10% of detected toxicants─chiefly inorganics, metals, BTEXs, haloalkanes, and phenols─drive >95% of cumulative EHRI. Spatial interpolation converted point-level EHRIs to grid-scale and, when embedded in a “source–plume–buffer” treatment train, reduced the great concern zone (EHRI > 0.60) from 19 km2 to <0.1 km2 after removal of 45 highest-leverage toxicants. The framework unifies deterministic and probabilistic perspectives, pinpoints priority toxicants and zones, and supplies tier-graded actionable triggers for adaptive intervention. This study provides the first field-scale evidence that mixture-aware risk assessment can be directly coupled to risk-zoned management, offering a transferable blueprint for the sustainable regulation of complex, multipollutant groundwater systems worldwide and a framework potentially relevant to other management zones such as surface water."

This study investigated the effects of As exposure on mud crabs (Scylla paramamosain) during the molting period. Environmentally relevant As elevations (8-fold in water and 3-fold in sediment) increased crab mortality by up to 60%, primarily due to impaired carapace sclerotization. Most deaths occurred within the first 8 days, coinciding with the peak inorganic As accumulation in the tissues. As exposure duration increased, mortality decreased, a trend associated with the biotransformation of inorganic As to arsenobetaine. Morphologically, As disrupted carapace mineralization, resulting in increased endocuticle pore density, shortened ribbon-like tubules, and disorganization of chitin-protein matrices. Concurrently, the phosphorus content decreased by approximately 30% in the hepatopancreas and 70% in the carapaces, showing significant negative correlations with As accumulation. The expression of phosphorus transporters (spPiT1) and carapace formation-related genes (spBMP) was down-regulated. These results demonstrate that As is highly toxic to mud crabs during molting, impairing carapace sclerotization through the interference of phosphorus metabolism. This study reveals a novel toxicological mechanism of As in marine crustaceans and highlights an urgent need to re-evaluate its ecological risks."

Conventional water quality standards rely on static concentration thresholds and fail to capture the dynamic nature of ammonia toxicity, which is strongly dependent on water temperature and pH. In this study, we combine high-frequency national water quality monitoring data with climate projections to evaluate both current and future chronic ammonia risks across China’s freshwater systems. Our results reveal that existing criteria substantially underestimate ecological risks: approximately 71% of chronic exceedance events go undetected under most commonly used static thresholds. These risks exhibit marked spatial heterogeneity, with over 80% of northern river basins experiencing elevated chronic exposure, while southern basins face less than half the national average. Climate change is projected to intensify ammonia risks even in regions with historically strong pollution controls. Under the high-emission scenario, the national exceedance rate increases from around 8% to nearly 14% in summer, primarily driven by rising temperatures and increasingly extreme hydrological conditions. These findings demonstrate the critical limitations of fixed-threshold regulation and highlight the need for dynamic, climate-adaptive ammonia toxicity risk assessments. To effectively protect freshwater biodiversity and water quality in the face of climate change, regulatory frameworks must incorporate temperature- and pH-sensitive criteria alongside targeted, region-specific mitigation strategies."

In this study, the ozonolysis of Z-3-hexenal (Z-3-H) and T-2-hexenal (T-2-H) in the presence of SO2 was investigated in a 30 m3 smog chamber. The experimental results showed that the SOA concentration produced by Z-3-H was far greater than that of T-2-H, indicating a significant influence of molecular structure on SOA formation. Through the mechanism study, a C3-carbonyl-RO2 radical (CHOC2H4O2) was regarded as a key intermediate playing a central role in the Z-3-H and T-2-H SOA formation. Due to the different double-bond positions, the ozonation of Z-3-H undergoes a relatively simpler pathway than T-2-H to produce this intermediate, which is considered one of the reasons for the higher SOA concentration of Z-3-H. Another key reason is that the average concentration of stable Criegee intermediate (sCI) in the Z-3-H/O3/SO2 system is much higher than that in the T-2-H/O3/SO2 system. The high level of sCI not only directly promotes a series of sCI-involved intramolecular and intermolecular reactions but also drives the rapid formation of H2SO4, which facilitates organosulfate production and acid-catalyzed aldol condensation reaction."

Due to their small particle sizes and low mass density, tire-wear particles can become airborne, undergo long-range transport, and potentially influence atmospheric processes. One critical but poorly understood pathway involves the heterogeneous freezing of supercooled cloud droplets, a key process in cloud glaciation and climate regulation. Here, we systematically investigate the ice-nucleating properties of laboratory-generated particles from summer, all-weather, and winter tires. Using optical microscopy as well as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy, we obtained particle-size distributions (∼100 μm mean diameter) and characterized the surface chemical compositions, confirming close similarity to the pristine tire materials. Ice-nucleation experiments performed with our custom-built IceBox instrument demonstrated that all tire particles consistently elevated the freezing temperatures of supercooled water droplets. The ice-nucleation performances of tire particles are found to be between feldspar and quartz, which are important mineral-based ice-nucleating agents in the atmosphere. Comparable results across all tire types suggest that major components such as rubber polymers or graphitic fillers are responsible for the observed activity. These findings establish tire-wear particles as effective atmospheric ice-nucleating agents, providing a baseline for future studies of environmentally aged tire particles and their potential roles in affecting the climate."

This review systematically integrates current evidence on the formation and transformation of MNPs under mechanical, photochemical, thermal, oxidative, and biological processes, highlighting that environmental MNPs are predominantly aged rather than pristine particles. Aging significantly reshapes particle shape, size, surface chemistry, and reactivity, thereby altering mobility, persistence, and interactions with copollutants, biota, and humans. By adopting a source─transformation─exposure─risk framework, this review clarifies the critical importance of understanding transformation pathways for tracing pollution origins, revealing exposure routes and doses, and improving health risk assessment. Particular attention is directed toward nanoplastics, whose elevated reactivity and bioavailability remain poorly understood due to analytical limitations. Strategic research priorities are identified, including the development of multifactorial aging simulation models, advanced detection and characterization techniques, and lifecycle-oriented mitigation strategies.

We quantify the contributions of vertical advection and turbulent mixing to C $C$. Vertical advection was important during the leading wave and the turbulent mixing flux was important over the entire wave train. Maximum C $C$ was highly correlated with the maximum horizontal current speed squared and was only weakly correlated with the maximum vertical velocity. Boundary layer‐induced turbulence was thus inferred to be the key driver of net vertical sediment flux over wave trains of this type. Estimating the maximum total horizontal speed (i.e., wave‐induced plus background) is sufficient for modeling sediment vertical dynamics in shelf‐scale modeling studies."

 Widespread permafrost thaw—indicated by the thickening of the soil active layer, which undergoes seasonal freeze–thaw cycles above the permafrost—has important implications for the thermal, hydrological and ecological processes of Arctic–boreal ecosystems. Yet, how thaw-driven biophysical and ecological feedbacks alter Arctic–boreal fire regimes remains poorly understood. Here we quantify these feedbacks by integrating long-term observations of soil active layer thickness (1997–2018) with a causal inference model and a space-for-time approach. We show that the thickening of the soil active layer can amplify summer fire regimes across the Arctic–boreal region, resulting in intensified fire weather conditions, increased burned area and higher fire emissions. The fire amplifications were driven by thaw-induced reductions in surface albedo and soil moisture that intensify summer warming and atmospheric aridity, further reinforced by enhanced vegetation growth and the desiccation of soil organic matter. These cascading feedbacks may create a positive fire–climate feedback loop, whereby more burning accelerates carbon release from vegetation and soil, further destabilizing northern ecosystems. Our findings highlight the potential escalating fire and climate risks initiated by permafrost thaw, emphasizing the urgent need for immediate climatic action to mitigate climate change and the compounding impacts of wildfires and permafrost degradation.

 Reliable quantification of global water-cycle components, such as river flow and land evapotranspiration, remains a major challenge. Here we refine estimates of global water partitioning by combining outputs from multiple Earth system models with river flow observations from 50 large basins, applying the emergent constraint approach. Between 1980 and 2014, global river flow was (39.1 ± 5.4) × 103 km3 yr−1, with a river flow-to-precipitation ratio of 0.35 ± 0.03, both lower than previous estimates. Land evapotranspiration reached (73.4 ± 6.2) × 103 km3 yr−1. Under climate change, we project global river flow to rise by 7.8 ± 5.5 mm per year per degree of warming. This estimate, refined through the emergent constraint method, is 9.3% lower than the ensemble mean of Earth system models and reduces inter-model uncertainty by 66%. By integrating river flow observations, we provide more accurate historical estimates and strengthen future projections of global water-cycle components.

Upregulated by circulating inflammatory cytokines post-injury, it binds ALK5 to potentiate TGF-β signaling and promotes fibrotic progression, presenting a promising target for CKD. 
 The concept of organ-organ communication in systemic diseases has gained significant traction. Despite accumulating evidence of liver-kidney crosstalk, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify hepatokine fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) as a pivotal mediator driving liver-kidney communication in renal fibrosis. Integrative RNA sequencing and clinical analyses revealed FGL1 upregulation in the liver post-renal injury, with subsequent selective accumulation in fibrotic kidneys. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of FGL1 improved renal morphology, attenuated collagen deposition, and inhibited fibrosis markers in unilateral ureteral obstruction and adenine-induced mouse models. Conversely, FGL1 overexpression exacerbated renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, FGL1 binds to TGF-β receptor ALK5 and blocks its interaction with K48-linked polyubiquitin. Structural analyses identified critical residues in FGL1-ALK5 interaction. Hepatic FGL1 is transcriptionally regulated by STAT3, and activated by inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α). Pharmacological inhibition by p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (screened out from 4080 compounds) or an anti-FGL1 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced renal fibrosis without hepatotoxicity. These findings establish FGL1 as a key mediator of pathogenic liver-kidney crosstalk and highlights therapeutic strategies to targeting organ-organ networks in renal fibrosis.

 Biomanufacturing provides a more sustainable alternative to fossil-based chemical manufacturing. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a top Department of Energy value-added chemical and precursor to bioplastics, yet cost-effective microbial production remains elusive. Here, we establish the acid-tolerant yeast Issatchenkia orientalis as a robust host for low-pH 3HP biosynthesis. Genome-scale modeling identifies the β-alanine pathway as optimal, offering the highest theoretical yield and lowest oxygen requirement. Thermodynamic analysis confirms its favorability under acidic conditions. Using sequence similarity network analysis, we discover highly active aspartate 1-decarboxylase (PAND), β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase (BAPAT), and 3HP dehydrogenase (YDFG), which significantly improve the pathway efficiency. Next, to further elevate the production, pathway optimization through multi-copy PAND integration, byproduct elimination (knockouts of pyruvate decarboxylase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and reinforcement of aspartate flux by overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase and aspartate amino transferase improves the titer to 29 g/L in shake flasks. Fed-batch fermentation at pH 4 with low-cost corn steep liquor medium further increases the production to 92 g/L with 0.7 g/g yield and 0.55 g/L/h productivity. Techno-economic analysis indicates that such performance could potentially enable a financially viable process for sustainable acrylic acid production. This work establishes I. orientalis as a next-generation platform for cost-effective 3HP production and paves the way toward industrial commercialization. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a top Department of Energy value-added chemical and precursor to bioplastics, yet cost-effective microbial bioproduction remains elusive.

 Precise manipulation of small objects using light holds transformative potential across diverse fields. While research in optical trapping and manipulation predominantly relies on the attraction of solid matter to light intensity maxima, here we demonstrate that meta-optics enables a departure from this accepted behavior. Specifically, we present deterministic control over the sign of optical forces exerted on a metasurface integrated on a suspended silicon nanomembrane. By tailoring the geometry of the constituent meta-atoms, we engineer the coherent superposition of their multipolar modes, and consequently, the net optical force experienced by the metasurface within a phase-controlled optical standing wave. In excellent agreement with 3D numerical simulations, we experimentally realize both attractive and repulsive forces on distinct metasurface designs, directly mirroring the behavior of two-level systems interacting with optical fields. This work establishes a versatile platform for the optical control of nanoscale mechanical systems, opening alternative avenues for both fundamental research and engineering.

In this case report, phage-antibiotic therapy was used to treat a vascular graft infection caused by a refractory fluoroquinolone non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
 Biofilm-related vascular graft infections (VGIs) pose major therapeutic challenges due to persistent, antibiotic-resistant bacteria often residing in retained grafts. Phage therapy offers a promising alternative treatment strategy against biofilm-associated infections, though its use remains mostly ad hoc and typically considered a last-resort intervention. We report here the treatment of a refractory, fluoroquinolone non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa VGI using a systematically planned and synergistic phage-antibiotic combination approach. Adjunctive phage therapy led to radiological improvement, as seen by reduced 18F-FDG PET/CT tracer uptake around the graft. The patient was transitioned to oral fluoroquinolone suppression therapy with no recurrence of bacteremia to-date, after a year. Our workflow led to the selection of phages that sensitized Pseudomonas aeruginosa to killing by levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam. We established that this phage-driven antibiotic sensitization was due to the ability of our phages to use the MexAB-OprM efflux pump as a receptor. We also showed that our phages had potent anti-biofilm activity. We advocate a systematic, multi-pronged management strategy for refractory VGIs, including early therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in vitro antibiotic combination testing (iACT), and timely adjunctive phage therapy. This case illustrates the utility of individualized, strategic approaches and highlights adjunctive phage therapy’s potential in treating complex biofilm-related infections.

Here, Zhang, Ding, and coauthors succeed in breaking in-plane mirror symmetries via crystallographic engineering, and observe a giant non-linear Hall effect and current induced magnetization at room temperature. 
 Interfaces in heterostructures possess inherent inversion asymmetry and display diverse physical effects, however, the pristine in-plane mirror symmetries of the constituent layers are usually preserved at the interface. On-demand manipulation of these symmetries remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to control the in-plane mirror symmetries of interfaces by engineering the crystallographic orientation of heterostructures. We design a workhorse system with a new orientation, i.e., the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure with metallic interfaces in the (112)-plane. Such a high index orientation leads to the breaking of all the pristine mirror symmetries except the mirror plane perpendicular to the $$[1\bar{1}0]$$ direction ($${M}_{[1\bar{1}0]}$$), resulting in the Cs point symmetry with a metallic conduction. Consequently, this interface exhibits a giant nonlinear Hall effect characterized by a large Berry curvature dipole, a circular photogalvanic effect, and current-induced out-of-plane magnetization, all functional at room temperature. The magnitude of the nonlinear Hall effect rivals the Weyl and Dirac systems. Our work establishes a new strategy in exploring emerging electronic properties with nontrivial quantum geometry by designing the interface symmetry.

 The intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in health and disease, yet the impact of microenvironmental cues in diseased contexts, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we first benchmarked human colonic organoid injury models against IBD tissue and established a disease-relevant model of inflammation using inflammatory cytokines. Using this system, we built a dictionary of epithelial responses to 79 secreted niche factors at single cell resolution via donor-pooled, multiplexed single cell RNA-sequencing. The comprehensive nature of our atlas allowed us to map relationships between perturbations, infer the function of less characterized ligands, and identify cell type-specific perturbed pathways. Finally, we established the relevance of organoid-derived gene programs by mapping them to single cell and spatial atlases of human IBD tissue. Our resource offers a global view of epithelial responses to microenvironmental cues, offering insights into epithelial homeostasis and repair mechanisms in IBD. Here they developed an inflamed human intestinal organoid model and used it to build a scRNA-seq perturbation atlas of microenvironmental cues in the context of inflammatory bowel disease."

 The streaming of energetic charged particles can magnetize astrophysical and laboratory plasmas via the current filamentation instability. Despite its importance, the experimental characterization of this instability has remained a challenge. Here, we report an experiment combining a high-intensity optical laser with a high-brightness X-ray free electron laser that successfully images the instability in solid-density plasmas with 200 nm spatial and 50 fs temporal resolution. We characterize the development of μm-scale filamentary structures and their evolution over tens of picoseconds through a non-linear merging process. The measured plasma density modulations and long merging time reveal the critical importance of space-charge effects and ion motion on this electron-driven instability. Supporting theoretical analysis and kinetic simulations help distinguish the relative role of space-charge and resistive effects. Our findings indicate that magnetic fields on the order of 10 megagauss are produced, with important implications for transport and radiation emission of energetic particles in plasmas.

 Wurtzite ferroelectrics, particularly aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), have emerged as a promising material platform for non-volatile memories, offering high polarization values exceeding 100 μC/cm2. However, their high coercive fields (>3 MV/cm) have limited cycling endurance to ~107 cycles in previous reports. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control of polarization switching in AlScN, achieving write cycling endurance exceeding 1010 cycles—a thousand-fold improvement over previous wurtzite ferroelectric benchmarks. Through precise voltage modulation in 45 nm-thick Al0.64Sc0.36N capacitors, we show that while complete polarization reversal (2Pr ≈ 200 μC/cm2) sustains ~108 cycles, partial switching extends endurance beyond 1010 cycles while maintaining a substantial polarization (>30 μC/cm2 for 2Pr). This exceptional endurance, combined with breakdown fields approaching 10 MV/cm in optimized 10 μm diameter devices, represents the highest reported values for any wurtzite ferroelectric. Our findings establish a new paradigm for reliability in nitride ferroelectrics, demonstrating that controlled partial polarization and size scaling enables both high endurance and energy-efficient operation.

 The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of global climate variability, yet its long-term effect on life expectancy remains unclear. Here we quantify how ENSO persistently impedes mortality improvement, leading to considerable life expectancy and economic losses across high-income Pacific Rim countries. We estimate life expectancy losses of 0.5 years (monetary equivalent loss of US$2.6 trillion) for the 1982–1983 El Niño and 0.4 years (US$4.7 trillion) for the 1997–1998 event. Climate projections under moderate emissions pathways suggest a cumulative decline of 2.8 years in life expectancy by 2100, amounting to US$35 trillion losses, with most of the monetary burden falling on the middle-aged population. These findings reveal that intensifying ENSO variability poses an underrecognized and enduring threat to human health and socio-economic stability, underscoring the urgent need for targeted adaptation strategies to safeguard population well-being.

 While of critical importance for coastal communities, Antarctica’s future sea-level contribution remains highly uncertain. This uncertainty largely stems from the complex interaction between the ocean and the ice shelves, which is both difficult to observe and model. To better understand and constrain land-ice response to reduced buttressing exerted by ice shelves, efforts are needed to fully comprehend basal melt rates and their impact on ice shelf weakening and retreat. Here we present high-resolution basal melt maps (50 m) of vulnerable ice shelves based on a combination of stereo imagery and satellite altimetry, revealing pronounced channelized melting patterns whose melt rates were previously substantially underestimated (42–50%), which could result in faster channel breakthrough. Accurately simulating small-scale dynamics in ice-sheet models remains challenging but is essential for accurate sea-level rise projections.

Here the authors use deep learning models and ecological network theory to study the impacts of human pressures on terrestrial vertebrate habitat hotspots now and under future scenarios of global change. 
 Protecting critical habitats globally is essential to buffer threatened species from extinction due to anthropogenic stressors. However, a limited understanding of the global distribution patterns of habitats for threatened terrestrial vertebrates and their associated habitat hotspots hinders efforts aimed at assessing biodiversity vulnerability and developing targeted conservation strategies. In this study, we integrated spatial data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species with a deep learning approach to evaluate the habitat distribution for 4,851 threatened species and construct a global niche interaction network. These habitat hotspots cover only 4% of the terrestrial surface but encompass 67.9% of all analysed species. While vast unoccupied habitats exist, 76.8% of them remain geographically isolated by continental or oceanic barriers and are significantly affected by human pressures. Species at higher risk of extinction often have a larger proportion of unoccupied habitats, but geographic isolation limits these ecological opportunities. We identified regions where unoccupied habitats are concentrated and have long-term persistence potential. Furthermore, the continued loss of native habitats for species inhabiting islands or continental margins due to human pressures may accelerate the widespread homogenization of global niches, underscoring the rarity and irreplaceability of these fragile habitats. Our global assessment provides useful perspectives on sustainable conservation planning. The threat of species extinction is a major problem resulting from various anthropogenic pressures.

This study reveals that, under all relevant protection mechanisms in the contiguous USA, only 12% of rivers are adequately protected. 
 To address the enduring and deepening crisis facing fresh waters, many nations have recently set bold targets for freshwater protection. However, the lack of comprehensive databases and integrative frameworks hampers a robust evaluation of current freshwater protections and prioritization of future opportunities to meet these goals. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of river protection for the USA by reconciling the disparate array of major federal, state, tribal and private protection mechanisms into a single, multifaceted index. We report that just over one tenth of the river length of the contiguous USA and less than one fifth of rivers nationwide are currently protected at a level deemed viable. Lowland headwater streams and intermittent watercourses are consistently underprotected. Protection is also often spatially misaligned with other conservation objectives, where only a small fraction of watersheds with high biodiversity, habitat intactness and importance to drinking water supply are adequately (30% of river length) protected. Our assessment of river protection highlights the urgency to increase new and fortify existing protections for rivers in the years to come if we are to meet ambitious conservation targets, reverse the curve of biodiversity loss and ensure that healthy rivers benefit everyone.

 Future changes in extratropical cyclones (ETCs), their moisture transport, and their connection to atmospheric rivers (ARs) remain uncertain. Here, using downscaled simulations from the Community Earth System Model version 2 under the high-emissions scenario SSP5-8.5, we show that moisture uptake associated with intense North Atlantic ETCs will increase by ~14.5%, or ~3.29% per Kelvin of global warming by the end of this century. Subregional analysis revealed greater increases during the most intense cyclone stages, with changes of 52.1% (11.8% K−1) in the eastern North Atlantic, 33.4% (7.6% K−1) in the western North Atlantic, and 29.1% (6.6% K−1) in the northern North Atlantic. Rather than a consistent increase within existing climatological source regions, the moisture origin exhibits a geographic shift, likely linked with changes in storm-track pathways and ocean circulation under warming. Using a novel method to couple ETC moisture sources with ARs, we demonstrate that while this coupling continues to be a defining characteristic at the basin scale, the strength of their association is projected to weaken. Historical differences between low- and fully associated ETCs, particularly in terms of moisture sources and proximity to the AR axis, diminish and lose significance in a warming climate."

 The North Atlantic climate is strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation, including the storm track and jet stream, which shape regional precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns. Climate models project an intensification of the winter circulation through the 21st century, however, it remains unclear whether abrupt or non-monotonic changes might occur under ongoing warming. Here we show that under continued CO2 emissions beyond 2100, the intensification reverses, with both the storm track and jet stream returning toward their 20th-century states. We attribute this reversal to the logarithmic relationship between CO2 and temperature, which leads to a reduced meridional temperature gradient and weakened atmospheric circulation at high CO2 concentrations. This behavior also alters regional climate patterns, reversing storm track-induced warming and wetting at higher mid-latitudes and cooling and drying at lower mid-latitudes over eastern North America and the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that mitigation policies should account for the pace of continued emissions as well as the potential reversals in climate impacts."

 Anthropogenic climate change is intensifying tropical cyclones, and some studies suggest that they are now impacting regions farther from the equator, though uncertainties remain. This study examines the North Atlantic (NATL) basin’s autumn climatology, focusing on environments conducive to tropical transitions (TTs), as most cyclones affecting Europe that originate from TTs occur during this season. Ten CMIP6 climate models under the historical, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios are used, covering the 1981–2100 period, with the ERA5 reanalysis employed as a reference to support the results. The study introduces the Tropical Transition Favorability Index (TTFI), which is a novel metric that integrates key parameters to quantify environmental favorability for TTs in the NATL. Findings indicate a progressive tropicalization of the NATL basin under both SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, with a more pronounced effect under the latter, driven by increased sea surface temperatures and humidity, while dynamic constraints weaken. Although in some cases the magnitude of projected future changes is comparable to existing CMIP6 models biases with respect to ERA5, the results suggest a higher likelihood of TTs, increasing the risk from these destructive systems."

 Sea surface temperature is a key indicator of climate change on Earth and is central to all related modelling endeavours. However, sea surface temperature is notoriously difficult to reconstruct accurately in the geological record, especially for the low temperatures of the polar regions, which occupy one-third of the world’s oceans. Here we show that a sea surface temperature proxy based on two isomeric diatom lipid biomarkers can be applied to marine sediment archives to reconstruct temperatures in the range −1 to 14 °C for the Arctic and Antarctic using a single calibration. For both regions, our datasets span timeframes from recent decades to the Younger Dryas/Holocene, and we also showcase a 750 kyr record from the Fram Strait, the major gateway between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. We anticipate that this lipid biomarker-based proxy may become a standard component of the palaeoclimate toolkit, especially for the polar regions.

 Rewetting is widely promoted as a climate mitigation strategy to preserve soil carbon in drained wetlands, although rewetting may enhance methane production and corresponding emissions. The increase in methane emissions following rewetting might be underestimated without considering near-surface methane oxidation under a fluctuating water table. Here, we refined the methane module in Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator with high-affinity methane oxidation and oxygen parameterization involving water table fluctuations. During 2007-2023, the Danish temperate wetland site functioned as a carbon dioxide sink (−41 gC-CO2m-2yr⁻1) and a methane source (0.71 gC-CH4m⁻2yr⁻1), with significant declines in seasonal amplitudes of methane flux, net ecosystem exchange, and gross primary productivity. Scenario analysis shows maintaining a stable water table at 9 cm depth offers the optimal trade-off between carbon sequestration and methane release. Our findings reduce the uncertainty in wetland methane estimates under climate change and highlight the importance of site-specific rewetting strategies to optimize mitigation efforts.

 Priority areas are typically identified based on mean conditions, while ignoring variance around the mean (i.e., “stochasticity’). This is problematic as high environmental stochasticity can increase extinction risk and reduce the effectiveness of protected areas. Here we use daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data from 1981 to 2025 to generate spatially-explicit estimates of both the mean and variance in environmental productivity across Canada. From these models, we found that environmental stochasticity shows strong spatial structure and has been steadily increasing over the past four decades. Additionally, stochasticity had a negative effect on species richness. We found no clear relationship between stochasticity and protection status, suggesting that Canada’s network of protected areas are not well-buffered against a climate-change induced increase in stochasticity. Promisingly, we identified 2,709,580 km2 of currently unprotected land that may minimise the impact(s) of growing stochasticity. This work provides a framework for incorporating environmental stochasticity into conservation planning.

 Snow water is key to water supply in cold regions and beyond. Here we introduce Snow Water Availability that quantifies water stored in the snow-covered portion of an area. By integrating a plausible set of available gridded datasets for snow depth, density, and cover fraction, we form four estimates of Snow Water Availability at the 25 × 25 km2 across Canada and Alaska. We show that annual long-term mean of Snow Water Availability over the domain was 996 ± 170 km³ during 2000–2019. While annual Snow Water Availability increased from 799 ± 121 km³ in 2000-2009 to 1208 ± 231 km³ in 2010-2019, significant losses (p-value ≤ 0.05) were observed in ~3% of the domain, mainly in North American Cordillera, headwaters to major rivers in western Canada.

 Recovering geological samples from the deep basins and ridges of the central Arctic Ocean presents significant challenges because of remote access and thick ice cover. During the 2016 Canada-Sweden Polar Expedition to the Arctic Ocean, volcaniclastic breccia was dredged from the Alpha Ridge, part of an underwater mountain chain extending from the Canadian polar margin to the Siberian shelf. Argon geochronology of plagioclase crystals within glassy lava fragments dates the sample to 90.4 ± 0.26 Ma.

 Permanent storage of gigatons of carbon in basalt requires thick, uncompartmentalized sequences that allow lateral dissipation of CO2 away from injection sites. Here we assess the presence of flow barriers by evaluating the variations in 87Sr/86Sr patterns in pore water, a method used extensively in sedimentary successions. Present-day pore water 87Sr/86Sr was measured from residual salts in core samples, while past water compositions were reconstructed from carbonate cements of different ages. We reveal smooth and uninterrupted trends in strontium isotopes through a 100 m thick basalt section indicating a common fluid reservoir unaffected by low-permeability massive lava flow interiors. The data further indicate that unconsolidated overburden sediments act as a good seal preventing seawater to mix with in situ pore water, and buoyant supercritical CO2 to leak. Finally, basaltic sequences form viable targets for CO2 storage and suggests that fractures may bypass low-permeability units to create a well-connected reservoir system. 87Sr/86Sr pattern of residual salts from a 100 m basalt section reveal a vertically connected pore water system unaffected by massive lava flow interiors, supporting continental margin basalt sequences as viable reservoirs for permanent CO2 storage."

 Livable cities enhance urban economic development, improve physical and mental health, foster well-being, and foster urban sustainability. Evaluating urban livability is therefore important for policymakers to develop urban planning and development strategies aimed at improving livability. Mainstream methods of evaluating urban livability assign different weights to diverse indicators extracted from survey data, statistical data, and geospatial data. To relieve such time-consuming and labor-intensive data collection, this study proposes a transformer-based multi-task multimodal regression (TMTMR) model for the simultaneous evaluation of urban livability focusing on five domain-specific scores. Pretrained state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing models serve as backbones to extract features from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) images, digital surface models (DSM), night light remote sensing (NLRS) images and point of interest (POI) data. An attention mechanism helps the TMTMR model to assign varying significance levels to features from different modalities, thus capturing both intrinsic information and interrelationships among modalities for livability evaluation. Focusing on 13 Dutch areas, our research demonstrates that the TMTMR model efficiently evaluates urban livability with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.605 to 0.779, and root mean square error values between 0.070 and 0.112 in four unseen test areas. Furthermore, we analyze the synergy between different modalities. We found that modalities of urban livability can be effectively evaluated by aligning, in a descending order, contributions from RS images, NLRS images, DSM, and POI data. We demonstrated that the proposed TMTMR model is capable of effectively evaluating urban livability directly from multimodal geospatial data."

 High-intensity forest fires have significant destructive impacts on ecosystems and society, and are an increasing concern worldwide. Accurate probabilistic risk assessment of these fires can effectively enhance the ability to guide wildfire management, particularly for large and extreme fires. However, forecasting large-scale fire behavior characteristics remains challenging, limiting the effectiveness of spatial estimations of high-intensity forest fire potential (HIFFP). This study aims to integrate fire spread simulations and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance HIFFP estimations through multi-step time-series forecasting on fire rate of spread and fireline intensity at regional scales. We first established a high-intensity forest fire dataset based on remote sensing-informed fire spread simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled fire-spread model (WRF-SFIRE), incorporating explanatory variables on fuel, weather, climate, and topography. Then, the knowledge-guided framework (multi-step time series-based ML, MTS-ML) was designed to estimate HIFFP within different hours after fires occur, integrating with Bayesian Network (BN), Random Forest (RF), and copula models. Results indicate that MTS-ML improved HIFFP modeling compared with ML-based methods, achieving AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) > 0.95 (with ∼0.04 increments), F1 score > 0.85 (with ∼0.08 increments), and MAE < 0.15. Topographic index, foliage fuel load, and wind speed are identified as primary contributors to HIFFP.

 Accurate characterization of the role of the dry tropics in the global carbon cycle requires precise estimation of woody biomass changes due to ecological and anthropogenic change, including deforestation, forest degradation, regrowth, mortality and enhanced tree growth due to climate change. L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations offer a reliable option to consistently map these processes as they are (i) available globally since 2007 (JAXA ALOS-1, ALOS-2 and ALOS-4), and (ii) sensitive to woody structure, such as aboveground biomass density (AGBD) up to ∼100 t ha−1. However, we lack multi-site empirical understanding of the scattering processes that determine the relationship between L-band SAR and woody vegetation structure in the dry tropics, and how this is mediated by soil properties.This study used observations from ground plots in Africa (n = 171), Australia (n = 6), and South America (n = 44) to understand the impact of vegetation structure and soil properties on spatially and temporally coincident fully-polarimetric L-band SAR data. Fully-polarimetric L-band SAR single-look complex data were converted to scattering mechanisms/parameters using van Zyl, Cloude-Pottier, and Freeman-Durden polarimetric decompositions to elucidate the physical mechanisms involved. Multivariate SAR-vegetation-soil relationships were analysed using a theory-informed structural equation modelling approach. The strongest positive effects on volume scattering come from stem density (stems ha−1) and mean stem biomass of trees, and soil water and sand content (standardized regression coefficients of 0.3, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively). The only significant effect on surface scattering is from stem density (0.1). Significant effects on double bounce scattering are from stem density (0.3) and soil sand content (−0.2). Since AGBD is the product of stem density and mean stem biomass, this modelling framework points to a stronger effect from the number of trees rather than their size/biomass. Therefore, AGBD maps relying solely on radar intensity may not reflect significant changes when AGBD is increasing due to the growth of existing stems. Additionally, such maps might overestimate changes in AGBD when driven by the recruitment of new stems or loss of existing stems. Full-polarimetric observations allow the decomposition of the radar signal into volume scattering, surface scattering, and double bounce, enabling the inversion of structural equation models to retrieve both stem density and mean stem biomass. This provides a more comprehensive description of forest structure compared to retrieving only AGBD. As this approach depends on full-polarimetric data, its effectiveness is closely tied to the availability of such observations. Our findings underscore the value of recent and upcoming missions such as ALOS-4 PALSAR-3, BIOMASS and ROSE-L, and highlight the need to prioritise the acquisition of quad-pol SAR data to support future large-scale retrieval of vegetation structure attributes."

 Semantic segmentation, the process of assigning a semantic label to each pixel in an image, is a critical computer vision task for extracting detailed information from remote sensing data. However, its application to complex geographical contexts, such as coastal wetlands, is often constrained by the need for highly specialized implementations, class imbalance, and limited accessibility for non-specialists. This paper introduces a novel, modular, and adaptive open-source framework for semantic segmentation tailored to satellite imagery. Designed for maximum flexibility, the framework supports both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks and incorporates specific training strategies to handle severe class imbalances inherent in ecological detection, such as salt marsh mapping. The implementation provides a fully configurable pipeline that bridges the gap between Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Deep Learning (DL). It integrates QGIS for intuitive spatial preprocessing and grid generation with a Python-based training and prediction workflow, thereby democratizing access to advanced segmentation techniques. The framework is architecture-agnostic, allowing the seamless deployment and benchmarking of various state-of-the-art encoder–decoder models, which are effective at combining multi-scale contextual information with high spatial resolution. A key contribution is the integration of a multifaceted training methodology that includes hybrid loss functions with dynamic class weighting and spectral-consistent data augmentation to ensure robust model generalization from limited and imbalanced datasets. We demonstrate the framework’s efficacy and scalability through two distinct case studies: a multi-class land cover classification on the Crozon Peninsula using Pléiades and a binary salt marsh detection in the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay Sentinel-2 imagery. The results show that accurate segmentation can be achieved with modest computational resources, promoting more sustainable and ethical AI applications in environmental monitoring. This work provides a critical tool for researchers and practitioners aiming to apply advanced DL segmentation to domain specific remote sensing challenges beyond conventional benchmarks."

 Ratoon rice plays a vital role in boosting land productivity and contributing to stable food supplies under the context of global climate change. This system offers these advantages by demonstrating the capacity to produce an additional grain yield of 5–6 t ha−1 from the ratoon season, while simultaneously reducing the growth duration by 44–48 days compared to conventional double-season rice cultivation. However, its precise spatial distribution remains unclear under varying climatic and surface conditions, and remote sensing-based monitoring of ratoon rice has received limited attention. Existing methods often struggle to accurately distinguish ratoon rice from other morphologically similar types, such as double-season rice, and are further hampered by frequent cloud cover and rainfall, compromising optical sensing effectiveness. This study proposes a two-step ratoon rice (TSRR) mapping method using multi-source remote sensing data at the parcel scale. The TSRR method integrates Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery, utilizing the distinct growth characteristics of main-season and ratoon rice. It employs object-based segmentation and two novel indices—the SAR-based paddy rice index (SPRI) and the SAR-based ratoon rice index (SRRI)—without relying on detailed phenological information. Results indicate that the TSRR method effectively distinguishes ratoon rice from other paddy rice types, achieving an average overall accuracy (OA) of 0.87, with particularly high performance in separating ratoon rice from double-season rice. The TSRR method demonstrates strong robustness and transferability across different regions, which can provide a reliable solution for large-scale paddy rice mapping, especially in cloud-prone areas with limited optical data availability, and offers valuable support for crop monitoring, yield estimation, and national agricultural inventory initiatives."

 The accurate estimation of surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from satellite observations is essential for regional air quality management using spaceborne sensors. However, estimation performance can vary significantly under different local and temporal conditions. This study investigates specific conditions causing satellite-based surface NO2 estimators underperformance. We developed a machine-learning model using hourly NO2 vertical column densities from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), along with meteorological and land-use data for December 2021 to November 2022. The model was trained and validated using observations from 614 ground-based monitoring stations across South Korea and demonstrated strong overall performance (R = 0.88). The model accuracy varied by station type and temporal conditions. Higher performance was observed at urban and roadside stations (R = 0.83–0.87). Contrastingly, national background and rural stations exhibited lower correlations (R = 0.66–0.68); and port stations showed moderate performance (R = 0.74). Seasonally, the performance peaked in winter (R = 0.89) and declined in summer (R = 0.82). Diurnally, better performance was observed between 09:45 and 14:45 Korea Standard Time (KST) when higher number of GEMS observations were available. The combined analysis further showed that urban and roadside sites maintained a consistently high performance during winter. These results indicate strong influence of spatial and seasonal factors on model accuracy. Therefore, local NO2 levels, boundary layer data, and land–sea corrections should be considered to improve satellite-based surface NO2 estimation. The findings of this study provide practical guidance on the spatiotemporal limits of geostationary monitoring, which can be adopted, with improvements, in establishing geostationary satellites as reliable tools for operational air quality policies development and public health assessments."

 On 17 December 2023, an exceptionally heavy rainfall event occurred at the southeastern tip of Tamil Nadu, with Kayalpattinam of Thoothukudi district recording 94 cm of rainfall in a single day, which caused widespread flooding in the region and its neighbourhood. This event was triggered by a low-pressure (LP) system moving northwestward through a complex terrain setting, bordered by the Western Ghats (WG) to the west and the Sri Lankan Mountains to the east. This synoptic event presents a rare opportunity to examine lateral and cross-barrier topographic influences on extreme rainfall. Three high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate the role of mountains in modulating this localised extreme rainfall. The study carried out (1) a control simulation (CNTRL) with natural terrain, (2) a simulation without the Sri Lankan Mountain topography (NTSLI), and (3) a simulation with removing mountains over the entire domain (NTWDOM). The CNTRL simulation accurately reproduced the features of the observed rainfall and indicated an extension of the LP system towards the east coast, leading to a sustained localised moisture convergence and deep convection. Further, the simulation highlighted the formation of a cold pool in the windward regions of the WG due to the evaporative cooling and effective orographic blocking during the event. The NTSLI simulated eastward extension of LP system with its centre shifted in southwestward compared to the CNTRL and exhibited relatively stronger easterly winds in the absence of the Sri Lankan Mountains. The enhanced easterlies produced multiple moisture convergence zones, thereby altering convective processes and leading to reduced rainfall over the Tamil Nadu coast. The simulation indicated a southwestward shift in the rainfall pattern. In contrast, the NTWDOM simulation, with no orographic barriers, inhibited cold pool formation, dispersed moisture convergence, and resulted in weaker convection, as well as a westward displacement of rainfall towards the Arabian Sea. Our results clearly highlight that, apart from cross-orographic barriers, lateral orographic features also play a critical role in modulating the location, intensity, spatial distribution, and evolution of extreme rainfall events by influencing synoptic systems, moisture dynamics, and convective processes."

 Amid escalating climate change and environmental instability, understanding the origins, transport mechanisms, and climatic-environmental impacts of intensifying East Asian dust storms has become crucial for global sustainability science. However, current research still faces critical limitations with lacking city- or site-level resolution for source apportionment, and quantitative assessments of the climatic and environmental effects of severe dust events are still insufficient. Here, we integrated in situ measurements, reanalysis datasets, and numerical simulations to investigate the extreme East Asian dust storm in March 2023. Results indicated that the Gobi Desert was the dominant source, contributing approximately 74.9–94.6 % to PM10 levels across four northern Chinese cities. Fine particles (2.5–5.0 μm) exhibited faster and higher-altitude transport than coarse particles (>7.5 μm), with consistent northwestward advection. Size-dependent deposition regimes emerged – dry deposition peaked for 7.5–10 μm particles, while wet deposition shifted from 5 to 7.5 μm in source regions to 2.5–5.0 μm in downwind North China. Crucially, we quantify the dust–climate feedback loop where aerosol-induced surface cooling by reducing surface solar radiation of 2.4–4.8 W m−2, which in turn suppresses surface turbulent kinetic energy and decrease the boundary layer height up to 40 m. The enhanced boundary layer stability subsequently promoted futher dust accumulation. By elucidating this positive feedback mechanism, our study moves beyond established correlations to reveal a key process amplifying extreme dust storms, with critical implications for predicting their intensity and impacts under a changing climate."

We identified aurora kinase A as a cell-intrinsic factor contributing to Erk activation and transcriptional response. Consequently, suppressing aurora kinase A activity delayed exit from naïve pluripotency. Moreover, our results show that upon entry into mitosis, Erk relocates to the cell division machinery.

Using idealized emission-driven climate simulations, this analysis examines changes in the extreme fire weather conditions under net-zero emission (ZeroE) and net-negative emission (NegE) scenarios. Compared to peak CO2levels, the NegE scenario achieves substantially greater fire danger mitigation, particularly in climatologically high-fire-danger regions, because of lower temperatures and increased relative humidity. In contrast, the ZeroE scenario leaves fire danger elevated globally, especially in Northern low-latitude regions. Regional responses are shaped by differences in atmospheric moisture supply, influenced by changes in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and the latitudinal position of the intertropical convergence zone. These findings highlight the crucial role of aggressive CO2removal strategies in mitigating fire weather dangers and underscore the limitations of ZeroEs alone in addressing global wildfire challenges."

These events tend to persist longer, causing widespread socioeconomic disruption. Using long-term satellite observations across North India, we find that elevated aerosol concentrations are associated with thicker fog and larger droplets near the fog top. However, the underlying mechanism of this observed relationship remains unclear. High-resolution aerosol-coupled fog simulations suggest that increased aerosol loading enhances fog droplet number concentrations, leading to greater latent heat release. This, in turn, results in buoyancy-induced vertical mixing within the fog. Simultaneously, the increased water content intensifies longwave radiative cooling at the fog top, promoting cool-saturated conditions that further favor the formation of condensate and larger droplets. Together, the aerosol-induced vertical mixing—driven by thermodynamic uplift and radiative cooling—amplifies condensational processes, causing fog invigoration. We find that this phenomenon is especially pronounced during nighttime. Overall, our findings indicate a mechanistic pathway by which aerosols increase fog thickness over Northern India."

Here, we propose a stepwise synthesis strategy that yields the first inorganic aerogel exhibiting state-of-the-art n-type TE performance. Optimized aerogels with 95% porosity exhibit a high power factor of 34.8 microwatts per meter per square kelvin and an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.061 microwatts per meter per kelvin, resulting inzTvalues of 0.17 at 300 kelvin and 0.24 at 383 kelvin. A vertical TE generator prototype with six TE-aerogel legs achieves a gravimetric output power of 76 microwatts per gram under a ΔTof ~60 kelvin. To address brittleness, a polyimide-encapsulated aerogel with bioinspired architecture was developed, achieving a high compressive strength to 1.4 kilopascals while maintaining excellent TE performance. This work establishes a generalizable method for designing high-performance flexible inorganic aerogels, opening more possibilities for lightweight wearable energy harvesting technologies."

We developed a self-transforming chitosan hydrogel to act as a biomimetic TLS. The chitosan hydrogel solution was peritumorally injected in bacteria-colonized tumors in mice followed by the rapid in situ gelation. After killing tumor cells and intratumoral bacteria by doxorubicin and cefotaxime, the hydrogel efficiently adsorbed bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, tumor cell–derived damage-associated molecular patterns, and tumor-associated antigens. These danger signals greatly potentiated immune cell recruitment into the hydrogel and sufficiently activated dendritic cells (DCs) by the absorbed DNA-mediated cGAS-STING activation. The activated DCs converted T cells into cytotoxic T cells, and these activated immune cells migrated through the pores of hydrogels into the tumor tissues, effectively remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby inhibiting the tumor growth and metastasis. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified method to establish a safe, easy-to-control, and effective biomimetic TLS that offers a promising strategy for updating current combined immunotherapy against various tumors."

The exceptional device performance is achieved through a binary host-guest architecture using a zero-dimensional organic-inorganic antimony(III) halide, which exhibits bright emission with a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Optical and photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations reveal the mechanism underlying its highly efficient self-trapped exciton emission. Efficient LEDs were achieved by doping (AylPPh3)2SbCl5into a binary host system, which improved film morphology, enhanced charge carrier mobility, and achieved better carrier balance.

Their physiology and evolutionary history have remained enigmatic due to their rarity in natural environments. Here, we assembled 101 Korarchaeota genomes from different seafloor hydrothermal vents and terrestrial hot springs, revealing that Korarchaeota lineages have undergone multiple transitions between marine and terrestrial habitats. These transitions were accompanied by genomic shifts reflecting adaptations to habitat-specific physicochemical conditions, including variations in nutrient availability, potential energy sources, osmotic conditions, and viral predation stresses. Molecular dating suggests that Korarchaeota originated ~2.84 billion years (Ga) ago, with three subsequent diversification events occurring around 2.42, 1.52, and 1.29 Ga ago. These major diversifications coincide with key geological events such as the Great Oxidation Event and the breakup and formation of supercontinents. Our findings provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory and ecological adaptations of Korarchaeota, thereby enhancing our understanding of microbial coevolution with Earth’s dynamic surface environments."

This strategy successfully reversed the established protonation pathway of electron-rich enamine-copper complexes, effectively inverting the conventional polarity at the β position of the amine in the form of a pyrrole-type α-amino copper carbene.

In particular, this α-sialylation protocol has been successfully applied in one-pot synthesis of several α-sialoglycans, including bioactive ganglioside Hp-s1 and STNantigen with reduced steps and improved efficiency. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations provide the mechanistic insights of much higher reactivity of sialyl PVB donors than the corresponding thiosialoside donors in the presence ofN-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH).

However, the most prevalent techniques for their synthesis are still the nonradical approaches of sulfoxide precursors with amines, where prepreparation of substrates, harsh reaction conditions, and restricted substrate ranges have intrinsically limited the synthetic scope. Herein, we leveraged a practical and streamlined electrocatalytic strategy to achieve sulfinamide synthesis, which involves the intermolecular oxidative cross-coupling of readily available arylthiols and aliphatic amines.

Its probe-integrated electrode array supports spatial-selective manipulation, while the adjustable electrode gaps enable manipulating multiscale targets. The independent programming of the electrical signals of each electrode further allows using multiple electric principles to achieve multiscale and spatiotemporal programmable control and in situ measurements, marking a transition from function-fixed single-object manipulation to function-on-demand single-object manipulation.

Like declarative programming in computer science, this approach emphasizes desired outcomes rather than specific steps, simplifying molecular programming and avoiding errors caused when thermodynamic forces work against programmed kinetics. We show broad applicability through three distinct applications: reversible signal propagation with fan-in and fan-out, algorithmic self-assembly performing Boolean logic, and synthesis of molecular chains (concatemers) of programmable length, illustrating how thermodynamic computation can enable practical molecular engineering tasks.

While we underestimate the ocean carbon sink when mimicking real-world sampling, adding available sailboat data does not substantially improve reconstructions. Nevertheless, increased sampling reveals a stronger carbon sink, particularly between 40°S and 60°S. The improvement persists with hypothetical measurement uncertainties, but substantial differences arise depending on whether positive or negative biases are applied to the race track data. While we show that two additional circumnavigations already improve the ocean mean sink estimate, we further highlight the finding that the additional data remain insufficient to correct the overestimated CO2sink trend, calling for continuation of the ongoing data collection."

This protocol works well for both aryl and unactivated alkenes with a broad functional group compatibility and is applicable to ─SCF3, ─SCN, and ─SBz groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal a key bimolecular homolytic (SH2) substitution process that efficiently traps the nascent C(sp3)-centered radical intermediates in acidic media and facilitates the C─S bond formation with high regioselectivity and even primary enantiocontrol.

This type of robust transport of polaritons (i.e., polariton canalization) holds promise for subwavelength control of energy flows. However, the lack of in situ dynamic tunability of canalized polaritons hinders such control because the canalization direction is fixed in the fabricated device. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating programmable polariton canalization in a reconfigurable single-layer metasurface. By engineering the orientation of metasurface unit cells, the direction of canalized magnetic polaritons can be programmed along any in-plane direction (i.e., dynamic all-angle tunability). On-demand steering of canalized polaritons allows customized near-field patterns to be obtained at any desired location—a proof of concept for canalization-based information display applications.

We analyzed newly compiled databases of Paleozoic vertebrate occurrences, biogeography, and ecosystems, revealing that the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (~445 to 443 million years ago) triggered parallel, endemic radiations of jawed and related jawless vertebrates (gnathostomes) in isolated refugia. Postextinction ecosystems hosted the first definitive appearances of most major vertebrate lineages of the Paleozoic “Age of Fishes” (and today), following the loss of ubiquitous stem-cyclostome conodonts, nascent faunas of other gnathostomes, and pelagic invertebrates. Turnover and recovery patterns matched those following climatically similar events like the end-Devonian mass extinction, including a postextinction “gap” with low biodiversity.

By contrast, non-DBD domains enable targeting of repressed chromatin marked by H3K9me3 or H3K27me3.Fusions of different non-DBD segments of heterochromatin-targeting pioneer factors to the transcription factor SOX2 can expand binding of SOX2 target motifs within heterochromatin and improve cellular reprogramming.

We show that, as in patients, UCE expression is markedly reduced in multiple HCC mouse models, including those driven by oncogenic c-MET/β-catenin, leading to impaired ammonia clearance, altered amino acid metabolism, and increased pyrimidine synthesis. In contrast, UCE expression is largely preserved in c-MET/sgAxin1 tumors, allowing assessment of the consequences of UCE loss. Silencing individual UCEs increases ammonia burden and accelerates HCC with reprogrammed amino acid and pyrimidine metabolism, supporting a causal role for defective ammonia detoxification in oncogenesis. Notably, dietary protein restriction lowers hepatic ammonia and slows tumor growth. These findings establish a mechanistic link between nitrogen overload and hepatocarcinogenesis and highlight protein restriction as a feasible therapeutic strategy for patients with impaired nitrogenous waste handling."

However, current miRNA imaging probes suffer from irreversible responses, impairing their capabilities for real-time tracking concentration fluctuations. Here, we present a near-infrared regulated DNA tweezer (NIR-DNA tweezer) with reversible binding affinities to target miRNA. Self-quenched DNA tweezer is composed of BHQ3-labeled miRNA recognition strand and Cy5-labeled competitive strand, while competitive strand is embedded with azobenzene (Azo) to photo-switch the hybridization zones of DNA tweezer for reversible miRNA recognitions. NIR-DNA tweezer is obtained by conjugating DNA tweezer to upconversion nanoparticles, which is switched to “transit” status upon high-power 808-nm irradiation withcis-Azo to allow miRNA recognition with Cy5 fluorescence recovery. Upon low-power 808-nm irradiation, NIR-DNA tweezer is switched to “closed” status withtrans-Azo to release miRNA and erase signal. The as-presented NIR-DNA tweezer achieves real-time in vivo tracing of miRNA expression fluctuations upon continuous chemotherapeutic drug and inhibitor treatments."

This protocol enables versatile access to chiral isoindolinone–linked benzofuran and indole bis-heterocyclic derivatives bearing a quaternary stereogenic center in good yields with high enantioselectivities. A sterically demanding, electron-rich (S)-(+)-1,1’-Bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-derived phosphoramidite ligand provides excellent control over both chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity. Moreover, these bis-heterocycles exhibited promising antimicrobial activity."
