10.5194/acp-25-3327-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注北极海洋系统中冰核粒子（INPs）的来源和特性，特别是陆地径流对海洋INPs的影响。虽然INPs会影响云的形成和辐射特性，但研究重点在于海洋生物过程和陆地径流，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['ice-nucleating particles', 'INPs', 'cloud formation', 'cloud droplet freezing', 'radiative properties', 'terrestrial runoff', 'marine systems']",Corina Wieber;Lasse Z. Jensen;Leendert Vergeynst;Lorenz Meire;Thomas Juul-Pedersen;Kai Finster;Tina Šantl-Temkiv,Terrestrial runoff is an important source of biological ice-nucleating particles in Arctic marine systems,"The Arctic region is subject to profound changes due to a warming climate. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the seawater can get transported to the atmosphere and impact cloud formation. However, the sources of characteristics of INPs in the marine areas are poorly understood. We investigated the INPs in seawater from Greenlandic fjords and identified a seasonal variability, with highly active INPs originating from terrestrial sources such as glacial and soil runoff. 
 The accelerated warming of the Arctic manifests in sea ice loss and melting glaciers, significantly altering the dynamics of marine biota. This disruption in marine ecosystems can lead to an increased emission of biological ice-nucleating particles (INPs) from the ocean into the atmosphere. Once airborne, these INPs induce cloud droplet freezing, thereby affecting cloud lifetime and radiative properties. Despite the potential atmospheric impacts of marine INPs, their properties and sources remain poorly understood. By analyzing sea bulk water and the sea surface microlayer in two southwest Greenlandic fjords, collected between June and September 2018, and investigating the INPs along with the microbial communities, we could demonstrate a clear seasonal variation in the number of INPs and a notable input from terrestrial runoff. We found the highest INP concentration in June during the late stage of the phytoplankton bloom and active melting processes causing enhanced terrestrial runoff. These highly active INPs were smaller in size and less heat-sensitive than those found later in the summer and those previously identified in Arctic marine systems. A negative correlation between salinity and INP abundance suggests freshwater input as a source of INPs. Stable oxygen isotope analysis, along with the strong correlation between INPs and the presence of terrestrial and freshwater bacteria such as Aquaspirillum arcticum, Rhodoferax, and Glaciimonas, highlighted meteoric water as the primary origin of the freshwater influx, suggesting that the notably active INPs originate from terrestrial sources such as glacial and soil runoff."

 Accurate NOx emission estimates are required to better understand air pollution, investigate the effectiveness of emission restrictions, and develop effective emission control strategies. This study investigates and demonstrates the ability and uncertainty of the superposition column model in combination with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) tropospheric NO2 column data to estimate city-scale NOx emissions and chemical lifetimes and their variabilities. Using the recently improved TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 column product (v2.4–2.6), we derive daily NOx emissions and chemical lifetimes over the city of Wuhan for 372 d with full NO2 coverage between May 2018 and December 2023 and validate the results with bottom-up emission inventories. We find an insignificant weekly cycle of NOx emissions for Wuhan. We estimate a summer-to-winter emission ratio of 0.77, which may be overestimated to some extent but is still lower than suggested by the bottom-up inventories. We find a steady decline in NOx emissions from 2019 to 2023 (except for the sudden drop in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 lockdown), indicating the success of the emission control strategy. The superposition model method results in an ∼ 15 % lower estimation of NOx emissions when the wind direction is from distinct upwind NO2 hotspots compared to other wind directions, indicating the need to improve the approach for cities that are not relatively isolated pollution hotspots. The method tends to underestimate NOx emissions and lifetimes when the wind speed is > 5–7 m s−1, and, in Wuhan's case, the underestimation is ∼ 4 % for the emissions and ∼ 8 % for the chemical lifetime. The results of this work nevertheless confirm the strength of the superposition column model in estimating urban NOx emissions with reasonable accuracy."

Theeuwes;Janet F. Barlow;Antti Mannisenaho;Denise Hertwig;Ewan O'Connor;Alan Robins,Observations of tall-building wakes using a scanning Doppler lidar,"A Doppler lidar was placed in a highly built-up area in London to measure wakes from tall buildings during a period of 1 year. We were able to detect wakes and assess their dependence on wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric stability. 
 High-rise buildings, increasingly a feature of many large cities, impact local atmospheric flow conditions. Tall-building wakes affect air quality downstream due to turbulent mixing and require parameterisation in dispersion models. Previous studies using numerical or physical modelling have been performed under idealised and neutral conditions. There has been a lack of data available in real urban environments due to the difficulty in deploying traditional wind sensors. Doppler wind lidars (DWLs) have been used frequently for studying wind turbine wakes but never building wakes. This study presents a year-long deployment of a DWL in a complex urban environment, studying tall-building wakes under atmospheric conditions. A HALO Photonics StreamLine DWL was deployed in a low- and mid-rise densely packed area in central London. From its rooftop position (33.5 m a.g.l. compared to mean building height of 12.5 m), velocity azimuth display (VAD) scans at 0° elevation intersected with two taller nearby buildings of 90 and 40 m a.g.l. Using an ensemble-averaging approach, wake dimensions were investigated in terms of wind direction, stability, and wind speed. Boundary layer stability categories were defined using eddy covariance observations from the BT Tower (191 m), and mixing height estimations were made from vertical stare scans. A method for calculating normalised velocity deficit from VAD scans is presented. For neutral conditions, wake dimensions around both buildings for the prevailing wind direction were compared with the ADMS-Build wake model for a single, isolated cube. The model underpredicts wake dimensions, confirming previous wind tunnel findings for the same area. Under varying stability, unstable and deep boundary layers were shown to produce shorter, narrower wakes. Typically observed wake lengths were 120–300 m, and widths were 80–150 m and reduced by 50–100 m downwind. Stable and shallow boundary layers were less frequent and produced an insignificant difference in wake dimensions compared to neutral conditions. The sensitivity to stability was weakened by enhanced turbulence upstream (i.e. due to other building wakes). Weakened stability dependence was confirmed if there were more obstacles upstream as the wind direction incident on the buildings changed. The results highlight the potential for future wake studies using multiple DWLs  deploying both vertical and horizontal scan patterns. Dispersion models should incorporate the effect of a complex urban canopy within which tall buildings are embedded."

To evaluate the practical application value of these data, we must assess their quality. We evaluate the quality of YUNYAO RO data. By using the “three-cornered hat” method and comparing with data from Metop-C and COSMIC-2, it was found that the YUNYAO GNSS-RO data are of high quality. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) data are an important component of numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. To incorporate more GNSS-RO data into NWP systems, commercial RO data have become an excellent option. Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. (YUNYAO) plans to launch a meteorological constellation of 90 satellites equipped with GNSS-RO instruments, which will significantly increase the amount of GNSS-RO data in NWP systems. This study evaluates the quality of neutral atmospheric refractivity and bending angle profiles from YUNYAO satellites Y003 to Y010 during the period from 1 May  to 31 July 2023. Compared with the refractivity and bending angle calculated from ERA5, the absolute values of the mean bias (MB) for YUNYAO refractivity and bending angle data are less than 1.54 % and 4.51 %, respectively, in the height range of 0 to 40 km and close to 0 between 4 and 40 km. The standard deviations (SDs) are below 3.35 % and 11.06 %, respectively, with variations in SDs among different GNSS satellites, especially in the lower troposphere and the stratosphere. Second, the refractivity error SD of YUNYAO RO data is estimated using the “three-cornered hat” (3CH) method and multiple data sets. In the pressure range of 1000–10 hPa, the refractivity error SD of YUNYAO RO data is below 2.53 %, and the differences in refractivity error SDs among different GNSS satellites do not exceed 0.52 %. Finally, compared to COSMIC-2 and Metop-C RO data, YUNYAO RO data exhibit consistent refractivity error SDs and are smaller within 300–50 hPa."

To accurately assess these impacts, we developed a machine learning model to downscale daily climate data to hourly Temperature Humidity Index (THI) values. We utilized historical weather data to train our model and applied them to future climate projections, under two climate scenarios. 
 Climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture, with potential impacts on food security, economic stability, and human livelihoods. Dairy cattle, a crucial component of the livestock sector, are particularly vulnerable to heat stress, which can adversely affect milk production, immune function, and feed intake and, in extreme cases, lead to mortality. The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a widely used metric to quantify the combined effects of temperature and humidity on cattle. However, the THI was previously estimated using daily-level data, which do not capture the daily thermal load and cumulative heat stress, especially during nights when cooling is inadequate. To address this limitation, we developed a machine learning approach to temporally downscale daily climate data to hourly THI values. Utilizing historical ERA5 reanalysis data, we trained an XGBoost model and generated hourly THI datasets for 12 NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate models under two emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) extending to the end of the century. These high-resolution THI data provide an accurate quantification of heat stress in dairy cattle, enabling improved predictions and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on this vital agricultural sector. The dataset created in this study is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/THI (Georgiades, 2024b)."

By using advanced modeling techniques and incorporating sea surface temperature observations, it provides a consistent picture of long-term climate variability. The dataset captures key ocean, sea ice and atmosphere changes, helping scientists understand past climate changes and variability. 
 Climate reanalyses are essential for studying climate variability, understanding climate processes, and initializing climate predictions. We present CoRea1860+ (Wang and Counillon, 2025, https://doi.org/10.11582/2025.00009), a 30-member coupled reanalysis spanning from 1860 to the present, produced using the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM) and assimilating sea surface temperature (SST) observations. NorCPM combines the Norwegian Earth System Model with the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation method. SST, available throughout the entire period, serves as the primary source of instrumental oceanic measurements prior to the 1950s. CoRea1860+ belongs to the category of sparse-input reanalyses, designed to minimize artifacts arising from changes in the observation network over time. By exclusively assimilating oceanic data, this reanalysis offers valuable insights into the ocean’s role in driving climate system variability, including its influence on the atmosphere and sea ice. This study first describes the numerical model, SST dataset, and assimilation implementation used to produce CoRea1860+. It then provides a comprehensive evaluation of the reanalysis across four key areas: reliability, ocean variability, sea ice variability, and atmospheric variability, benchmarked against more than ten independent reanalyses and observational datasets. Overall, CoRea1860+ demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in observation-rich periods, and provides a reasonable representation of climate variability. It successfully captures key features such as multidecadal variability and long-term trends in ocean heat content, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and sea ice variability in both hemispheres. Furthermore, CoRea1860+ aligns well with the other datasets for surface air temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure, and 500 hPa geopotential height, especially in the tropics where air-sea interactions are most pronounced."

The results demonstrate that both sites can be modeled with similar parameters and robust performance over a wide range of parameters. The study shows that the model is useful for non-experts and applicable for modeling ecosystems with limited data. It holds promise for evolutionary and deep-time climate models. 
 Trait-based models founded on biophysical principles are becoming popular in planktonic ecological modeling, and justifiably so. They allow for slim, efficient models with a significant reduction in parameters that are well-suited to modeling past and future climate changes. In their idealized forms, trait-based models describe the ecosystem in one set of parameters defined by first principles and rooted in physics, chemistry, geometry, and evolution. The result is an emerging ecosystem defined by physical and chemical limitations at the cell level. At present, however, a significant part of these parameters is not fully constrained, which potentially introduces considerable uncertainty into the model results. Here, we investigate how these parameters influence the ecosystem structure of one of the simplest trait-based models, the Nutrient-Unicellular-Multicellular (NUM) model. We describe the unicellular module of the NUM model and, through an extensive parameter sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the model – with a large span in parameters – can capture the general features of the picoplanktonic, nanoplanktonic, and microplanktonic ecosystem in a high-productivity upwelling system. We demonstrate that it is possible to narrow the range of parameters to get a stable and acceptable solution. Finally, the model responds correctly in an oligotrophic downwelling system using parameters fitted to the upwelling system. Our analysis demonstrates that the unicellular module of the NUM model is broadly accessible without detailed knowledge of the parameter settings and that the first-principles approach is well-suited to modeling poorly resolved regions and ecosystem evolution during current and deep-time climate change."

We performed analyses stratified by child’s sex, coadjusting for maternal or paternal PFAS and other confounders and estimating PFAS mixture effects using quantile g-computation. In male children, multiple maternal PFAS, modeled as individual chemicals or a mixture, were associated with externalizing difficulties. Maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with internalizing difficulties in female children. In contrast, paternal exposure to individual PFAS or PFAS mixture was not associated with behavioral difficulties in children of either sex. In summary, maternal prenatal exposure to PFAS, but not paternal PFAS, was associated with mid-childhood behavioral difficulties in a sex-specific manner.

To evaluate the safety upon acute exposure to OP pesticides, the Dietary Comparator Ratio (DCR) approach was used for the first time for this class of chemicals. Six OPs including chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, methyl parathion, profenofos, and chlorfenvinphos were selected as model compounds. Seventy-four reports of human exposures were collected, and a DCR value at each defined exposure level was calculated with in vitro determined AChE inhibition potency and in silico simulated internal exposures. Results indicate that the DCR outcomes are comparable to the actual knowledge on the presence or absence of in vivo AChE inhibition and adverse effects for the respective exposure scenarios. Of all collected scenarios, only four false positives but no false negatives were obtained. No safety concern on acute neurotoxicity appears to be raised for the evaluated environmental exposure scenarios to OPs. To conclude, the described DCR approach provides an adequate evaluation of the OP-induced adverse outcomes for humans, shedding light on its utility for 3Rs-compliant safety assessment of chemicals with different toxicity mechanisms especially for which in vitro bioassays are available."

Although maritime air masses contained fewer VOCs, emissions from high-productivity seawater and shipping increased reactive alkene levels. Additionally, higher temperatures, stronger solar radiation, and reduced NO titration effects over the sea facilitated ozone formation. By integrating marine-terrestrial observations, this study underscores the impact of pollutant emissions from high-productivity seas on coastal air quality, particularly through secondary formation during long-range transport. The link between coastal seawater eutrophication and air photochemical pollution emphasizes the need for coordinated air and water pollution control in coastal cities. These findings may apply to other similar coastal environments worldwide."

Here, serum samples from 28 workers at a fluorochemical facility were analyzed using nontarget techniques, identifying 64 PFAS classes, including 15 novel ones such as pentafluorosulfur ether-substituted perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids, hydrogen-substituted perfluoroalkylamines, and perfluoroalkylsulfonyl protocatechualdehyde esters. Temporal trend analyses (2008–2018) revealed stable levels for most PFAS but an increase in perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), suggesting industrial shifts from long-chain PFAS to short-chain homologues in China since the early 2010s. Commonly reported structurally modified PFAS (e.g., hydrogen/carbonyl/chlorine substitution, ether insertion, and unsaturation) were likely historical byproducts of legacy PFAS production rather than intentionally manufactured alternatives. A Toxicological Priority Index-based risk assessment, integrating mobility, persistence, and bioaccumulation indices, identified perfluoroalkylamines, di(perfluoroakyl sulfonyl)imides, structurally modified perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids/carboxylic acids, and perfluoroalkylsulfonamidoacetic acids as high-risk PFAS chemicals. Overall, structurally modified PFAS exhibited higher mobility but lower persistence and bioaccumulation than legacy PFAS, except for chlorinated variants, which showed increased bioaccumulation potential. This study highlights critical gaps in the spectrum of historically emitted PFAS and emphasizes the need for large-scale monitoring and extensive risk assessments to manage emerging PFAS."

Many countries are grappling with significant historical Sb-containing waste, leading to soil contamination, which is of international concern. The lack of clarity on Sb sources and migration mechanisms in soil limits the effective prevention and control of soil pollution. This study utilized Sb stable isotope techniques to analyze soil profiles from two pollution scenarios, with the aims of quantifying Sb sources, understanding migration processes, and elucidating isotopic fractionation mechanisms in soil. The results reveal that surface soil Sb originates primarily from atmospheric dry deposition (31.7–56.3%), wet deposition (19.6–32.7%), and rock weathering (<21.0%). In subsurface soils, Sb mainly comes from solutions resulting from desorption in upper soil layers, with adsorption by iron minerals, manganese (hydr-)oxides, and organic matter impeding its downward movement. Deeper soil layers contain Sb derived from parent rock weathering, with migration impacted by secondary mineral adsorption. Groundwater aids in Sb migration and influences isotopic fractionation during water–soil exchange. This research introduces a novel framework for quantitatively tracking Sb pollution and enhances the scientific understanding of the geochemical behavior of Sb in soil."

We overlaid 1930s-40s Home Owners’ Loan Corporation maps of 202 US cities from the Mapping Inequality project onto EPA EJScreen data to analyze whether a collective, simultaneous, IQR increase in 12 environmental hazards (various air pollutants and toxic facility proximities) was significantly associated with higher odds of a neighborhood having been historically redlined (D-grade) using a boosted regression tree model. Controlling for neighborhood socioeconomic status, a collective, simultaneous, IQR increase in 12 environmental hazards was associated with 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17–1.46) times higher odds of a neighborhood having been historically redlined. Proximity to hazardous waste and wastewater discharge sites, traffic volume, and diesel particulate matter were the most pervasive environmental hazards in historically redlined neighborhoods. Cumulative environmental inequities were largest in the Western US by region and in Oklahoma City, Cincinnati, and Detroit by city. We find that historically redlined neighborhoods may be disproportionately impacted by cumulative environmental impacts. Environmental regulation of single pollutants may not be sufficiently protective of historically marginalized communities, which may help us understand why contemporary environmental health disparities persist today."

Numerous pollutants are known to disrupt animal behavior, alter ecological interactions, and shift evolutionary trajectories. Crucially, both chemical pollutants and individual organisms are nonrandomly distributed throughout the environment. Despite this fact, the current evidence for chemical-induced impacts on wildlife largely stems from tests that restrict organism movement and force homogeneous exposures. While such approaches have provided pivotal ecotoxicological insights, they overlook the dynamic spatiotemporal interactions that shape wildlife–pollution relationships in nature. Indeed, the seemingly simple notion that pollutants and animals move nonrandomly in the environment creates a complex of dynamic interactions, many of which have never been theoretically modeled or experimentally tested. Here, we conceptualize dynamic interactions between spatiotemporal variation in pollutants and organisms and highlight their ecological and evolutionary implications. We propose a three-pronged approach─integrating in silico modeling, laboratory experiments that allow movement, and field-based tracking of free-ranging animals─to bridge the gap between controlled ecotoxicological studies and real-world wildlife exposures. Advances in telemetry, remote sensing, and computational models provide the necessary tools to quantify these interactions, paving the way for a new era of ecotoxicology that accounts for spatiotemporal complexity."

The study highlighted challenges in implementing MII at midstream facilities, including significant disagreement in TD methods (up to 2:1), discrepancies between TD and operator estimated inventory (OEI), limited use of measurements to improve inventories due to confusion and distrust, and underestimated analysis costs, often matching the expense of TD surveys.

Furthermore, we compare vendor-provided emission rate estimates to estimates from an open-source quantification algorithm applied to the raw CMS concentration data. This experimental setup allows us to separate the effect of the sensor platform (i.e., sensor type and arrangement) from the quantification algorithm. We find that 1) localization and quantification estimates rarely agree between the three CMS solutions on short time scales (i.e., 30 min), but temporally aggregated emission rate distributions are similar between solutions, 2) differences in emission rate distributions are generally driven by the quantification algorithm, rather than the sensor platform, 3) agreement between CMS and aerial rate estimates varies by CMS solution but is close to parity when CMS estimates are averaged across solutions, and 4) similar sites with similar bottom-up inventories do not necessarily have similar emission characteristics.

Here, we use the air quality model GEOS-Chem adjoint with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)-based satellite downscaling to estimate that long-term NO2 exposure is responsible for 2.07 (95% CI 0.91–2.70) million pediatric asthma cases and 1.98 (95% CI 0.52–2.86) million deaths globally in 2019. We attribute these to anthropogenic NOx emissions by sector, country, and season using the adjoint model and provide a recommendation for the most impactful sector and season for NOx emission controls in each G20 country. Discrepancies exist between the health benefits incurred by emission reductions and the emission sector distributions, particularly in countries with emitters adjoining population centers. For example, we find that, if Russian anthropogenic NOx emissions were reduced uniformly by 10% across all sectors, the energy sector, 31% of annual NOx emissions, would account for 47% of pediatric asthma and 49% of premature death health benefits. The season in which these emission reductions occur also affects the magnitude of the health benefit, as seen by the fact that Russian wintertime NOx emission reductions alone are responsible for approximately one-third of the annual health benefits for each health outcome.

The GMP primarily varies with GMST, however, change in the low‐latitude land fraction is also important. An increase in land fraction can directly reduce GMP by reducing latent heat and increasing sensible heat. Furthermore, the weakened greenhouse gas effect of the drier atmosphere further amplify the direct impact by approximately 44%.

In addition, a 150‐day periodicity in anomalous column dust optical depth most likely emerges in response to extrema of the MNAM.

CCIC offers TIWP estimates at three‐hourly resolution from 1983 and half‐hourly resolution from 2000 onwards. We demonstrate the long‐term stability of CCIC by directly comparing it with CloudSat/CALIPSO‐based estimates over the entire mission lifetime. Additionally, we assess CCIC against other long‐term TIWP records, revealing that CCIC yields the most accurate TIWP estimates compared to CloudSat/CALIPSO‐based reference estimates. Analysis of regional 40 year trends across four long‐term TIWP data sets indicates an increase of TIWP over the Southern Ocean and the east Bering Sea in two observational data sets and ERA5.

Concurrent water vapor and nitric acid profiles from Aura Microwave Limb Sounder measurements are used to determine the approximate temperature threshold for PSC formation. Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite LP daytime measurements have limited coverage of the polar vortex region during winter months, with increasing coverage as spring equinox approaches. Suomi National Polar‐orbiting Partnership (NPP) OMPS LP observations since 2012 show a relatively consistent seasonal pattern of PSC formation and evolution in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), but significantly more variability during each season and between seasons in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Comparisons of OMPS LP PSC detections with concurrent Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations show good agreement in spatial distribution and seasonal evolution when the CALIOP latitude coverage is screened to the range viewed by OMPS LP daytime measurements. Limb Profiler measurements from current and future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites will enable us to follow long‐term changes in PSC behavior, such as possible effects of the increased stratospheric water vapor from the Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai eruption."

 Many technological breakthroughs in electronics and photonics were made possible by downscaling—the process of making elementary devices smaller in size1–5. The downsizing of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on III–V semiconductors led to micro-LEDs5–12, an ‘ultimate technology’ for displays. However, micro-LEDs are costly to produce and they exhibit severe efficiency losses when the pixel sizes are reduced to about 10 μm or less, hindering their potential in commercial applications. Here we show the downscaling of an emerging class of LEDs based on perovskite semiconductors to below the conventional size limits. Micro- and nano-perovskite LEDs (micro-PeLEDs/nano-PeLEDs) with characteristic pixel lengths from hundreds of micrometres down to about 90 nm are demonstrated, through a localized contact fabrication scheme that prevents non-radiative losses at the pixel boundaries. For our near-infrared (NIR) and green micro-PeLEDs, average external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) are maintained at around 20% across a wide range of pixel lengths (650 to 3.5 μm), exhibiting minimum performance reduction on downsizing. Our nano-PeLEDs with characteristic pixel lengths down to about 90 nm represent the smallest LEDs reported, enabling a record-high pixel density of 127,000 pixels per inch (PPI) among all classes of LED arrays. Our demonstration showcases the strength of micro- and nano-PeLEDs as a next-generation light-source technology with unprecedented compactness and scalability.

 Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wavefunctions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. By contrast, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), magnetism—manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavours1–7—originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system indicates signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution ΔS ≈ 1 kB per charge carrier that begins at the Curie temperature and survives more than one order of magnitude in temperature. First-order phase transitions show an isospin ‘Pomeranchuk effect’ in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favoured over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid8,9. Our results imply that, despite the itinerant nature of the electron wavefunctions, the spin and valley polarization of individual electrons is decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He (ref. 10). Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite-temperature resistance minimum in the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron–phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat-band systems.

 Modern birds have diversified into a striking array of forms, behaviours and ecological roles. Analyses of molecular evolutionary rates can reveal the links between genomic and phenotypic change1–4, but disentangling the drivers of rate variation at the whole-genome scale has been difficult. Using comprehensive estimates of traits and evolutionary rates across a family-level phylogeny of birds5,6, we find that genome-wide mutation rates across lineages are predominantly explained by clutch size and generation length, whereas rate variation across genes is driven by the content of guanine and cytosine. Here, to find the subsets of genes and lineages that dominate evolutionary rate variation in birds, we estimated the influence of individual lineages on decomposed axes of gene-specific evolutionary rates. We find that most of the rate variation occurs along recent branches of the tree, associated with present-day families of birds. Additional tests on axes of rate variation show rapid changes in microchromosomes immediately after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene transition. These apparent pulses of evolution are consistent with major changes in the genetic machineries for meiosis, heart performance, and RNA splicing, surveillance and translation, and correlate with the ecological diversity reflected in increased tarsus length. Collectively, our analyses paint a nuanced picture of avian evolution, revealing that the ancestors of the most diverse lineages of birds underwent major genomic changes related to mutation, gene usage and niche expansion in the early Palaeogene period. Genomic evolutionary rates are decomposed to identify the dominant lineages and genes driving rate variation across the phylogeny of birds."

 Trees are an important carbon sink as they accumulate biomass through photosynthesis1. Identifying tree species that grow fast is therefore commonly considered to be essential for effective climate change mitigation through forest planting. Although species characteristics are key information for plantation design and forest management, field studies often fail to detect clear relationships between species functional traits and tree growth2. Here, by consolidating four independent datasets and classifying the acquisitive and conservative species based on their functional trait values, we show that acquisitive tree species, which are supposedly fast-growing species, generally grow slowly in field conditions. This discrepancy between the current paradigm and field observations is explained by the interactions with environmental conditions that influence growth. Acquisitive species require moist mild climates and fertile soils, conditions that are generally not met in the field. By contrast, conservative species, which are supposedly slow-growing species, show generally higher realized growth due to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions. In general, conservative tree species grow more steadily than acquisitive tree species in non-tropical forests. We recommend planting acquisitive tree species in areas where they can realize their fast-growing potential. In other regions, where environmental stress is higher, conservative tree species have a larger potential to fix carbon in their biomass. Under field conditions, acquisitive tree species generally grow slowly, whereas conservative species show generally higher realized growth, owing to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions."

 The global spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi presents a serious threat to human health, necessitating the discovery of antifungals with unique modes of action1. However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets2. Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.

 Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8+ T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear1,2. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS–STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS–STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8+ T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.

 Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10−3 per base pair per cell division1. As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions2. Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation.

 Entangled photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)1 are central to many quantum applications2–6.

We demonstrate strong narrowband SPDC with an on-chip rate of 0.8 million pairs per second in Si3N4. Si3N4 is the pre-eminent material for photonic integration and also exhibits the lowest waveguide loss (which is essential for integrated quantum circuits). However, being amorphous, silicon nitride lacks an intrinsic χ(2), which limits its role in photonic quantum devices. We enabled SPDC in Si3N4 by combining strong light-field enhancement inside a high optical Q-factor microcavity with an optically induced space-charge field. We present narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness. The quantum nature of the down-converted photon pairs is verified through coincidence measurements.

 Cortical networks for the production of spoken language in humans are organized by phonetic features1,2, such as articulatory parameters3,4 and vocal pitch5,6. Previous research has failed to find an equivalent forebrain representation in other species7–11. To investigate whether this functional organization is unique to humans, here we performed population recordings in the vocal production circuitry of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), a small parrot that can generate flexible vocal output12–15, including mimicked speech sounds16. Using high-density silicon probes17, we measured the song-related activity of a forebrain region, the central nucleus of the anterior arcopallium (AAC), which directly projects to brainstem phonatory motor neurons18–20. We found that AAC neurons form a functional vocal motor map that reflects the spectral properties of ongoing vocalizations. We did not observe this organizing principle in the corresponding forebrain circuitry of the zebra finch, a songbird capable of more limited vocal learning21. We further demonstrated that the AAC represents the production of distinct vocal features (for example, harmonic structure and broadband energy). Furthermore, we discovered an orderly representation of vocal pitch at the population level, with single neurons systematically selective for different frequency values. Taken together, we have uncovered a functional representation in a vertebrate brain that displays unprecedented commonalities with speech-related motor cortices in humans. This work therefore establishes the parrot as an important animal model for investigating speech motor control and for developing therapeutic solutions for addressing a range of communication disorders22,23.

 Rapid learning confers significant advantages on animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues1–4. This slow learning is thought to be supported by gradual changes to cue representation in the sensory cortex2,5. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest6,7, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance)7. Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable once mice achieve ‘expert’ performance. Instead of enhanced cue representations8, two-photon calcium imaging of auditory cortical neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. A reward-prediction signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors early in training, and faded in expert mice. Silencing at the time of this signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting that it serves an associative role. A distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove slower performance improvements. These ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from sensory representations, indicating higher-order functional segregation within auditory cortex. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex. In mice, learning and performance on an auditory task is driven by higher-order signals in the auditory cortex that are no longer required when the mouse has achieved expert-level performance."

 The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nucleocytoplasmic exchange, catalysing a massive flux of protein and nucleic acid material in both directions1. Distinct trafficking pathways for import and export would be an elegant solution to avoid unproductive collisions and opposing movements. However, the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of macromolecules traversing the NPC remains challenging to visualize on the timescale of millisecond-scale transport events. Here we used 3D MINFLUX2 to identify the nuclear pore scaffold and then to simultaneously monitor both nuclear import and nuclear export, thereby establishing that both transport processes occur in overlapping regions of the central pore. Whereas translocation-arrested import complexes bound at the pore periphery, tracks of translocating complexes within the central pore region revealed a preference for an approximately 40- to 50-nm diameter annulus with minimal circumferential movement, indicating activity-dependent confinement within the permeability barrier. Movement within the pore was approximately 1,000-fold slower than in solution and was interspersed with pauses, indicating a highly restricted environment with structural constraints and/or transient binding events during transport. These results demonstrate that high spatiotemporal precision with reduced photobleaching is a major advantage of MINFLUX tracking, and that the NPC permeability barrier is divided into annular rings with distinct functional properties.

 Hexameric helicases are nucleotide-driven molecular machines that unwind DNA to initiate replication across all domains of life. Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved1: the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis2, we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an ‘entropy switch’, removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery.

Our results indicate that oil–water emulsion interfaces can exhibit reduced tetrahedral order and weaker hydrogen bonding, along with a substantial population of free hydroxyl groups that experience about 95 cm−1 redshift in their stretching mode compared with planar oil–water interfaces. Given the known electrostatic zeta potential characteristic of oil droplets9, we propose the existence of a strong electric field (about 50–90 MV cm−1) emanating from the oil phase. This field is inferred indirectly but supported by control experiments and theoretical estimates. These observations are either absent or opposite in the molecular hydrophobic interface formed by small solutes or at planar oil–water interfaces. Instead, water structural disorder and enhanced electric fields emerge as unique features of the mesoscale interface in oil–water emulsions, potentially contributing to the accelerated chemical reactivity observed at hydrophobic–water interfaces10–13. Raman spectroscopy measurements of water at the interface with oil droplets show a perturbed hydrogen-bond network and evidence for a strong interfacial electric field."

 Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (for example, light-emitting diodes)1,2. In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared emission of confined light–matter excitations called phonon polaritons3,4, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) present hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light–matter coupling5,6. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors7,8. However, as HPhPs are locally confined, they are inaccessible in the far field, and as such, any hint of electroluminescence has been based on indirect electronic signatures and has yet to be confirmed by direct observation. Here we demonstrate far-field mid-infrared (wavelength approximately 6.5 μm) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed by far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy owing to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The resulting radiative flux is quantified by mid-infrared pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is also shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process. Far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy reveals both the electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons of hexagonal boron nitride excited by strongly biased graphene, and the associated radiative energy transfer through the material."

 Phonon polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from the coherent coupling of photons with optical phonons in polar dielectrics1. Owing to their exceptional ability to confine electric fields to deep-subwavelength scales with low loss, they are uniquely poised to enable a suite of applications beyond the reach of conventional photonics, such as subdiffraction imaging2 and near-field energy transfer3–5. The conventional approach to exciting phonon polaritons through optical methods, however, involves costly light sources along with near-field schemes6,7, and generally leads to low excitation efficiency owing to substantial momentum mismatch between phonon polaritons and free-space photons. Here we demonstrate that under proper conditions, phonon polaritons can be excited all-electrically by drifting charge carriers. Specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures, by electrically driving charge carriers in ultrahigh-mobility graphene out of equilibrium, we observe bright electroluminescence of hBN’s hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared frequencies, which shows a temperature and carrier density dependence distinct from black-body thermal emission. Moreover, the carrier density dependence of the HPhP electroluminescence spectra reveals that HPhP electroluminescence can arise from both interband transition and intraband Cherenkov radiation8 of charge carriers in graphene. The HPhP electroluminescence offers avenues for realizing electrically pumped mid-infrared and terahertz phonon-polariton light sources.

 Depicting spatial distributions of disease-relevant cells is crucial for understanding disease pathology1,2. Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes. Our study provides a method for spatially resolved mapping of trait-associated cells and demonstrates the gain of biological insights (such as the spatial distribution of trait-relevant cells and related signature genes) through these maps.

 Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a life-threatening malignancy with limited therapeutic options following the failure of second-line treatments1,2. Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity3, offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1–PD-L1-blocking fusion protein4, for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain is mediated by cation-selective AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)1. AMPARs are critical for the learning and memory mechanisms of Hebbian plasticity2 and glutamatergic synapse homeostasis3, with recent work establishing that AMPAR missense mutations can cause autism and intellectual disability4–7. AMPARs have been grouped into two functionally distinct tetrameric assemblies based on the inclusion or exclusion of the GluA2 subunit that determines Ca2+ permeability through RNA editing8,9. GluA2-containing AMPARs are the most abundant in the central nervous system and considered to be Ca2+ impermeable10. Here we show this is not the case. Contrary to conventional understanding, GluA2-containing AMPARs form a continuum of polyamine-insensitive ion channels with varying degrees of Ca2+ permeability. Their ability to transport Ca2+ is shaped by the subunit composition of AMPAR tetramers as well as the spatial orientation of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins and cornichon auxiliary subunits. Ca2+ crosses the ion-conduction pathway by docking to an extracellular binding site that helps funnel divalent ions into the pore selectivity filter. The dynamic range in Ca2+ permeability, however, arises because auxiliary subunits primarily modify the selectivity filter. Taken together, our work proposes a broader role for AMPARs in Ca2+ signalling in the mammalian brain and offers mechanistic insight into the pathogenic nature of missense mutations.

 Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change.

 Lymphatic capillaries continuously take up interstitial fluid and adapt to resulting changes in vessel calibre1–3. The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)4 maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis5,6, LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell–cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.

 From experimental evolution in the laboratory to sustained measurements of natural selection in the wild, long-term studies have revolutionized our understanding of evolution. By directly investigating evolutionary dynamics in real time, these approaches have provided unparallelled insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern. These approaches can reveal oscillations, stochastic fluctuations and systematic trends that unfold over extended periods, expose critical time lags between environmental shifts and population responses, and illuminate how subtle effects may accumulate into significant evolutionary patterns. Long-term studies can also reveal otherwise cryptic trends that unfold over extended periods, and offer the potential for serendipity: observing rare events that spur new evolutionary hypotheses and research directions. Despite the challenges of conducting long-term research, exacerbated by modern funding landscapes favouring short-term projects, the contributions of long-term studies to evolutionary biology are indispensable. This is particularly true in our rapidly changing, human-dominated world, where such studies offer a crucial window into how environmental changes and altered species interactions shape evolutionary trajectories. In this Review article, we showcase the groundbreaking discoveries of long-term evolutionary studies, underscoring their crucial role in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of evolution across multiple systems and timescales.

 Superconducting (SC) states that break space-group symmetries of the underlying crystal can exhibit nontrivial spatial modulation of the order parameter. Previously, such states were intimately associated with the breaking of translational symmetry1,2, resulting in the density-wave orders3–8, with wavelengths spanning several unit cells9–19. However, a related basic concept has long been overlooked20: when only intra-unit-cell symmetries of the space group are broken, the SC states can show a distinct type of nontrivial modulation preserving long-range lattice translation. Here we refer to this new concept as the pair density modulation (PDM) and report the first observation of a PDM state in exfoliated thin flakes of the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we discover robust SC gap modulation with the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity and the amplitude exceeding 30% of the gap average. Notably, we find that the observed modulation originates from the large difference in SC gaps on the two nominally equivalent iron sublattices. The experimental findings, backed up by model calculations, suggest that, in contrast to the density-wave orders, the PDM state is driven by the interplay of sublattice symmetry breaking and a peculiar nematic distortion specific to the thin flakes. Our results establish new frontiers for exploring the intertwined orders in strong-correlated electronic systems and open a new chapter for iron-based superconductors.

 The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform us about the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, providing insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development1. Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections2 from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic ‘driver’ mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, CTNNB1 and KDM6A. The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.

 Fibrosis, the replacement of healthy tissue with collagen-rich matrix, can occur following injury in almost every organ1,2. Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury3, and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched ‘ECM-secreting’ (Csmd1-expressing) and ‘pro-resolving’ (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial–transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cells and matrix along the fibrotic trajectory in mouse lung identified PI16 as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential for therapeutic application in humans."

 Voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels contain cytoplasmically exposed β-subunits1–5 whose aldo-keto reductase activity6–8 is required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep9. Here we show that Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the KV1 channel Shaker in Drosophila7, forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls10–13, such as 4-oxo-2-nonenal or an endogenous analogue generated by illuminating a membrane-bound photosensitizer9,14, abstract an electron pair. NADP+ remains locked in the active site of KVβ until membrane depolarization permits its release and replacement with NADPH. Sleep-inducing neurons15–17 use this voltage-gated oxidoreductase cycle to encode their recent lipid peroxidation history in the collective binary states of their KVβ subunits; this biochemical memory influences—and is erased by—spike discharges driving sleep. The presence of a lipid peroxidation sensor at the core of homeostatic sleep control16,17 suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep.

Victora,Transient silencing of hypermutation preserves B cell affinity during clonal bursting,"B cell germinal centres achieve a balance between clonal expansion and sequence diversification by suppressing somatic hypermutation during proliferative clonal bursts. 
 In the course of antibody affinity maturation, germinal centre (GC) B cells mutate their immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in a process known as somatic hypermutation (SHM)1–4. Panels of mutant B cells with different binding affinities for antigens are then selected in a Darwinian manner, which leads to a progressive increase in affinity among the population5. As with any Darwinian process, rare gain-of-fitness mutations must be identified and common loss-of-fitness mutations avoided6. Progressive acquisition of mutations therefore poses a risk during large proliferative bursts7, when GC B cells undergo several cell cycles in the absence of affinity-based selection8–13. Using a combination of in vivo mouse experiments and mathematical modelling, here we show that GCs achieve this balance by strongly suppressing SHM during clonal-burst-type expansion, so that a large fraction of the progeny generated by these bursts does not deviate from their ancestral genotype. Intravital imaging and image-based cell sorting of a mouse strain carrying a reporter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity showed that B cells that are actively undergoing proliferative bursts lack the transient CDK2low ‘G0-like’ phase of the cell cycle in which SHM takes place. We propose a model in which inertially cycling B cells mostly delay SHM until the G0-like phase that follows their final round of division in the GC dark zone, thus maintaining affinity as they clonally expand in the absence of selection. B cell germinal centres achieve a balance between clonal expansion and sequence diversification by suppressing somatic hypermutation during proliferative clonal bursts."

 A quantum network1–3 provides an infrastructure that connects quantum devices with revolutionary computing, sensing and communication capabilities. A quantum satellite constellation offers a solution to facilitate the quantum network on a global scale4,5. The Micius satellite has verified the feasibility of satellite quantum communications6–9; however, scaling up quantum satellite constellations is challenging, requiring small lightweight satellites, portable ground stations and real-time secure key exchange. Here we tackle these challenges and report the development of a quantum microsatellite capable of performing space-to-ground quantum key distribution using portable ground stations. The microsatellite payload weighs approximately 23 kilograms, and the portable ground station weighs about 100 kilograms, representing reductions by more than 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Using this set-up, we demonstrate satellite-based quantum key distribution with multiple ground stations and achieve the sharing of up to 1.07 million bits of secure keys during a single satellite pass. In addition, we multiplex bidirectional satellite–ground optical communication with quantum communication, enabling key distillation and secure communication in real time. Also, a secret key, enabling one-time pad encryption of images, is created between China and South Africa at locations separated by over 12,900 kilometres on Earth. The compact quantum payload can be readily assembled on existing space stations10,11 or small satellites12, paving the way for a satellite-constellation-based quantum and classical network for widespread real-life applications.

 Defence from environmental threats is provided by physical barriers that confer mechanical protection and prevent the entry of microorganisms1. If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells2,3. Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build ‘rings’ of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world. A population of neutrophils in the skin produces extracellular matrix, providing a defence strategy by reinforcing the barrier properties of the skin and helping to block the entry of pathogens."

 Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driven by systems orchestrating multiple large language models (LLMs) and other specialized tools, such as search engines and simulators. So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems.

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators involved in multiple biological processes. To achieve their gene repression function, they are loaded in miRNA-specific Argonautes to form the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Mammals and C. elegans possess more than one paralog of miRNA-specific Argonautes, but the dynamic between them remains unclear. Here, we report the conserved dipeptidyl peptidase DPF-3 as an interactor of the miRNA-specific Argonaute ALG-1 in C. elegans. Knockout of dpf-3 increases ALG-2 levels and miRISC formation in alg-1 loss-of-function animals, thereby compensating for ALG-1 loss and rescuing miRNA-related defects observed. DPF-3 can cleave an ALG-2 N-terminal peptide in vitro but does not appear to rely on this catalytic activity to regulate ALG-2 in vivo. This study uncovers the importance of DPF-3 in the miRNA pathway and provides insights into how multiple miRNA Argonautes contribute to achieving proper miRNA-mediated gene regulation in animals.

 Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is crucial for enzyme exploration and modification. Existing models face the problem of either low accuracy or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. In this work, we first developed unbiased datasets to evaluate the actual performance of these methods and proposed a deep learning model, CataPro, based on pre-trained models and molecular fingerprints to predict turnover number (kcat), Michaelis constant (Km), and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Compared with previous baseline models, CataPro demonstrates clearly enhanced accuracy and generalization ability on the unbiased datasets. In a representational enzyme mining project, by combining CataPro with traditional methods, we identified an enzyme (SsCSO) with 19.53 times increased activity compared to the initial enzyme (CSO2) and then successfully engineered it to improve its activity by 3.34 times. This reveals the high potential of CataPro as an effective tool for future enzyme discovery and modification. Enzyme kinetic parameter prediction is a challenge in enzyme discovery and engineering. Here, the authors train a robust deep learning model CataPro to predict enzyme kinetic parameters and validate its practicality through wet-lab experiments."

 Tools available for inferring enzyme function from general sequence, fold, or evolutionary information are generally successful. However, they can lead to misclassification if a deviation in local structural features influences the function. Here, we present TopEC, a 3D graph neural network based on a localized 3D descriptor to learn chemical reactions of enzymes from enzyme structures and predict Enzyme Commission (EC) classes. Using message-passing frameworks, we include distance and angle information to significantly improve the predictive performance for EC classification (F-score: 0.72) compared to regular 2D graph neural networks. We trained networks without fold bias that can classify enzyme structures for a vast functional space (>800 ECs). Our model is robust to uncertainties in binding site locations and similar functions in distinct binding sites. We observe that TopEC networks learn from an interplay between biochemical features and local shape-dependent features. TopEC is available as a repository on GitHub:

 Tetracoordinate boron-based fluorescent materials have shown extensively applications in chemistry, biology and materials science owing to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, constructing chiral boron-stereogenic fluorophores through practical and universal strategies remains rare and challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, we report an enantioselective postfunctionalization of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), to acess boron-stereogenic BODIPYs in moderate to good yields with commendable enantioselectivity.

In this·work, we present a phase-transfer-catalyst enabled enantioselective C–N coupling reaction of BODIPYs with diverse nucleophiles.

 The interaction between photons and phonons plays a crucial role in broad areas ranging from optical sources and modulators to quantum transduction and metrology. The performance can be further improved using integrated photonic-phononic devices, promising enhanced interaction strength and large-scale integration. While the enhanced interaction has been widely demonstrated, it is challenging to realize large-scale integrated photonic-phononic circuits due to material limitations.

 The northeast (NE) Pacific has experienced significant marine heatwaves (MHWs) in recent years, commonly known as “warm blobs.” This study examines the impact of Arctic warming, particularly in the Eastern Siberian-Chukchi Sea (ES-CS) region, on the occurrence of these warm blobs during boreal winters. We found that Arctic warming triggers a positive phase of the Tropical/Northern Hemisphere-like (TNH-like) atmospheric circulation, creating a pronounced high-pressure system over the Alaskan region. This system leads to easterly wind anomalies that weaken prevailing westerlies, reducing heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere and cold advection in the upper ocean. Consequently, sea surface temperatures rise, favoring the development of warm blobs. A numerical experiment confirmed that the projected changes in the ES-CS region impact warm blobs occurrences by inducing this high-pressure system, linking Arctic warming to MHWs in the NE Pacific."

 Current frameworks for evaluating biogeochemical climate change feedbacks in Earth System Models lack an explicit consideration of nitrogen cycling in the land and ocean spheres despite its vital role in limiting primary productivity. As coupled carbon-nitrogen cycling becomes the norm, a better understanding of the role of nitrogen cycling is needed. Here we develop a new framework for quantifying carbon-nitrogen feedbacks in Earth System Models and show that rising nitrogen deposition acts as a negative feedback over both land and ocean, enhancing carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation in a model ensemble. However, increased CO2 uptake due to rising nitrogen deposition is small relative to the large reduction in CO2 uptake when coupled carbon-nitrogen cycling is implemented in Earth System Models. Altogether, rising nitrogen deposition leads to only a minor increase in CO2 uptake but also enhances nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions over land and ocean, contributing only marginally to mitigating climate change.

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for climate studies and land surface process models as it indicates ground surface temperature variations across landscapes and timescales. However, satellite-based LST products derived from infrared sensors suffer from substantial missing values due to extensive cloud covers on the Earth’s surface. Traditional methods rely heavily on numerical LST simulations for gap-filling, but the latency significantly limits the timeliness of gapless LST products. In this study, a novel deep learning method called the Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) was proposed, which was based on a U-Net architecture but enhanced with two unique feature extraction modules for capturing spatially and temporally dependent LST variations. Unlike many previous methods depending highly on numerical simulations, STAN reconstructs LST relying on spatiotemporal context information learned from historical memories, enabling more efficient LST reconstruction in a more timely manner. Ground validation results demonstrate better performance of STAN over other companion methods, with root-mean-square errors of 1.99 K and 2.89 K under clear and cloudy sky respectively, when reconstructing LST data collected from the Chinese Fengyun-4A geostationary satellite in the Yangtze River Delta. Intercomparison studies and error analysis also confirm the superiority of STAN, showing high LST reconstruction accuracy across different land covers and seasons. Overall, the proposed STAN method offers a much more efficient solution to facilitate timely LST reconstruction, and the method can also be easily transferred to other parameters with significant spatio-temporal variation context."

 Scholars have documented that perceived safety of the visual built environment (VBE) can influence human behaviors. The dual developments of street view imagery (SVI) and deep learning techniques offer a cost-effective approach to measure perceived safety. However, current SVI-based perception models often lack specific definitions of perceived safety and demographic information when collecting data for model training. Furthermore, these models are rarely validated by onsite perception evaluations, which undermines their credibility.Given these gaps, this study builds a localized crowdsourcing survey to train crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety of the VBE captured by SVIs, and compares model-predicted perceptions with onsite perceptions. This study specifically focuses on their ability to represent onsite perceptions and examines gender differences as a test case in safety perception. This study recruits over 1,800 participants living in the Greater Toronto Area to rate SVIs in terms of crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety.Pearson correlation coefficients reveal a positive but weak correlation between female and male safety perceptions, indicating some consistency while highlighting potential gender differences in safety perceptions. Machine-learning perception models are then trained using this localized SVI survey. Model-predicted perceptions are further validated to assess their alignments with onsite perceptions at sampling locations. The results show that model-predicted perceptions do not exactly match onsite perceptions but align better when less stringent criteria are applied (within ± 1 scale point).In short, this study underscores the necessity of gender inclusivity and a clear definition of safety terms when using SVIs to model perceptions. While SVI-based perception models are cost-effective, the predicted perceptions cannot yet fully substitute onsite perceptions, necessitating broader research to refine the effectiveness."

 Understanding frontal clouds and precipitation is crucial due to its increasing variability and intensity driven by global warming, which impacts agriculture, water resource management, and climate adaptation. Autumn precipitation in Central China is frequently induced by extratropical cyclones, often featuring a frontal cloud system influenced by warm conveyor belt (WCB). In this paper, the detailed microphysical processes of an autumn precipitation event were examined using reconstructed vertical profiles of polarimetric variables, supplemented with numerical simulation to better depict the microphysics evolution in different stages. Results showed that during the initial stage, a strong, inclined updraft and supersaturated layer influenced by WCB, enhanced the formation and depositional growth of ice particles above −10 °C level, then ice particles grew by riming in addition to aggregation in −5–0 °C layer while precipitation particles coalescence and collecting cloud droplets occurred in warm cloud. As the vertical extent of supersaturated layer increased, the intensified process of collecting cloud droplets and vigorous riming process contributed to the maximum surface rainfall intensity. In the weakening stage, ice-phase processes attenuated before the warm cloud processes showed reducing tendencies. This decline is attributed to weakened inclined updraft and supersaturated layer falling below 0 °C level, which impaired the conditions necessary for ice-phase processes. It is concluded that the thermodynamic structure of WCB, namely the vertical extension of inclined updraft and the presence of supersaturated layer, significantly influenced both the ice-phase and liquid-phase microphysical processes of the frontal cloud system as well as the surface precipitation."

 Severe air pollution in urban areas poses a significant threat to residents' health and has raised considerable concerns. The influence of topography on air pollution, particularly in mountainous regions, is substantial. The Sichuan Basin (SCB), known as one of China's most polluted areas, exhibits complex topography that interacts synergistically with weather conditions and anthropogenic emissions to affect air pollution levels. Previous studies have primarily focused on the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on the SCB, while paying less attention to the role of complex terrain within the basin. In this study, an episode was investigated to figure out factors contributing to pollution deterioration prior to dissipation at Hechuan, a city located on the leeward side of parallel ridge-valleys in eastern SCB. Our findings indicate that enhanced vertical advection and suppressed vertical diffusion played dominant roles in pollutant accumulation rather than horizontal transport during the studied episode, which was primarily influenced by the combined effects of airflow crossing parallel valley-ridges and topography. When crossing airflow was weak, cold air concentrated near ground level leading to temperature inversion and weak downdrafts. As the crossing airflow intensified, gravity waves made an array of waves that facilitated downward transport of pollutants. As the crossing airflow further intensified, strong horizontal wind and updraft formed under cyclonic circulation facilitated pollutant dispersion. Considering the synergistic effects of synoptic circulation and topography on vertical dispersion ability at leeside valley-ridges, additional emission control measures are necessary to prevent further deterioration of air pollution prior to dissipation."

 As an important absorptive component of aerosols in the atmosphere, black carbon (BC) plays a key role in climatic processes. Continuous BC measurements in the atmosphere of Nanjing, China, were performed from 2015 to 2022. By combining data from PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3 and meteorological variables, the temporal variations in BC during different pollution events were determined in this study. The annual mean BC concentration increased from 2015 to 2018 (0.80 ± 0.05 μg/(m3 a)) and decreased from 2019 to 2022 (0.30 ± 0.001 μg/(m3 a)). The daily variations in BC concentrations during different processes (haze, dust, ozone, fireworks and fog) in Nanjing showed different characteristics. The BC concentration increased the most during haze events (50 %–100 %), while it changed little during fog events, so BC can be used to distinguish between these two processes. During O3 pollution events, the BC concentration increased by 6 %–44 %. During dust pollution events, BC concentration decreased owing to the high wind speed. Besides, BC wasn't a major pollutant originating from Nanjing fireworks. During haze and O3 pollution events, BC concentrations tended to increase (0.45 μg/m3–1.51 μg/m3) as the pollution levels increase. It's worth noting that BC concentrations were higher in autumn (4.85 μg/m3) than other seasons during moderate haze events because of enhanced long-range BC transport.

 The Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) is a crucial feature of the stratospheric system in winter. The variation in the strength of the Antarctic SPV significantly impacts the weather and climate of the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Although previous studies have provided a good understanding of the variations in the strength of the Antarctic SPV and its associated physical mechanisms, the trend of the Antarctic SPV after 2000 has not received sufficient attention. Here, based on observations and reanalysis data, we find that the middle SPV has a strengthening trend in austral winter during 2000–2022. Our findings indicate that warming SST alter atmospheric convection and planetary wave activity, reducing wavenumber-1 planetary waves into the stratosphere and thereby strengthening the polar vortex. Using idealized sea surface temperature (SST) patch experiments with a climate model, we quantified the specific contributions of SST warming in various regions. Among these, the tropical Atlantic, North Indian Ocean, West Pacific warm pool, and East Pacific contributed 106.86 %, −52.67 %, −40.72 %, and 36.94 %, respectively, to the cooling of the polar vortex from 2000 to 2022. On decadal timescales, the variability of tropical SST patterns, particularly in the Atlantic and Pacific basins, has been critical in shaping the observed trends and fluctuations in the Antarctic SPV during recent decades."

Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels. This discovery advances our understanding of neuronal excitability control and nicotine addiction."

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicatingDrosophilasalivary gland andBombyxsilk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr.

Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales.

After use in affinity selection, treatment with dithiothreitol enables near-quantitative reduction, rendering linear peptide analogs for standard tandem mass spectrometry. We use these libraries to discover macrocyclic binders to cadherin-2 and anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone 12ca5.

Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids.

Here, we investigate the impact ofN4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), a highly conserved tRNA modification catalyzed by the essential acetyltransferase Nat10. By targeting Thumpd1, a nonessential adapter protein required for Nat10-catalyzed tRNA acetylation, we determine that loss of tRNA acetylation leads to reduced levels of tRNALeu, increased ribosome stalling, and activation of eIF2α phosphorylation. Thumpd1 knockout mice exhibit growth defects and sterility. Concurrent knockout of Thumpd1 and the stress-sensing kinase Gcn2 causes penetrant postnatal lethality in mice, indicating a critical genetic interaction.

By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection.

It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide."

However, the mechanism by which assembly occurs remains poorly understood, and few intermediate states are available to illuminate the expansion of meta-stable procapsids into robust mature capsids. Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP."

This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science."

By concurrently increasing cross-link sites and dynamic bond contents, this approach fabricates polymer networks with high cross-link density yet low processing temperature, challenging the conventional structure-property relationship where cross-linking inherently limits plasticity. Notably, the material demonstrates remarkable processability, evidenced by the ratio ofG′maxtoG′minwith a temperature differential (ΔT) of 120°C (which signifies the soft-to-hard transition capability).

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not targetDrosophilaSpd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but theDrosophilaSP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo."

Here, we identified a kidney disease gene called pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) through integrating GWAS on kidney function and multiomic analysis. PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD+levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD+and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction.

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials."

Here, we show that changes in RNA metabolism following depletion of TIP60/KAT5, the acetyltransferase subunit of the NuA4 transcriptional coactivator complex, reveal that transcript buffering occurs at a gene-specific level. By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering.
