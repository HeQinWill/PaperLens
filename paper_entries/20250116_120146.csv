10.5194/acp-25-473-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了飞机尾迹卷云对全球变暖的影响，这是航空业对气候变化最大但也是最不确定的贡献。研究者首次评估了不同气候模式对尾迹卷云特性的影响，发现不同模式中尾迹卷云的形成、持续时间和辐射效应存在显著差异。这主要是因为气候模式中云光学特性和微物理过程的模拟差异导致的。论文比较了两种不同气候模式（Community Atmosphere Model 和 UK Met Office Unified Model）中尾迹卷云的有效辐射强迫，发现其结果差异很大，这突显了目前对尾迹卷云辐射强迫估计的不确定性。改进气候模式中微物理和辐射过程的模拟，以及利用观测数据更好地约束模型，是未来研究的重点。虽然论文没有直接提及具体的遥感技术，例如哪种卫星传感器，但其研究结果直接关系到利用卫星观测数据来改进气候模式对云和气溶胶的模拟，从而更准确地评估航空业对气候变化的影响。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Contrail cirrus', 'Cloud optical properties', 'Cloud microphysics', 'Radiative forcing', 'Effective radiative forcing (ERF)', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate models', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Aerosols']",Weiyu Zhang;Kwinten Van Weverberg;Cyril J.

Marsh;Alexandru Rap,Impact of host climate model on contrail cirrus effective radiative forcing estimates,"Contrail cirrus is the largest, but also most uncertain, contribution of aviation to global warming. We evaluate, for the first time, the impact of the host climate model on contrail cirrus properties. Substantial differences exist between contrail cirrus formation, persistence, and radiative effects in the host climate models. Reliable contrail cirrus simulations require advanced representation of cloud optical properties and microphysics, which should be better constrained by observations. 
 Estimates of aviation effective radiative forcing (ERF) indicate that contrail cirrus is currently its largest contributor, although with a substantial associated uncertainty of ∼ 70 %. Here, we implement the contrail parameterisation developed for the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) in the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM), allowing us to compare, for the first time, the impact of key features of the host climate model on contrail cirrus ERF. We find that differences in background humidity between the models result in the UM-simulated contrail fractions being 2 to 3 times larger than in CAM. Additionally, the models show contrasting responses in overall global cloud fraction, with contrails increasing the total cloud fraction in the UM and decreasing it in CAM. Differences in the complexity of the cloud microphysics schemes lead to significant differences in simulated changes to cloud ice water content due to aviation. After compensating for the unrealistically low contrail optical depth in the UM, we estimate the 2018 contrail cirrus ERF to be 40.8 mW m−2 in the UM, compared to 60.1 mW m−2 in CAM. These values highlight the substantial uncertainty in contrail cirrus ERF due to differences in microphysics and radiation schemes between the two models. We also find a factor-of-8 uncertainty in contrail cirrus ERF due to existing uncertainty in contrail cirrus optical depth. Future research should focus on better representing microphysical and radiative contrail characteristics in climate models and on improved observational constraints."
10.5194/acp-25-491-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这项研究利用15年地球静止卫星观测到的纳米布沙漠低云和雾（FLC）消散时间数据，结合再分析数据和机器学习方法，调查了生物质燃烧气溶胶（BBAs）对纳米布沙漠低云和雾消散的半直接影响。研究发现，高气溶胶负荷日，FLC消散时间显著延迟。BBAs通过大型反气旋环流模式，沿湿润对流层自由大气输送到纳米布沙漠。地表长波加热增强了大陆热低压，改变了沿海地区的环流和边界层湿度，增加了BBAs影响的归因难度。统计学习框架被用来量化气象和BBAs对FLC消散时间的影响。模型能够重现高、低BBAs日FLC消散时间的差异，并将这些差异主要归因于沿海地区环流、边界层湿度和近地表气温的差异。然而，模型存在欠拟合问题，无法重现大部分FLC消散变化。研究结果强调了利用观测数据区分气象和气溶胶对云发展影响的挑战，并呼吁对潜在过程进行详细的建模分析，例如使用大涡模拟。总而言之，该研究利用卫星遥感技术观测大气成分（气溶胶）的变化，分析其对纳米布沙漠地区雾和低云的影响，属于大气环境遥感技术的范畴。,"['aerosol', 'biomass burning', 'fog', 'low cloud', 'satellite observation', 'geostationary satellite', 'remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'Namibia', 'FLC dissipation', 'radiation interaction']",Alexandre Mass;Hendrik Andersen;Jan Cermak;Paola Formenti;Eva Pauli;Julian Quinting,A satellite-based analysis of semi-direct effects of biomass burning aerosols on fog and low-cloud dissipation in the Namib Desert,"This study investigates the interaction between smoke aerosols and fog and low clouds (FLCs) in the Namib Desert between June and October. Here, a satellite-based dataset of FLCs, reanalysis data and machine learning are used to systematically analyze FLC persistence under different aerosol loadings. Aerosol plumes are shown to modify local thermodynamics, which increase FLC persistence. But fully disentangling aerosol effects from meteorological ones remains a challenge. 
 In the Namib Desert, fog is the only regular water input and, thus, is a crucial water source for its fauna and flora. Each year, between June and October, absorbing biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) overlie the stratocumulus clouds in the adjacent Southeast Atlantic. In some synoptic settings, this layer of BBAs reaches Namibia and its desert, where it interacts with coastal fog and low clouds (FLCs). In this study, a novel 15-year data set of geostationary satellite observations of FLC dissipation time in the Namib Desert is used, along with reanalysis data, to better understand the potential semi-direct effects of BBAs on FLC dissipation in the Namib Desert, i.e., through adjustments of atmospheric stability and thermodynamics via the interaction of aerosols with radiation. This is done by investigating both the time of day when FLCs dissolve and the synoptic-scale meteorology depending on BBA loading. It is found that FLC dissipation time is significantly later on high-BBA-loading days. BBAs are transported to the Namib along moist free-tropospheric air by a large-scale anticyclonic recirculation pattern. At the surface, the associated longwave heating strengthens a continental heat low, which modifies the circulation and boundary layer moisture along the coastline, complicating the attribution of BBA effects. During high-BBA days, the vertical profiles of the temporal development of air temperatures highlight contrasting daytime and nighttime processes modifying the local inversion. These processes are thought to be driven by greenhouse warming as a result of the moisture in the BBA plumes and BBA absorption (only during the daytime). A statistical learning framework is used to quantify meteorological and BBA influences on FLC dissipation time. The statistical model is able to reproduce the observed differences in FLC dissipation time between high- and low-BBA days and attributes these differences mainly to differences in circulation, boundary layer moisture and near-surface air temperature along the coastline. However, the model is prone to underfitting and is not able to reproduce the majority of the FLC dissipation variability. While the model does not suggest that BBA patterns are important for FLC dissipation, the findings show how the moist BBA plumes modify local thermodynamics, to which FLC dissipation is shown to be sensitive. The findings highlight the challenges of disentangling meteorological and aerosol effects on cloud development using observations and invite detailed modeling analyses of the underlying processes, for example, with large-eddy simulations."
10.5194/acp-25-459-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了加拿大南部地区有机磷酸酯（OPEs）在大气中的季节性浓度变化、气粒分配、降水清除和空气-水平衡。研究使用了地面观测数据，包括大气气相和颗粒相、降水和地表水中的OPEs浓度。结果显示夏季OPEs浓度较高，降水清除效率高，但化合物挥发性和气粒分配之间缺乏关系。空气-地表交换的表观焓值与空气-水和空气-辛醇交换焓值大致相当，表明局部空气-地表交换过程和/或季节性变化的源强度的影响。许多OPEs在气相和颗粒相中均有相当大的比例，但与化合物挥发性之间没有明显的联系。研究还计算了空气-水平衡，提示气态OPEs从大气到水体的净沉降。总的来说，该研究主要关注OPEs在大气环境中的行为和迁移转化过程，缺乏对遥感技术应用的讨论，例如卫星观测或大气成分分析等。,"['organophosphate esters', 'air quality', 'gas-particle partitioning', 'precipitation scavenging', 'air-water equilibrium']",Yuening Li;Faqiang Zhan;Chubashini Shunthirasingham;Ying Duan Lei;Jenny Oh;Amina Ben Chaaben;Zhe Lu;Kelsey Lee;Frank A. P. C. Gobas;Hayley Hung;Frank Wania,"Seasonal air concentration variability, gas–particle partitioning, precipitation scavenging, and air–water equilibrium of organophosphate esters in southern Canada","Organophosphate esters are important humanmade trace contaminants. Measuring them in the atmospheric gas phase, particles, precipitation, and surface water in Canada, we explore seasonal concentration variability, gas–particle partitioning, precipitation scavenging, and the air–water equilibrium. Whereas higher summer concentrations and efficient precipitation scavenging conform with expectations, the lack of a relationship between compound volatility and gas–particle partitioning is puzzling. 
 In response to increasing production and application volumes, organophosphate esters (OPEs) have emerged as pervasively detected contaminants in various environmental media, with concentrations often exceeding those of traditional organic contaminants. Despite the recognition of the atmosphere's important role in dispersing OPEs and a substantial number of studies quantifying OPEs in air, investigations into atmospheric phase distribution processes are rare. Using measurements of OPEs in the atmospheric gas and particle phase, in precipitation, and in surface water collected in southern Canada, we explored the seasonal concentration variability, gas–particle partitioning behaviour, precipitation scavenging, and air–water equilibrium status of OPEs. Whereas consistent seasonal trends were not observed for OPE concentrations in precipitation or atmospheric particles, gas phase concentrations of several OPEs were elevated during the summer in suburban Toronto and at two remote sites on Canada's eastern and western coast. Apparent enthalpies of air–surface exchange fell mainly within or slightly above the range of air–water and air–octanol enthalpies of exchange, indicating the influence of local air–surface exchange processes and/or seasonally variable source strength. While many OPEs were present with a notable fraction in both the gas and particle phase, no clear relationship with compound volatility was apparent, although there was a tendency for higher particle-bound fractions at a lower temperature. High precipitation scavenging ratios for OPEs measured at the two coastal sites are consistent with low air–water partitioning ratios and the association with particles. Although beset by large uncertainties, air–water equilibrium calculations suggest net deposition of gaseous OPEs from the atmosphere to the Salish Sea and the St. Lawrence River and St. Lawrence Estuary. The measured seasonal concentration variability is likely less a reflection of temperature-driven air–surface exchange and instead indicates that more OPEs enter or are formed in the atmosphere in summer. More research is needed to better understand the atmospheric gas–particle partitioning behaviour of the OPEs and how it may be influenced by transformation reactions."
10.5194/amt-18-211-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究的是利用卫星数据反演局部二氧化碳排放量的方法。研究使用了来自即将发射的哥白尼二氧化碳监测任务的模拟卫星图像数据（包含XCO2和NO2），评估了五种不同的数据驱动反演方法，包括横截面通量法、积分质量增强法、散度法和高斯羽流模型法等。通过模拟一年卫星图像数据，涵盖了德国15个发电厂和柏林市，对这些方法的精度和效率进行了比较。研究结果表明，高斯羽流模型法和改进的横截面通量法在单幅图像排放量估算方面表现最佳，并且在考虑云层覆盖等因素后，通过滤波处理可以提高其他方法的精度。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是利用卫星观测数据进行大气成分分析和空气质量监测，为利用未来卫星数据估算局部二氧化碳排放提供了重要的技术支撑。,"['CO2', 'NO2', 'XCO2', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Emission inversion', 'Copernicus CO2 Monitoring Mission']",Diego Santaren;Janne Hakkarainen;Gerrit Kuhlmann;Erik Koene;Frédéric Chevallier;Iolanda Ialongo;Hannakaisa Lindqvist;Janne Nurmela;Johanna Tamminen;Laia Amorós;Dominik Brunner;Grégoire Broquet,Benchmarking data-driven inversion methods for the estimation of local CO2 emissions from synthetic satellite images of XCO2 and NO2,"This study evaluates data-driven inversion methods for estimating CO2 emissions from local sources, such as power plants and cities, using meteorological data and XCO2 and NO2 satellite images rather than atmospheric transport modeling. We assess and compare the performance of five different methods using simulations of 1 year of satellite images, taken from the upcoming Copernicus CO2 Monitoring Mission, covering 15 power plants and the city of Berlin, Germany. 
 The largest anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) come from local sources, such as cities and power plants. The upcoming Copernicus CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) mission will provide satellite images of the CO2 and NO2 plumes associated with these sources at a resolution of 2 km × 2 km and with a swath of 250 km. These images could be exploited using atmospheric-plume inversion methods to estimate local CO2 emissions at the time of the satellite overpass and their corresponding uncertainties. To support the development of the operational processing of satellite imagery of the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) and tropospheric-column NO2, this study evaluates data-driven inversion methods, i.e., computationally light inversion methods that directly process information from satellite images, local winds, and meteorological data, without resorting to computationally expensive dynamical atmospheric transport models. We designed an objective benchmarking exercise to analyze and compare the performance of five different data-driven inversion methods: two implementations with different complexities for the cross-sectional flux approach (CSF and LCSF), as well as one implementation each for the integrated mass enhancement (IME), divergence (Div), and Gaussian plume (GP) model inversion approaches. This exercise is based on pseudo-data experiments with simulations of synthetic true emissions, meteorological and concentration fields, and CO2M observations across a domain of 750 km × 650 km, centered on eastern Germany, over 1 year. The performance of the methods is quantified in terms of the accuracy of single-image emission estimates (from individual images) or annual-average emission estimates (from the full series of images), as well as in terms of the number of instant estimates for the city of Berlin and 15 power plants within this domain. Several ensembles of estimations are conducted using different scenarios for the available synthetic datasets. These ensembles are used to analyze the sensitivity of performance to (1) data loss due to cloud cover, (2) uncertainty in the wind, or (3) the added value of simultaneous NO2 images. The GP and LCSF methods generate the most accurate estimates from individual images. The deviations between the emission estimates and the true emissions from these two methods have similar interquartile ranges (IQRs), ranging from ∼ 20 % to ∼ 60 % depending on the scenario. When taking cloud cover into account, these methods produce 274 and 318 instant estimates, respectively, from the ∼ 500 daily images, which cover significant portions of the plumes from the sources. Filtering the results based on the associated uncertainty estimates can improve the statistics of the IME and CSF methods but does so at the cost of a large decrease in the number of estimates. Due to a reliable estimation of uncertainty and, thus, a suitable selection of estimates, the CSF method achieves similar, if not better, accuracy statistics for instant estimates compared to the GP and LCSF methods after filtering. In general, the performance of retrieving single-image estimates improves when, in addition to XCO2 data, collocated NO2 data are used to characterize the structure of plumes. With respect to the estimates of annual emissions, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the most realistic benchmarking scenario are 20 % (GP), 27 % (CSF), 31 % (LCSF), 55 % (IME), and 79 % (Div). This study suggests that the Gaussian plume and/or cross-sectional approaches are currently the most efficient tools for providing estimates of CO2 emissions from satellite images, and their relatively light computational cost will enable the analysis of the massive amount of data to be provided by future satellite XCO2 imagery missions."

Burrows;Hartmut Bösch;Ruediger Lang,Retrieving the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane from the European Copernicus CO2M satellite mission using artificial neural networks,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the main anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The European Copernicus CO2 monitoring satellite mission CO2M will provide measurements of their atmospheric concentrations, but the accuracy requirements are demanding and conventional retrieval methods computationally expensive. We present a new retrieval algorithm based on artificial neural networks that has the potential to meet the stringent requirements of the CO2M mission with minimal computational effort. 
 Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases and the main drivers of climate change. Monitoring their concentrations from space helps detect and quantify anthropogenic emissions, supporting the mitigation efforts urgently needed to meet the primary objective of the Paris Agreement, adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015, to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. In addition, satellite observations can be used to quantify natural sources and sinks, improving our understanding of the carbon cycle. Advancing these goals is one key motivation for the European Copernicus CO2 monitoring mission CO2M. The necessary accuracy and precision requirements for the measured quantities XCO2 and XCH4 (the column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4) are demanding. According to the CO2M mission requirements, the spatial and temporal variability of the systematic errors (or spatio-temporal systematic errors) of XCO2 and XCH4 must not exceed 0.5 ppm and 5 ppb, respectively. The stochastic errors due to instrument noise must not exceed 0.7 ppm for XCO2 and 10 ppb for XCH4. Conventional so-called full-physics algorithms for retrieving XCO2 and/or XCH4 from satellite-based measurements of reflected solar radiation are typically computationally intensive and still usually require empirical bias corrections based on supervised machine learning methods. Here we present the retrieval algorithm Neural networks for Remote sensing of Greenhouse gases from CO2M (NRG-CO2M), which derives XCO2 and XCH4 from CO2M radiance measurements with minimal computational effort using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In addition, NRG-CO2M also provides estimates of both the noise-driven uncertainties and the averaging kernels of XCO2 and XCH4 for each sounding. Since CO2M will not be launched until 2026, our study exploits simulated measurements over land surfaces from a comprehensive observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) that includes realistic meteorology, aerosols,  surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and CO2 and CH4 concentrations. We created a novel hybrid learning approach that combines advantages of simulation-based and measurement-based training data to ensure coverage of a wide range of XCO2 and XCH4 values, making the training data representative of future concentrations as well. The algorithm's postprocessing is designed to achieve a high data yield of about 80 % of all cloud-free soundings. The spatio-temporal systematic errors of XCO2 and XCH4 are 0.44 ppm and 2.45 ppb, respectively. The average single sounding precision is 0.41 ppm for XCO2 and 2.74 ppb for XCH4. Therefore, the presented retrieval method has the potential to meet the demanding CO2M mission requirements for XCO2 and XCH4. While the presented results are a solid proof of concept, the actual achievable quality can only be determined once NRG-CO2M is trained on real data, where it is confronted, e.g., with unknown instrument effects and systematic errors in the training truth."

Lewis;Coty N. Jen,Fast and sensitive measurements of sub-3 nm particles using Condensation Particle Counters For Atmospheric Rapid Measurements (CPC FARM),"This study describes a new method, the Condensation Particle Counters For Atmospheric Rapid Measurements (CPC FARM), to measure sub-3 nm size distribution at high time resolution and sensitivity. The CPC FARM is compared to traditionally used particle mobility sizers during a new particle formation campaign to study rapidly changing sub-3 nm particles in Pittsburgh, PA. 
 New particle formation (NPF) is the atmospheric process whereby gas molecules react and nucleate to form detectable particles. NPF has a strong impact on Earth's radiative balance as it produces roughly half of global cloud condensation nuclei. However, the time resolution and sensitivity of current instrumentation are inadequate in measuring the size distribution of sub-3 nm particles, the particles critical for understanding NPF. Here we present the Condensation Particle Counters For Atmospheric Rapid Measurements (CPC FARM), a method to measure the concentrations of freshly nucleated particles. The CPC FARM consists of five CPCs operating in parallel, each configured to operate at different detectable particle sizes between 1–3 nm. This study explores two methods to calculate the size distribution from the differential measurements across the CPC channels. The performance of both inversion methods was tested against the size distribution measured by a pair of stepping particle mobility sizers (SMPSs) during an ambient air sampling study in Pittsburgh, PA. Observational results indicate that the CPC FARM is more accurate with higher time resolution and sensitivity in the sub-3 nm range compared to the SMPS."

The deuterated α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2 were proved as effective surrogates in tracing these losses for some key monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The findings highlight the importance of selecting internal surrogates that closely match the adsorptive and reactive behaviors of target compounds for precise loss correction. 
 Accurately measuring the emissions of monoterpenes (MTs) and sesquiterpenes (SQTs) using dynamic chambers requires careful consideration of their adsorptive and reactive losses, which are often overlooked and difficult to assess in situ. This study evaluated the effectiveness of deuterated surrogates, α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, in tracing these losses in a dynamic chamber system. Using standard gas mixtures of 10 MTs and 10 SQTs, we characterized adsorptive losses across varying concentrations, temperatures, and humidity levels, as well as reactive losses with ozone. Results indicated that adsorptive losses were significantly influenced by concentration and temperature, with species-specific variations particularly under low concentrations and low temperatures, while relative humidity had negligible impact. Reactive losses with ozone exhibited substantial species-specific variability. Key MTs (α-pinene, β-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, and 1,8-cineole) and SQTs (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene) demonstrated consistent adsorptive and reactive behavior with their respective deuterated surrogates α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, suggesting that these surrogates are effective for correcting losses in in-situ emission measurements using dynamic chambers. However, due to varied adsorptive and reactive losses, additional deuterated MTs and SQTs are recommended, particularly selected according to their O3 reactivities, to cover a broader range of MTs and SQTs for loss correction. A strong correlation between adsorptive capacity and ozone reactivity was observed, underscoring the need to carefully address losses of highly reactive MTs and SQTs during emission measurements. This study also emphasizes that ozone-free circulating air should be used for accurately measuring emissions of highly reactive SQTs, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, especially when loss correction methods are unavailable."

An integrated compensation algorithm was designed to account for the effects of UAV motion, attitude changes, and rotor-induced airflow on wind speed measurements. Comparative experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed compensation algorithm. 
 A hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was fitted with a three-dimensional sonic anemometer to measure three-dimensional wind speed. To obtain accurate results for three-dimensional wind speeds, we developed an algorithm to correct biases caused by the rotor-induced airflow disturbance, UVA movement, and attitude changes in the three-dimensional wind measurements. The wind measurement platform was built based on a custom-designed integration kit that couples seamlessly to the UAV, equipped with a payload and the sonic anemometer. Based on an accurate digital model of the integrated UAV-payload-anemometer platform, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to quantify the wind speed disturbances caused by the rotation of the UAV's rotor on the anemometer during the UAV's steady flight under headwind, tailwind, and crosswind conditions. Through analysis of the simulated data, regression equations were developed to predict the wind speed disturbance, and the correction algorithm for rotor disturbances, motions, and attitude changes was developed. To validate the correction algorithm, we conducted a comparison study in which the integrated UAV flew around a meteorological tower on which three-dimensional wind measurements were made at multiple altitudes. The comparison between the corrected UAV wind data and those from the meteorological tower demonstrated an excellent agreement. The corrections result in significant reductions in wind speed bias caused mostly by the rotors, along with notable changes in the dominant wind direction and wind speed in the original data. The algorithm enables reliable and accurate wind speed measurements in the atmospheric boundary layer made from rotorcraft UAVs."

Hattermann,Climate model downscaling in central Asia: a dynamical and a neural network approach,"We tried to contribute to a local climate change impact study in central Asia, a region that is water-scarce and vulnerable to global climate change. We use regional models and machine learning to produce reliable local data from global climate models. We find that regional models show more realistic and detailed changes in heavy precipitation than global climate models. Our work can help assess the future risks of extreme events and plan adaptation strategies in central Asia. 
 High-resolution climate projections are essential for estimating future climate change impacts. Statistical and dynamical downscaling methods, or a hybrid of both, are commonly employed to generate input datasets for impact modelling. In this study, we employ COSMO-CLM (CCLM) version 6.0, a regional climate model, to explore the benefits of dynamically downscaling a general circulation model (GCM) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), focusing on climate change projections for central Asia (CA). The CCLM, at 0.22° horizontal resolution, is driven by the MPI-ESM1-2-HR GCM (at 1° spatial resolution) for the historical period of 1985–2014 and the projection period of 2019–2100 under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), namely the SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) gridded observation dataset as a reference, we evaluate the performance of CCLM driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis over the historical period. The added value of CCLM, compared to its driving GCM, is evident over mountainous areas in CA, which are at a higher risk of extreme precipitation events. The mean absolute error and bias of climatological precipitation (mm d−1) are reduced by 5 mm d−1 for summer and 3 mm d−1 for annual values. For winter, there was no error reduction achieved. However, the frequency of extreme precipitation values improved in the CCLM simulations. Additionally, we employ CCLM to refine future climate projections. We present high-resolution maps of heavy precipitation changes based on CCLM and compare them with the CMIP6 GCM ensemble. Our analysis indicates an increase in the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events over CA areas already at risk of extreme climatic events by the end of the century. The number of days with precipitation exceeding 20 mm increases by more than 90 by the end of the century, compared to the historical reference period, under the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The annual 99th percentile of total precipitation increases by more than 9 mm d−1 over mountainous areas of central Asia by the end of the century, relative to the 1985–2014 reference period, under the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Finally, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map a GCM simulation to its dynamically downscaled CCLM counterpart. The CNN successfully emulates the GCM–CCLM model chain over large areas of CA but shows reduced skill when applied to a different GCM–CCLM model chain.

Here, we describe recent significant improvements of ESMValTool’s computational efficiency including parallel, out-of-core, and distributed computing. Evaluations with the enhanced version of ESMValTool are faster, use less computational resources, and can handle input data larger than the available memory. 
 Earth System Models (ESMs) allow numerical simulations of the Earth's climate system. Driven by the need to better understand climate change and its impacts, these models have become increasingly sophisticated over time, generating vast amounts of data. To effectively evaluate the complex state-of-the-art ESMs and ensure their reliability, new tools for comprehensive analysis are essential. The open-source community-driven Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) addresses this critical need by providing a software package for scientists to assess the performance of ESMs using common diagnostics and metrics. In this paper, we describe recent significant improvements of ESMValTool’s computational efficiency, which allow a more effective evaluation of these complex ESMs and also high-resolution models. These optimizations include parallel computing (execute multiple computation tasks simultaneously), out-of-core computing (process data larger than available memory), and distributed computing (spread computation tasks across multiple interconnected nodes or machines). When comparing the latest ESMValTool version with a previous not yet optimized version, we find significant performance improvements for many relevant applications running on a single node of a high performance computing (HPC) system, ranging from 2.6 times faster runs in a multi-model setup up to 25 times faster runs for processing a single high-resolution model. By utilizing distributed computing on two nodes of an HPC system, these speedup factors can be further improved to 3.2 and 36, respectively. Moreover, especially on small hardware, evaluation runs with the latest version of ESMValTool also require significantly less computational resources than before, which in turn reduces power consumption and thus the overall carbon footprint of ESMValTool runs. For example, the previously mentioned use cases use 16 (multi-model evaluation) and 40 (high-resolution model evaluation) times less resources compared to the reference version. Finally, analyses which could previously only be performed on machines with large amounts of memory can now be conducted on much smaller hardware through the use of out-of-core computation. For instance, the high-resolution single-model evaluation use case can now be run on a machine with only 16 GB of memory despite a total input data size of 35 GB, which was not possible with earlier versions of ESMValTool. This enables running much more complex evaluation tasks on a standard laptop than before."

M. Pugh,"Combining empirical and mechanistic understanding of spruce bark beetle outbreak dynamics in the LPJ-GUESS (v4.1, r13130) vegetation model","The European spruce bark beetle (SBB) has, in recent years, been the most important disturbance agent in many European forests. We implemented a SBB module in a dynamic vegetation model and calibrated it against observations from Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and France. The start and duration of outbreaks triggered by storm damage and the increased damage driven by recent warm and dry periods were reasonably well simulated, although the spread was reflected in uncertain parameter estimates. 
 For evaluating the forests’ performance in a future with changing climate for different management alternatives, dynamic vegetation models are important tools. One of the functions in such models that has a big influence on the results is tree mortality. Bark beetles are important for the pattern of mortality in forest, especially for needle leaved forest in the temperate and boreal zones. The European spruce bark beetle (SBB, Ips typographus) has in the most recent years replaced wind as the most important disturbance agent in European forests. Historically, SBB damage is typically triggered by wind storms as they create breeding material with no defences to overcome for the beetles. Drought can contribute to increased damage and prolonged outbreaks by lowering the defence of the trees, but has been the main driver of some of the European forest damage in the last decade. In this study we implemented a SBB damage module in a dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) that includes representation of wind damage and forest management. The module was calibrated against observations of storm and SBB damage in Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and France. An index of the SBB population size that changed over time driven by phenology, drought, storm felled spruce trees and density of the beetle population, was used to scale modelled damage. The model was able to catch the start and duration of outbreaks triggered by storm damage reasonably well but there was a large variability that partly can be related to salvage logging of storm felled forest and sanitary cutting of infested trees. The model showed increased damage in most recent years with warm and dry conditions, although below the level reported, which may suggest that the drought stress response of spruce in LPJ-GUESS is underestimated. The new model forms a basis to explore vulnerability of European forests to spruce bark beetle infestations."

While there is support for the major drivers of Hg bioaccumulation, the relative influence of different external factors can vary widely among waterbodies, which makes predicting Hg risk across large spatial scales particularly challenging. We modeled Hg bioaccumulation by coupling Hg concentrations in more than 21,000 dragonflies collected across the United States from 2008 to 2021 with a suite of chemical (e.g., dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, sulfate) and landscape (e.g., soil characteristics, land cover) variables representing external drivers of Hg methylation, transport, and uptake. Model predictions explained 85% of the variation in dragonfly Hg concentrations across the United States. Certain predictor variables were more important than others (e.g., DOC, pH, and percent wetland), and they varied among waterbodies. Variation in Hg bioaccumulation was explained by including habitat and ecosystem type in a hierarchical modeling framework, which confirms the context-dependency of external factors in explaining Hg bioaccumulation across disparate freshwater ecosystems. This continent-scale model provides valuable insights into the processes underlying landscape-scale patterns in Hg exposure risk and demonstrates that drivers of Hg methylation and bioaccumulation are habitat- and ecosystem-dependent."

Reliable quantification is important for understanding the environmental fate and potential adverse effects of TRWPs. To address environmental monitoring needs, the present work adapts a series of isolation and identification steps from methods commonly applied for microplastic analysis for single-particle-level enumeration of TRWPs from environmental samples. We present the method performance of a two-stage density separation with saturated NaCl and sodium polytungstate to isolate TRWPs from sediment matrices, the compatibility of tire microrubber with reagents used for digestion of environmental matrices, and the use of elasticity and heat resistance observations to differentiate TRWPs from bitumen particulates, which are potential visual interference. We found that alkaline digestions (NaOH and KOH) are compatible with tire microrubbers, but hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite can cause TRWPs to lose elasticity and flatten or break when probed. The adapted methods were applied to road dust samples, and a subset of identified TRWPs was qualitatively confirmed by both scanning electron microscopy and pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Further, a compilation of aspect ratio measurements of TRWPs between 63 and 500 μm (N = 780) that were isolated from urban sediments shows the potential diversity of TRWP shapes in the environment."

Behavioral assessments revealed significant cognitive deficits, while biochemical analyses demonstrated increased levels of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and activation of microglial cells were observed, indicating a robust neuroinflammatory response.

Here, we show that poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) films undergo ultraviolet photoaging, resulting in increased surface roughness and a higher quantity of MNPs on the surface. This aging process involves the generation of carbon- and oxygen-centered free radicals, chain scission, and the formation of oxidation products with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. These MNPs can be released under water shear force, significantly increasing the normalized mass loss of aged films to approximately 0.128 mg/cm2 (18 times higher than that of unaged films in water). In the gastrointestinal environment, the normalized mass loss further increases to about 0.196 mg/cm2 (28 times higher), likely due to potential enzymatic digestion and ion-swelling effects. These MNPs, primarily composed of PLA, are smaller and carry more negative charges under gastrointestinal conditions. In the THP-1 cell model, these MNPs affect cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. MNPs obtained through ultrafiltration, compared to those collected via centrifugation, display a broader size distribution and induce more pronounced toxicity in THP-1 cells, with an EC50 of 243 mg/L.

This inter‐continental correlation, together with paleobiogeographic affinities, supports a southern hemispheric low‐latitude location adjacent to the west of East Gondwana for the NCB during the late Cambrian, thus constraining further paleogeographic‐tectonic reconstructions around East Gondwana during the Paleozoic."

Its pattern resembled the 1997 EXpIOD, contrasting with other coastally‐concentrated EXpIODs. Here we show that the distinctive air‐sea responses of equatorial EXpIODs stem from the energetic central IO zonal winds fueled by concurrent strong El Niños, which were absent in other cases. The exceptionally strong easterly anomaly generates prominent nonlinear vertical advection cooling the central IO, with nonlinear zonal advection and the Ekman feedback playing supportive roles. Current coupled models can capture this Pacific shaping effect, despite with divergent strengths. Under strong El Niño's inter‐basin forcing, the westward extension of cooling has profound implications for regional hydrology and coral ecology, and warrants closer attention in future predictions."

Pseudo global warming experiments for counterfactual natural non‐warming conditions (NAT) were conducted by removing anthropogenic warming patterns from the observations. The anthropogenic warming patterns were estimated from the differences between Coupled Model Inter‐comparison Project Phase 6 historical and historical natural‐only simulations. Two NAT experiments were performed by using the multi‐model mean of all nine models (NATT) and the three models with weaker upper tropospheric warming (NATW). The results show that atmospheric moisture is reduced in both NAT experiments compared to the current‐condition experiments, but that enhanced convective instability due to upper tropospheric cooling offsets the effect of moisture reduction, resulting in similar precipitation responses. This compensation effect becomes weak in NATW, indicating the important role of the vertical profile of anthropogenic warming pattern in PGW‐based attribution experiments."

 Nucleophilic aromatic substitutions (SNAr) are amongst the most widely used processes in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries1–4, allowing convergent assembly of complex molecules through C–C and C–X (X = O, N, S) bond formation. SNAr reactions are typically carried out using forcing conditions, involving polar aprotic solvents, stoichiometric bases and elevated temperatures, which do not allow for control over reaction selectivity. Despite the importance of SNAr chemistry, there are only a handful of selective catalytic methods reported that rely on small organic hydrogen-bonding or phase-transfer catalysts5–11. Here we establish a biocatalytic approach to stereoselective SNAr chemistry by uncovering promiscuous SNAr activity in a designed enzyme featuring an activated arginine12. This activity was optimized over successive rounds of directed evolution to afford an engineered biocatalyst, SNAr1.3, that is 160-fold more efficient than the parent and promotes the coupling of electron-deficient arenes with carbon nucleophiles with near-perfect stereocontrol (>99% e.e.). SNAr1.3 can operate at a rate of 0.15 s-1, perform >4000 turnovers and can accept a broad range of electrophilic and nucleophilic coupling partners, including those that allow construction of challenging 1,1-diaryl quaternary stereocentres. Biochemical, structural and computational studies provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of SNAr1.3, including the emergence of a halide binding pocket shaped by key catalytic residues Arg124 and Asp125. This study brings a landmark synthetic reaction into the realm of biocatalysis to provide an efficient and versatile platform for catalytic SNAr chemistry."

 Hippocampal circuits in the brain enable two distinct cognitive functions: the construction of spatial maps for navigation, and the storage of sequential episodic memories1–5. Although there have been advances in modelling spatial representations in the hippocampus6–10, we lack good models of its role in episodic memory. Here we present a neocortical–entorhinal–hippocampal network model that implements a high-capacity general associative memory, spatial memory and episodic memory. By factoring content storage from the dynamics of generating error-correcting stable states, the circuit (which we call vector hippocampal scaffolded heteroassociative memory (Vector-HaSH)) avoids the memory cliff of prior memory models11,12, and instead exhibits a graceful trade-off between number of stored items and recall detail. A pre-structured internal scaffold based on grid cell states is essential for constructing even non-spatial episodic memory: it enables high-capacity sequence memorization by abstracting the chaining problem into one of learning low-dimensional transitions. Vector-HaSH reproduces several hippocampal experiments on spatial mapping and context-based representations, and provides a circuit model of the ‘memory palaces’ used by memory athletes13. Thus, this work provides a unified understanding of the spatial mapping and associative and episodic memory roles of the hippocampus.

 With promises for high specific energy, high safety and low cost, the all-solid-state lithium–sulfur battery (ASSLSB) is ideal for next-generation energy storage1–5. However, the poor rate performance and short cycle life caused by the sluggish solid–solid sulfur redox reaction (SSSRR) at the three-phase boundaries remain to be solved. Here we demonstrate a fast SSSRR enabled by lithium thioborophosphate iodide (LBPSI) glass-phase solid electrolytes (GSEs). On the basis of the reversible redox between I− and I2/I3−, the solid electrolyte (SE)—as well as serving as a superionic conductor—functions as a surficial redox mediator that facilitates the sluggish reactions at the solid–solid two-phase boundaries, thereby substantially increasing the density of active sites. Through this mechanism, the ASSLSB exhibits ultrafast charging capability, showing a high specific capacity of 1,497 mAh g−1sulfur on charging at 2C (30 °C), while still maintaining 784 mAh g−1sulfur at 20C. Notably, a specific capacity of 432 mAh g−1sulfur is achieved on charging at an extreme rate of 150C at 60 °C. Furthermore, the cell demonstrates superior cycling stability over 25,000 cycles with 80.2% capacity retention at 5C (25 °C). We expect that our work on redox-mediated SSSRR will pave the way for developing advanced ASSLSBs that are high energy and safe.

 Roman writers found the relative empowerment of Celtic women remarkable1. In southern Britain, the Late Iron Age Durotriges tribe often buried women with substantial grave goods2. Here we analyse 57 ancient genomes from Durotrigian burial sites and find an extended kin group centred around a single maternal lineage, with unrelated (presumably inward migrating) burials being predominantly male. Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines. Patterns of haplotype sharing reveal that British Iron Age populations form fine-grained geographical clusters with southern links extending across the channel to the continent. Indeed, whereas most of Britain shows majority genomic continuity from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age, this is markedly reduced in a southern coastal core region with persistent cross-channel cultural exchange3. This southern core has evidence of population influx in the Middle Bronze Age but also during the Iron Age. This is asynchronous with the rest of the island and points towards a staged, geographically granular absorption of continental influence, possibly including the acquisition of Celtic languages.

 Molecular recognition events between proteins drive biological processes in living systems1. However, higher levels of mechanistic regulation have emerged, in which protein–protein interactions are conditioned to small molecules2–5. Despite recent advances, computational tools for the design of new chemically induced protein interactions have remained a challenging task for the field6,7. Here we present a computational strategy for the design of proteins that target neosurfaces, that is, surfaces arising from protein–ligand complexes. To develop this strategy, we leveraged a geometric deep learning approach based on learned molecular surface representations8,9 and experimentally validated binders against three drug-bound protein complexes: Bcl2–venetoclax, DB3–progesterone and PDF1–actinonin. All binders demonstrated high affinities and accurate specificities, as assessed by mutational and structural characterization. Remarkably, surface fingerprints previously trained only on proteins could be applied to neosurfaces induced by interactions with small molecules, providing a powerful demonstration of generalizability that is uncommon in other deep learning approaches. We anticipate that such designed chemically induced protein interactions will have the potential to expand the sensing repertoire and the assembly of new synthetic pathways in engineered cells for innovative drug-controlled cell-based therapies10.

 DNA is subject to continual damage, leaving each cell with thousands of individual DNA lesions at any given moment1–3. The efficiency of DNA repair means that most known classes of lesion have a half-life of minutes to hours3,4, but the extent to which DNA damage can persist for longer durations remains unknown. Here, using high-resolution phylogenetic trees from 89 donors, we identified mutations arising from 818 DNA lesions that persisted across multiple cell cycles in normal human stem cells from blood, liver and bronchial epithelium5–12. Persistent DNA lesions occurred at increased rates, with distinctive mutational signatures, in donors exposed to tobacco or chemotherapy, suggesting that they can arise from exogenous mutagens. In haematopoietic stem cells, persistent DNA lesions, probably from endogenous sources, generated the characteristic mutational signature SBS1913; occurred steadily throughout life, including in utero; and endured for 2.2 years on average, with 15–25% of lesions lasting at least 3 years. We estimate that on average, a haematopoietic stem cell has approximately eight such lesions at any moment in time, half of which will generate a mutation with each cell cycle. Overall, 16% of mutations in blood cells are attributable to SBS19, and similar proportions of driver mutations in blood cancers exhibit this signature. These data indicate the existence of a family of DNA lesions that arise from endogenous and exogenous mutagens, are present in low numbers per genome, persist for months to years, and can generate a substantial fraction of the mutation burden of somatic cells. Persistent DNA lesions can occur throughout the human lifespan and can remain in the genome of affected cells for several years and generate a substantial proportion of the mutational burden."

 Many human diseases are the result of early developmental defects. As most paediatric diseases and disorders are rare, children are critically underrepresented in research. Functional genomics studies primarily rely on adult tissues and lack critical cell states in specific developmental windows. In parallel, little is known about the conservation of developmental programmes across non-human primate (NHP) species, with implications for human evolution. Here we introduce the developmental Genotype-Tissue Expression (dGTEx) projects, which span humans and NHPs and aim to integrate gene expression, regulation and genetics data across development and species.

The data will comprise whole-genome sequencing, extensive bulk, single-cell and spatial gene expression profiles, and chromatin accessibility data across tissues and development. Through community engagement and donor diversity, the human dGTEx study seeks to address disparities in genomic research. Thus, dGTEx will provide a reference human and NHP dataset and tissue bank, enabling research into developmental changes in expression and gene regulation, childhood disorders and the effect of genetic variation on development.

 Inflammatory diseases are often chronic and recurrent, and current treatments do not typically remove underlying disease drivers1. T cells participate in a wide range of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis2, Crohn’s disease3, oesophagitis4 and multiple sclerosis5,6, and clonally expanded antigen-specific T cells may contribute to disease chronicity and recurrence, in part by forming persistent pathogenic memory. Chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma are inflammatory airway diseases that often present as comorbidities7. Chronic rhinosinusitis affects more than 10% of the general population8. Among these patients, 20–25% would develop nasal polyps, which often require repeated surgical resections owing to a high incidence of recurrence9. Whereas abundant T cells infiltrate the nasal polyps tissue10,11, T cell subsets that drive the disease pathology and promote recurrence are not fully understood. By comparing T cell repertoires in nasal polyp tissues obtained from consecutive surgeries, here we report that persistent CD8+ T cell clones carrying effector memory-like features colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence, and these cells characteristically express the tryptase Granzyme K (GZMK). We find that GZMK cleaves many complement components, including C2, C3, C4 and C5, that collectively contribute to the activation of the complement cascade. GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells participate in organized tertiary lymphoid structures, and tissue GZMK levels predict the disease severity and comorbidities better than well-established biomarkers such as eosinophilia and tissue interleukin-5. Using a mouse asthma model, we further show that GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells exacerbate the disease in a manner dependent on the proteolytic activity of GZMK and complements. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of GZMK after the disease onset markedly alleviates tissue pathology and restores lung function. Our work identifies a pathogenic CD8+ memory T cell subset that promotes tissue inflammation and recurrent airway diseases by the effector molecule GZMK and suggests GZMK as a potential therapeutic target. Comparing T cells in nasal polyps from repeated surgeries shows that effector memory-like persistent clones colonize the mucosal tissue during disease recurrence and promote inflammation by producing Granzyme K, a complement-activating tryptase, which is a potential therapeutic target."

 The human genome contains millions of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) with cell-type-specific activities that shape both health and many disease states1. However, we lack a functional understanding of the sequence features that control the activity and cell-type-specific features of these cCREs. Here we used lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays (lentiMPRAs) to test the regulatory activity of more than 680,000 sequences, representing an extensive set of annotated cCREs among three cell types (HepG2, K562 and WTC11), and found that 41.7% of these sequences were active. By testing sequences in both orientations, we find promoters to have strand-orientation biases and their 200-nucleotide cores to function as non-cell-type-specific ‘on switches’ that provide similar expression levels to their associated gene. By contrast, enhancers have weaker orientation biases, but increased tissue-specific characteristics. Utilizing our lentiMPRA data, we develop sequence-based models to predict cCRE function and variant effects with high accuracy, delineate regulatory motifs and model their combinatorial effects.

 Argonaute proteins are categorized into AGO and PIWI clades. Across most animal species, AGO-clade proteins are widely expressed in various cell types, and regulate normal gene expression1. By contrast, PIWI-clade proteins predominantly function during gametogenesis to suppress transposons and ensure fertility1,2. Both clades use nucleic acid guides for target recognition by means of base pairing, crucial for initiating target silencing, often through direct cleavage. AGO-clade proteins use a narrow channel to secure a tight guide–target interaction3. By contrast, PIWI proteins feature a wider channel that potentially allows mismatches during pairing, broadening target silencing capability4,5. However, the mechanism of PIWI-mediated target cleavage remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that after target binding, PIWI proteins undergo a conformational change from an ‘open’ state to a ‘locked’ state, facilitating base pairing and enhancing target cleavage efficiency. This transition involves narrowing of the binding channel and repositioning of the PIWI-interacting RNA–target duplex towards the MID-PIWI lobe, establishing extensive contacts for duplex stabilization. During this transition, we also identify an intermediate ‘comma-shaped’ conformation, which might recruit GTSF1, a known auxiliary protein that enhances PIWI cleavage activity6. GTSF1 facilitates the transition to the locked state by linking the PIWI domain to the RNA duplex, thereby expediting the conformational change critical for efficient target cleavage. These findings explain the molecular mechanisms underlying PIWI–PIWI-interacting RNA complex function in target RNA cleavage, providing insights into how dynamic conformational changes from PIWI proteins coordinate cofactors to safeguard gametogenesis.

 Identifying phase-separated structures remains challenging, and effective intervention methods are currently lacking1. Here we screened for phase-separated proteins in breast tumour cells and identified forkhead (FKH) box protein M1 (FOXM1) as the most prominent candidate. Oncogenic FOXM1 underwent liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) with FKH consensus DNA element, and compartmentalized the transcription apparatus in the nucleus, thereby sustaining chromatin accessibility and super-enhancer landscapes crucial for tumour metastatic outgrowth. Screening an epigenetics compound library identified AMPK agonists as suppressors of FOXM1 condensation. AMPK phosphorylated FOXM1 in the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), perturbing condensates, reducing oncogenic transcription, accumulating double-stranded DNA to stimulate innate immune responses, and endowing discrete FOXM1 with the ability to activate immunogenicity-related gene expressions. By developing a genetic code-expansion orthogonal system, we demonstrated that a phosphoryl moiety at a specific IDR1 site causes electrostatic repulsion, thereby abolishing FOXM1 LLPS and aggregation. A peptide targeting IDR1 and carrying the AMPK-phosphorylated residue was designed to disrupt FOXM1 LLPS and was shown to inhibit tumour malignancy, rescue tumour immunogenicity and improve tumour immunotherapy. Together, these findings provide novel and in-depth insights on function and mechanism of FOXM1 and develop methodologies that hold promising implications in clinics.

 Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are de novo ectopic lymphoid aggregates that regulate immunity in chronically inflamed tissues, including tumours. Although TLSs form due to inflammation-triggered activation of the lymphotoxin (LT)–LTβ receptor (LTβR) pathway1, the inflammatory signals and cells that induce TLSs remain incompletely identified. Here we show that interleukin-33 (IL-33), the alarmin released by inflamed tissues2, induces TLSs. In mice, Il33 deficiency severely attenuates inflammation- and LTβR-activation-induced TLSs in models of colitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In PDAC, the alarmin domain of IL-33 activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) expressing LT that engage putative LTβR+ myeloid organizer cells to initiate tertiary lymphoneogenesis. Notably, lymphoneogenic ILC2s migrate to PDACs from the gut, can be mobilized to PDACs in different tissues and are modulated by gut microbiota. Furthermore, we detect putative lymphoneogenic ILC2s and IL-33-expressing cells within TLSs in human PDAC that correlate with improved prognosis. To harness this lymphoneogenic pathway for immunotherapy, we engineer a recombinant human IL-33 protein that expands intratumoural lymphoneogenic ILC2s and TLSs and demonstrates enhanced anti-tumour activity in PDAC mice. In summary, we identify the molecules and cells of a druggable pathway that induces inflammation-triggered TLSs. More broadly, we reveal a lymphoneogenic function for alarmins and ILC2s.

 Realizing quantum control and entanglement of particles is crucial for advancing both quantum technologies and fundamental science. Substantial developments in this domain have been achieved in a variety of systems1–5. In this context, ultracold polar molecules offer new and unique opportunities because of their more complex internal structure associated with vibration and rotation, coupled with the existence of long-range interactions6,7. However, the same properties make molecules highly sensitive to their environment8–10, affecting their coherence and utility in some applications.

 Snakebite envenoming remains a devastating and neglected tropical disease, claiming over 100,000 lives annually and causing severe complications and long-lasting disabilities for many more1,2. Three-finger toxins (3FTx) are highly toxic components of elapid snake venoms that can cause diverse pathologies, including severe tissue damage3 and inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in life-threatening neurotoxicity4. At present, the only available treatments for snakebites consist of polyclonal antibodies derived from the plasma of immunized animals, which have high cost and limited efficacy against 3FTxs5–7. Here we used deep learning methods to de novo design proteins to bind short-chain and long-chain α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins from the 3FTx family. With limited experimental screening, we obtained protein designs with remarkable thermal stability, high binding affinity and near-atomic-level agreement with the computational models. The designed proteins effectively neutralized all three 3FTx subfamilies in vitro and protected mice from a lethal neurotoxin challenge. Such potent, stable and readily manufacturable toxin-neutralizing proteins could provide the basis for safer, cost-effective and widely accessible next-generation antivenom therapeutics. Beyond snakebite, our results highlight how computational design could help democratize therapeutic discovery, particularly in resource-limited settings, by substantially reducing costs and resource requirements for the development of therapies for neglected tropical diseases.

 During motor learning, breaks in practice are known to facilitate behavioural optimizations. Although this process has traditionally been studied over long breaks that last hours to days1–6, recent studies in humans have demonstrated that rapid performance gains during early motor sequence learning are most pronounced after very brief breaks lasting seconds to minutes7–10. However, the precise causal neural mechanisms that facilitate performance gains after brief breaks remain poorly understood. Here we recorded neural ensemble activity in the motor cortex of macaques while they performed a visuomotor sequence learning task interspersed with brief breaks. We found that task-related neural cofiring patterns were reactivated during brief breaks. The rate and content of reactivations predicted the magnitude and pattern of subsequent performance gains. Of note, we found that performance gains and reactivations were positively correlated with cortical ripples (80–120 Hz oscillations) but anti-correlated with β bursts (13–30 Hz oscillations), which ultimately dominated breaks after the fast learning phase plateaued. We then applied 20 Hz epidural alternating current stimulation (ACS) to motor cortex, which reduced reactivation rates in a phase-specific and dose-dependent manner. Notably, 20 Hz ACS also eliminated performance gains. Overall, our results indicate that the reactivations of task ensembles during brief breaks are causal drivers of subsequent performance gains. β bursts compete with this process, possibly to support stable performance. In macaques, motor cortex activity associated with motor learning tasks is reactivated during brief breaks between learning blocks and predicts subsequent performance gains."

 Graphene is a single-layered sp2-hybridized carbon allotrope, which is impermeable to all atomic entities other than hydrogen1,2. The introduction of defects allows selective gas permeation3–5; efforts have been made to control the size of these defects for higher selectivity6–9. Permeation of entities other than gases, such as ions10,11, is of fundamental scientific interest because of its potential application in desalination, detection and purification12–16. However, a precise experimental observation of halide permeation has so far remained unknown11,15–18. Here we show halide permeation through a single benzene-sized defect in a molecular nanographene. Using supramolecular principles of self-aggregation, we created a stable bilayer of the nanographene19–23. As the cavity in the bilayer nanographene could be accessed only by two angstrom-sized windows, any halide that gets trapped inside the cavity has to permeate through the single benzene hole. Our experiments reveal the permeability of fluoride, chloride and bromide through a single benzene hole, whereas iodide is impermeable. Evidence for high permeation of chloride across single-layer nanographene and selective halide binding in a bilayer nanographene provides promise for the use of single benzene defects in graphene for artificial halide receptors24,25, as filtration membranes26 and further to create multilayer artificial chloride channels.

 Nutrient acquisition is crucial for sustaining life. Plants develop beneficial intracellular partnerships with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria to surmount the scarcity of soil nutrients and tap into atmospheric dinitrogen, respectively1,2. Initiation of these root endosymbioses requires symbiont-induced oscillations in nuclear calcium (Ca2+) concentrations in root cells3. How the nuclear-localized ion channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) 15 and DOESN’T MAKE INFECTIONS1 (DMI1)4 are coordinated to specify symbiotic-induced nuclear Ca2+ oscillations remains unknown. Here we discovered an autoactive CNGC15 mutant that generates spontaneous low-frequency Ca2+ oscillations. While CNGC15 produces nuclear Ca2+ oscillations via a gating mechanism involving its helix 1, DMI1 acts as a pacemaker to specify the frequency of the oscillations. We demonstrate that the specificity of symbiotic-induced nuclear Ca2+ oscillations is encoded in its frequency. A high frequency activates endosymbiosis programmes, whereas a low frequency modulates phenylpropanoid pathways. Consequently, the autoactive cngc15 mutant, which is capable of generating both frequencies, has increased flavonoids that enhance AM, root nodule symbiosis and nutrient acquisition. We transferred this trait to wheat, resulting in field-grown wheat with increased AM colonization and nutrient acquisition. Our findings reveal a new strategy to boost endosymbiosis in the field and reduce inorganic fertilizer use while sustaining plant growth.

 The amount of methane released to the atmosphere from the Nord Stream subsea pipeline leaks remains uncertain, as reflected in a wide range of estimates1–18. A lack of information regarding the temporal variation in atmospheric emissions has made it challenging to reconcile pipeline volumetric (bottom-up) estimates1–8 with measurement-based (top-down) estimates8–18. Here we simulate pipeline rupture emission rates and integrate these with methane dissolution and sea-surface outgassing estimates9,10 to model the evolution of atmospheric emissions from the leaks. We verify our modelled atmospheric emissions by comparing them with top-down point-in-time emission-rate estimates and cumulative emission estimates derived from airborne11, satellite8,12–14 and tall tower data. We obtain consistency between our modelled atmospheric emissions and top-down estimates and find that 465 ± 20 thousand metric tons of methane were emitted to the atmosphere. Although, to our knowledge, this represents the largest recorded amount of methane released from a single transient event, it is equivalent to 0.1% of anthropogenic methane emissions for 2022. The impact of the leaks on the global atmospheric methane budget brings into focus the numerous other anthropogenic methane sources that require mitigation globally. Our analysis demonstrates that diverse, complementary measurement approaches are needed to quantify methane emissions in support of the Global Methane Pledge19.

 Sustainable development aspires to “leave no one behind”1. Even so, limited attention has been paid to small-scale fisheries (SSF) and their importance in eradicating poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Through a collaborative and multidimensional data-driven approach, we have estimated that SSF provide at least 40% (37.3 million tonnes) of global fisheries catches and 2.3 billion people with, on average, 20% of their dietary intake across six key micronutrients essential for human health. Globally, the livelihood of 1 in every 12 people, nearly half of them women, depends at least partly on small-scale fishing, in total generating 44% (US$77.2 billion) of the economic value of all fisheries landed. Regionally, Asian SSF provide fish, support livelihoods and supply nutrition to the largest number of people. Relative to the total capture of the fisheries sector (comprising large-scale and small-scale fisheries), across all regions, African SSF supply the most catch and nutrition, and SSF in Oceania improve the most livelihoods. Maintaining and increasing these multidimensional SSF contributions to sustainable development requires targeted and effective actions, especially increasing the engagement of fisherfolk in shared management and governance. Without management and governance focused on the multidimensional contributions of SSF, the marginalization of millions of fishers and fishworkers will worsen.

 Foraminifera are ubiquitous marine protists that intracellularly accumulate phosphate1, an important macronutrient in marine ecosystems and in fertilizer potentially leaked into the ocean. Intracellular phosphate concentrations can be 100–1,000 times higher than in the surrounding water1. Here we show that phosphate storage in foraminifera is widespread, from tidal flats to the deep sea. The total amount of intracellular phosphate stored in the benthic foraminifer Ammonia confertitesta in the Wadden Sea during a bloom is as high as around 5% of the annual consumption of phosphorus (P) fertilizer in Germany. Budget calculations for the Southern North Sea and the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone indicate that benthic foraminifera may buffer riverine P runoff for approximately 37 days at the Southern North Sea and for about 21 days at the Peruvian margin. This indicates that these organisms are probably relevant for marine P cycling—they potentially buffer anthropogenic eutrophication in coastal environments. Phosphate is stored as polyphosphate in cell organelles that are potentially acidocalcisomes. Their metabolic functions can range from regulation of osmotic pressure and intracellular pH to calcium and energy storage. In addition, storage of energetic P compounds, such as creatine phosphate and polyphosphate, is probably an adaptation of foraminifera to O2 depletion.

 Increasing soil salinity causes significant crop losses globally; therefore, understanding plant responses to salt (sodium) stress is of high importance. Plants avoid sodium toxicity through subcellular compartmentation by intricate processes involving a high level of elemental interdependence. Current technologies to visualize sodium, in particular, together with other elements, are either indirect or lack in resolution. Here we used the newly developed cryo nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry ion microprobe1, which allows high-resolution elemental imaging of cryo-preserved samples and reveals the subcellular distributions of key macronutrients and micronutrients in root meristem cells of Arabidopsis and rice. We found an unexpected, concentration-dependent change in sodium distribution, switching from sodium accumulation in the cell walls at low external sodium concentrations to vacuolar accumulation at stressful concentrations. We conclude that, in root meristems, a key function of the NHX family sodium/proton antiporter SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 1 (also known as Na+/H+ exchanger 7; SOS1/NHX7) is to sequester sodium into vacuoles, rather than extrusion of sodium into the extracellular space. This is corroborated by the use of new genomic, complementing fluorescently tagged SOS1 variants. We show that, in addition to the plasma membrane, SOS1 strongly accumulates at late endosome/prevacuoles as well as vacuoles, supporting a role of SOS1 in vacuolar sodium sequestration. This study demonstrates that cryo nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (CryoNanoSIMS) enables direct multi-elemental imaging at subcellular resolution of macro- and micronutrients or trace elements in plants and may provide insights into the in vivo roles of many transporters."

 Cells display a range of mechanical activities generated by motor proteins powered through catalysis1. This raises the fundamental question of how the acceleration of a chemical reaction can enable the energy released from that reaction to be transduced (and, consequently, work to be done) by a molecular catalyst2–7. Here we demonstrate the molecular-level transduction of chemical energy to mechanical force8 in the form of the powered contraction and powered re-expansion of a cross-linked polymer gel driven by the directional rotation of artificial catalysis-driven9 molecular motors. Continuous 360° rotation of the rotor about the stator of the catalysis-driven motor-molecules incorporated in the polymeric framework of the gel twists the polymer chains of the cross-linked network around one another. This progressively increases writhe and tightens entanglements, causing a macroscopic contraction of the gel to approximately 70% of its original volume. The subsequent addition of the opposite enantiomer fuelling system powers the rotation of the motor-molecules in the reverse direction, unwinding the entanglements and causing the gel to re-expand. Continued powered twisting of the strands in the new direction causes the gel to re-contract. In addition to actuation, motor-molecule rotation in the gel produces other chemical and physical outcomes, including changes in the Young modulus and storage modulus—the latter is proportional to the increase in strand crossings resulting from motor rotation. The experimental demonstration of work against a load by a synthetic organocatalyst, and its mechanism of energy transduction6, informs both the debate3,5,7 surrounding the mechanism of force generation by biological motors and the design principles6,10–14 for artificial molecular nanotechnology.

 Clouds greatly influence the Earth’s energy balance1,2. Observationally constraining cloud radiative feedback, a notably uncertain climate feedback mechanism3–5, is crucial for improving predictions of climate change5–7 but, so far, remains an elusive objective, and the feedback may be different over the ocean versus over land8–10. Here we show a local negative surface longwave cloud feedback over land at the southern Great Plains site, constrained by direct long-term observation of spectrally resolved downwelling longwave radiance11. This negative cloud feedback at the southern Great Plains site causes a −1.77 ± 1.15 W m−2 per decade change in downwelling longwave radiation and suggests that cloud changes may partially modulate the warming effect of increased greenhouse gas concentrations and atmospheric temperatures over land. Specifically, our results are derived from an optimal spectral fingerprinting method12–15 designed to separate surface longwave cloud feedback from other surface forcings and feedbacks, by making use of their unique spectral signatures13–18 in the long-term record of spectrally resolved radiances. Furthermore, we show that the results are not site specific: negative surface longwave cloud feedbacks, primarily induced by decreasing low cloud cover in warming climates, are commonly observed over land in reanalysis and satellite datasets. Our findings establish a pivotal observational benchmark of radiative forcing and feedback needed for validating climate model performance over land. Results derived from an optimal spectral fingerprinting method applied to reanalysis and satellite datasets show that low cloud cover in warming climates caused a reduction in downwelling longwave radiation over land, which is not site specific."

 Creating the Babel Fish, a tool that helps individuals translate speech between any two languages, requires advanced technological innovation and linguistic expertise. Although conventional speech-to-speech translation systems composed of multiple subsystems performing translation in a cascaded fashion exist1–3, scalable and high-performing unified systems4,5 remain underexplored. To address this gap, here we introduce SEAMLESSM4T–Massively Multilingual and Multimodal Machine Translation–a single model that supports speech-to-speech translation (101 to 36 languages), speech-to-text translation (from 101 to 96 languages), text-to-speech translation (from 96 to 36 languages), text-to-text translation (96 languages) and automatic speech recognition (96 languages). Built using a new multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations and other publicly available data, SEAMLESSM4T is one of the first multilingual systems that can translate from and into English for both speech and text. Moreover, it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art cascaded systems, achieving up to 8% and 23% higher BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores in speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks, respectively. Beyond quality, when tested for robustness, our system is, on average, approximately 50% more resilient against background noise and speaker variations in speech-to-text tasks than the previous state-of-the-art systems. We evaluated SEAMLESSM4T on added toxicity and gender bias to assess translation safety. For the former, we included two strategies for added toxicity mitigation working at either training or inference time. Finally, all contributions in this work are publicly available for non-commercial use to propel further research on inclusive speech translation technologies. SEAMLESSM4T is a single machine translation tool that supports speech-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation and automatic speech recognition between up to 100 languages."

 The ventrolateral pallial (VLp) excitatory neurons in the claustro-amygdalar complex and piriform cortex (PIR; which forms part of the palaeocortex) form reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), integrating cognitive and sensory information that results in adaptive behaviours1–5. Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders4–8, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Here we reveal that the transcription factors SOX4, SOX11 and TFAP2D have a pivotal role in the development, identity and PFC connectivity of these excitatory neurons. The absence of SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic excitatory neurons results in a marked reduction in the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum (CLA) and PIR. These transcription factors control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including in humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing excitatory neurons of BLC, CLA, PIR and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. Although the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat-response behaviours, differences emerge in the phenotypes at different Tfap2d dosages, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and BLC–PFC connectivity. This underscores the importance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC–PFC connectivity and behavioural modifications that resemble symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial VLp excitatory neurons and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.

 The zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) interferes with memory maintenance and long-term potentiation (LTP)1 when administered to mice. However, mice lacking its putative target, protein kinase PKMζ, exhibit normal learning and memory as well as LTP2,3, making the mechanism of ZIP unclear. Here we show that ZIP disrupts LTP by removing surface AMPA receptors through its cationic charge alone. This effect requires endophilin-A2-mediated endocytosis and is fully blocked by drugs suppressing macropinocytosis. ZIP and other cationic peptides remove newly inserted AMPA receptor nanoclusters at potentiated synapses, providing a mechanism by which these peptides erase memories without altering basal synaptic function. When delivered in vivo, cationic peptides can modulate memories on local and brain-wide scales, and these mechanisms can be leveraged to prevent memory loss in a model of traumatic brain injury. Our findings uncover a previously unknown synaptic mechanism by which memories are maintained or lost. Elucidation of the mechanism by which zeta inhibitory peptide erases memories, involving endocytosis of AMPA receptors on potentiated synapses, provides insight into more general mechanisms of memory maintenance and response to traumatic brain injury."

 After a long-distance migration, Avars with Eastern Asian ancestry arrived in Eastern Central Europe in 567 to 568 ce and encountered groups with very different European ancestry1,2. We used ancient genome-wide data of 722 individuals and fine-grained interdisciplinary analysis of large seventh- to eighth-century ce neighbouring cemeteries south of Vienna (Austria) to address the centuries-long impact of this encounter1,2. We found that even 200 years after immigration, the ancestry at one site (Leobersdorf) remained dominantly East Asian-like, whereas the other site (Mödling) shows local, European-like ancestry. These two nearby sites show little biological relatedness, despite sharing a distinctive late-Avar culture3,4. We reconstructed six-generation pedigrees at both sites including up to 450 closely related individuals, allowing per-generation demographic profiling of the communities. Despite different ancestry, these pedigrees together with large networks of distant relatedness show absence of consanguinity, patrilineal pattern with female exogamy, multiple reproductive partnerships (for example, levirate) and direct correlation of biological connectivity with archaeological markers of social status. The generation-long genetic barrier was maintained by systematically choosing partners with similar ancestry from other sites in the Avar realm. Leobersdorf had more biological connections with the Avar heartlands than with Mödling, which is instead linked to another site from the Vienna Basin with European-like ancestry. Mobility between sites was mostly due to female exogamy pointing to different marriage networks as the main driver of the maintenance of the genetic barrier.

 Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H2 in a CO2-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H2 was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H2 outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H2 fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥105 years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO2 via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

 Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is crucial for maternal to zygotic transition at the 2-8-cell stage in order to overcome silencing of genes and enable transcription from the zygotic genome. In humans, ZGA is induced by DUX4, a pioneer factor that drives expression of downstream germline-specific genes and retroelements. Here we show that herpesviruses from all subfamilies, papillomaviruses and Merkel cell polyomavirus actively induce DUX4 expression to promote viral transcription and replication. Analysis of single-cell sequencing data sets from patients shows that viral DUX4 activation is of relevance in vivo. Herpes-simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate early proteins directly induce expression of DUX4 and its target genes, which mimics zygotic genome activation. Upon HSV-1 infection, DUX4 directly binds to the viral genome and promotes viral transcription. DUX4 is functionally required for infection, since genetic depletion by CRISPR/Cas9 as well as degradation of DUX4 by nanobody constructs abrogates HSV-1 replication. Our results show that DNA viruses including herpesviruses mimic an embryonic-like transcriptional program that prevents epigenetic silencing of the viral genome and facilitates herpesviral gene expression.

 Topological phases have prevailed across diverse disciplines, spanning electronics, photonics, and acoustics. Hitherto, the understanding of these phases has centred on energy (frequency) bandstructures, showcasing topological boundary states at spatial interfaces. Recent strides have uncovered a unique category of bandstructures characterised by gaps in momentum, referred to as momentum bandgaps or k gaps, notably driven by breakthroughs in photonic time crystals. This discovery hints at abundant topological phases defined within momentum bands, alongside a wealth of topological boundary states in the time domain. Here, we report the experimental observation of k-gap topology in a large-scale optical temporal synthetic lattice, manifesting as temporal topological boundary states. These boundary states are uniquely situated at temporal interfaces between two subsystems with distinct k-gap topology. Counterintuitively, despite the exponential amplification of k-gap modes within both subsystems, these topological boundary states exhibit decay in both temporal directions [i.e., with energy growing (decaying) before (after) the temporal interfaces]. Our findings mark a significant pathway for delving into k gaps, temporal topological states, and time-varying physics.

 Regulating carbon hybridization states lies at the heart of engineering carbon materials with tailored properties but orchestrating the sequential transition across three states has remained elusive. Here, we visiualize stepwise evolution in carbon hybridizations from sp³ to sp² and to sp states via dehydrogenation and elimination reactions of methylcyano-functionalized molecules on surfaces. Utilizing scanning probing microscopy, we distinguish three distinct carbon-carbon bond types within polymers induced by annealing at elevated temperatures. Density-functional-theory calculations unveil the pivotal role of the electron-withdrawing cyano group in activating neighboring methylene to form C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds, and in facilitating subsequent stepwise HCN eliminations to realize the transformation across three carbon-carbon bond types. We also demonstrate the applicability of this strategy on one-dimensional molecular wires and two-dimensional covalent organic framework on different substrates. Our work expands the scope of carbon hybridization evolution and serves as an advance in flexibly engineering carbon-material by employing cyanomethyl-substituted molecules.

 Phosphorus in crucial for all living organisms. In vertebrate, cellular phosphate homeostasis is partly controlled by XPR1, a poorly characterized inositol pyrophosphate-dependent phosphate exporter. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human XPR1, which forms a loose dimer with 10 transmembrane helices (TM) in each protomer. The structure consists of a scaffold domain (TM1, TM3-4) and a core domain (TM2, TM5-10) structurally related to ion-translocating rhodopsins. Bound phosphate is observed in a tunnel within the core domain at a narrow point that separates the tunnel into intracellular and extracellular vestibules. This site contains a cluster of basic residues that coordinate phosphate and a conserved W573 essential for export function. Loss of inositol pyrophosphate binding is accompanied by structural movements in TM9 and the W573 sidechain, closing the extracellular vestibule and blocking phosphate export. These findings provide insight into XPR1 mechanism and pave the way for further in-depth XPR1 studies. XPR1 is the only known organic phosphate exporter.

 Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are advancing to become the frontrunner candidates for the next generation of lighting and display technologies. However, despite rapid technical development, a thorough understanding of PeLEDs’ environmental and economic impacts—essential information for future commercialization—is currently lacking. Here we assess the environmental and economic performance of 18 representative PeLEDs, aiming to identify effective industrial techniques to develop sustainable PeLEDs from a life-cycle perspective. We find that, like mature organic LEDs, PeLEDs show excellent environmental performance. In addition, we demonstrate that lead is not a major source of toxicity from PeLEDs. We estimate that, to commercialize PeLEDs and improve their sustainability, their lifetime should reach the order of 10,000 hours to compensate for the relative environmental impacts. The techno-economic assessment indicates that the cost of future PeLEDs will probably be in the vicinity of US$100 m–2, comparable to that of commercial organic LED panels.

 Climate change is considered to affect wildfire spread both by increasing fuel dryness and by altering vegetation mass and structure. However, the direct effect of global warming on wildfires is hard to quantify due to the multiple non-climatic factors involved in their ignition and spread. By combining wildfire observations with the latest generation of climate models, here we show that more than half of the large wildfires (area>500 ha) occurring in the Iberian Peninsula between 2001 and 2021 present a significant increase in the rate of spread with respect to what it would have been in the pre-industrial period, attributable to global warming.

 Air pollution impacts on human health are of serious concern in northern India, and over the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) in particular. The Kharif crop residue burning (CRB) is often blamed for degradation of Delhi-NCR’s seasonal air quality. However, the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remained stable in Delhi, while the fire detection counts (FDCs) from satellites over Punjab and Haryana declined by 50% or more during 2015–2023. We measured PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO) and related parameters over Delhi-NCR, Haryana and Punjab from a network of 30 low-cost sensors (CUPI-Gs) in a selected period (September–November) of 2022 and 2023. Measured PM2.5 showed lower concentration in 2023 compared to 2022 at Punjab and Haryana sites, in compliance with FDC reductions. Using the CUPI-G measurements, airmass trajectories, particle dispersion and chemical-transport model simulations, we show that the CRB emissions over Punjab contributed only a meagre ~14% to the overall PM2.5 over Delhi-NCR during October-November 2022. This indicates that there exists only a very weak coupling between PM2.5 mass over Delhi-NCR and the CRB over Punjab, highlighting the effectiveness of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in controlling air pollution in the region."

 The Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) is among the most productive volcanoes of the Mediterranean area. However, the volcanic history preceding the VEI 7 Campanian Ignimbrite eruption (~40 ka) is still poorly constrained. Here, we use a tephra dispersal model to reconstruct the eruption source parameters of the Maddaloni/X-6 eruption (~109 ka), one of the most widespread Late Pleistocene Mediterranean marker tephra from Campi Flegrei. Our results suggest that the eruption was characterized by an early Plinian phase involving ~6 cubic kilometers (within the range of 3–21 cubic kilometers) of magma, followed by a co-ignimbrite phase erupting ~148 cubic kilometers (range of 60–300 cubic kilometers). This ranks the Maddaloni/X-6 as a high-magnitude (M7.6) eruption, resulting at least as the second largest known event from Campi Flegrei.

 Foliage, wood (i.e., trunk, branch), ground, and lower objects (i.e., grass, shrubs), are key semantic components of forests that play different roles in the forest ecosystem. For understanding forest ecosystem structure and function, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud is a valuable form of remote sensing observation. The understanding intensively relies on precisely performing semantic segmentation task to segment semantic components from forest point cloud data. However, the semantic segmentation of massive point cloud data from forest scenes remains a significant challenge. The forest environment is highly heterogeneous and complex due to tree species and terrain conditions. Different climate zones lead to varying canopy characteristics and the diversity of LiDAR platforms delivers inconsistent point cloud properties. Heuristic approaches and conventional machine learning approaches inevitably suffer from poor generalization. Additionally, most deep learning methods lack a dedicated network design to address the characteristics of forests. This paper introduces Sen-net, a point cloud understanding network specifically constructed for semantic component segmentation of forest scene point cloud. Sen-net implements three modules tailored for forest characteristics. First, a spatial context enhancement module (SCEM) is designed for providing both global and dataset-level perspectives to mine geometric information and robust features hidden in heterogeneous forest. Second, a semantic-driven detail enrichment module (SDEM) is incorporated to preserve rich geometric details and semantic information thereby enhancing the learning of complex structures in the forests. Finally, an adaptive guidance flow (AGF) is added to seamlessly fuse the semantic and detailed features. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on both self-built Lin3D dataset and public datasets. Sen-net achieved an OA of 97.6 % and 85.1 % MIoU on the Lin3D dataset, and an OA of 94.5 % and 78.2 % MIoU on the public dataset FOR-instance. Results show that Sen-net outperformed the representative forest scene point cloud semantic segmentation approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning networks, and it has the potential to generalize to point cloud data collected by LiDAR from other platforms. It is concluded that Sen-net is a powerful and robust framework with substantial potential for being widely and deeply explored in forest ecosystem studies."

 The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), equipped with the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS), utilizes an innovative photon-counting LiDAR technique to conduct precise global elevation measurements. While it offers significant advantages in surface elevation retrieval, its performance can be compromised by substantial multiple scattering in highly scattering turbid media, leading to surface elevation deviations. Despite this issue, the mechanisms and effective algorithms to address the impact of multiple scattering in photon-counting LiDAR data have remained largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this study employs the DART-Lux model to simulate the photon-counting LiDAR signals, incorporating laser multiple scattering, and conducts a comprehensive analysis of its effect on photon spatial distribution and surface elevation retrieval. Additionally, a novel method based on the photon distribution characteristics is proposed to remove multiple scattering photons for surface elevation retrieval in highly scattering turbid media, which combines 2D Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with adaptive classification threshold. Experimental results reveal that multiple scattering photons predominantly accumulate below the surface, with photon density decreasing as elevation declines. This causes a downward shift in the elevation density peak, resulting in surface elevation underestimation. The proposed method in this study effectively mitigates the impact of multiple scattering, a challenge that conventional surface extraction algorithms struggle to address. Through analyzing the surface types in different scenarios including day/night and strong/weak beams, the results indicate that our proposed method outperforms other methods, with an average bias of 0.009 m, MAE of 0.032 m, RMSE of 0.059 m, and R2 of 0.990. Our method demonstrates high robustness and precision, particularly over land ice. In summary, this study is the first to not only analyze the impact of multiple scattering on the spatial distribution of photons and surface elevation retrieval, but also provide an effective method for separating multiple scattering photons in photon-counting LiDAR data."

 The Mountain Excavation and City Construction project (MECC) in Yan’an New District (YND) on the Chinese Loess Plateau is one of the largest geotechnical works globally. Ground deformation resulting from these extensive earthworks continues to evolve spatially and temporally even after construction is completed. Monitoring this deformation is crucial for understanding uneven post-construction subsidence and ensuring the structural integrity of infrastructure. This study proposes a framework for monitoring and predicting post-construction ground settlement (PCGS) using a dual-polarization Multi-temporal InSAR method (dual-pol MT-InSAR) and Self-Attention Memory Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (SAM-ConvLSTM) model. Compared to single-polarization (single-pol) MT-InSAR methods, the dual-pol MT-InSAR approach, which utilizes both polarization channels of Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data, achieves a 24 % increase in Permanent Scatterer (PS) density for PS-InSAR and improves average coherence while reducing coherence standard deviation for Small Baseline Subset (SBAS). The study further examines the factors contributing to uneven ground deformation, including fill and excavation activities (e.g., the thickness and geotechnical properties of loess), construction activities and surface loads, and precipitation. A consolidation settlement model is employed to simulate and assess ground settlement decay due to loess compaction. Based on this analysis, the most affected area in Qiaoergou is selected for spatiotemporal forecasting using MT-InSAR measurements and the SAM-ConvLSTM model. The results indicate that regions with significant subsidence form a characteristic funnel shape, with subsidence increasing over time and the deformation perimeter expanding outward. The model achieved an average absolute error of 1.6 mm, with the majority of errors concentrated within 5 mm."

 Floods induced by rainstorm events (RSEs) are among the most frequent natural disasters and have a significant impact on ecosystems and human society. While most extensive researches have investigated the magnitude, frequency, and risk of floods, understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of contiguous flood-causing rainstorm events remains largely unexplored in China. Here, we collected historical flood disaster data from the Statistical Yearbook, news reports, and government sources and examined the evolution patterns of spatiotemporally contiguous flood-causing RSEs across China from 2000 to 2020, utilizing the connected component three-dimensional algorithm. Our results indicate that floods mostly occur in southern China (SC), followed by northern China (NC), with less frequency in northwestern China (NWC) and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (TP). The flood-causing RSEs tend to occur with longer durations and higher magnitudes in SC and NC, while in NWC and TP, they are primarily characterized by short-term precipitation processes with lower magnitudes. Moreover, the flood-causing RSEs exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns in different subregions. In NWC and TP, RSEs generally move eastward and southeastward, with relatively longer lifespans, traveling longer distances at faster moving speeds, but covering smaller areal extent and lower accumulated rainfall amounts. In contrast, in both SC and NC, flood-causing rainstorm events are mainly moved in two directions, namely westwards and eastwards. These events have shorter average lifespans, and travel shorter moving distances at slower moving speeds, but have a larger areal extent and huge accumulated rainfall amounts. Our findings significantly enhance our understanding of flood-causing rainstorm characteristics in China."

Reef habitats with the greatest benefits are shallow, nearshore, and fronting low-lying, vulnerable communities, which are often where reef impacts and loss are the greatest.

We show that small amphiphiles can be used to tune friction, haptics, and triboelectric properties by assembling into specific conformations on the surfaces of materials. Molecules that form multiple slip planes under pressure, especially through π-π stacking, produce 80 to 90% lower friction than those that form disordered mesostructures. We propose a scaling framework for their friction reduction properties that accounts for adhesion and contact mechanics. Amphiphile-coated surfaces tend to resist wear and generate distinct tactile perception, with humans preferring more slippery materials. Separately, triboelectric output is enhanced through the use of amphiphiles with high electron affinity. Because device adoption is tied to both friction reduction and electron-withdrawing potential, molecules that self-organize into slippery planes under pressure represent a facile way to advance the development of haptic power harvesters at scale."

In this study, we found that μ-opioid signals in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activate the descending pain inhibitory system to initiate placebo analgesia in neuropathic pain rats. Chemogenetic manipulation demonstrated that specific activation of μ-opioid receptor–positive (MOR+) neurons in the mPFC or suppression of the mPFC–ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) circuit inhibited placebo analgesia in rats. MOR+neurons in the mPFC are monosynaptically connected and directly inhibit layer V pyramidal neurons that project to the vlPAG via GABAAreceptors. Thus, intrinsic opioid signaling in the mPFC disinhibits excitatory outflow to the vlPAG by suppressing MOR+neurons, leading to descending pain inhibitory system activation that initiates placebo analgesia. Our results shed light on the fundamental neurobiological mechanism of the placebo effect that maximizes therapeutic efficacy and reduces adverse drug effects in medical practice."

We identified CeANpbwr1neurons, a population in central amygdala expressing neuropeptide B/W receptor-1 (NPBWR1), that play a critical role in these interactions. CeANpbwr1neurons were activated during encounters with unfamiliar, but not with familiar, mice. Manipulations of CeANpbwr1neurons showed that their excitation is essential for maintaining physical interactions with novel conspecifics. Activation of CeANpbwr1neurons alleviated social deficits induced by chronic social defeat stress, suggesting therapeutic potential. Conversely, overexpression of humanNPBWR1in CeANpbwr1neurons reduced activity of these neurons and impaired social interactions with unfamiliar mice. This effect was absent in a polymorphic variant of the human NPBWR1 gene (404A>T). These findings highlight how CeANpbwr1neurons promote social novelty seeking and reveal a complex interplay betweenNPBWR1genetic variations and social behavior."

However, predicting these interactions from genome sequences is notoriously difficult. Here, we developed bioinformatic tools to predict whether secreted iron-scavenging siderophores stimulate or inhibit the growth of community members. Siderophores are chemically diverse and can be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on whether bacteria have or lack corresponding uptake receptors. We focused on 1928 representativePseudomonasgenomes and developed an experimentally validated coevolution algorithm to match encoded siderophore synthetases to corresponding receptor groups. We derived community-level iron interaction networks to show that siderophore-mediated interactions differ across habitats and lifestyles. Specifically, dense networks of siderophore sharing and competition were observed among environmental and nonpathogenic species, while small, fragmented networks occurred among human-associated and pathogenic species.

Here, using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing techniques, we studied the role of ESX-1 in MNP heterogeneity and response in mice and murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM). We found that ESX-1 is required for MTB to recruit diverse MNP subsets with high MTB burden. Further, MTB induces a transcriptional signature of immune evasion in lung macrophages and BMDM in an ESX-1–dependent manner. Spatial transcriptomics revealed an up-regulation of permissive features within MTB lesions, where monocyte-derived macrophages concentrate near MTB-infected cells.

InDrosophila, slower development at lower temperatures results in higher brain connectivity, but the generality of such scaling across temperatures and brain regions and its impact on function are unclear. Here, we show that brain connectivity scales continuously across temperatures, in agreement with a first-principle model that postulates different metabolic constraints for the growth of the brain and the organism. The model predicts brain wiring under temperature cycles and the nonuniform temporal scaling of neural development across temperatures. Developmental temperature has notable effects on odor-driven behavior. Dissecting the circuit architecture and function of neurons in the olfactory pathway, we demonstrate that developmental temperature does not alter odor encoding in first- and second-order neurons, but it shifts the specificity of connections onto third-order neurons that mediate innate behaviors. We conclude that while some circuit computations are robust to the effects of developmental temperature on wiring, others exhibit phenotypic plasticity with possible adaptive advantages."

Notably, a comprehensive examination of the TCGA validated FOXP3E2 as an independent prognostic marker in all other BC subtypes. We found that FOXP3E2 expression underlies BCs with defective mismatch repair and a stem-like signature and highlights pathways involved in tumor survival.

Davies,"Cryptic coral diversity is associated with symbioses, physiology, and response to thermal challenge","Coral persistence in the Anthropocene depends on interactions among holobiont partners (coral animals and microbial symbionts) and their environment. Cryptic coral lineages—genetically distinct yet morphologically similar groups—are critically important as they often exhibit functional diversity relevant to thermal tolerance. In addition, environmental parameters such as thermal variability may promote tolerance, but how variability interacts with holobiont partners to shape responses to thermal challenge remains unclear. Here, we identified three cryptic lineages ofSiderastrea sidereain Bocas del Toro, Panamá that differ in distributions across inshore and offshore reefs, microbial associations, phenotypic traits of holobiont partners (i.e., phenomes), and skeleton morphologies. A thermal variability experiment failed to increase thermal tolerance, but subsequent thermal challenge and recovery revealed that one lineage maintained elevated energetic reserves, photochemical efficiency, and growth. Last, coral cores highlighted that this lineage also exhibited greater growth historically. Functional variation among cryptic lineages highlights their importance in predicting coral reef responses to climate change."

Gu,A tunable metamaterial microwave absorber inspired by chameleon’s color-changing mechanism,"A metamaterial absorber capable of swiftly altering its electromagnetic response in the microwave range offers adaptability to changing environments, such as tunable stealth capabilities. Inspired by the chameleon’s ability to change color through the structural transformation of photonic lattice crystals, which shift the bandgaps of reflection and transmission of visible light, we designed a crisscross structure that transforms from an expanded to a collapsed form. This transformation enables a switch between broadband absorption and peak transmission in the microwave range (4 to 18 gigahertz). The structure, optimized through data-driven design, is mechanically actuated by the rotation of interlinked trusses. This mechanism changes the entire array’s response, allowing it to remain undetected by an external radar or to transmit an internal radar signal to a near-field receiver when needed. The mechanical actuation and the shifting electromagnetic response of the arrayed structure are demonstrated."

Around 12,900 years before present (B.P.), the Atlantic-European realm experienced an abrupt relapse to near-glacial climate conditions attributed to Arctic meltwater fluxes, the Younger Dryas. However, it remained unclear how fast this climatic change propagated southward into Europe as terrestrial and ice-core chronologies are not sufficiently synchronized. Here, we use a volcanic sulfur spike identified in a speleothem from Germany to link the Laacher See eruption (LSE), a key chronostratigraphic marker in European terrestrial archives, to a previously unidentified sulfate spike in the Greenland ice-core record. The LSE, dated to 13,008 ± 8 years B.P.1950, thus synchronizes radiometric and ice-core calendars back in time, which consistently demonstrates that the LSE predates the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling by about 150 years, both in Greenland and Europe."

However, the mass diffusion is yet substantially limited by the confined surface of the support in comparison to homogeneous catalysis. Here, we demonstrate that cylindrical micellar brushes with highly solvated poly(2-vinylpyridine) coronas can immobilize 33 types of metal single atoms with 8.3 to 40.9 weight % contents on conventional electrodes under ambient conditions. This is favored by the forest-like hierarchically open soft structure of the micellar brushes and the dynamic coordination between the metals and the pyridine groups. It was found that the nanoforests of individual noble metal single atoms can be well solvated in an aqueous electrolyte to comprehensively expose the atomic active sites and the nanoforest of Pt single atoms on nickel foam reveals high electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution. The micellar brush support also enables the simultaneous anchoring of multiple single atoms on the cathode of an anion-exchange membrane electrolyzer for long-term stable water electrolysis."

Here, we report the experimental demonstration of enhanced broadband absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated time-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear time-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the frequency–wave vector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by breaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a periodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a secondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable, antireflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide insights into enhanced wave absorption in time-varying scenarios and may enable the development of devices operating in a regime fundamentally beyond the reach of linear time-invariant systems."

We use a large new dataset on mayoral elections and three different modern causal inference research designs (a regression discontinuity design centered around close elections and two robust difference-in-differences methods) to determine the causal effect of mayoral partisanship on crime, arrests, and racial differences in arrest patterns in medium and large US cities. We find no evidence that mayoral partisanship affects police employment or expenditures, police force or leadership demographics, overall crime rates, or numbers of arrests. At the same time, we find some suggestive evidence that mayoral partisanship may modestly affect the racial composition of arrests. Overall, the results from our multimethod analyses indicate that local partisan politics has little causal impact on crime and policing."

Here, we recognize five valid outside-Tibet records of the snow leopard lineage. Our results suggest that the snow leopard dispersed out of the Tibetan Plateau multiple times during the Quaternary. The osteological anatomy of the modern snow leopard shows adaptation to the steep slope and, to a lesser extent, cold/high-altitude environment. Fossils and phylogeny suggest that the snow leopard experienced a gradual strengthening of such adaptation, especially since the Middle Pleistocene (~0.8 million years). Species distribution modeling suggests that the locations of the fossil sites are not within most suitable area, and we argue that local landscape features are more influential factors than temperature and altitude alone. Our study underscores the importance of integrating morphology, fossil records, and species distribution modeling, to comprehensively understand the evolution, ecology, and inform conservation strategies for endangered species."

ATB NPs by stereotactic injection target dopamine neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors in the substantia nigra. Upon pulsed near-infrared irradiation, ATB NPs, serving as nanoantennae, convert the light into heat, leading to calcium ion influx, depolarization, and action potentials in dopamine neurons through TRPV1 receptors. Simultaneously, β-synuclein peptides released from ATB NPs cooperate with chaperone-mediated autophagy initiated by heat shock protein, HSC70, to effectively eliminate α-synuclein fibrils in neurons. These orchestrated actions restored pathological dopamine neurons and locomotor behaviors of Parkinson’s disease."
