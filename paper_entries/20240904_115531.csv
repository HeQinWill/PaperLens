Analyses of the interactions between flood risks and armed conflict are essential for developing effective policies and strategies to address both challenges. This study aims to develop conceptual and analytical socio-hydrological frameworks for assessing how armed conflict can impact flood risks. The frameworks postulate a link between armed conflict and flood vulnerability, given that armed conflict creates unique challenges that exacerbate the effects of floods. Our conceptual framework identifies routes through which armed conflict affects vulnerability to floods, such as damage to infrastructure, population displacement and density, weak governance, and less awareness, resulting in lower resilience, higher susceptibility, and increased flood vulnerability and risk. Our analytical framework uses flood modeling to evaluate flood hazards and incorporates spatial data related to armed conflict zones, nighttime light, population classification by age, land price, land cover, and rural/urban areas classification. We take Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, as a case study in view of its armed conflict that erupted in 2023. By highlighting the linkages between armed conflict and flood risk, this study contributes to conceptualizing the broader interlinkages between conflict and environmental systems. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating conflict analysis with disaster risk management strategies. We encourage collaboration between humanitarian, environmental, and security sectors to improve preparedness, response, and resilience in conflict-affected regions. While our analysis for Khartoum is based on conflict zones in the early stages of the conflict and uses simple estimates for conflict vulnerability contribution, the proposed frameworks provide groundwork for assessing changes in flood risk in Sudan and other conflict regions around the world."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7042,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是加拉帕戈斯群岛的食品环境对居民饮食的影响。研究者通过分析市场库存、价格和消费者行为，建立了地理食品环境和经验食品环境的指标，并探讨了这些指标与居民饮食质量之间的关系。研究发现，消费者在食品购物时优先考虑便利性会导致健康食品摄入量下降，而市场库存对饮食的影响取决于消费者如何应对食品环境。因此，论文强调了在制定食品系统变革措施时，需要考虑特定环境下的消费者行为。,[],Khristopher M Nicholas;Margaret E Bentley;Enrique Terán;Amanda L Thompson,Healthy eating in globalized food environments: market access and consumer behavior in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador,"Food environments are the interface between food systems and consumers. Although market access contributes to diet intake, consumer behavior determines food acquisition practices yet is often neglected in food environment research. Implementing sustainable food system transformations in climate-vulnerable, trade-dependent settings requires effective integration of both geographic and experienced-based measures of access. This study in the Galápagos Islands (i) develops measures for geographic and experience-based food environments (EFEs) and (ii) links diet outcomes to these food environment measures independently and when interacted. Cross-sectional household data including diet recalls come from 388 participants in the Healthy Family Study from San Cristóbal Island, Galápagos in 2018. Geocoded market inventory and price data were obtained in 2018 using the Nutritional Environment Measurement Survey for Stores (n = 60). Geographic food environments were created from market scores and distribution. EFEs were based on factor analyzed consumer behavior strategies. Diet quality was defined using the global dietary recommendations score. Adjusted linear regressions tested the relationships between diet and food environment measures and included sociodemographic covariates. Interactions between geographic and EFEs were tested. This study showed that higher prioritization of convenience when food shopping was associated with lower healthy food intake. However, the relationship between food environment measures and diet is strongly modified by consumer behavior. For convenience-prioritizing households, the nearest market proved most associated with healthy diet outcomes. For households with a food-driven purchasing strategy, the preferred market was most associated with healthy diet outcomes. These findings show that market inventory can be healthful or deleterious to diets, depending on how individuals navigate their food environments. Empirical measures of food access that neglect to consider consumer behavior may fail to capture realistic representations of food environment and diet relationships. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring food system changes to incorporate context-specific consumer behavior."

Nonetheless, the efficacy of proactive policies in ensuring equitable health protection in China’s Eastern Coastal Area (ECA) remains uncertain. Here, we employed an integrated assessment model to assess the combined reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and atmospheric pollutants and their health repercussions in the ECA of China. Our findings reveal that 273 000 premature deaths are attributable to air pollution in 2060 in the ECA in the absence of mitigation policies. Conversely, carbon reduction policies are poised to curtail 80% of CO2 emissions, alongside reductions of 76% for NOx, 79% for SO2, 80% for PM2.5, 72% for VOCs, and 66% for NH3 emissions. Air pollution control policies could mitigate premature deaths by 19 600, while carbon reduction policies could potentially lower them by 50 800. The health inequality coefficient among provinces stands at 0.19, primarily attributable to significantly higher mortality rates in Hebei and Shandong. These findings yield valuable insights for crafting synergistic abatement strategies in similarly imbalanced developmental regions grappling with comparable environmental challenges."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7278,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注越南Gianh河流域的气候变化、土地覆盖/土地利用变化对洪水和滑坡灾害的影响。研究使用了深度神经网络模型来评估和监测这些影响，并预测了未来不同时期的灾害风险。研究结果表明，虽然洪水影响区域预计会减少，但由于滑坡影响区域的扩大，整体灾害易发区域在2005-2050年间将会增加。该研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Huu Duy Nguyen;Dinh Kha Dang;Quoc-Huy Nguyen;Tan Phan-Van;Quang-Thanh Bui;Alexandru-Ionut Petrisor;Son Van Nghiem,"Monitoring the effects of climate, land cover and land use changes on multi-hazards in the Gianh River watershed, Vietnam","In recent decades, global rapid urbanization has exacerbated the impacts of natural hazards due to changes in Southeast Asia’s environmental, hydrological, and socio-economic conditions. Confounding non-stationary processes of climate change and global warming and their negative impacts can make hazards more complex and severe, particularly in Vietnam. Such complexity necessitates a study that can synthesize multi-dimensional natural-human factors in disaster risk assessments. This synthesis study aims to assess and monitor climate change and land-cover/land-use change impacts on flood and landslide hazards in Vietnam’s Gianh River basin. Three Deep Neural Network (DNN) and optimization algorithms, including the Adam, Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), and Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (DMOA) were used to determine the regions with the probability of the occurrence of flood and landslide and their combination. All efficiently evaluated hazard susceptibility based on a synthesis analysis encompassing 14 natural and anthropogenic conditioning factors. Of the three, the Deep Neural Network (DNN)-DMOA model performed the best for both flood and landslide susceptibility, with area-under-curve values of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively, followed by DNN-TSA (0.97 for flood, 0.92 for landslide), and DNN-Adam (0.96 for flood, 0.89 for landslide). Although the area affected by flooding is predicted to decrease, the overall trend for total hazard-prone areas increases over 2005–2050 due to the more extensive area affected by landslides. This study develop and demonstrate a robust framework to monitor multi-hazard susceptibility, taking into account the changes in climate and land-use influence the occurrence of multiple hazards. Based on the quantitative assessment, these findings can help policymakers understand and identify confounding hazard issues to develop proactive land-management approaches in effective mitigation or adaptation strategies that are spatially and temporally appropriate."
10.5194/acp-24-9733-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注了中国长江三角洲地区扬州在2021年夏季新冠疫情封锁期间，黑碳颗粒物（BCc）的特性变化。研究利用单颗粒气溶胶质谱仪（SPA-MS）分析了封锁期间和封锁前BCc颗粒物的大小、化学成分和来源。研究发现，封锁期间新鲜排放的BCc颗粒物比例显著下降，但PM2.5浓度却基本保持不变，这表明封锁期间BCc颗粒物的老化程度增加。研究还强调了区域传输对PM2.5污染的影响，并指出高湿度和低风速也对BCc颗粒物的生长和PM2.5浓度起着重要作用。研究结果表明，短期严格的本地排放控制可能无法有效降低PM污染，需要采取更全面的区域协调控制策略，以有效控制BCc颗粒物并降低PM2.5浓度。,"['air quality monitoring', 'black carbon', 'aerosol', 'satellite observations', 'PM2.5', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing']",Yuan Dai;Junfeng Wang;Houjun Wang;Shijie Cui;Yunjiang Zhang;Haiwei Li;Yun Wu;Ming Wang;Eleonora Aruffo;Xinlei Ge,"Measurement report: Characteristics of airborne black-carbon-containing particles during the 2021 summer COVID-19 lockdown in a typical Yangtze River Delta city, China","Short-term strict emission control can improve air quality, but its effectiveness needs assessment. During the 2021 summer COVID-19 lockdown in Yangzhou, we found that PM2.5 levels did not decrease despite reduced primary emissions. Aged black-carbon particles increased substantially due to higher O3 levels and transported pollutants. High humidity and low wind also played key roles. The results highlight the importance of a regionally balanced control strategy for future air quality management. 
 Black-carbon-containing (BCc) particles are ubiquitous in ambient air, significantly contributing to particulate matter (PM) pollution. The unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2021 prompted a localized and prolonged lockdown in Yangzhou, situated in the Yangtze River Delta, China. This lockdown led to significant alteration of local anthropogenic emissions, while neighboring cities continued regular operations, providing a unique opportunity for the investigation of BCc particle characteristics influenced by varying emission conditions. Single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPA-MS) analysis revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of freshly emitted BCc particles during the lockdown (LD) period. However, PM2.5 concentrations remained relatively unchanged, with an observed increase in the proportion of aged BCc particles during LD compared to the period before the lockdown (BLD). The study also underscores the significant role of regional transport in PM2.5 pollution during the campaign. Moreover, reactive trace gases (e.g., NOx, SO2, and volatile organic compounds – VOCs) could form thick coatings on pre-existing particles, likely via enhanced heterogeneous hydrolysis under high relative humidity (RH), resulting in significant BCc particle growth (∼ 600 nm), as well as PM2.5 concentration, during LD. Our study highlights that short-term, strict local emission controls may not effectively reduce PM pollution due to the complex production and transmission characteristics of BCc particles and the nonlinear responses of PM2.5 to its precursors. Achieving further effective PM2.5 reduction mandates a focus on nuanced control of BCc particles and necessitates a comprehensive and extensive approach with a regionally coordinated and balanced control strategy through joint regulation."

The performance of the on-site calibration procedures was evaluated, providing very good results. 
 To retrieve columnar intensive aerosol properties from sun–sky photometers, both irradiance and radiance calibration factors are needed. For the irradiance the solar calibration constant, V0, which denotes the instrument counts for a direct normal solar flux extrapolated to the top of the atmosphere, must be determined. The solid view angle, SVA, is a measure of the field of view of the instrument, and it is important for obtaining the radiance from sky diffuse irradiance measurements. Each of the three sun-photometer networks considered in the present study (SKYNET, AERONET, WMO GAW) adopts different protocols of calibration, and we evaluate the performance of the on-site calibration procedures, applicable to every kind of sun–sky photometer but tested in this analysis only on SKYNET Prede POM01 instruments, during intercomparison campaigns and laboratory calibrations held in the framework of the Metrology for Aerosol Optical Properties (MAPP) European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR) project. The on-site calibration, performed as frequently as possible (ideally monthly) to monitor changes in the device conditions, allows operators to track and evaluate the calibration status on a continuous basis, considerably reducing the data gaps incurred by the periodic shipments for performing centralized calibrations. The performance of the on-site calibration procedures for V0 was very good at sites with low turbidity, showing agreement with a reference calibration between 0.5 % and 1.5 % depending on wavelengths. In the urban area, the agreement decreases between 1.7 % and 2.5 %. For the SVA the difference varied from a minimum of 0.03 % to a maximum of 3.46 %."

Some clouds are composed of supercooled liquid water (SLW; water held in liquid form below 0 °C) and are difficult to forecast by models. We performed in situ observations of SLW clouds at Concordia Station using SLW sondes attached to meteorological balloons in summer 2021–2022. The SLW clouds were observed in a saturated layer at the top of the planetary boundary layer in agreement with ground-based lidar observations. 
 Clouds in Antarctica are key elements that affect radiative forcing and thus Antarctic climate evolution. Although the vast majority of clouds are composed of ice crystals, a non-negligible fraction constitutes supercooled liquid water (SLW; water held in liquid form below 0 °C). Numerical weather prediction models have great difficulty in forecasting SLW clouds over Antarctica, favouring ice at the expense of liquid water and therefore incorrectly estimating the cloud radiative forcing. Remote-sensing observations of SLW clouds have been carried out for several years at Concordia Station (75° S, 123° E; 3233 m above mean sea level), combining active lidar measurements (SLW cloud detection) and passive HAMSTRAD microwave measurements (liquid water path, LWP). The present project aimed at in situ observations of SLW clouds using sondes developed by the company Anasphere, specifically designed for SLW content (SLWC) measurements. These SLWC sondes were coupled to standard meteorological pressure–temperature–humidity sondes from Vaisala and released under meteorological balloons. During the 2021–2022 summer campaign, 15 launches were made, of which 7 were scientifically exploitable above a height of 400 m above ground level, a threshold height imposed by the time the SLWC sonde takes to stabilize after launch. The three main outcomes from our analyses are as follows: (a) the first in situ observations so far of SLW clouds in Antarctica with SLWC sondes; (b) on average, the consistency of SLW cloud heights as observed by in situ sondes and remote-sensing lidar; and (c) the liquid water path (vertically integrated SLWC) deduced by the sondes being generally equal to or greater than the LWP remotely sensed by HAMSTRAD. In general, the SLW clouds were observed in a layer close to saturation (U > 80 %) or saturated (U ∼ 100 %–105 %) just below or at the lowermost part of the entrainment zone, or capping inversion zone, which exists at the top of the planetary boundary layer and is characterized by an inflection point in the potential temperature vertical profile. Our results are consistent with the theoretical view that SLW clouds form and remain at the top of the planetary boundary layer."

Their observation in the middle atmosphere is challenging and rare, as it requires continuous measurements with a high temporal resolution. In this paper, temperature time series of a ground-based microwave radiometer were analyzed with a spectral filter to derive thermal tide amplitudes and phases in an altitude range of 25–50 km at the geographical locations of Payerne and Bern (Switzerland). 
 In recent decades, theoretical studies and numerical models of thermal tides have gained attention. It has been recognized that tides have a significant influence on the dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere; as they grow in amplitude and propagate upward, they transport energy and momentum from the lower to the upper atmosphere, contributing to the vertical coupling between atmospheric layers. The superposition of tides with other atmospheric waves leads to non-linear wave–wave interactions. However, direct measurements of thermal tides in the middle atmosphere are challenging and are often limited to satellite measurements in the tropics and at low latitudes. Due to orbit geometry, such observations provide only a reduced insight into the short-term variability in atmospheric tides. In this paper, we present tidal analysis from 5 years of continuous observations of middle-atmospheric temperatures. The measurements were performed with the ground-based temperature radiometer TEMPERA (TEMPErature RAdiometer), which was developed at the University of Bern in 2013 and was located in Bern (46.95° N, 7.45° E) and Payerne (46.82° N, 6.94° E). TEMPERA achieves a temporal resolution of 1–3 h and covers the altitude range between 25–50 km. Using an adaptive spectral filter with a vertical regularization (ASF2D) for the tidal analysis, we found maximum amplitudes for the diurnal tide of approximately 2.4 K, accompanied by seasonal variability. The maximum amplitude was reached on average at an altitude of 43 km, which also reflected some seasonal characteristics. We demonstrate that TEMPERA is suitable for providing continuous temperature soundings in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere with a sufficient cadence to infer tidal amplitudes and phases for the dominating tidal modes. Furthermore, our measurements exhibit a dominating diurnal tide and smaller amplitudes for the semidiurnal and terdiurnal tides in the stratosphere."

Each one showed potential for pollen identification, but the large variability between them needs to be addressed. 
 The study evaluated a new model of a Plair SA airflow cytometer, Rapid-E+, and assessed its suitability for airborne pollen monitoring within operational networks. Key features of the new model are compared with the previous one, Rapid-E. A machine learning algorithm is constructed and evaluated for (i) classification of reference pollen types in laboratory conditions and (ii) monitoring in real-life field campaigns. The second goal of the study was to evaluate the device usability in forthcoming monitoring networks, which would require similarity and reproducibility of the measurement signal across devices. We employed three devices and analysed (dis-)similarities of their measurements in laboratory conditions. The lab evaluation showed similar recognition performance to that of Rapid-E, but field measurements in conditions when several pollen types were present in the air simultaneously showed notably lower agreement of Rapid-E+ with manual Hirst-type observations than those of the older model. An exception was the total-pollen measurements. Comparison across the Rapid-E+ devices revealed noticeable differences in fluorescence measurements between the three devices tested. As a result, application of the recognition algorithm trained on the data from one device to another led to large errors. The study confirmed the potential of the fluorescence measurements for discrimination between different pollen classes, but each instrument needed to be trained individually to achieve acceptable skills. The large uncertainty of fluorescence measurements and their variability between different devices need to be addressed to improve the device usability."

However, the use of satellite data is usually conservative and imperfect. In this study, a better spatial representation of satellite observations is discussed and explored by a so-called footprint function or operator, highlighting its added value through a case study and diagnostics. 
 The microwave radiances are key observations, especially over data-sparse regions, for operational data assimilation in numerical weather prediction (NWP). An often applied simplification is that these observations are used as point measurements; however, the satellite field of view may cover many grid points of high-resolution models. Therefore, we examine a solution in high-resolution data assimilation to better account for the spatial representation of the radiance observations. This solution is based on a footprint operator implemented and tested in the variational assimilation scheme of the AROME-Arctic (Application of Research to Operations at MEsoscale – Arctic) limited-area model. In this paper, the design and technical challenges of the microwave radiance footprint operator are presented. In particular, implementation strategies, the representation of satellite field-of-view ellipses, and the emissivity retrieval inside the footprint area are discussed. Furthermore, the simulated brightness temperatures and the sub-footprint variability are analysed in a case study, indicating particular areas where the use of the footprint operator is expected to provide significant added value. For radiances measured by the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) sensors, the standard deviation of the observation minus background (OmB) departures is computed over a short period in order to compare the statistics of the default and the implemented footprint observation operator. For all operationally used AMSU-A and MHS tropospheric channels, it is shown that the standard deviation of OmB departures is reduced when the footprint operator is applied. For AMSU-A radiances, the reduction is around 1 % for high-peaking channels and about 4 % for low-peaking channels. For MHS data, this reduction is somewhere between 1 %–2 % by the footprint observation operator."

Anion-exchange resins (AERs) have long been employed for removing anionic contaminants from drinking water, but their performance for bacterial contamination is poor. Here, we develop a novel AER (AER6–1) with exceptional bactericidal effects and ultrafast adsorption rates of extracellular DNA (eDNA) (2.2- and 11.5-fold compared to other AERs) achieved through preloading quaternary ammonium groups (QAGs) with hexyl chain (−C6–N+−) on the resin exterior and successively grafting QAGs with a methyl chain (−C1–N+−) inside a resin pore. The AER6–1 outperforms other commercial AERs and ultraviolet disinfection, exhibiting superior elimination of total bacteria, potential pathogens (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), eDNA, and antibiotic resistance genes (mexF, mexB, and bacA) in actual drinking water, while maintaining a comparable anion exchange capacity with other commercial AERs. Theoretical calculations of density functional theory and xDLVO combined with XPS elucidate the crucial roles of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic force provided by the resin skeleton and −C6–N+– in cleaving the bacterial cell membrane and increasing the adsorption kinetics on eDNA. This study broadens the scope of AERs and highlights an effective way of simultaneously removing bacterial and anionic contaminants from drinking water."

To address this, the centrifugal force was innovatively adopted to enhance the coalescence and separation of immiscible fine droplets within the biphasic solvent. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that centrifugal phase-splitting shows outstanding separation efficiency (>95%) and excellent applicability for various solvents. Correlation analysis reveals a strong relationship between the rich phase’s viscosity, lean phase’s residual CO2, and the phase separation efficiency. The time-profile behavior of immiscible droplets, observed through microscope images of phase-splitting, enables the estimation of the growth and coalescence rates of the discrete phase. Industrial-scale process simulation for technical and economic analysis confirms that the total capture cost ($ 42.5/t CO2) can be reduced by ∼22% with the use of biphasic solvents and a centrifugal separator compared to conventional methods. This study introduces a fresh perspective on polarity-induced cluster generation and coagulation-induced separation, offering an effective solution to address the challenges associated with dynamic phase-splitting in biphasic solvents during practical applications."

To address the critical need for advanced thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide (PA) membranes with exceptional permselectivity and fouling resistance for emerging contaminant purification, we introduce a novel high-performance NF membrane. This membrane features a selective polypiperazine (PIP) layer functionalized with amino-containing quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) through an in situ interfacial polycondensation reaction. Our investigation demonstrated that precise QAC functionalization enabled the construction of the selective PA layer with increased surface area, enhanced microporosity, stronger electronegativity, and reduced thickness compared to the control PIP membrane. As a result, the QAC NF membrane exhibited an approximately 51% increase in water permeance compared to the control PIP membrane, while achieving superior retention capabilities for divalent salts (>99%) and emerging organic contaminants (>90%). Furthermore, the incorporation of QACs into the PIP selective layer was proved to be effective in mitigating mineral scaling by allowing selective passage of scale-forming cations, while simultaneously exhibiting strong antimicrobial properties to combat biofouling. The in situ QAC incorporation strategy presented in this study provides valuable guidelines for the fit-for-purpose design of the selective PA layer, which is crucial for the development of high-performance NF membranes for efficient water purification."

The polyamide active layer of the TFC membrane formed through interfacial polymerization and temperature control during the fabrication process plays an important role in membrane permeability-selectivity. However, the commonly used ambient temperature in membrane production workshops has not been studied systematically. Here, under an ambient temperature range from 10 to 25 °C, we fabricated polyamide layers on a free interface between the aqueous phase and organic phase and on the traditional PES support interface, respectively. We observed polyamide morphologies using the infrared thermal imager for the free interface and SEM for the support interface, respectively. We found that a minor change in ambient temperature could switch the polyamide from a ridge-like to bubble-like morphology. Moreover, with increasing the temperature of the fabrication process from 10 to 25 °C, the pure water permeance exhibited a decline of 38.94%, and the monodivalent selectivity presented a 12.04-fold increase. These findings highlight that the daily ambient temperature of membrane-based enterprises should be fully considered and reasonably used to decrease the production costs in both initial site selection and membrane production stability. Additionally, the permeability-selectivity of the TFC membrane could be tailored through temperature control in a membrane production workshop."

Among other parameters, inorganic particle and gas-phase species were alternatingly measured in the gym’s supply duct and weight room. The Indoor Model of Aerosols, Gases, Emissions, and Surfaces (IMAGES) uses the inorganic aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium model, ISORROPIA, to estimate the partitioning of inorganic aerosols and corresponding gases. In this study herein, measurements from the ATHLETIC campaign were used to evaluate IMAGES’ performance. Ammonia emission rates, nitric acid deposition, and particle deposition velocities were related to observed occupancy, which informed these rates in IMAGES runs. Initially, modeled indoor inorganic aerosol concentrations were not in good agreement with measurements. A parametric investigation revealed that lowering the temperature or raising the relative humidity used in the ISORROPIA model drove the semivolatile species more toward the particle phase, substantially improving modeled-measured agreement. One speculated reason for these solutions is that aerosol water was enhanced by increasing the RH or decreasing the temperature. Another is that thermodynamic equilibrium was not established in this indoor setting or that the thermodynamic parametrizations in ISORROPIA are less accurate for typical indoor settings. This result suggests that applying ISORROPIA indoors requires further careful experimental validation."

Our results show that the segmented slab due to faulting and grain‐size reduction may further break off and stack over itself as it encounters the high‐viscosity lower mantle. Stacked slabs slowly sink in the lower mantle, while periodic slab tearing hinders upward stress transmission, allowing shallow plates to subduct at a higher rate. This discovered mode also provides an alternative explanation for slab thickening in the lower mantle."

In this study, we propose a new air‐sea heat flux parameterization using a physical‐informed neural network (PINN) based on multiple observational data sets worldwide. Evaluated with an independent observation data set, it is shown that the PINN can significantly reduce the RMSE of latent heat flux by at least about 48.6% compared to three traditional bulk formulas. Moreover, the PINN can be flexibly updated with new observational data by transfer learning. To test the performance of the new parameterization in realistic application, we implement the PINN into a global ocean‐atmosphere coupled model and make seasonal forecasts for the first time. The PINN markedly reduce the errors of equatorial SST forecast, indicating a good performance of the PINN‐based air‐sea turbulent heat flux scheme. Noticeably, due to limited observational data, the NN‐based parameterizations tend to underestimate heat flux at high wind speeds compared with bulk formula‐based parameterizations. With more data available at extreme conditions, the PINN can be improved via transfer learning and need to be futher evaluated. This study suggests that PINN‐based air‐sea heat flux parameterization is promising to improve SST simulation."

However, responses of various types of HWs (i.e., dry HWs, only high Td; humid HWs, only high Tw; hybrid HWs, both high Td and Tw; total HWs, high Td or Tw), to ACC and urbanization remain unknown. In this study, both observations and simulations show significantly increasing occurrence probability of total HWs over China during 1971–2020, whereas this increase is mainly reflected in hybrid HWs, followed by dry HWs and humid HWs. 68.2%–93.0% of the observed increases in the above four types of HWs can be attributed to ACC; on the other hand, urbanization tends to suppress humid HWs but enhance dry HWs, as a result of contributing to the increase of hybrid HWs by 10.9%. Under future ACC, total HWs are projected to be more frequent as expected, which is mainly sourced from the increasing hybrid HWs because dry/humid HWs are projected to be steady/downward. As a consequence, urban population exposure to ACC‐induced total HWs would remarkably increase to 83.55 billion person‐days by the 2090s, 89.5% of which can be attributed to hybrid HWs. Urbanization would amplify this population exposure of ACC‐induced hybrid HWs from 74.79 billion person‐days to 110.9 billion person‐days. Our results underscore the importance of improving understanding of hybrid HWs in urban areas and developing targeted adaptation planning on a warmer planet."

The future trajectory of wetlands is anticipated to be influenced not only by direct human activities, but also by climate change. Here we present our assessment of climate‐driven global changes in wetlands extent, focusing on the main wetland complexes. We used an approach based on the Topographic Hydrological model (TOPMODEL) and soil liquid water content projections from 14 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Our analysis reveals a consistent decrease in wetlands extent in the Mediterranean, Central America, and northern South America, with a substantial loss of 28% in the western Amazon Basin for the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) under the SSP370 scenario. Conversely, Central Africa exhibits an increase in wetlands extent, except in the Congo Basin. Nevertheless, most of the areas studied (80%) present uncertain results, due to conflicting projections of changes between the models. Notably, we show that there is significant uncertainty among CMIP6 models regarding liquid soil water content in high latitudes. By narrowing our focus to 10 models, which seem to better represent the thawing of permafrost, we obtain a better inter‐model agreement. We then find a modest declines in the overall global area (<5%), but an average loss of 13% beyond 50°N. Specific areas like the Hudson Bay Lowlands experiencing a 21% decrease and the Western Siberian Lowlands a 15% decrease."

However, it is not well understood how the compound heatwave, extreme precipitation, and flash drought events will likely change, and how global population, agriculture, and forest will likely be exposed to these compound events under future climate change scenarios. This research uses eight CMIP6 climate models to assess the current and future global compound climate extreme events, as well as population, agriculture, and forestry exposures to these events, under two climate scenarios, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), SSP1‐2.6 and SSP5‐8.5 for three time periods: early‐, mid‐, and late‐ 21st century. Climate extremes are derived for heatwaves, extreme precipitation, and flash droughts using locational‐dependent thresholds. We find that compound heatwaves and flash drought events result in the largest increases in exposure of populations, agriculture, and forest lands, under SSP5‐8.5 late‐century projections of sequential heatwaves and flash droughts. Late‐century projections of sequential heatwaves and flash droughts show hot spots of exposure increases in population exposure greater than 50 million person‐events in China, India, and Europe; increases in agriculture land exposures greater than 90 thousand km2‐events in China, South America, and Oceania; and increase in forest land exposure greater than 120 thousand km2‐events in Oceania and South America regions when compared to the historical period.

Trends of PM2.5 in urban and rural census tracts between 2010 and 2019 were assessed alongside sociodemographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, poverty, and age. For 2010, we identified 13,474 rural tracts and 59,065 urban tracts. In 2019, 13,462 were rural and 59,055 urban. Urban tracts had significantly higher PM2.5 concentrations than rural tracts during this period. Levels of PM2.5 were lower in rural tracts compared to urban and fell more rapidly in rural than urban. Rural tract annual means for 2010 and 2019 were 8.51 [2.24] μg/m3 and 6.41 [1.29] μg/m3, respectively. Urban tract annual means for 2010 and 2019 were 9.56 [2.04] μg/m3 and 7.51 [1.40] μg/m3, respectively. Rural and urban majority Black communities had significantly higher PM2.5 pollution levels (10.19 [1.64] μg/m3 and 9.79 [1.10] μg/m3 respectively), in 2010.

Majority Hispanic communities had higher PM2.5 levels and were the highest urban concentration among all races/ethnicities (8.01 [1.73] μg/m3), however they were not the highest rural concentration among all races/ethnicities (6.22 [1.60] μg/m3) in 2019. Associations with higher levels of PM2.5 were found with communities in the poorest quartile and with higher proportions of residents age<15 years old.

 SeS2 positive electrodes are promising components for the development of high-energy, non-aqueous lithium sulfur batteries. However, the (electro)chemical and structural evolution of this class of positive electrodes is not yet fully understood. Here, we use operando physicochemical measurements to elucidate the dissolution and deposition processes in the SeS2 positive electrodes during lithium sulfur cell charge and discharge. Our analysis of real-time imaging reveals the pivotal role of Se in the SeS2 nucleation process, while S enables selective depositions. During the initial discharge, SeS2 converts into Se and S separately, with the dissolved Se acting as nucleation sites due to their lower nucleation potential. The Se effectively catalyzes the growth of S particles, resulting in improved lithium sulfur battery performance compared to cells using positive electrodes containing only Se or S as active materials. By adjusting the Se-to-S ratio, we demonstrate that a low concentration of Se enables uniform catalytic sites, promotes the homogeneous distribution of S and favours improved lithium sulfur battery performance.

 Repeat expansions in FGF14 cause autosomal dominant late-onset cerebellar ataxia (SCA27B) with estimated pathogenic thresholds of 250 (incomplete penetrance) and 300 AAG repeats (full penetrance), but the sequence of pathogenic and non-pathogenic expansions remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that STRling and ExpansionHunter accurately detect FGF14 expansions from short-read genome data using outlier approaches. By combining long-range PCR and nanopore sequencing in 169 patients with cerebellar ataxia and 802 controls, we compare FGF14 expansion alleles, including interruptions and flanking regions. Uninterrupted AAG expansions are significantly enriched in patients with ataxia from a lower threshold (180–200 repeats) than previously reported based on expansion size alone. Conversely, AAGGAG hexameric expansions are equally frequent in patients and controls. Distinct 5’ flanking regions, interruptions and pre-repeat sequences correlate with repeat size. Furthermore, pure AAG (pathogenic) and AAGGAG (non-pathogenic) repeats form different secondary structures. Regardless of expansion size, SCA27B is a recognizable clinical entity characterized by frequent episodic ataxia and downbeat nystagmus, similar to the presentation observed in a family with a previously unreported nonsense variant (SCA27A). Overall, this study suggests that SCA27B is a major overlooked cause of adult-onset ataxia, accounting for 23–31% of unsolved patients. We strongly recommend re-evaluating pathogenic thresholds and integrating expansion sequencing into the molecular diagnostic process.

These MPL-L+ T-like cells exhibit features distinct from T cells of jawed vertebrates, particularly in their elevated expression of hematopoietic genes. We further discovered that MPL-L+ VLRA+ T-like cells are widely present in the typhlosole, gill, liver, kidney, and skin of lamprey and they proliferate in response to both a T cell mitogen and recombinant human thrombopoietin.

This effect originates from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which necessitates utilizing materials with heavy elements. Here, we show that in magnetic materials with non-collinear magnetic order, the Edelstein effect and, consequently, a current-induced torque can exist even in the absence of the spin-orbit coupling. Using group symmetry analysis, model calculations, and realistic simulations on selected compounds, we identify large classes of non-collinear magnet candidates and demonstrate that the current-driven torque is of similar magnitude as the celebrated spin-orbit torque in conventional transition metal structures. We also show that this torque can exist in an insulating material, which could allow for highly efficient electrical control of magnetic order. A major goal of spintronics is to manipulate magnetic order with electric fields. The typical approach is to use a material with spin-orbit coupling, and the resulting Edelstein effect. Here, González-Hernández et al. show theoretically that non-collinear magnets can also host an Edelstein effect, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling."

 The selection and combination of dose regimens for antimalarials involve complex considerations including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. In this study, we use immediate ex vivo P. falciparum field isolates to evaluate the effect of cabamiquine and pyronaridine as standalone treatments and in combination therapy. We feed the data into a pharmacometrics model to generate an interaction map and simulate meaningful clinical dose ratios. We demonstrate that the pharmacometrics model of parasite growth and killing provides a detailed description of parasite kinetics against cabamiquine-susceptible and resistant parasites. Pyronaridine monotherapy provides suboptimal killing rates at doses as high as 720 mg. In contrast, the combination of a single dose of 330 mg cabamiquine and 360 mg pyronaridine provides over 90% parasite killing in most of the simulated patients. The described methodology that combines a rapid, 3R-compliant in vitro method and modelling to set meaningful doses for new antimalarials could contribute to clinical drug development.

Here, the authors show that low levels of androgens function through androgen receptor (AR) monomers to activate mTOR and promote cell proliferation, while high dose androgens induce AR dimerization to inhibit c-MYC expression and facilitate cell differentiation. 
 Most prostate cancers express the androgen receptor (AR), and tumor growth and progression are facilitated by exceptionally low levels of systemic or intratumorally produced androgens. Thus, absolute inhibition of the androgen signaling axis remains the goal of current therapeutic approaches to treat prostate cancer (PCa). Paradoxically, high dose androgens also exhibit considerable efficacy as a treatment modality in patients with late-stage metastatic PCa. Here we show that low levels of androgens, functioning through an AR monomer, facilitate a non-genomic activation of the mTOR signaling pathway to drive proliferation. Conversely, high dose androgens facilitate the formation of AR dimers/oligomers to suppress c-MYC expression, inhibit proliferation and drive a transcriptional program associated with a differentiated phenotype. These findings highlight the inherent liabilities in current approaches used to inhibit AR action in PCa and are instructive as to strategies that can be used to develop new therapeutics for this disease and other androgenopathies. The response of prostate cancer cells to androgens depends on the dose. Here, the authors show that low levels of androgens function through androgen receptor (AR) monomers to activate mTOR and promote cell proliferation, while high dose androgens induce AR dimerization to inhibit c-MYC expression and facilitate cell differentiation."

Here the authors convert cellulose to an electrolyte through molecular engineering showing good performance in solid-state Li-ion batteries. 
 As the most abundant and renewable biopolymer, cellulose has found applications in a range of fields such as healthcare, packaging, electronics and environmental remediation, contributing to the transition towards sustainability. Here we apply a green and scalable process transforming cellulose to a robust electrolyte exhibiting lithium (Li) ion conductivity of 1.09 × 10−3 S cm−1 with a transference number of 0.81 and mechanical strength of 12 MPa. Our process takes advantage of the rich hydroxyl groups in the cellulose which are replaced by phthalic anhydride through an esterification reaction to form cellulose phthalate (CP). Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the introduction of phthalate groups is essential to not only ensure effective multi-oxygen interaction with Li ions to create fast ion transportation channels, but also facilitates the intermolecular hydrogen bond responsible for the impressive mechanical properties. The CP biopolymer film is even compatible with most commercial cathode materials, and our solid-state Li/CP/LiFePO4 cells show better performance and notably good stability over 1,000 cycles than that of a baseline Li-ion cell with a flammable organic liquid electrolyte. Our study unlocks the enormous potential of cellulose utilization in batteries and opens an avenue for the development of abundant and sustainable solid-state electrolytes.

 Southern Ocean (SO) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) warmed from approximately 1949–1978 and cooled slightly from 1979–2013. We compare the remote impacts of these SO trends using historical coupled model experiments in which the model’s SO SST anomalies are nudged to observations. Compared to the control (no nudging) ensemble, the nudged ensemble shows enhanced SST warming in the tropical southeast Pacific and Atlantic, and greater Antarctic sea ice loss, during the SO warming period: analogous to the impacts of SO cooling but of opposite sign. The SO-driven response in the tropical Pacific (Atlantic) is statistically significant when considering the trend difference between the two periods, and accounts for 34% (59%) of the observed non-radiatively forced trend. Surface heat budget analysis indicates wind-evaporation-SST feedback dominates over shortwave cloud feedback in amplifying the SO-driven SST trends in the tropics during the SO warming period, opposite to that for the SO cooling period."

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered a global wheat price spike and food insecurities in import-dependent countries. We combine an analysis of the global wheat supply network with an agricultural commodity price model to investigate national impaired supplies and the global annual wheat price hike, respectively, for the trade year 2022. Using a scenario analysis, we show that international cooperation manifested in the Black Sea Grain and Solidarity Lanes initiatives and the removal of export restrictions may have mitigated the 2022 price hike by 13 percentage points. In a worst case scenario – characterized by multi-breadbasket harvest failures, escalating export restrictions, and blocked Ukrainian exports – wheat price increases by 90% compared to the 2000–2020 average. Coping strategies – such as food-secure countries dispersing stocks, reducing wheat as feed, or boosting wheat production – are effective at mitigating the price spike in simplified scenarios. Our findings underscore the imperative of coordinated policy responses to avoid global food supply disruptions."

 Climate events that break records by large margins are a threat to society and ecosystems. Climate change is expected to increase the probability of such events, but quantifying these probabilities is challenging due to natural variability and limited data availability, especially for observations and very rare extremes. Here we estimate the probability of precipitation events that shatter records by a margin of at least one pre-industrial standard deviation. Using large ensemble climate simulations and extreme value theory, we determine empirical and analytical record shattering probabilities and find they are in high agreement. We show that, particularly in high emission scenarios, models project much higher record-shattering precipitation probabilities in a changing relative to a stationary climate by the end of the century for almost all the global land, with the strongest increases in vulnerable regions in the tropics. We demonstrate that increasing variability is an essential driver of near-term increases in record-shattering precipitation probability, and present a framework that quantifies the influence of combined trends in mean and variability on record-shattering behaviour in extreme precipitation. Probability estimates of record-shattering precipitation events in a warming world are crucial to inform risk assessment and adaptation policies.

 Although internal seiches are ubiquitous in large, deep lakes, little is known about the effect of higher vertical-mode seiches on deepwater dynamics. Here, by combining entire summer season current and temperature observations and 3D numerical modeling, we demonstrate that previously undetected vertical mode-two and mode-three Poincaré waves in 309-meter deep Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France) generate bottom-boundary layer currents up to 4 cm s−1. Poincaré wave amphidromic patterns revealed three strong cells excited simultaneously. Weak hypolimnetic stratification (N2 ≈ 10−6 s−2), typical of deep lakes, significantly modified the wave structure by shifting the lower vertical node in the lake’s center from ~75-meter depth (without stratification) to ~150-meter depth (with stratification). This shift induces shear in the middle of the hypolimnion and strengthens bottom currents, with important implications for hypolimnetic mixing and sediment-water exchange. Our findings demonstrate that classical concepts based on constant temperature layers cannot correctly characterize higher vertical-mode Poincaré seiches in deep lakes. Higher vertical-mode Poincaré waves in Lake Geneva generate strong bottom boundary layer currents which have significant implications for sediment dynamics and oxygen consumption, according to analysis of summer observations and 3D numerical modelling."

 Precise and timely information about crop types plays a crucial role in various agriculture-related applications. However, crop type mapping methods often face significant challenges in cross-regional and cross-time scenarios with high discrepancies between temporal-spectral characteristics of crops from different regions and years. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been employed to mitigate the problem of domain shift between the source and target domains. Since these methods require source domain data during the adaptation phase, they demand significant computational resources and data storage, especially when large labeled crop mapping source datasets are available. This leads to increased energy consumption and financial costs. To address this limitation, we developed a source-free UDA method for cross-regional and cross-time crop mapping, capable of adapting the source-pretrained models to the target datasets without requiring the source datasets. The method mitigates the domain shift problem by leveraging mutual information loss. The diversity and discriminability terms in the loss function are balanced through a novel unsupervised weighting strategy based on mean confidence scores of the predicted categories. Our experiments on mapping corn, soybean, and the class Other from Landsat image time series in the U.S. demonstrated that the adapted models using different backbone networks outperformed their non-adapted counterparts. With CNN, Transformer, and LSTM backbone networks, our adaptation method increased the macro F1 scores by 12.9%, 7.1%, and 5.8% on average in cross-time tests and by 20.1%, 12.5%, and 8.8% on average in cross-regional tests, respectively. Additionally, in an experiment covering a large study area of 450 km × 300 km, the adapted model with the CNN backbone network obtained a macro F1 score of 92.6%, outperforming its non-adapted counterpart with a macro F1 score of 89.2%. Our experiments on mapping the same classes using Sentinel-2 image times series in France demonstrated the effectiveness of our method across different countries and sensors. We also tested our method in more diverse agricultural areas in Denmark and France containing six classes. The results showed that the adapted models outperformed the non-adapted models. Moreover, in within-season experiments, the adapted models performed better than the non-adapted models in the vast majority of weeks. These results and their comparison to those obtained by the other investigated UDA methods demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed method for both end-of-season and within-season crop mapping tasks. Additionally, our study showed that the method is modular and flexible in employing various backbone networks. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Sina-Mohammadi/SFUDA-CropMapping."
