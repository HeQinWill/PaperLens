The experiments are designed with the goal of answering science policy questions related to fires. The options for the multi-model approach, including inputs, outputs, and model set up are discussed, and the official recommendations for the project are presented. 
 Open biomass burning has major impacts globally and regionally on atmospheric composition. Fire emissions include particulate matter, tropospheric ozone precursors, greenhouse gases, as well as persistent organic pollutants, mercury and other metals. Fire frequency, intensity, duration, and location are changing as the climate warms, and modelling these fires and their impacts is becoming more and more critical to inform climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as land management. Indeed, the air pollution from fires can reverse the progress made by emission controls on industry and transportation. At the same time, nearly all aspects of fire modelling – such as emissions, plume injection height, long-range transport, and plume chemistry – are highly uncertain. This paper outlines a multi-model, multi-pollutant, multi-regional study to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and variability in fire atmospheric science, models, and fires’ impacts, in addition to providing quantitative estimates of the air pollution and radiative impacts of biomass burning. Coordinated under the auspices of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution, the international atmospheric modelling and fire science communities are working towards the common goal of improving global fire modelling and using this multi-model experiment to provide estimates of fire pollution for impact studies. This paper outlines the research needs, opportunities, and options for the fire-focused multi-model experiments and provides guidance for these modelling experiments, outputs, and analysis that are to be pursued over the next 3 to 5 years. It proposes a plan for delivering specific products at key points over this period to meet important milestones relevant to science and policy audiences."

This may help understand why models produce varying amounts of sea ice in the present day. We find models tend to show more melt, growth or conduction for a given ice thickness than the buoys, though the difference is smaller for models with more physically realistic thermodynamics. 
 With the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice extent, the accurate simulation of Arctic sea ice in coupled models remains an important problem in climate modelling. In this study, the substantial CMIP6 model spread in Arctic sea ice extent and volume is investigated using a novel, process-based approach. An observational dataset derived from the Arctic Ice Mass Balance buoy (IMB) network is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and mass balance diagnostics produced by a subset of CMIP6 models, to better understand the model processes that underlie the large-scale sea ice states. Due to the sparse nature of the IMB observations, the evaluation is performed by comparing distributions of modelled and observed fluxes in the densely sampled regions of the North Pole and Beaufort Sea."

Do;Sabine Griessbach;Patrick Jöckel;Domenico Taraborrelli,The MESSy DWARF (based on MESSy v2.55.2),"This article introduces the MESSy DWARF. Usually, the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) is linked to full dynamical models to build chemistry climate models. However, due to the modular concept of MESSy, and the newly developed DWARF component, it is now possible to create simplified models containing just one or some process descriptions. This renders very useful for technical optimisation (e.g., GPU porting) and can be used to create less complex models, e.g., a chemical box model. 
 Adaptation of Earth system model (ESM) codes to modern computing architectures is challenging, as ESMs consist of a multitude of different components. Historically grown and developed by scientists rather than software engineers, the codes of the individual components are often interwoven, making the optimisation of the ESMs on modern computing architectures rather challenging, if not impossible."

Raj;Puna Ram Sinha;Rohit Srivastava;Srinivas Bikkina;Damu Bala Subrahamanyam,AeroMix v1.0.1: a Python package for modeling aerosol optical properties and mixing states,"A Python successor to the aerosol module of the OPAC model, named AeroMix, has been developed, with enhanced capabilities to better represent real atmospheric aerosol mixing scenarios. AeroMix’s performance in modeling aerosol mixing states has been evaluated against field measurements, substantiating its potential as a versatile aerosol optical model framework for next-generation algorithms to infer aerosol mixing states and chemical composition. 
 Assessing aerosol mixing states, which primarily depend on aerosol chemical compositions, is indispensable to estimate direct and indirect effects of aerosols. The limitations of the direct measurements of aerosol chemical composition and mixing states necessitate modeling approaches to infer the aerosol mixing states. The Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) model has been extensively utilized to construct optically equivalent aerosol chemical compositions from measured aerosol optical properties using Mie inversion. However, the representation of real atmospheric aerosol mixing scenarios in OPAC has perennially been challenged by the exclusive assumption of external mixing. A Python successor to the aerosol module of the OPAC model is developed, named AeroMix, with novel capabilities to (1) model externally and core–shell mixed aerosols, (2) simulate optical properties of aerosol mixtures constituted by any number of aerosol components, and (3) define aerosol composition and relative humidity in up to six vertical layers. Designed as a versatile open-source aerosol optical model framework, AeroMix is tailored for sophisticated inversion algorithms aimed at modeling aerosol mixing states and also their physical and chemical properties. AeroMix's performance is demonstrated by modeling the probable aerosol mixing states over Kanpur (urban) and the Bay of Bengal (marine) in south Asia. The modeled mixing states are consistent with independent measurements using a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), substantiating the potential capability of AeroMix to model complex aerosol mixing scenarios involving multiple internally mixed components in diverse environments. This work contributes a valuable tool for modeling aerosol mixing states to assess their impact on cloud-nucleating properties and radiation budget."

The deep-learning model can serve as the cloud parameterization within reanalysis frameworks, offering insights into improving the simulation of low clouds. By quantifying biases due to various meteorological factors and parameterizations, this deep-learning-driven approach helps bridge the observation–modeling divide. 
 Based on long-term observations at the Southern Great Plains site by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program for training and validation, a deep-learning model is developed to simulate the daytime evolution of boundary layer clouds (BLCs) from the perspective of land–atmosphere coupling. The model takes ARM measurements (including early-morning soundings and diurnally varying surface meteorological conditions and heat fluxes) as inputs and predicts hourly estimates (including cloud occurrence, the positions of cloud boundaries, and the vertical profile of the cloud fraction) as outputs. The deep-learning model offers good agreement with the observed cloud fields, especially in the accuracy with which cloud occurrence and base height are reproduced. When the inputs are substituted by reanalysis data from ERA5 and MERRA-2, the outputs of the deep-learning model provide a better agreement with observation than the cloud fields extracted from ERA5 and MERRA-2 themselves. Thus, the deep-learning model shows great potential to serve as a diagnostic tool for the performance of physics-based models in simulating stratiform and cumulus clouds. By quantifying biases in clouds and attributing them to the simulated atmospheric state variables versus the model-parameterized cloud processes, this observation-based deep-learning model may offer insights into the directions needed to improve the simulation of BLCs in physics-based models for weather forecasting and climate prediction."

Reich;Zhiyi Zhao;Yanqing Zhou,Quantifying the role of ozone-caused damage to vegetation in the Earth system: a new parameterization scheme for photosynthetic and stomatal responses,"A new scheme is developed to model the surface ozone damage to vegetation in regional and global process-based models. Based on 4210 data points from ozone experiments, it accurately reproduces statistically significant linear or nonlinear photosynthetic and stomatal responses to ozone in observations for all vegetation types. It also enables models to implicitly capture the variability in plant ozone tolerance and the shift among species within a vegetation type. 
 Surface ozone (O3) is the primary air pollutant threatening global vegetation. It typically reduces the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, leading to changes in carbon, water, and energy cycles; vegetation structure and composition; and climate. Several parameterization schemes have been developed to integrate the photosynthetic and stomatal responses to O3 exposure in regional and global process-based models to simulate time- and space-varying O3 plant damage and its cascading dynamic influence. However, these schemes are calibrated based on limited observations and often fail to reproduce the response relationships in observations, impeding accurate assessments of the role of O3 plant damage in the Earth system. This study proposes a new parameterization scheme to utilize the extensive observations from O3 fumigation experiments to inform large-scale modeling. It is built on 4210 paired data points of photosynthetic and stomatal responses compiled from the peer-reviewed literature, more than 6 times larger than those employed in earlier schemes. Functions of phytotoxic O3 dose (POD) are found to accurately reproduce the statistically significant linear or nonlinear relationships observed between POD and either relative leaf photosynthetic rate or relative stomatal conductance for needleleaf trees, broadleaf trees, shrubs, grasses, and crops. These eliminate the practice in earlier schemes of setting response functions as constants and applying the response function from one vegetation type to another. It outperforms the old scheme in the Community Land Model (CLM), which skillfully reproduces the observed response for crop photosynthetic rate only. The nonlinear response functions we developed depict decreasing plant sensitivity with increases in POD, enabling models to implicitly capture the variability in plant ozone tolerance and the shift among plant species for both intra- and inter-PFTs (plant functional types) within a vegetation type observed in the real world. Then, the new scheme is incorporated into the Community Earth System Model version 2.2 (CESM2.2), specifically its land component CLM5, to quantify the global impacts of present-day O3 plant damage by comparing the simulations with and without O3 plant damage. Results show that O3 exposure reduces the global leaf photosynthetic rate by 8.5 % and stomatal conductance by 7.4 %, around half the estimates using the old scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme improves global gross primary productivity (GPP) simulations, decreasing RMSE by 11.1 % relative to simulations without O3 plant damage and by 11.7 % compared to the old scheme. These results underscore the importance of including O3 plant damage in large-scale process-based models and the effectiveness of the new scheme in assessing and projecting globally the role of O3 plant damage in the Earth system."

The data are derived from low light imaging data collected nightly by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day / night band (DNB). The form of the structures only becomes apparent when data from one or more years are accumulated. Identifiable structures include fishing grounds, platforms, gas flares, anchorages, and transportation routes. 
 We present the first comprehensive multiyear global mapping of offshore lighting structures derived from low-light imaging satellite observations collected at night. The sensor is the day/night band (DNB) flown as part of the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The product merges two operational nighttime light products: VIIRS boat detection (VBD) data and VIIRS cloud-free nighttime lights (VNL). The two products are spatially complementary, making it possible to fill gaps through a merger. Both product sets have an average DNB radiance layer, and the merger involves preserving the higher of the two average radiances. A wide range of lighting structures are present, from fishing grounds, platforms, anchorages, gas flares, transit routes, and the glow surrounding bright lighting onshore. The richness in the numbers and types of offshore lighting structures traces back to the DNB spike detector at the core of the VBD algorithm. The VNL algorithm uses outlier removal to filter out biomass burning, an essential process for mapping electric lighting onshore. The outlier removal drops about 80 % of the offshore lighting detections. We expect the new product will lead to an improved understanding of fishing grounds, offshore light pollution, and supply chain disruptions at anchorages, thereby aiding in the development of more sustainable and efficient practices."

In this study, we develop a novel algorithm to infer ocean subsurface temperature and salinity using satellite observations of ocean surface properties. The algorithm proposed is efficient, interpretable and widely applicable. The resultant dataset has a global coverage with a high spatial resolution (0.25°x0.25°) and has been validated against in-situ observations with satisfactory accuracy. 
 In-situ measurements of ocean temperature and salinity are critical to ocean-related studies but are limited in space and time. Satellite retrievals provide high-resolution, globally-covered sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and cannot directly measure the subsurface information., and height (SSH), but are limited to the ocean surface and cannot directly measure the subsurface information. Here we design a physics-informed algorithm that can reconstruct the vertical distributions of upper ocean temperature and salinity based purely on satellite observations. The algorithm stresses the tight ocean surface-subsurface coupling and the co-variability of ocean temperature and salinity. It is firstly tested with climate model simulations and then validated with actual observations by Argo floats, moored buoys and multiple ocean reanalysis datasets. The resultant satellite-based upper ocean temperature and salinity dataset has a global coverage, a high spatial resolution, and resolves ocean thermohaline structure from surface to 400 m. This dataset complements existing ocean subsurface products as an independent satellite-based observational dataset. The success of our reconstruction algorithm highlights a pressing need to maintain and advance the satellite observations of SST, SSS, and SSH. The reconstructed ocean temperature and salinity dataset can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13145129 (Liu, 2024) and be used by researchers to study mesoscale ocean phenomena, assess the ocean heat content in various sea areas and etc."

However, global LIA knowledge is still lacking. This study generated the first global 500 m LIA products by gap-filling LIA measurement data. The global LIA is 41.47°±9.55° and increases with latitude. The LIA products would enhance our understanding of global LIA and assist remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies. 
 Leaf inclination angle (LIA), the angle between leaf surface normal and zenith directions, is a vital parameter in radiative transfer, rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. Due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale field measurement data, LIA is typically assumed to follow the spherical leaf distribution or simply considered constant for different plant types. However, the appropriateness of these simplifications and the global LIA distribution are still unknown. This study compiled global LIA measurements and generated the first global 500 m mean LIA (MLA) product by gap-filling the LIA measurement data using a random forest regressor. Different generation strategies were employed for noncrops and crops. The MLA product was evaluated by validating the nadir leaf projection function (G(0)) derived from the MLA product with high-resolution reference data. The global MLA is 41.47°±9.55°, and the value increases with latitude. The MLAs for different vegetation types follow the order of cereal crops (54.65°) > broadleaf crops (52.35°) > deciduous needleleaf forest (50.05°) > shrubland (49.23°) > evergreen needleleaf forest (47.13°) ≈ grassland (47.12°) > deciduous broadleaf forest (41.23°) > evergreen broadleaf forest (34.40°). Cross-validation shows that the predicted MLA presents a medium consistency (r = 0.75, RMSE = 7.15°) with the validation samples for noncrops, whereas crops show relatively lower correspondence (r = 0.48 and 0.60 for broadleaf crops and cereal crops) because of limited LIA measurements and strong seasonality. The global G(0) distribution is opposite to that of the MLA and agrees moderately with the reference data (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.15). This study shows that the common spherical and constant LIA assumptions may underestimate the intercept capability for most vegetation. The MLA and G(0) products derived in this study would enhance our knowledge about global LIA and should greatly facilitate remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies."

Using machine learning and environmental data, it reconstructs sea surface CO2 levels from 1993–2021. The product accurately captures seasonal cycles, regional variations, and long-term trends, outperforming earlier attempts. It provides crucial data for studying coastal carbon dynamics and climate change impacts. 
 Insufficient spatiotemporal coverage of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) observations has hindered precise studies of the coastal carbon cycle along the North American Atlantic Coastal Ocean Margin (NAACOM). Earlier pCO2-products have encountered difficulties in accurately capturing the heterogeneity of regional variations and decadal trends of pCO2 in the NAACOM. This study developed a regional reconstructed pCO2-product for the NAACOM (Reconstructed Coastal Acidification Database-pCO2, or ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2) using a two-step approach combining random forest regression and linear regression. The product provides monthly pCO2 data at 0.25° spatial resolution from 1993 to 2021, enabling investigation of regional spatial differences, seasonal cycles, and decadal changes in pCO2. The observation-based reconstruction was trained using Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) observations as ground-truth values, with various satellite-derived and reanalysis environmental variables known to control sea surface pCO2 as model inputs. The product shows high accuracy during the model training, validation, and independent test phases, demonstrating robustness and capability to accurately reconstruct pCO2 in regions or periods lacking direct observational data in the NAACOM. Compared with all the observation samples from SOCAT, the pCO2-product yields a determination coefficient of 0.83, a root-mean-square error of 18.64 µatm, and an accumulative uncertainty of 23.83 µatm. The ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2 product demonstrates its capability to resolve seasonal cycles, regional-scale variations, and decadal linear trends of pCO2 along the NAACOM. This new product provides reliable pCO2 data for more precise studies of coastal carbon dynamics in the NAACOM region.

This program collected 700 d of measurements under different latitudes, seasons, sea states, and weather conditions. These new data will support the calibration and validation of numerical models and the understanding of the atmospheric composition of this region of Earth. 
 This article is devoted to the presentation of the MAP-IO observation program. This program, launched in early 2021, has enabled the observation of nearly 700 d of measurements over the Indian and Southern Ocean with the equipment of 17 meteorological and oceanographic scientific instruments on board the ship Marion Dufresne. Several observational techniques have been developed to respond to the difficulties of observations on board the ship, in particular for passive remote sensing data, as well as for quasi-autonomous data acquisition and transfer. The first measurements made it possible to draw up unprecedented climatological data of the Southern Ocean regarding the size distribution and optical thickness of aerosols, the concentration of trace gases and greenhouse gases, UV, and integrated water vapor. High-resolution observations of phytoplankton in surface waters have also shown a great variability in latitude in terms of abundance and community structure (diversity). The operational success of this program and these unique scientific results together establish a proof of concept and underline the need to transform this program into a permanent observatory. The multi-year rotations over the Indian Ocean will enable us to assess the trends and seasonal variability of phytoplankton, greenhouse gases, ozone, and marine aerosols in a sensitive and poorly documented climatic region. Without being exhaustive, MAP-IO should make it possible to better understand and assess the biological carbon pump, to study the variability of gases and aerosols in a region that is remote in relation to the main anthropogenic sources, and to monitor the transport of stratospheric ozone by the Brewer–Dobson circulation.

It is the first attempt to synergistically estimate all-weather instantaneous and daily mean LST data on a long  global-scale time series. The generated datasets were evaluated by the observations from in situ stations and other LST datasets, and the evaluation indicated that the dataset is sufficiently reliable. 
 Land surface temperature (LST) serves as a crucial variable in characterizing climatological, agricultural, ecological, and hydrological processes. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing provides high temporal and spatial resolutions for obtaining LST information. Nevertheless, TIR-based satellite LST products frequently exhibit missing values due to cloud interference. Prior research on estimating all-weather instantaneous LST has predominantly concentrated on regional or continental scales. This study involved generating a global all-weather instantaneous and daily mean LST product spanning from 2000 to 2020 using XGBoost. Multisource data, including Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, surface radiation products, and reanalysis data, were employed. Validation using an independent dataset of 77 individual stations demonstrated the high accuracy of our products, yielding root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.787 K (instantaneous) and 2.175 K (daily). The RMSE for clear-sky conditions was 2.614 K for the instantaneous product, which is slightly lower than the cloudy-sky RMSE of 2.931 K. Our instantaneous and daily mean LST products exhibit higher accuracy compared to the MODIS official LST product (instantaneous RMSE = 3.583 K; daily 3.105 K) and the land component of the fifth generation of the European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) LST product (instantaneous RMSE = 4.048 K; daily 2.988 K). Significant improvements are observed in our LST product, notably at high latitudes, compared to the official MODIS LST product.

Fu,Retrieving ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in China (2013–2021) with a numerical-model-informed testbed to mitigate sample-imbalance-induced biases,"Surface PM2.5 data have gained widespread application in health assessments and related fields, while the inherent uncertainties in PM2.5 data persist due to the lack of ground-truth data across the space. This study provides a novel testbed, enabling comprehensive evaluation across the entire spatial domain. The optimized deep-learning model with spatiotemporal features successfully retrieved surface PM2.5 concentrations in China (2013–2021), with reduced biases induced by sample imbalance. 
 Ground-level PM2.5 data derived from satellites with machine learning are crucial for health and climate assessments. However, uncertainties persist due to the absence of spatially covered observations. To address this, we propose a novel testbed using nontraditional numerical simulations to evaluate PM2.5 estimation across the entire spatial domain. The testbed emulates the general machine-learning approach by training the model with grids corresponding to ground monitoring sites and subsequently testing its predictive accuracy for other locations. Our approach enables comprehensive evaluation of various machine-learning methods' performance in estimating PM2.5 across the spatial domain for the first time. Unexpected results are shown in the application in China, with larger absolute PM2.5 biases found in densely populated regions with abundant ground observations across all benchmark models due to the higher baseline concentration, though the relative error (approximately 20 %) is smaller compared to that in rural areas (over 50 %). The imbalance in training samples, mostly from urban areas with high emissions, is the main reason, leading to significant overestimation due to the lack of monitors in downwind areas where PM2.5 is transported from urban areas with varying vertical profiles. Our proposed testbed also provides an efficient strategy for optimizing model structure or training samples to enhance satellite-retrieval model performance. Integration of spatiotemporal features, especially with conventional neural network (CNN)-based deep-learning approaches like the residual neural network (ResNet) model, has successfully mitigated PM2.5 overestimation (by 5–30 µg m−3) and the corresponding exposure (by 3 million people ⋅ µg m−3) in the downwind area over 9 years (2013–2021) compared to the traditional approach. Furthermore, the incorporation of 600 strategically positioned ground monitoring sites identified through the testbed is essential for achieving a more balanced distribution of training samples, thereby ensuring precise PM2.5 estimation and facilitating the assessment of the associated impacts in China. In addition to presenting the retrieved surface PM2.5 concentrations in China from 2013 to 2021, this study provides a testbed dataset derived from physical modeling simulations which can serve to evaluate the performance of data-driven methodologies, such as machine learning, in estimating spatial PM2.5 concentrations for the community (Li et al., 2024a; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11122294)."

For key events, we analyse their predictability and drivers and attribute them to climate change and land use. We provide a seasonal outlook and decadal projections. Key anomalies occurred in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia, with other high-impact events catalogued worldwide. Climate change significantly increased the likelihood of extreme fires, and mitigation is required to lessen future risk. 
 Climate change contributes to the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires globally, with significant impacts on society and the environment. However, our understanding of the global distribution of extreme fires remains skewed, primarily influenced by media coverage and regionalised research efforts. This inaugural State of Wildfires report systematically analyses fire activity worldwide, identifying extreme events from the March 2023–February 2024 fire season. We assess the causes, predictability, and attribution of these events to climate change and land use and forecast future risks under different climate scenarios. During the 2023–2024 fire season, 3.9×106 km2 burned globally, slightly below the average of previous seasons, but fire carbon (C) emissions were 16 % above average, totalling 2.4 Pg C. Global fire C emissions were increased by record emissions in Canadian boreal forests (over 9 times the average) and reduced by low emissions from African savannahs. Notable events included record-breaking fire extent and emissions in Canada, the largest recorded wildfire in the European Union (Greece), drought-driven fires in western Amazonia and northern parts of South America, and deadly fires in Hawaii (100 deaths) and Chile (131 deaths). Over 232 000 people were evacuated in Canada alone, highlighting the severity of human impact. Our analyses revealed that multiple drivers were needed to cause areas of extreme fire activity. In Canada and Greece, a combination of high fire weather and an abundance of dry fuels increased the probability of fires, whereas burned area anomalies were weaker in regions with lower fuel loads and higher direct suppression, particularly in Canada. Fire weather prediction in Canada showed a mild anomalous signal 1 to 2 months in advance, whereas events in Greece and Amazonia had shorter predictability horizons. Attribution analyses indicated that modelled anomalies in burned area were up to 40 %, 18 %, and 50 % higher due to climate change in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia during the 2023–2024 fire season, respectively. Meanwhile, the probability of extreme fire seasons of these magnitudes has increased significantly due to anthropogenic climate change, with a 2.9–3.6-fold increase in likelihood of high fire weather in Canada and a 20.0–28.5-fold increase in Amazonia. By the end of the century, events of similar magnitude to 2023 in Canada are projected to occur 6.3–10.8 times more frequently under a medium–high emission scenario (SSP370). This report represents our first annual effort to catalogue extreme wildfire events, explain their occurrence, and predict future risks. By consolidating state-of-the-art wildfire science and delivering key insights relevant to policymakers, disaster management services, firefighting agencies, and land managers, we aim to enhance society's resilience to wildfires and promote advances in preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation.

Our study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite to estimate ground-level PM concentrations using a machine learning model. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the world's first ultraviolet–visible instrument for air quality monitoring in geostationary orbit. Since its launch in 2020, GEMS has provided hourly daytime air quality information over Asia. However, to date, validation and applications of these data are lacking. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the first 1.5-year GEMS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data in estimating ground-level particulate matter (PM) concentrations at an hourly scale. To do so, we employ random forest models and use GEMS AOD data and meteorological variables as input features to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, respectively, in South Korea. The model-estimated PM concentrations are strongly correlated with ground measurements, but they exhibit negative biases, particularly during high aerosol loading months. Our results indicate that GEMS AOD values represent underestimates compared to ground-measured AOD values, possibly leading to negative biases in the final PM estimates. Further, we demonstrate that more training data could significantly improve random forest model performance, thus indicating the potential of GEMS for high-resolution surface PM prediction when sufficient data are accumulated over the coming years. Our results will serve as a reference to aid the evaluation of future GEMS AOD retrieval algorithm improvements and also provide initial guidance for data users."

Nagao;Kentaroh Suzuki;Makoto Kuji,Retrieving cloud base height and geometric thickness using the oxygen A-band channel of GCOM-C/SGLI,"In satellite remote sensing, estimating cloud base height (CBH) is more challenging than estimating cloud top height because the cloud base is obscured by the cloud itself. We developed an algorithm using the specific channel (known as the oxygen A-band channel) of the SGLI instrument on JAXA’s GCOM-C satellite to estimate CBH together with other cloud properties. This algorithm can provide global distributions of CBH across various cloud types, including liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. 
 Measurements with a 763 nm channel, located within the oxygen A-band and equipped on the Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI) onboard the JAXA’s Global Change Observation Mission – Climate (GCOM-C) satellite, have the potential to retrieve cloud base height (CBH) and cloud geometric thickness (CGT) through passive remote sensing. This study implemented an algorithm to retrieve the CBH using the SGLI 763 nm channel in combination with several other SGLI channels in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions. In addition to CBH, the algorithm can simultaneously retrieve other key cloud properties, including cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius, ice COT fraction as the cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud top height (CTH), and CGT. Moreover, the algorithm can be seamlessly applied to global clouds comprised of liquid, ice, and mixed phases. The SGLI-retrieved CBH exhibited quantitative consistency with CBH data obtained from the ground-based ceilometer network, ship-borne ceilometer, satellite-borne radar and lidar observations, as evidenced by sufficiently high correlations and small biases. These results provide practical evidence that the retrieval of CBH is indeed possible using the SGLI 763 nm channel. Moreover, the results lend credence to the future use of SGLI CBH data, including the estimation of the surface downward longwave radiative flux from clouds. Nevertheless, issues remain that must be addressed to enhance the value of SGLI-derived cloud retrieval products. These include the systematic bias of SGLI CTH related to cirrus clouds and the bias of SGLI CBH caused by multi-layer clouds."

The results uncovered three factors that influence calibration performance: calibration period, concentration range, and time averaging. We developed a comprehensive framework for the best sensor calibration practices, which serves as a valuable reference for calibrating various sensor types used in air quality monitoring. 
 The rapid expansion of low-cost sensor networks for air quality monitoring necessitates rigorous calibration to ensure data accuracy. Despite numerous published field calibration studies, a universal and comprehensive assessment of factors affecting sensor calibration remains elusive, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality across different networks. To address these challenges, this study deployed eight sensor-based monitors equipped with electrochemical sensors for NO2, NO, CO, and O3 measurement in strategically chosen locations within Hong Kong, Macau, and Shanghai, covering a wide range of climatic conditions: Hong Kong's subtropical climate, Macau's similar yet distinct urban environment, and Shanghai's more variable climate. This strategic deployment ensured that the sensors' performance and calibration processes were tested across diverse atmospheric conditions. Each monitor employed a patented dynamic baseline tracking method for the gas sensors, which isolates the concentration signals from temperature and humidity effects, enhancing the sensors' accuracy and reliability. The tests, which involved evaluating the validation performance by analyzing randomly selected calibration sample subsets ranging from 1 to 15 days, indicated that the length of the calibration period, pollutant concentration range, and time averaging period are pivotal for sensor calibration quality. We determined that a 5–7 days calibration period minimizes calibration coefficient errors, and a wider concentration range improves the validation R2 values for all sensors, suggesting the necessity of setting specific concentration range thresholds. Moreover, a time averaging period of at least 5 minutes for data with 1-minute resolution was recommended to enable optimal calibration in field operation. This study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive calibration assessment and the importance of considering environmental variability in sensor calibration condition. These findings offer methodological guidance for the calibration of other sensor types, providing a reference for future research in the field of sensor calibration."

 In recent years, the application of compact and cost-effective deployable X-band polarimetric radars has gained in popularity, particularly in regions with complex terrain. The deployable radars generally use a radome constructed by joining multiple panels using metallic threads to facilitate easy transportation. As a part of the ESPOIRS project, Laboratoire de l’Atmosphère et des Cyclones has acquired an X-band meteorological radar with four panel radome configuration. In this study, we investigated the effect of the radome on the measured polarimetric variables, particularly differential reflectivity and differential phase. Our observations reveal that the metallic threads connecting the radome panels introduce power loss at vertical polarization, leading to a positive bias in the differential reflectivity values. To address the spatial variability bias observed in differential reflectivity and differential phase, we have developed a novel algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. The algorithm's performance was tested during an intense heavy rainfall event caused by the Batsirai cyclone on Reunion Island. The comparative and joint histogram analysis demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in correcting the spatial bias in the polarimetric variables."

Both models can provide a good match to measurements from airborne radiometers and are sufficiently accurate for use with ICI. 
 Accurate gas absorption models at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths are required to make best use of observations from instruments on board the next generation of EUMETSAT polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI), which measures at frequencies up to 664 GHz. In this study, airborne observations of clear-sky scenes between 89 and 664 GHz are used to perform radiative closure calculations for both upward- and downward-looking viewing directions in order to evaluate two state-of-the-art absorption models, both of which are integrated into the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS). Differences of 20 K are seen in some individual comparisons, with the largest discrepancies occurring where the brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the atmospheric water vapour profile. However, these differences are within the expected uncertainty due to the observed water vapour variability, highlighting the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of water vapour when performing such comparisons. The errors can be significantly reduced by averaging across multiple flights, which reduces the impact of uncertainties in individual atmospheric profiles. For upward-looking views, which have the greatest sensitivity to the absorption model, the mean differences between observed and simulated brightness temperatures are generally close to, or within, the estimated spectroscopic uncertainty. For downward-looking views, which more closely match the satellite viewing geometry, the mean differences were generally less than 1.5 K, with the exception of window channels at 89 and 157 GHz, which are significantly influenced by surface properties. These results suggest that both of the absorption models considered are sufficiently accurate for use with ICI."

To improve the accuracy of this wind measurement and to evaluate this improvement, we conducted experiments with the drones in a wind tunnel under various conditions. This wind tunnel can generate different kinds and intensities of wind. Here we measured with the drones and with other sensors as a reference and compared the results. We were able to improve our wind measurement and show how accurately it works in different situations. 
 As a contribution to closing observational gaps in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the Simultaneous Wind measurement with Uncrewed Flight Systems in 3D (SWUF-3D) fleet of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) is utilized for in situ measurements of turbulence. To date, the coefficients for the transformation terms used in our algorithm for deriving wind speeds from avionic data have only been determined via calibration flights in the free field. Therefore, we present in this work calibration and verification under laboratory conditions. The UAS measurements are performed in a wind tunnel equipped with an active grid and constant temperature anemometers (CTAs) as a reference. Calibration is performed in x- and y-coordinate directions of the UAS body frame at wind speeds of 2 … 18 m s−1. For systematic verification of the measurement capabilities and identification of limitations, different measurement scenarios like gusts, velocity steps, and turbulence are generated with the active grid. Furthermore, the measurement accuracy under different angles of sideslip (AoSs) and wind speeds is investigated, and we examined whether the calibration coefficients can be ported to other UASs in the fleet. Our analyses show that the uncertainty in measuring the wind speed depends on the wind speed magnitude and increases with extreme velocity changes and with higher wind speeds, resulting in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 0.2 m s−1 for steady wind speeds. Applying the calibration coefficients from one UAS to others within the fleet results in comparable accuracies. Flights in gusts of different strengths yield an RMSE of up to 0.6 m s−1. The maximal RMSE occurs in the most extreme velocity steps (i.e., a lower speed of 5 m s−1 and an amplitude of 10 m s−1) and exceeds 1.3 m s−1. For variances below approx. 0.5 and 0.3 m2 s−2, the maximal resolvable frequencies of the turbulence are about 2 and 1 Hz, respectively. The results indicate successful calibration but with susceptibility to high AoSs in high wind speeds, no necessity for wind tunnel calibration for individual UASs, and the need for further research regarding turbulence analysis."

The enhancement varied multiple dimensional factors, emphasizing the complexity of temperature inside of OFR. The effects of temperature on the flow field and gas- or particle-phase reaction inside OFR were also evaluated with experiments and model simulations. Finally, multiple mitigation strategies were demonstrated to minimize this temperature increase. 
 Oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) have been extensively utilized to examine the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, the UV lamps typically employed to initiate the photochemistry in OFRs can result in an elevated reactor temperature when their implications are not thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the temperature distribution within an Aerodyne potential aerosol mass OFR (PAM-OFR) and then examined the subsequent effects on flow and chemistry due to lamp heating. A lamp-induced temperature increase was observed, which was a function of lamp-driving voltage, number of lamps, lamp types, OFR residence time, and positions within the PAM-OFR. Under typical PAM-OFR operational conditions (e.g., < 5 d of equivalent atmospheric OH exposure under low-NOx conditions), the temperature increase typically ranged from 1–5 °C. Under extreme (but less frequently encountered) conditions, the heating could reach up to 15 °C. The influences of the increased temperature over ambient conditions on the flow distribution, gas, and condensed-phase chemistry within PAM-OFR were evaluated. Our findings indicate that the increase in temperature altered the flow field, resulting in a diminished tail on the residence time distribution and corresponding oxidant exposure due to faster recirculation. According to simulation results from a radical chemistry box model, the variation in absolute oxidant concentration within PAM-OFR due to temperature increase was minimal (< 5 %). The temperature influences on seed organic aerosol (OA) and newly formed secondary OA were also investigated, suggesting that an increase in temperature can impact the yield, size, and oxidation levels of representative biogenic and anthropogenic SOA types. Recommendations for  temperature-dependent SOA yield corrections and PAM-OFR operating protocols that mitigate lamp-induced temperature enhancement and fluctuations are  presented. We recommend blowing air around the reactor's exterior with fans during PAM-OFR experiments to minimize the temperature increase within  PAM-OFR. Temperature increases are substantially lower for OFRs utilizing less powerful lamps compared to the Aerodyne version."

 Ceilometers are used routinely at aerodromes worldwide to derive the height and sky coverage fraction of cloud layers. This information, possibly combined with direct observations by human observers, contributes to the production of meteorological aerodrome reports (METARs). Here, we present ampycloud, a new algorithm, and its associated Python package for automatic processing of ceilometer data with the aim of determining the sky coverage fraction and base height of cloud layers above aerodromes. The ampycloud algorithm was developed at the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) as part of the AMAROC (AutoMETAR/AutoReport rOund the Clock) program to help in the fully automatic production of METARs at Swiss civil aerodromes. ampycloud is designed to work with no direct human supervision. The algorithm consists of three distinct, sequential steps that rely on agglomerative clustering methods and Gaussian mixture models to identify distinct cloud layers from individual cloud base hits reported by ceilometers. The robustness of the ampycloud algorithm stems from the first processing step, which is simple and reliable. It constrains the two subsequent processing steps that are more sensitive but also better suited to handling complex cloud distributions. The software implementation of the ampycloud algorithm takes the form of an eponymous, pip-installable Python package developed on GitHub and made publicly accessible."

A novel method is developed to define four phases of mixed-phase clouds. Relationships between cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties are quantified. Effects of aerosols and thermodynamic and dynamical conditions on ice nucleation and phase partitioning are examined. 
 The onset of ice nucleation in mixed-phase clouds determines the lifetime and microphysical properties of ice clouds. In this work, we develop a novel method that differentiates between various phases of mixed-phase clouds, such as clouds dominated by pure liquid or pure ice segments, compared with those having ice crystals surrounded by supercooled liquid water droplets or vice versa. Using this method, we examine the relationship between the macrophysical and microphysical properties of Southern Ocean mixed-phase clouds at −40 to 0 °C (e.g. stratiform and cumuliform clouds) based on the in situ aircraft-based observations during the US National Science Foundation Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) flight campaign. The results show that the exchange between supercooled liquid water and ice crystals from a macrophysical perspective, represented by the increasing spatial ratio of regions containing ice crystals relative to the total in-cloud region (defined as ice spatial ratio), is positively correlated with the phase exchange from a microphysical perspective, represented by the increasing ice water content (IWC), decreasing liquid water content (LWC), increasing ice mass fraction, and increasing ice particle number fraction (IPNF). The mass exchange between liquid and ice becomes more significant during phase 3 when pure ice cloud regions (ICRs) start to appear. Occurrence frequencies of cloud thermodynamic phases show a significant phase change from liquid to ice at a similar temperature (i.e. −17.5 °C) among three types of definitions of mixed-phase clouds based on ice spatial ratio, ice mass fraction, or IPNF. Aerosol indirect effects are quantified for different phases using number concentrations of aerosols greater than 100 or 500 nm (N>100 and N>500, respectively). N>500 shows stronger positive correlations with ice spatial ratios compared with N>100. This result indicates that larger aerosols potentially contain ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which facilitate the formation of ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds. The impact of N>500 is also more significant in phase 2 when ice crystals just start to appear in the mixed phase compared with phase 3 when pure ICRs have formed, possibly due to the competing aerosol indirect effects on primary and secondary ice production in phase 3. The thermodynamic and dynamic conditions are quantified for each phase. The results show stronger in-cloud turbulence and higher updraughts in phases 2 and 3 when liquid and ice coexist compared with pure liquid or ice (phases 1 and 4, respectively). The highest updraughts and turbulence are seen in phase 3 when supercooled liquid droplets are surrounded by ice crystals. These results indicate both updraughts and turbulence support the maintenance of supercooled liquid water amongst ice crystals. Overall, these results illustrate the varying effects of aerosols, thermodynamics, and dynamics through various stages of mixed-phase cloud evolution based on this new method that categorizes cloud phases."

In this study, we proposed the wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager (WFUI) and built a forward model to evaluate the detection capability and efficiency. The results demonstrate that the WFUI performs well in PMC detection and has high detection efficiency. The relationship between ice water content and detection efficiency follows an exponential function distribution. 
 The variation trends and characteristics of polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) are important for studying the evolution of atmospheric systems and understanding various atmospheric dynamic processes. Through observation and analysis of PMCs, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving atmospheric processes, providing a scientific basis and support for addressing climate change. Ultraviolet (UV) imaging technology, adopted by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite, has significantly advanced the research on PMCs. Due to the retirement of the AIM satellite, there is currently no concrete plan for next-generation instruments based on the CIPS model, resulting in a discontinuity in the observation data sequence.In this study, we propose a compact and cost-effective wide-field-of-view ultraviolet imager (WFUI) that can be integrated into various satellite platforms for future PMC observation missions. A forward model was built to evaluate the detection capability and efficiency of the WFUI. CIPS and Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) data were fused to reconstruct a three-dimensional PMC scene as the input background. Based on the scattering and extinction characteristics of ice particles and atmospheric molecules, the radiative transfer was calculated using the solar radiation path through the atmosphere and PMCs. The optical system and satellite platform parameters of the WFUI were selected according to CIPS, enabling the calculation of the number of photons received by the WFUI. The actual detection signal is then simulated by photoelectric conversion, and the PMC information can be obtained by removing detector noise. Subsequently, a comparison with the input background field was conducted to compute and analyze the detection efficiency. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the instrument and platform parameters was conducted.Simulations were performed for both individual orbits and for the entire PMC seasons. The research results demonstrate that the WFUI performs well in PMC detection and has high detection efficiency. Statistical analysis of the detection efficiency using data from 2008 to 2012 revealed an exponential relationship between the ice water content (IWC) of PMCs and detection efficiency. During the initial and final durations of the PMC season, when the IWC was relatively low, the detection efficiency remained limited. However, as the season progressed and the IWC increased, the detection efficiency significantly improved. We note that regions at lower latitudes exhibited a lower IWC and, consequently, lower detection efficiency. In contrast, regions at higher latitudes, with a greater IWC, demonstrated better detection efficiency. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis results suggest that increasing the satellite orbit altitude and expanding the field of view (FOV) of the WFUI both contribute to improving the detection efficiency."

Renewed interest in H2 as a low- or zero-carbon source of energy may lead to increased production, uses, and supply chain emissions. NOAA measurements of weekly air samples collected between 2009 and 2021 at over 50 sites in mostly remote locations are now available, and they complement other datasets to study the H2 global budget. 
 The NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) measures atmospheric hydrogen (H2) in grab samples collected weekly as flask pairs at over 50 sites in the Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. Measurements representative of background air sampling show higher H2 in recent years at all latitudes. The marine boundary layer (MBL) global mean H2 was 552.8 ppb in 2021, 20.2 ± 0.2 ppb higher compared to 2010. A 10 ppb or more increase over the 2010–2021 average annual cycle was detected in 2016 for MBL zonal means in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere. Carbon monoxide measurements in the same-air samples suggest large biomass burning events in different regions likely contributed to the observed interannual variability at different latitudes. The NOAA H2 measurements from 2009 to 2021 are now based on the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO GAW) H2 mole fraction calibration scale, developed and maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC), Jena, Germany. GML maintains eight H2 primary calibration standards to propagate the WMO scale. These are gravimetric hydrogen-in-air mixtures in electropolished stainless steel cylinders (Essex Industries, St. Louis, MO), which are stable for H2. These mixtures were calibrated at the MPI-BGC, the WMO Central Calibration Laboratory (CCL) for H2, in late 2020 and span the range 250–700 ppb. We have used the CCL assignments to propagate the WMO H2 calibration scale to NOAA air measurements performed using gas chromatography and helium pulse discharge detector instruments since 2009. To propagate the scale, NOAA uses a hierarchy of secondary and tertiary standards, which consist of high-pressure whole-air mixtures in aluminum cylinders, calibrated against the primary and secondary standards, respectively. Hydrogen at the parts per billion level has a tendency to increase in aluminum cylinders over time. We fit the calibration histories of these standards with zero-, first-, or second-order polynomial functions of time and use the time-dependent mole fraction assignments on the WMO scale to reprocess all tank air and flask air H2 measurement records. The robustness of the scale propagation over multiple years is evaluated with the regular analysis of target air cylinders and with long-term same-air measurement comparison efforts with WMO GAW partner laboratories. Long-term calibrated, globally distributed, and freely accessible measurements of H2 and other gases and isotopes continue to be essential to track and interpret regional and global changes in the atmosphere composition. The adoption of the WMO H2 calibration scale and subsequent reprocessing of NOAA atmospheric data constitute a significant improvement in the NOAA H2 measurement records."

A total of eight potentially unique events are analyzed, considering both the number and size of raindrops. However, no clear evidence supporting the existence of a special rainfall regime could be found. The results highlight the challenges in experimentally confirming well-established theoretical ideas in the field of precipitation sciences. 
 An experimental study aimed at identifying special rainfall regimes with the help of co-located disdrometers is performed. Eight potentially special events (i.e., four number-controlled events and four size-controlled events) are identified and examined. However, a detailed cross-check with additional, independent radar measurements reveals no clear evidence of special rainfall dynamics. The research underscores the difficulty of experimentally confirming seemingly straightforward questions about rainfall patterns and dynamics that have been theorized in the literature for several decades but never formally validated experimentally. The study also questions the reliability of previous claims and serves as a reminder to approach such problems with more caution, emphasizing the need for rigorous uncertainty analysis and multiple cross-checks between sensors to avoid misinterpretation."

We demonstrate our method by making measurements of the emissivity of water. We then compare our results to the emissivity predicted using a model and find good agreement. The observations from FINESSE are novel because they allow us to determine surface emissivity at longer wavelengths than have been routinely measured before. 
 In this paper, we describe a method for retrieving the surface emissivity of specular surfaces across the wavenumber range of 400–1600 cm−1 using novel radiance measurements of the Far-INfrarEd Spectrometer for Surface Emissivity (FINESSE) instrument. FINESSE is described in detail in Part 1 (Murray et al., 2024) of this paper. We apply the method to two sets of measurements of distilled water. The first set of emissivity retrievals is of distilled water heated above ambient temperature to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The second set of emissivity retrievals is of ambient temperate water at a range of viewing angles. In both cases, the observations agree well with calculations based on compiled refractive indices across the mid- and far-infrared. It is found that the reduced contrast between the up- and downwelling radiation in the ambient temperature case degrades the performance of the retrieval. Therefore, a filter is developed to target regions of high contrast, which improves the agreement between the ambient temperature emissivity retrieval and the predicted emissivity. These retrievals are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published simultaneous retrievals of the surface temperature and emissivity of water that extend into the far-infrared and demonstrate a method that can be used and further developed for the in situ retrieval of the emissivity of other surfaces in the field."

Polarization measurements are demonstrated to aid in the determination of snow grain shape, ice crystal roughness, and the vertical distribution of impurities in the snow–atmosphere system, data that are critical for estimating snow albedo for use in climate models. 
 This study presents a detailed theoretical assessment of the information content of passive polarimetric observations over snow scenes, using a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method. Conventional sensitivity studies focus on varying a single parameter while keeping all other parameters fixed. In contrast, the GSA correctly addresses the covariance of state parameters across their entire parameter space, hence favoring a more correct interpretation of inversion algorithms and the optimal design of their state vectors.The forward simulations exploit a vector radiative transfer model to obtain the Stokes vector emerging at the top of the atmosphere for different solar zenith angles, when the bottom boundary consists of a vertically resolved snowpack of non-spherical grains. The presence of light-absorbing particulates (LAPs), either embedded in the snow or aloft in the atmosphere above in the form of aerosols, is also considered. The results are presented for a set of wavelengths spanning the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum.The GSA correctly captures the expected, high sensitivity of the reflectance to LAPs in the VIS–NIR and to grain size at different depths in the snowpack in the NIR–SWIR. With adequate viewing geometries, mono-angle measurements of total reflectance in the VIS–SWIR (akin to those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) resolve grain size in the top layer of the snowpack sufficiently well. The addition of multi-angle polarimetric observations in the VIS–NIR provides information on grain shape and microscale roughness. The simultaneous sensitivity in the VIS–NIR to both aerosols and snow-embedded impurities can be disentangled by extending the spectral range to the SWIR, which contains information on aerosol optical depth while remaining essentially unaffected when the same particulates are mixed with the snow. Multi-angle polarimetric observations can therefore (i) effectively partition LAPs between the atmosphere and the surface, which represents a notorious challenge for snow remote sensing based on measurements of total reflectance only and (ii) lead to better estimates of grain shape and roughness and, in turn, the asymmetry parameter, which is critical for the determination of albedo. The retrieval uncertainties are minimized when the degree of linear polarization is used in place of the polarized reflectance.The Sobol indices, which are the main metric for the GSA, were used to select the state parameters in retrievals performed on data simulated for multiple instrument configurations. Improvements in retrieval quality with the addition of measurements of polarization, multi-angle views, and different spectral channels reflect the information content, identified by the Sobol indices, relative to each configuration.The results encourage the development of new remote sensing algorithms that fully leverage multi-angle and polarimetric capabilities of modern remote sensors. They can also aid flight planning activities, since the optimal exploitation of the information content of multi-angle measurements depends on the viewing geometry. The better characterization of surface and atmospheric parameters in snow-covered regions advances  research opportunities for scientists of the cryosphere and ultimately benefits albedo estimates in climate models."

 We report in-plume carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and carbon isotope ratios during the 2021 eruption of Tajogaite volcano, island of La Palma, Spain. CO2 measurements inform our understanding of volcanic contributions to the global climate carbon cycle and the role of CO2 in eruptions. Traditional ground-based methods of CO2 collection are difficult and dangerous, and as a result only about 5 % of volcanoes have been directly surveyed. We demonstrate that unpiloted aerial system (UAS) surveys allow for fast and relatively safe measurements. Using CO2 concentration profiles we estimate the total flux during several measurements in November 2021 to be 1.76±0.20×103 to 2.23±0.26×104 t d−1. Carbon isotope ratios of plume  CO2 indicate a deep magmatic source, consistent with the intensity of the eruption.

We performed calibrations on a NO3¯ ToFCIMS instrument to determine its sensitivity and linearity for detecting various organic compounds. Our findings revealed significant variability, over several orders of magnitude, in the calibration factors obtained. The results suggest that relying on a single calibration factor from H2SO4 for the quantification of all compounds detected by this technique is not appropriate. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a key role in tropospheric chemistry, giving rise to secondary products such as highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). HOMs, a group of low-volatility gas-phase products, are formed through the autoxidation process of peroxy radicals (RO2) originating from the oxidation of VOCs. The measurement of HOMs is made by a NO3- ToFCIMS instrument, which also detects other species like small highly oxygenated VOCs (e.g., dicarboxylic acids) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The instrument response to HOMs is typically estimated using H2SO4, as HOMs are neither commercially available nor easily synthesized in the laboratory. The resulting calibration factor is then applied to quantify all species detected using this technique. In this study, we explore the sensitivity of the instrument to commercially available small organic compounds, primarily dicarboxylic acids, given the limitations associated with producing known amounts of HOMs for calibration. We compare these single-compound calibration factors to the one obtained for H2SO4 under identical operational conditions. The study found that the sensitivity of the NO3- ToFCIMS varies depending on the specific type of organic compound, illustrating how a single calibration factor derived from sulfuric acid is clearly inadequate for quantifying all detected species using this technique. The results highlighted substantial variability in the calibration factors for the tested organic compounds, with 4-nitrocatechol exhibiting the highest sensitivity and pyruvic acid the lowest. The obtained sulfuric acid calibration factor agreed well with the previous values from the literature. In summary, this research emphasized the need to develop reliable and precise calibration methods for progressively oxygenated reaction products measured with a NO3- chemical-ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS), for example, HOMs."

 We assess the temperature stability requirements of unseeded Nd:YAG lasers in lidar systems for atmospheric temperature profiling through the rotational Raman technique. Taking as a reference a system using a seeded laser assumed to emit pulses of negligible spectral width and free of wavelength drifts, we estimate first the effect of the pulse spectral widening of the unseeded laser on the output of the interference filters, and then we derive the limits of the allowable wavelength drift for a given bias in the temperature measurement that would add to the noise-induced uncertainty. Finally, using spectroscopic data, we relate the allowable wavelength drift to allowable temperature variations in the YAG rod. We find that, in order to keep the bias affecting atmospheric temperature measurements smaller than 1 K, the Nd:YAG rod temperature should also be kept within  a variation range of 1 K."

The accuracy and linearization of rain rates can further improve the Gaussianity. 
 Given that the Gaussianity of the observation error distribution is the fundamental principle of some data assimilation and machine learning algorithms, the error structure of radar reflectivity has become increasingly important with the development of high-resolution forecasts and nowcasts of convective systems. This study examines the error distribution of radar reflectivity and discusses what causes the non-Gaussian error distribution using 6-month observations minus backgrounds (OmBs) of composites of vertical maximum reflectivity (CVMRs) in mountainous and hilly areas. By following the symmetric error model in all-sky satellite radiance assimilation, we reveal the error structure of CVMRs as a function of symmetric rain rates, which is the average of the observed and simulated rain rates. Unlike satellite radiance, the error structure of CVMRs shows a sharper slope for light precipitation than for moderate precipitation. Thus, a three-piecewise fitting function is more suitable for CVMRs. The probability density functions of OmBs normalized by symmetric rain rates become more Gaussian than the probability density functions normalized by all samples. Moreover, the possibility of using a third-party predictor to construct the symmetric error model is also discussed in this study. The result shows that the Gaussian distribution of OmBs can be further improved via more accurate precipitation observations. According to the Jensen–Shannon divergence, a more linear predictor, the logarithmic transformation of the rain rate, can provide the most Gaussian error distribution in comparison with other predictors."

Haywood,In-plume and out-of-plume analysis of  aerosol–cloud interactions derived from the   2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption,"Natural aerosols from volcanic eruptions can help us understand how anthropogenic aerosols modify climate. We use observations and model simulations of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption plume to examine aerosol–cloud interactions in September 2014. We find a shift to clouds with smaller, more numerous cloud droplets in the first 2 weeks of the eruption. In the third week, the background meteorology and previous conditions experienced by air masses modulate the aerosol perturbation to clouds. 
 Aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) has persisted as the most uncertain aspect of anthropogenic forcing over the industrial period, limiting our ability to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity and to confidently predict 21st century climate change. Aerosol–cloud interactions are the most uncertain component of aerosol ERF. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption acted as a large source of sulfur dioxide, providing an opportunistic experiment for studying aerosol–cloud interactions at a climatically relevant scale. We evaluate the observed aerosol-induced perturbation to marine liquid cloud properties inside the volcanic plume in the first month of the eruption and compare the results to those from UKESM1 (UK Earth System Model). In the first 2 weeks, as expected, we find an in-plume shift to smaller and more numerous cloud droplets in both the observations and the simulations. We find an observed increase in liquid water path (LWP) values inside the plume that is not captured in UKESM1. However, in the third week, the in-plume shift to smaller and more numerous cloud droplets is neither observed nor modelled, and there are discrepancies between the observed and modelled response in the fourth week. An analysis of the model simulations and trajectory modelling reveals that air mass history and background meteorological factors can strongly influence aerosol–cloud interactions between the weeks of our analysis. Overall, our study supports the findings of many previous studies: the aerosol impact on cloud effective radius is significant, with differences in the observed and modelled response for in-cloud LWP."

Harrison,Insights into the sources of ultrafine particle numbers at six European urban sites obtained by investigating COVID-19 lockdowns,"Different sources of airborne particles in the atmospheres of four European cities were distinguished by recognising their particle size distributions using a statistical procedure, positive matrix factorisation. The various sources responded differently to the changes in emissions associated with COVID-19 lockdowns, and the reasons are investigated. While traffic emissions generally decreased, particles formed from reactions of atmospheric gases decreased in some cities but increased in others. 
 Lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to the curtailment of many activities and reduced emissions of primary air pollutants. Here, we applied positive matrix factorisation  to particle size distribution (PSD) data from six monitoring sites (three urban background and three roadside) between four European cities (Helsinki, Leipzig, Budapest, and London) to evaluate how particle number concentrations (PNCs) and their sources changed during the respective 2020 lockdown periods compared to the reference years 2014–2019. A number of common factors were resolved between sites, including nucleation, road traffic semi-volatile fraction (road trafficsvf), road traffic solid fraction (road trafficsf), diffuse urban (wood smoke + aged traffic), ozone-associated secondary aerosol (O3-associated SA), and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA). Nucleation, road traffic, and diffuse urban factors were the largest contributors to mean PNCs during the reference years and respective lockdown periods. However, SIA factors were the largest contributors to particle mass concentrations, irrespective of environment type. Total mean PNCs were lower at two of the urban-background and all roadside sites during lockdown. The response of nucleation and road trafficsvf factors to lockdown restrictions was highly variable, although road trafficsf factors were consistently lower at roadside sites. The responses of diffuse urban factors were largely consistent and were mostly lower at urban-background sites. Secondary aerosols (O3-associated SA and SIA) exhibited extensive reductions in their mean PNCs at all sites. These variegated responses to lockdowns across Europe point to a complex network of sources and aerosol sinks contributing to PSDs."

We explored highly oxygenated organic molecule (HOM) formation from ∆3-carene ozonolysis in chambers and investigated the impact of temperature and relative humidity on HOM formation. Our findings provide new insights into ∆3-carene oxidation pathways and their potential to impact atmospheric aerosols. 
 Δ3-carene is a prominent monoterpene in the atmosphere, contributing significantly to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. However, knowledge about Δ3-carene oxidation pathways, particularly regarding their ability to form highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), is still limited. In this study, we present HOM measurements during Δ3-carene ozonolysis under various conditions in two simulation chambers. We identified numerous HOMs (monomers: C7−10H10−18O6−14; dimers: C17−20H24−34O6−18) using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS). Δ3-carene ozonolysis yielded higher HOM concentrations than α-pinene, with a distinct distribution, indicating differences in formation pathways. All HOM signals decreased considerably at lower temperatures, reducing the estimated molar HOM yield from ∼ 3 % at 20 °C to ∼ 0.5 % at 0 °C. Interestingly, the temperature change altered the HOM distribution, increasing the observed dimer-to-monomer ratios from roughly 0.8 at 20 °C to 1.5 at 0 °C. HOM monomers with six or seven O atoms condensed more efficiently onto particles at colder temperatures, while monomers with nine or more O atoms and all dimers condensed irreversibly even at 20 °C. Using the gas- and particle-phase chemistry kinetic multilayer model ADCHAM, we were also able to reproduce the experimentally observed HOM composition, yields, and temperature dependence."

The DCSs over the TP are less frequent, showing narrower and thinner cores and anvils compared to those over the TO. TP DCSs show a stronger longwave cloud radiative effect at the surface and in the low-level atmosphere. Distinct aerosol–cloud–precipitation interaction is found in TP DCSs, probably due to the cold cloud bases. 
 Using spaceborne lidar and radar observations, this study identifies deep convection systems (DCSs), including deep convection cores (DCCs) and anvils, over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and tropical Indian Ocean (TO) and finds that DCSs over the TP are less frequent, exhibiting narrower and thinner DCCs and anvils compared to those over the TO. The thinner DCCs over the TP exert weaker radiative cooling effects at the top of atmosphere (TOA) compared to the TO. But, the shortwave TOA cloud radiative effect (CRE) of TP anvils is stronger than that of the TO possibly due to more densely packed cloud tops over the TP. It results in a stronger TOA CRE of DCSs over the TP than that of TO. In particular, the longwave CRE of DCSs over the TP is notably greater at surface and low-level atmosphere due to the distinct lower temperature and less water vapour. The width of DCSs shows a positive correlation with wind shear and atmospheric instability, and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. We also find that the impact of aerosols on cloud top heights and precipitation displays significant discrepancies between the two regions. It is because that the aerosol invigoration effect is less efficient on the TP DCSs, mainly attributed to the significantly colder cloud base. Due to competition between invigoration and direct/semi-direct radiative effects of aerosols, the correlation between precipitation and aerosols over the TP is not obvious. However, precipitation in the TO experiences invigoration followed by suppression with increasing aerosols, due to the dominance of aerosol radiative effects and enhancement entrainment under polluted conditions."

The algorithm is mathematically proved, and its performance is shown for a carbon flux observing system simulation experiment. These results legitimize and generalize this algorithm's current use and make available this effective algorithm to new DA domains. 
 Through the Bayesian lens of four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation, uncertainty in model parameters is traditionally quantified through the posterior covariance matrix. However, in modern settings involving high-dimensional and computationally expensive forward models, posterior covariance knowledge must be relaxed to deterministic or stochastic approximations. In the carbon flux inversion literature, (Chevallier et al., 2007) proposed a stochastic method capable of approximating posterior variances of linear functionals of the model parameters that is particularly well suited for large-scale Earth-system 4D-Var data assimilation tasks. This note formalizes this algorithm and clarifies its properties. We provide a formal statement of the algorithm, demonstrate why it converges to the desired posterior variance quantity of interest, and provide additional uncertainty quantification allowing incorporation of the Monte Carlo sampling uncertainty into the method's Bayesian credible intervals. The methodology is demonstrated using toy simulations and a realistic carbon flux inversion observing system simulation experiment."

Observed results highlighted remarkably different aqueous processing of primary and secondary submicron aerosol components under distinct ambient relative humidity (RH) conditions and that RH levels significantly impact aerosol sampling through the aerosol swelling effect. 
 Aerosol hygroscopic growth and activation under high-relative-humidity (RH) conditions significantly influence the physicochemical properties of submicron aerosols (PM1). However, this process remains poorly characterized due to limited measurements. To address this gap, we deployed an advanced aerosol–fog sampling system that automatically switched between PM1, PM2.5 and total suspended particulate (TSP) inlets at a rural site in the North China Plain in the cold season. The results revealed that aerosol swelling due to water vapor uptake influenced aerosol sampling under high-RH conditions by shifting the cut-off size of impactors. At subsaturated high RH (> 90 %), over 25 % of aerosol mass with dry diameters below 1 µm resided in supermicron ranges, while in supersaturated foggy conditions, more than 70 % of submicron aerosol migrated to supermicron ranges. Hygroscopic growth and activation particularly affected highly hydrophilic inorganic salts,  shifting a significant number of submicron sulfate and nitrate particles to supermicron ranges, with 27 %–33 % at 95 % ≤ RH ≤ 99 % and more than 78 % under supersaturated foggy conditions. Moreover, more than 10 % of submicron biomass burning organic aerosols grew beyond 2.5 µm during fog events, while fossil-fuel-related organic aerosol (FFOA) remained dominantly in submicron ranges, suggesting inefficient aqueous conversion of FFOA. The two secondary organic aerosol (SOA) factors (OOA1 and OOA2) behaved differently under supersaturated conditions, with OOA2 exhibiting a higher activated fraction despite a lower oxygen / carbon ratio. A substantial increase in organic nitrate and organosulfur mass concentrations in activated droplets during fog events suggested aqueous conversions and formations of brown carbon with potential radiative impacts. Overall, our study highlights remarkably different cloud and fog processing behaviors between primary and secondary aerosols, which would benefit a better understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions under distinct atmospheric conditions."

We found that the trends did not match satellite data or emission estimates, revealing complexities in ammonia sources. While seasonal variations in ammonia were temperature-dependent, daily variations were correlated with water vapor. We also found an increasing contribution of ammonia reduction, emphasizing its importance in mitigating the effects of fine particulate matter in Beijing. 
 Ammonia (NH3) has major effects on the environment and climate. In situ measurements of NH3 concentrations taken between June 2009 and July 2020 at an urban site in Beijing were analyzed to study its long-term behavior, responses to meteorological conditions, and influences on the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs). The 11-year average NH3 mixing ratio was 26.9±19.3 ppb (median 23.5 ppb). The annual average NH3 mixing ratio increased from 2009 to 2017 by 50 % and then decreased by 49 % from 2017 to 2020. Notably, the long-term trend for NH3 at the ground level did not align with the trends derived from satellite observations and emission estimates. The NH3 concentration exhibited a stronger correlation with the daily variation in water vapor (H2O) concentration than with air temperature. Thermodynamic modeling revealed the nonlinear response of SIAs to NH3, with increased sensitivity when its concentration was reduced to 40 % of the initial level. Although reducing NH3 concentrations can improve air quality during winter, controlling acid gas concentrations has a greater effect than controlling NH3 concentrations on reducing SIA concentrations, until NH3 and acidic gas concentrations are reduced below 80 % of their current levels. Nevertheless, the increased mass proportion of ammonium salts in SIAs during the observation period indicates that future control measures for NH3 concentrations may need to be prioritized in Beijing."

The OA rise in the SEUS is driven by the enhanced formation of epoxydiol-derived secondary organic aerosol due to the increase in biogenic volatile organic compounds and sulfate, while in the PNW, it is caused by wildfires. A total of 10 climate models captured the OA increase in the PNW yet greatly underestimated it in the SEUS. 
 Drought events have been linked with the enhancements of organic aerosols (OAs), but the mechanisms have not been comprehensively understood. This study investigates the relationships between the monthly standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and surface OA in the contiguous United States (CONUS) during the summertime from 1998 to 2018. OA under severe drought conditions shows a significant increase in mass concentrations across most of the CONUS relative to non-drought periods, with the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Southeast United States (SEUS) experiencing the highest average enhancement of 1.79 µg m−3 (112 %) and 0.92 µg m−3 (33 %), respectively. In the SEUS, a linear regression approach between OA and sulfate was used to estimate the epoxydiol-derived secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX SOA), which is the primary driver of the OA enhancements under droughts due to the simultaneous increase in emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs; such as isoprene and monoterpene) and sulfate. The rise in sulfate is mainly caused by the reduced wet deposition because of the up to 62 % lower precipitation amount. In the PNW, OA enhancements are closely linked to intensified wildfire emissions, which raise OA mass concentrations to be 4–8 times higher relative to non-fire conditions. All 10 Earth system models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) can capture the slopes between SPEI and OA in the PNW, with CESM2-WACCM and GFDL-ESM4 performing the best and worst in predicting the OA enhancement under severe droughts. However, all models significantly underestimate the OA increase in the SEUS, with Nor-ESM2-LM and MIRCO6 showing relatively better performance. This study reveals the key drivers of the elevated OA levels under droughts in the CONUS and underscores the deficiencies of current climate models in their predictive capacity for assessing the impact of future droughts on air quality."

We demonstrate that the aerosol–cloud interaction's effect on top-of-atmosphere energy gain strongly depends on the underlying SST, while the shortwave part of the spectrum is significantly more sensitive to SST. Furthermore, increasing aerosols influences upper-troposphere stability and thus anvil cloud fraction. 
 Clouds play a vital role in regulating Earth's energy balance and are impacted by anthropogenic aerosol concentration (Na) and sea   surface temperature (SST) alterations. Traditionally, these factors, aerosols and SST, are investigated independently. This study employs   cloud-resolving, radiative–convective-equilibrium (RCE) simulations to explore aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) under varying SSTs. ACIs are   found to be SST-dependent even under RCE conditions. Notably, changes in cloud radiative effects for both longwave radiation and shortwave radiation lead  to a decrease in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy gain with increasing Na. The changes in TOA shortwave flux exhibit greater sensitivity to underlying SST conditions compared to longwave radiation. To comprehend these trends, we perform a linear decomposition, analyzing the responses of different cloud regimes and contributions from changes in the cloud's opacity and occurrence. This breakdown reveals that ice and shallow clouds predominantly contribute to the radiative effect, mostly due to changes in the cloud's opacity and due to the Twomey effect, which is proportional to the baseline cloud fraction. Moreover, with an increase in Na, we observe an increase in latent heat release at the upper troposphere associated with heightened production of snow and graupel. We show that this trend, consistently across all SSTs, affects the anvil cloud cover by affecting the static stability at the upper troposphere via a similar mechanism to the stability iris effect, resulting in an increase in outgoing longwave radiation. In conclusion, under the ongoing climate change, studying the sensitivity of clouds to aerosols and SST should be conducted concomitantly as mutual effects are expected."

The publication offers a new toolbox, illustrating NA's fragmentation and pattern of kinetic degradation leading to the formation of new small molecules. Furthermore, the research strategy presented here demonstrates how a mass spectrometer can function as a gas-phase reactor and the quantum chemistry method can serve as a reaction model builder. 
 Norpinonic acid has been known as an important α-pinene atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) component. It is formed in the reaction of α-pinene, β-pinene or verbenone with atmospheric oxidizing reagents. In the presented study, tandem mass spectrometry techniques were used to determine the exact norpinonic acid fragmentation pathway in the gas phase. The precursor anion – deprotonated norpinonic acid (m/z 169), generated in an electrospray (ESI) source – was introduced into the collision cell of the mass spectrometer and fragmented using the energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation (ER-CID) technique. The experimental energy values of degradation processes were determined via analysis of the breakdown curves. Quantum chemical calculations of the reaction models were also constructed, including calculation of all transition states. Comparison between the experimental and the theoretical threshold energies calculated at a ωB97XD/6-311+G(2d,p) theoretical level has shown a good correlation. Two basic pathways of the fragmentation of the parent anion [M-H]− (m/z 169) were observed. Firstly this leads to the decarboxylation product (m/z 125) and secondly to the loss of a neutral molecule (C4H6O), together with the formation of the anion m/z 99. On the other hand, the breakdown of the anion m/z 125 gives rise to the m/z 69, 57 and 55 ions. To confirm structures formed during ER-CID experiments, the gas-phase proton transfer reactions were examined of all norpinonic acid anionic fragments with a series of neutral reagents, characterized by proton affinity (PA) values. Based on PA difference analysis, the most possible chemical structures were proposed for the observed fragment anions."

While impacts from large-scale meteorology were evaluated by separating ozone (O3) exceedance (>70 ppb) and non-exceedance (<70 ppb) days, we developed a technique that allows direct comparisons of small temporal variations between chemical and dynamics measurements under rapid dynamical transitions. 
 The NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory (CSL) conducted the Southwest Urban NOx and VOCs Experiment (SUNVEx) to study emissions and the role of boundary layer (BL) dynamics and sea-breeze (SB) transitions in the evolution of coastal air quality. The study presented utilizes remote sensing and in situ observations in Pasadena, California. Separate analyses are conducted on the synoptic conditions during ozone (O3) exceedance (>70 ppb) and non-exceedance (<70 ppb) days, as well as the fine-structure variability of in situ chemistry measurements during BL growth and SB transitions.Diurnal analyses spanning August 2021 revealed a markedly different wind direction during evenings preceding O3 exceedance (northerly) versus non-exceedance (easterly) days. Increased O3 occurred simultaneously with warmer and drier conditions, a reduction in winds, and an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). While the average BL height was lower and surface pressure was higher, the day-to-day variability of these quantities led to an overall weak statistical relationship. Investigations focused on the fine-structure variability of in situ chemistry measurements superimposed on background trends were conducted using a novel multivariate spectral coherence mapping (MSCM) technique that combined the spectral structure of two or more independent measurements through a wavelet analysis as reported by maximum-normalized scaleograms.  A case study was chosen to illustrate the MSCM technique, where the dominant peaks in scaleograms were identified and compared to BL height during the growth phase.  The temporal widths of peaks (τmax) derived from VOC and nitrogen oxide (NOx) scaleograms, as well as scaleograms combining VOCs, NOx, and variations in BL height, indicated a broadening with respect to time as the BL increased in depth. A separate section focused on comparisons between τmax and BL height during August 2021 revealed uncorrelated or weakly correlated scatter, except in the case of VOCs when really large τmax and relatively deep BL heights were ignored.  Instances of large τmax  and relatively deep BL heights occurred near sunrise and as onshore flow entered Pasadena, respectively.  Wind transitions likely influenced both the dynamical evolution of the BL and tracer advection and thus offer additional challenges when separating factors contributing to the fine structure.  Other insights gained from this work include observations of descending wind jets from the San Gabriel Mountains that were not resolved by the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model and the derivation of intrinsic properties of oscillations observed in NOx and O3 during the interaction between an SB and enhanced winds above the BL that flowed in opposition to the SB."

Our observations show that the enhanced light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon at the tropopause can be attributed to the formation of nitrogen-containing organic compounds through the aqueous-phase reactions of carbonyls with ammonium. 
 An enhanced formation of brown carbon (BrC) with a non-negligible warming effect at the tropopause has recently been found. However, its formation mechanism is unclear. Here, we report on a BrC formation process that happens during air mass upward transport by conducting simultaneous measurements on atmospheric BrC with a 4 h time resolution at the mountain foot (MF, 400 m a.s.l.) and mountainside (MS, 1120 m a.s.l.) of Mt. Hua, China, in the 2016 summer. Our results showed that the daytime light absorption (abs365 nm) of BrC on the MS is approximately 60 % lower than that at the MF due to a dilution effect caused by the planetary boundary layer expansion, but the daytime light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon on the MS is about 30 % higher than that at the MF, suggesting a significant formation of secondary BrC in the lifting process of air mass from the MF to the MS. Such a secondary formation accounted for > 50 % of BrC on the MS but only 27 % of BrC at the MF. Moreover, the N:C elemental ratio of the daytime BrC was 15 % higher on the MS than that at the MF, mainly due to an aerosol aqueous-phase formation of water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) compounds. Stable nitrogen isotope composition further indicated that such light-absorbing WSON compounds were produced from the aerosol aqueous-phase reaction of carbonyls with NH4+. Our work revealed, for the first time, that ammonia-induced aerosol aqueous reactions can significantly promote BrC formation during the air mass lifting process, which is probably responsible for an enhanced light absorption of BrC in the upper boundary layer."

Wuebbles,Understanding the role of contrails and contrail cirrus in climate change: a global perspective,"Radiative forcing of contrails could triple by 2050 due to increased air traffic and potential changes in flight altitudes. Factors like air traffic patterns, fuel efficiency, alternative fuels, and climate change further influence this impact. By highlighting gaps in knowledge and uncertainties, this research helps set priorities for future studies and assess strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation emissions. 
 Globally, emissions from aviation affect Earth's climate via complex processes. Contrail cirrus and carbon dioxide emissions are the largest factors contributing to aviation's radiative forcing on climate. Contrail cirrus, like natural cirrus clouds, impacts Earth's climate. Even with the extensive ongoing research, the relative importance of the climate effects of contrails compared to other aviation effects on climate still has major uncertainties requiring further research. Contrail cirrus encompasses linear contrails and the associated cirrus clouds; these are characterized by ice particle properties, e.g., size, concentration, mixing, extinction, ice water content, optical depth, geometrical depth, and cloud coverage. The climate impact of contrails may intensify due to projected increases in air traffic. The radiative forcing from global contrail cirrus has the potential to triple and could reach as much as 160 mW m−2 by 2050. This projection is based on anticipated growth in air traffic and a potential shift to higher altitudes. The future climate impact of contrail cirrus is influenced by factors like the magnitude and geographical spread in air traffic, advancements in fuel efficiency, the effects of the use of alternative fuels, and the effects of the changing climate on the background atmosphere. This study reviews the microphysical processes affecting contrail formation and the aging of contrails and contrail cirrus. Furthermore, the study explores global observational datasets for contrails, current analyses, and future projections and will aid in evaluating the effectiveness and tradeoffs associated with various mitigation strategies. The research highlights gaps in knowledge and uncertainties while outlining research priorities for the future."

Results show distinct differences based on both air mass source region (North America, Ocean, Caribbean/North Africa) and altitude for a given air mass type. This work highlights the sensitivity of remote marine areas to long-range transport and the importance of considering the vertical dependence of trace gas and aerosol properties. 
 Remote marine regions comprise a high fraction of Earth's surface, but in situ vertically resolved measurements over these locations remain scarce. Here we use airborne data during 15 vertical spiral soundings (0.15–8.5 km) over Bermuda during the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions over the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) to investigate the impact of different source regions on the vertical structure of trace gases, aerosol particles, and meteorological variables over 1000 km offshore of the US East Coast. Results reveal significant differences in vertical profiles of variables between three different air mass source categories (North America, Ocean, Caribbean/North Africa) identified using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model: (i) the strongest pollution signature is from air masses from the North America category, while the weakest one is from the Ocean category; (ii) North America air has the highest levels of CO, CH4, submicron particle number concentration, aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) mass, and organic mass fraction along with smoke layers in the free troposphere (FT); (iii) Ocean air has the highest relative amount of nitrate, non-sea-salt sulfate, and oxalate, which are key acidic species participating in chloride depletion; (iv) air masses from the Caribbean/North Africa showed a pronounced coarse aerosol signature in the FT and reduced aerosol hygroscopicity, which is associated with dust transport; and (v) there is considerable vertical heterogeneity for almost all variables examined, including higher O3 and submicron particle concentrations with altitude, suggesting that the FT is a potential contributor of both constituents in the marine boundary layer.

Satellite records of tropospheric ozone currently show large-scale inconsistencies in long-term trends. Our detailed study of the potential factors (e.g. satellite errors, where the satellite can observe ozone) potentially driving these inconsistencies found that, in North America, Europe, and East Asia, the underlying trends are typically small with large uncertainties. 
 Ozone is a potent air pollutant in the lower troposphere and an important short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) in the upper troposphere. Studies investigating long-term trends in the tropospheric column ozone (TCO3) have shown large-scale spatio-temporal inconsistencies. Here, we investigate the long-term trends in lower-tropospheric column ozone (LTCO3, surface–450 hPa sub-column) by exploiting a synergy of satellite and ozonesonde data sets and an Earth system model (UK's Earth System Model, UKESM) over North America, Europe, and East Asia for the decade 2008–2017. Overall, we typically find small LTCO3 linear trends with large uncertainty ranges using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), while model simulations indicate a stable LTCO3 tendency. The satellite a priori data sets show negligible trends, indicating that any year-to-year changes in the spatio-temporal sampling of these satellite data sets over the period concerned have not artificially influenced their LTCO3 temporal evolution. The application of the satellite averaging kernels (AKs) to the UKESM simulated ozone profiles, accounting for the satellite vertical sensitivity and allowing for like-for-like comparisons, has a limited impact on the modelled LTCO3 tendency in most cases. While, in relative terms, this is more substantial (e.g. on the order of 100 %), the absolute magnitudes of the model trends show negligible change. However, as the model has a near-zero tendency, artificial trends were imposed on the model time series (i.e. LTCO3 values rearranged from smallest to largest) to test the influence of the AKs, but simulated LTCO3 trends remained small. Therefore, the LTCO3 tendencies between 2008 and 2017 in northern-hemispheric regions are likely to be small, with large uncertainties, and it is difficult to detect any small underlying linear trends due to interannual variability or other factors which require further investigation (e.g. the radiative transfer scheme (RTS) used and/or the inputs (e.g. meteorological fields) used in the RTS)."

These properties are key to understanding the effect of dust upon climate. We found two different playa lakes according to the groundwater regime, which implies differences in crusts' cohesion state and mineralogy, which can affect the dust emission potential and properties. We also compare them with Moroccan Sahara crusts and Icelandic top sediments. 
 Constraining dust models to understand and quantify the effect of dust upon climate and ecosystems requires comprehensive analyses of the physiochemical properties of dust-emitting sediments in arid regions. Building upon previous studies in the Moroccan Sahara and Iceland, we analyse a diverse set of crusts and aeolian ripples (n=55) from various potential dust-emitting basins within the Mojave Desert, California, USA. Our focus is on characterizing the particle size distribution (PSD), mineralogy, aggregation/cohesion state, and Fe mode of occurrence. Our results show differences in fully and minimally dispersed PSDs, with crusts exhibiting average median diameters of 92 and 37 µm, respectively, compared to aeolian ripples with 226 and 213 µm, respectively. Mineralogical analyses unveiled strong variations between crusts and ripples, with crusts being enriched in phyllosilicates (24 % vs. 7.8 %), carbonates (6.6 % vs. 1.1 %), Na salts (7.3 % vs. 1.1 %), and zeolites (1.2 % and 0.12 %) and ripples being enriched in feldspars (48 % vs. 37 %), quartz (32 % vs. 16 %), and gypsum (4.7 % vs. 3.1 %). The size fractions from crust sediments display a homogeneous mineralogy, whereas those of aeolian ripples display more heterogeneity, mostly due to different particle aggregation. Bulk Fe content analyses indicate higher concentrations in crusts (3.0 ± 1.3 wt %) compared to ripples (1.9 ± 1.1 wt %), with similar proportions in their Fe mode of occurrence: nano-sized Fe oxides and readily exchangeable Fe represent ∼1.6 %, hematite and goethite ∼15 %, magnetite/maghemite ∼2.0 %, and structural Fe in silicates ∼80 % of the total Fe. We identified segregation patterns in the PSD and mineralogy differences in Na salt content within the Mojave basins, which can be explained by sediment transportation dynamics and precipitates due to groundwater table fluctuations described in previous studies in the region. Mojave Desert crusts show similarities with previously sampled crusts in the Moroccan Sahara in terms of the PSD and readily exchangeable Fe yet exhibit substantial differences in mineralogical composition, which should significantly influence the characteristic of the emitted dust particles."

It was found that intercomparisons among aerosol mixing-state parameters derived from different techniques can help us gain more insight into aerosol physical properties which, in turn, will aid the investigation of emission characteristics and secondary aerosol formation pathways. 
 ​​​​​​​This study compares aerosol mixing-state parameters obtained via simultaneous measurements using DMA–CCNC, H(/V)TDMA, and DMA–SP2, shedding light on the impacts of primary aerosol emissions and secondary aerosol (SA) formation. The analysis reveals significant variations in mixing-state parameters among different techniques, with VTDMA and DMA–SP2 indicating that non-volatile particles mainly stem from black carbon (BC)-containing aerosols, while a substantial proportion of nearly hydrophobic aerosols originates from fossil fuel combustion and biomass-burning emissions. Synthesizing the results, some nearly hydrophobic BC-free particles were found to be cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-inactive under the measured supersaturated conditions, likely from fossil fuel combustion emissions, while others were CCN-active, linked to biomass-burning emissions. Moreover, BC-containing aerosols emitted from fossil fuel combustion exhibit more external mixing with other aerosol components compared to those from biomass burning. Secondary nitrate and organic aerosol formation significantly affect aerosol mixing states, enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility while reducing heterogeneity among techniques. The study also highlights distinct physical properties of two resolved secondary organic aerosol factors, hinting at their formation through different mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of comparing aerosol mixing states from different techniques as a tool for understanding aerosol physical properties from different sources and their responses to SA formation, as well as aiding in the exploration of SA formation mechanisms."

Despite advances in science, not all the factors that lead to the formation of thunderclouds, to their charging and to lightning ignition are known in detail. This paper shows that lightning frequency may, to some extent, be modulated by solar activity and solar wind. Namely, in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly of the Earth's magnetic field, it correlates with the polarity and intensity of the solar wind. 
 The cross-correlation between annual lightning frequency and solar activity and the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) is examined on a global scale using corrected data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) for the period 2009 to 2022. Relatively large regions with significant cross-correlation coefficients (p<0.05) between the yearly lightning rates and sunspot number (SSN) are found in eastern Africa, part of South America overlapping with the South Atlantic Anomaly, and the Indian Ocean and west coast of Australia. The main region that shows a significant correlation between lightning activity and the By component of the HMF and the magnetopause reconnection Kan–Lee electric field matches the South Atlantic Anomaly quite well. Also shown are areas that show a significant cross-correlation of lightning activity with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation index.Similar areas of significant cross-correlation are obtained if simulated thunder days are used instead of lightning counts. Possible mechanisms leading to the observed correlations and limitations of the current study are discussed. The findings of the present study do not support previous works indicating that cosmic ray intensity is in phase with the global occurrence of lightning, but they do not rule out the role of cosmic rays in lightning ignition in developed thunderclouds and the role of energetic particles precipitating from the magnetosphere in the significant correlation between lightning and the By component of the HMF (SSN) in the South Atlantic Anomaly."

Our study highlights the differences in aerosol–cloud interactions between land and ocean and between precipitation clouds and non-precipitation clouds, and it differentiates and quantifies their underlying mechanisms. 
 In this study we explore aerosol–cloud interactions in liquid-phase clouds over eastern China (EC) and its adjacent ocean (ECO) using the WRF-Chem–SBM model with four-dimensional assimilation. The results show that our simulations and analyses based on each vertical layer provide a more detailed representation of the aerosol–cloud relationship compared to the column-based analyses which have been widely conducted previously. For aerosol activation, cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) generally increases with aerosol number concentration (Naero) at low Naero and decreases with Naero at high Naero. The main difference between EC and ECO is that Nd increases faster in ECO than EC at low Naero due to abundant water vapor, whereas at high Naero, when aerosol activation in ECO is suppressed, Nd in EC shows significant fluctuation due to strong surface effects (longwave radiation cooling and terrain uplift) and intense updrafts. Cloud liquid water content (CLWC) increases with Nd, but the increase rate gradually slows down for precipitating clouds, while CLWC increases and then decreases in non-precipitating clouds. Higher Nd and CLWC can be found in EC than in ECO, and the transition-point Nd value at which CLWC in non-precipitating clouds changes from increasing to decreasing is also higher in EC. Aerosol activation is strongest at moderate Naero, but CLWC increases relatively fast at low Naero. ECO cloud processes are more limited by cooling and humidification, whereas strong and diverse surface and atmospheric processes in EC allow intense cloud processes to occur under significant warming or drying conditions."

A potential approach to compensate for this is the use of satellite measurements of ozone, because cyclones impact the tropopause and therefore also ozone. In this study we used this connection to investigate the correlation between ozone and the tropopause in the Arctic and to identify cyclones with satellite ozone observations. 
 Large-scale meteorological events (e.g. cyclones), referred to as synoptic events, strongly influence weather predictability but still cannot be fully characterised in the Arctic region because of the sparse coverage of measurements. Due to the fact that atmospheric dynamics in the lower stratosphere and troposphere influence the ozone field, one approach to analyse these events further is the use of space-borne measurements of ozone vertical distributions and total columns in addition to conventional parameters such as pressure or wind speed. In this study we investigate the link between cyclones and changes in stratospheric ozone by using a combination of unique measurements during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) ship expedition, ozone profile and total column observations by satellite instruments (OMPS-LP, TROPOMI), and ERA5 reanalysis data. The final goal of the study is to assess whether the satellite ozone data can be used to obtain information about cyclones and provide herewith an additional value in the assimilation by numerical weather prediction models. Three special cases during the MOSAiC expedition were selected and classified for the analysis. They are one “normal” cyclone, where a low surface pressure coincides with a minimum in tropopause height, and two “untypical” cyclones, where this is not observed. The influence of cyclone events on ozone in the upper-troposphere lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region was investigated, using the fact that both are correlated with tropopause height changes. The negative correlation between tropopause height from ERA5 and ozone columns was investigated in the Arctic region for the 3-month period from June to August 2020. This was done using total ozone columns and sub-columns from TROPOMI, OMPS-LP, and MOSAiC ozonesonde data. The greatest influence of tropopause height changes on ozone contour levels occurs at an altitude between 10 and 20 km. Moreover, the lowering of the 250 ppb ozonopause (at about 11 km altitude) below 9 km was used to detect cyclones using OMPS-LP ozone observations. The potential of this approach was demonstrated in two case studies where the boundaries of cyclones could be determined using ozone observations. The results of this study can help improve our understanding of the relationship between cyclones, tropopause height, and ozone in the Arctic and demonstrate the usability of satellite ozone data in addition to the conventional parameters for investigating cyclones in the Arctic."

The effects of these wind reversals on aerosol and cloud characteristics are not well understood. Using data from multiple datasets we found that southerly flow periods had enhanced signatures of anthropogenic emissions due to shipping and continental sources, and clouds had more but smaller droplets. 
 Wind reversals resulting in southerly flow along the California coast are not well understood in terms of how aerosol and cloud characteristics change. This gap is addressed using airborne field measurements enhanced with data from spaceborne remote sensing (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), surface stations (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments), and models (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System and Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System), with a focus on submicron and supermicron aerosol, as well as cloud microphysical variables: cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud droplet effective radius (re). Southerly flow coincided with higher values of submicron aerosol concentration (Na) and mass concentrations of species representative of fine-aerosol pollution (NO3- and nss-SO42-) as well as shipping and continental emissions (V, oxalate, NH4+, Ni, OC, and EC). Supermicron Na did not change; however, heightened levels of acidic species in southerly flow coincided with reduced Cl− : Na+, suggestive of Cl− depletion in salt particles. Clouds responded correspondingly in southerly flow, with more acidic cloud water and higher levels of similar species as in the aerosol phase (e.g., NO3-, nss-SO42-, NH4+, V), along with elevated values of Nd and COT and reduced re during campaigns with similar cloud liquid water paths. Case study flights help to visualize offshore pollution gradients and highlight the sensitivity of the results to the presence of widespread smoke coverage including how associated plumes have enhanced supermicron Na.

A high-fidelity ambient instrumentation system was deployed at Madrid–Barajas Airport to measure the following: concentrations of organic aerosols (with their composition), black carbon (eBC), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), total hydrocarbon (THC), and total particle number. The average concentrations of eBC, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and THC at the airport for the entire campaign were 1.07 µg m−3, 22.7 µg m−3, 4.10 µg m−3, 9.35 µg m−3, 16.43 µg m−3, 0.23 mg m−3, and 2.30 mg m−3, respectively. The source apportionment analysis of the non-refractory organic aerosol (OA) using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) allowed us to discriminate between different sources of pollution, namely less oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA), alkane organic aerosol (AlkOA), and more oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA). The results showed that LO-OOA and MO-OOA account for more than 80 % of the total organic particle mass measured near the runway. Trace gases correlate better with the AlkOA factor than LO-OOA and MO-OOA, indicating that AlkOA is mainly related to primary combustion emissions. Bivariate polar plots were used for pollutant source identification. Significantly higher concentrations of the obtained factors were observed at low wind speeds (<3 m s−1) from the southwest, where two of the runways and all terminals are located. Higher SO2/NOx and CO/eBC ratios were observed when the winds originated from the northeast, where the two northern runways are located. These elevated ratios are attributed to the aircraft activity being the major pollutant source in the northeast area."

Lee,The effect of different climate and air quality policies in China on in situ ozone production in Beijing,"The impact of combined air quality and carbon neutrality policies on O3 formation in Beijing was investigated. Emissions inventory data were used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios relative to ground-level observations. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in alkenes, but large reductions in less reactive compounds led to larger reductions in future O3 production. This study highlights the importance of understanding the emissions of organic pollutants. 
 In recent years, clean air policies have led to reductions in air pollution across China. Alongside this, emerging carbon neutrality (CN) policies that aim to address the impacts of climate change may also deliver air quality (AQ) co-benefits or climate penalties. Different CN policies will lead to different changes in volatile organic compound (VOC), NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions, which will in turn impact the photochemical production of secondary pollutants such as ozone (O3). It is currently unclear how different combinations of AQ and CN policies may impact in situ O3 production across China in the future. A detailed chemical box model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism was developed to investigate the impact of combined AQ and CN policies on O3 formation in Beijing. The Multi-resolution Emission Inventory model for Climate and air pollution research (MEIC) and the Dynamic Projection model for Emissions in China (DPEC) were used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios, relative to ambient observations of 35 VOCs, NOx, CO and aerosol surface area (ASA) during the APHH-Beijing 2017 summer campaign. The most ambitious policy scenario, “Ambitious Pollution 1.5D Goals”, led to the largest reduction in O3 production by 2060 but was not the most impactful scenario for reducing O3 production between 2030–2045. Larger reductions were observed under the “Ambitious Pollution Neutral Goals” policy, which focuses on achieving net zero by 2060. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in the OLE2 group of VOCs (alkenes where kOH>7×104 ppm−1 min−1; a 5 % increase in OLE2 increased simulated O3 production by 1.12 %). However, reducing less reactive but higher concentration species in Beijing (such as short-chain alkanes) led to larger reductions in O3 production under all scenarios. O3 production was not sensitive to changes in ASA, with a 69 % decrease in ASA leading to a change of <1 % in O3. However, doubling biogenic VOCs in the model further increased O3 production in 2060 under all future scenarios by up to 18 %, indicating that the influence of future climate-induced changes in biogenic emissions may have a significant impact on in situ O3 formation in Beijing. This study highlights that the emission trajectories of certain specific VOCs are highly influential in determining possible future O3 air quality effects that may arise from increasing ambient temperatures and decarbonisation in Beijing."

Note that RFE increment is higher under clean conditions than that under polluted conditions, which is contributed to high-oxygen-content products. The enhanced RFE of amine–mineral particles caused by heterogenous oxidation is expected to alleviate warming effects. 
 The warming radiative forcing effect (RFE) derived from atmospheric amines attracts a lot of attention because of their contribution to brown carbon. Herein, the enhanced influence of amines (methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethylamine) on cooling RFE of mineral particles is first confirmed at visible wavelengths. Present results state heterogeneous uptake and oxidation reactions of atmospheric amines are feasible on mineral particles under clean and polluted conditions, which are proven by related thermodynamics and kinetics data obtained using combined classical molecular dynamics and density function theory methods. Based on mineral particles, simple forcing efficiency (SFE) results explain that amine uptake induces at least 11.8 %–29.5 % enhancement on cooling RFE of amine–mineral particles at visible wavelengths. After amine heterogeneous oxidation, oxidized amine–mineral particle cooling RFEs are furthermore enhanced due to increased oxygen contents. Moreover, oxidized amine–mineral particles under clean conditions show 27.1 %–47.1 % SFE increments at 400–600 nm, which is at least 11.3 % higher than that of itself under polluted conditions, due to high-oxygen-content product formation through amine autoxidation. Our results suggest cooling RFE derived from atmospheric amines can be equally important to their warming RFE on the atmosphere. It is necessary to update the heterogeneous oxidation mechanism and kinetics data of amines in atmospheric models in order to accurately evaluate the whole RFE caused by amines on the atmosphere."

Thus, implementing a global ultra-low-sulfur oil policy needs to be optimized in the near future. 
 Mandatory use of low-sulfur fuel according to the global sulfur limit regulation has reduced the emissions of SO2 and particulate matter (PM) significantly on ships, and it also leads to a very large uncertainty in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Therefore, an on-board test of VOCs from nine typical cargo ships with low-sulfur fuels in China was carried out in this study. Results showed that the emission factor of VOCs (EFVOCs) varied largely from 0.09 to 3.01 g kg−1 of fuel, with domestic coastal cargo ships (CCSs) having the highest level, followed by inland cargo ships (ICSs) and ocean-going vessels (OGVs). The switch of fuels from heavy fuel oil (HFO) to diesel increased EFVOCs by 48 % on average, which enhanced both O3 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential, especially for OGVs. Besides, the use of low-sulfur fuels for OGVs also led to a significant increase in naphthalene emission. These indicated that the implementation of a global ultra-low-sulfur oil policy in the near future needs to be optimized. Moreover, aromatics were the most important common contributors to O3 and SOA in ship exhausts, which need to be controlled as a matter of priority. It was also found that the benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene ratio of 0.5:0.3:0.2 on average could be considered a diagnostic characteristic to distinguish ship emissions from other emission sources."

Crowley,NO3 reactivity during a summer period in a temperate forest below and above the canopy,"In the scope of a field campaign in a suburban forest near Paris in the summer of 2022, we measured the reactivity of the nitrate radical NO3 towards biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs; e.g. monoterpenes) mainly below but also above the canopy. NO3 reactivity was the highest during nights with strong temperature inversions and decreased strongly with height. Reactions with BVOCs were the main removal process of NO3 throughout the diel cycle below the canopy. 
 We present direct measurements of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC)-induced nitrate radical (NO3) reactivity (kVOC) through the diel cycle in the suburban, temperate forest of Rambouillet near Paris (France). The data were obtained in a 6-week summer period in 2022 as part of the Atmospheric ChemistRy Of the Suburban foreSt (ACROSS) campaign. kVOC was measured in a small (700 m2) clearing mainly at a height of 5.5 m above ground level but also at 40 m (for 5 d and nights). At nighttime, mean values (and 25th–75th percentile ranges) of knightVOC(5.5m) = (0.24-0.06+0.32) s−1 and knightVOC(40m) = (0.016-0.007+0.018) s−1 indicate a significant vertical gradient and low NO3 reactivity above the canopy, whereas knightVOC(5.5 m) showed peak values of up to 2 s−1 close to the ground. The strong vertical gradient in NO3 reactivity could be confirmed by measurements between 0 and 24 m on one particular night characterized by a strong temperature inversion and is a result of the decoupling of air masses aloft from the ground- and canopy-level sources of BVOCs (and nitric oxide, NO). No strong vertical gradient was observed in the mean daytime NO3 reactivity, with kdayVOC(5.5m) = (0.12 ± 0.04) s−1 for the entire campaign and kdayVOC(40m) = (0.07 ± 0.02) s−1 during the 5 d period.Within the clearing, the fractional contribution of VOCs to the total NO3 loss rate coefficient (ktot, determined by photolysis, reaction with NO and VOCs) was 80 %–90 % during the night and ∼ 50 % during the day. In terms of chemical losses of α-pinene below canopy height in the clearing, we find that at nighttime hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozone (O3) dominate, with NO3 contributing “only” 17 %, which decreases further to 8.5 % during the day. Based on measured OH, measured O3, and calculated NO3 concentrations, the chemical lifetime of BVOCs at noon is about 1 h and is likely to be longer than timescales of transport out of the canopy (typically of the order of minutes), thus significantly reducing the importance of daytime in-canopy processing. Clearly, in forested regions where sufficient nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx) is available, the role of NO3 and OH as initiators of BVOC oxidation is not strictly limited to nighttime and daytime, respectively, as often implied in e.g. atmospheric chemistry textbooks."

Numerical simulation experiments showed CRI could cause a 50 % reduction in aerosol radiation interaction (ARI) under a low-trough system. The results emphasized the nonnegligible role of CRI and its inhibition of ARI under wet and cloudy pollution synoptic patterns. 
 Persistent winter aerosol pollution frequently occurs in the Sichuan Basin (SCB) due to its unfavourable weather conditions, such as low wind, wetness, and cloudiness. Based on long-term observational data analyses from 2015–2021, it has been found that the four representative stations in  the SCB often simultaneously experience PM2.5 pollution accompanied by variations in meteorological conditions above 850 hPa, which indicates a connection between regional winter air pollution in the SCB and large-scale synoptic patterns. The dominant 850 hPa synoptic patterns of winter in the SCB were classified into six patterns using T-model principal component analysis: (1) strong high pressure in the north, (2) east high–west low (EHWL) pressure, (3) weak high pressure in the north, (4) a weak ridge of high pressure after the trough, (5) a low trough (LT), and (6) strong high pressure. Pattern 2 characterized by the EHWL pressure system, and Pattern 5, featured with LT, was identified as having key synoptic patterns for the beginning and accumulation of pollution processes. Pattern 1, characterized by a strong high pressure in the north, was the cleanest pattern associated with reduced PM2.5 concentrations. The EHWL and LT patterns were associated with a remarkably high cloud liquid content attributed to upper southerly winds introducing humid air. Clouds reduce solar radiation through reflection and scattering, resulting in more stable stratification and aerosol accumulation. This cloud radiation interaction (CRI) was more pronounced in the LT pattern due to denser isobaric lines and stronger southerly winds than in the EHWL pattern. Numerical simulation experiments utilizing WRF-Chem indicated that there is an upper-level heating during afternoon and surface cooling in the morning forced by the aerosol radiation interaction (ARI) under the EHWL and LT patterns. Additionally, strong surface cooling in the evening influenced by valley winds could be found. With wet and cloudy synoptic forcing, ARI directly affects the stability of the boundary layer and is modulated through CRI inhibition. For example, Chongqing exhibited lower PM2.5 concentrations and stronger ARI compared to the western and southern SCB due to lower cloud liquid content and weaker CRI inhibition on the ARI. The CRI inhibition caused a 50 % reduction in solar radiation and boundary layer height during the daytime under the LT pattern, which was larger than that under the EHWL pattern. This study comprehensively analysed the spatial disparities in cloud inhibition on the ARIs, their impacts on the boundary layer structure, and the discrepancies of these interactions under different synoptic patterns during pollution processes. The findings have important implications for the effective management of pollution processes in cloudy and foggy weather."

 2023 was the warmest year on record, influenced by multiple warm ocean basins. This has prompted speculation of an acceleration in surface warming, or a stronger than expected influence from loss of aerosol induced cooling. Here we use a recent Green’s function-based method to quantify the influence of sea surface temperature patterns on the 2023 global temperature anomaly, and compare them to previous record warm years. We show that the strong deviation from recent warming trends is consistent with previously observed sea surface temperature influences, and regional forcing. This indicates that internal variability was a strong contributor to the exceptional 2023 temperature evolution, in combination with steady anthropogenic global warming. 2023 temperatures fall in line with historical trends, with warm anomalies typical of El Niño, indicating dominance of sea surface temperature variability and regional forcing, according to an analysis for isolating the 2023 global surface contribution from various ocean basins."

 Vegetation growth may adapt to climate warming by adjusting the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature. However, changes in the optimal temperature for ecosystem productivity during recent decades of warming remain uncertain. Here we provide empirical evidence that global optimal temperature increased at a rate of 0.017 ± 0.002 °C y−1 from 1982 to 2016, using multiple datasets of satellite-derived productivity and climate variables. Model simulations show that the optimal temperature will increase by 0.027 ± 0.001 °C y−1 until the end of 21st century. The global increasing optimal temperature is consistent with increasing mean air temperatures and model simulations further confirm the key role of temperature in regulating changes in optimal temperature, while being co-regulated by other factors, such as CO2 and precipitation. These results suggest that vegetation is acclimating to warming and that the negative impacts of climate change on ecosystem productivity may be less severe than previously thought.

 Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is known to cause adverse health outcomes. Most of the evidence has been derived from developed countries, with lower pollution levels and different demographics and comorbidities from the rest of the world. Here we leverage new satellite-based measurements of PM2.5, combined with comprehensive public records in Chile, to study the effect of PM2.5 pollution on elderly mortality. We find that a 10 μg/m3 monthly increase in PM2.5 exposure is associated with a 1.7% increase (95% C.I.: 1.1–2.4%) in all-cause mortality for individuals aged 75+. Satellite-based measurements allow us to comprehensively investigate heterogeneous effects. We find remarkably similar effect sizes across baseline exposure, rural and urban areas, income, and over time, demonstrating consistency in the evidence on mortality effects of PM2.5 exposure. The most notable source of heterogeneity is geographical, with effects closer to 5% in the center-south and in the metropolitan area.

 Detecting and interpreting long-term changes in typhoon translation speed in observations remains challenging, contrasting with increased confidence in the poleward migration of typhoons. Here, I show a significant relationship between the basin-wide translation speed and the latitudinal position of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific over 1980–2023. First, because tropical cyclones move faster at higher latitudes, the significant poleward migration (80 km/decade) increases the yearly basin-wide translation speed by 5% over the period. This effect reduces the detectability of a slowing trend. Second, the basin-wide translation speed solely contributed by regional translation speed has slowed by 18%, mostly in the late stage of the cyclone lifecycle. The translation speed slowdown and the poleward migration are likely caused by the same climate drivers through the interconnected large-scale atmospheric circulation between the tropics and subtropics. My findings suggest exacerbated tropical cyclone-related risk in the subtropical regions in a changing climate."

 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is an important photochemical product and affects ozone (O3) formation in the troposphere. Yet, the long-term observation of PAN remains scarce, limiting the full understanding of its impacts on photochemical pollution. Here, we observed PAN from 2018 to 2022 in urban Fuzhou, Southeastern China. We found that, in contrast to upward trend of O3, PAN concentrations shown a significant decreasing trend at an average rate of −0.07 ppb/year. NO2, CO, UVB, and T contributed to the decreasing trend of PAN according to Machine learning analyses, while the effect of O3-represented atmospheric oxidation capacity on PAN was fluctuating from year to year. Chemical box model revealed active PA production and depletion in Fuzhou. Thus, despite the decreasing PAN concentration, PAN chemistry effectively promoted O3 formation by rising ROx levels, leading to increases of 2.18%–58.4% in net O3 production rate in different years.

 Nitrous acid (HONO), a key precursor of hydroxyl radicals (OH), is one of the factors affecting atmospheric chemistry and air quality. Currently, the proposed sources of HONO are not able to fully explain observed HONO concentrations. In this study, a comprehensive field observation of HONO was conducted in the autumn of 2021 in urban Beijing. The box model using a default Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) was unable to reproduce the observed HONO concentrations with a normalized mean bias (NMB) of −92.8%. The NMB improved to −46.1% after the inclusion of seven additional HONO formation pathways. Several factors like vehicle emission factor (1.23%) and nocturnal NO2 heterogeneous uptake coefficient on the ground surface (8.25 × 10−6) were calculated based on observational data. The enhancement factor for nocturnal NO2 heterogeneous conversion was established as a function of relative humidity (RH) and incorporated into the model, which compensated for the missing nocturnal HONO sources and well-reproduced the observed HONO concentrations, with an NMB of −5.1%. The major source of HONO at night was found to be the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on the ground surface, contributing up to 85.6%.

 Previous studies have shown that aerosols invigorate deep convective systems (DCS). However, the magnitude or even the existence of aerosol invigoration of DCS remains controversial. Here, we aimed to observationally quantify the full aerosol effects on DCS by tracking their entire lifecycle and spatial extent in tropical regions. We found that fine aerosols (FA) can invigorate DCS, making them taller and longer lived, and resulting in up to ×5 increase in total area and rainfall amount. In contrast, added coarse sea salt aerosols (CSA) over the ocean can inhibit the vertical development of DCS through enhancing warm rain formation, yet resulting in longer lived and extensive DCSs. Notably, combining FA and CSA generates the strongest aerosol invigoration effect at the concentrations of ~5 and ~80 μg/m³, leading up to ×10 increase in rainfall amount. Our results indicate that aerosols significantly redistribute convective precipitation and climate effects, greatly underestimated in previous studies."

Chelluboyina;Taveen S. Kapoor;Rajan K. Chakrabarty,Dark brown carbon from wildfires: a potent snow radiative forcing agent?,"Dark brown carbon from wildfires: a potent snow radiative forcing agent? 
 Deposition of wildfire smoke on snow contributes to its darkening and accelerated snowmelt. Recent field studies have identified dark brown carbon (d-BrC) to contribute 50–75% of shortwave absorption in wildfire smoke. d-BrC is a distinct class of water-insoluble, light-absorbing organic carbon that co-exists in abundance with black carbon (BC) in snow across the world. However, the importance of d-BrC as a snow warming agent relative to BC remains unexplored. We address this gap using aerosol-snow radiative transfer calculations on datasets from laboratory and field measurement. We show d-BrC increases the annual mean snow radiative forcing between 0.6 and 17.9 W m−2, corresponding to different wildfire smoke deposition scenarios. This is a 1.6 to 2.1-fold enhancement when compared with BC-only deposition on snow. This study suggests d-BrC is an important contributor to snowmelt in midlatitude glaciers, where ~40% of the world’s glacier surface area resides."

L. Chan;Sheng Chen;Qihua Peng;Dongxiao Wang,China coasts facing more tropical cyclone risks during the second decaying summer of double-year La Niña events,"China coasts facing more tropical cyclone risks during the second decaying summer of double-year La Niña events 
 Long-lasting La Niña events (including double-year and triple-year La Niña events) have become more frequent in recent years. How the multi-year La Niña events affect tropical cyclone (TC) activities in the western North Pacific (WNP) and whether they differ from single-year La Niña events are unknown. Here we show that TCs are more active over the far-WNP (FWNP, 110°–150°E), leading to marked high risks at China coasts during the second decaying summer of double-year La Niña events. The anomalous TC activities are directly related to the enhanced cyclonic anomaly over the FWNP, possibly a result of large-scale remote forcing initiated by the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) cooling. The persistent TNA cooling from the decaying winter to summer of double-year La Niña events drives westerlies over the Indo-western Pacific through Kelvin waves, which induce the cooling over the north Indian Ocean via the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature effect, favoring the asymmetric heat distribution pattern and stimulating an anomalous vertical circulation over the eastern Indian Ocean to FWNP. The cooling over the north Indian Ocean also excites Gill responses, magnifying the TNA-induced westerlies and boosting the anomalous vertical circulation, and thus gives rise to the strong cyclonic circulation anomaly over the FWNP in summer. We suggest that the key point of the process is the strong TNA cooling related to the persistent negative Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) while double-year La Niña events decay, distinct from the rapid decline of PNA and NAO during single-year La Niña events. The work provides a unique perspective on understanding TC activities over the WNP related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation."

 The 2023 Canadian forest fires have been extreme in scale and intensity with more than seven times the average annual area burned compared to the previous four decades1. Here, we quantify the carbon emissions from these fires from May to September 2023 on the basis of inverse modelling of satellite carbon monoxide observations. We find that the magnitude of the carbon emissions is 647 TgC (570–727 TgC), comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of large nations, with only India, China and the USA releasing more carbon per year2. We find that widespread hot–dry weather was a principal driver of fire spread, with 2023 being the warmest and driest year since at least 19803. Although temperatures were extreme relative to the historical record, climate projections indicate that these temperatures are likely to be typical during the 2050s, even under a moderate climate mitigation scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway, SSP 2–4.5)4. Such conditions are likely to drive increased fire activity and suppress carbon uptake by Canadian forests, adding to concerns about the long-term durability of these forests as a carbon sink5–8.

 HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas, predominantly emitted as an undesired by-product during the synthesis and processing of HCFC-22 (ref. 1). Previously, the Clean Development Mechanism and national efforts called for the implementation of abatement technology for reducing HFC-23 emissions2,3. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2019, a divergence was found between the global emissions derived from atmospheric observations and those expected from reported abatement1,2. Primarily, this points to insufficient implementation of abatement strategies2,4, calling for independent verification of the emissions at the individual chemical facility level. Here we use regional atmospheric observations and a new, deliberately released tracer to quantify the HFC-23 emissions from an HCFC-22 and fluoropolymer production facility, which is equipped with waste gas destruction technology. We find that our inferred HFC-23/HCFC-22 emission factor of 0.19% (0.13–0.24%) broadly fits within the emission factor considered practicable for abatement projects5,6. Extrapolation to global HCFC-22 production underscores that the operation of appropriate destruction technology has the potential to reduce global HFC-23 emissions by at least 84% (69–100%) (14 (12–16) Gg yr−1). This reduction is equivalent to 17% CO2 emissions from aviation in 2019 (ref. 7). We also demonstrate co-destruction of PFC-318, another by-product and greenhouse gas. Our findings show the importance of the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which obligates parties to destroy HFC-23 emissions from facilities manufacturing hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons “to the extent practicable” from 2020 onwards8.

 Cold plasma of ionospheric origin has recently been found to be a much larger contributor to the magnetosphere of Earth than expected1–3. Numerous competing mechanisms have been postulated to drive ion escape to space, including heating and acceleration by wave–particle interactions4 and a global electrostatic field between the ionosphere and space (called the ambipolar or polarization field)5,6. Observations of heated O+ ions in the magnetosphere are consistent with resonant wave–particle interactions7. By contrast, observations of cold supersonic H+ flowing out of the polar ionosphere8,9 (called the polar wind) suggest the presence of an electrostatic field. Here we report the existence of a +0.55 ± 0.09 V electric potential drop between 250 km and 768 km from a planetary electrostatic field (E∥⊕ = 1.09 ± 0.17 μV m−1) generated exclusively by the outward pressure of ionospheric electrons. We experimentally demonstrate that the ambipolar field of Earth controls the structure of the polar ionosphere, boosting the scale height by 271%. We infer that this increases the supply of cold O+ ions to the magnetosphere by more than 3,800%, in which other mechanisms such as wave–particle interactions can heat and further accelerate them to escape velocity. The electrostatic field of Earth is strong enough by itself to drive the polar wind9,10 and is probably the origin of the cold H+ ion population1 that dominates much of the magnetosphere2,3.

 Wildfires cause critical shifts in ecosystem functions, such as dramatic reductions in vegetation productivity. However, how fast vegetation regains its pre-fire productivity levels and the key influencing factors remain poorly understood on a global scale. Here we present the global estimates of post-fire vegetation productivity recovery from 2004 to 2021 using gross primary productivity observations and related proxies at a spatial resolution of 10 km, employing a random forest model to identify the key factors influencing recovery time. Roughly 87% of burned vegetation regained pre-fire productivity levels within 2 years, with evergreen needleleaf forests and savannas displaying the lengthiest recovery periods. During the recovery phase, post-fire climate conditions, such as soil moisture, vapour pressure deficit and air temperature, had nonlinear impacts on recovery time globally. These climatic factors exhibited a dominant role in regional recovery time in ~89% of the globally assessed area. As climate aridity decreased, the areas where recovery time was dominated by soil moisture and vapour pressure deficit decreased, while the influence of temperature increased. Soil-moisture-dominated regions witnessed reduced proportions of promoting vegetation recovery as aridity decreased, whereas vapour pressure deficit and air-temperature-dominated regions saw an increase in such proportions. Regions with strong human interventions were associated with accelerated vegetation recovery compared with similar ecosystems with smaller human interventions. These findings had important implications for global carbon-cycle assessments and fire-management strategies. More than 80% of vegetation burned globally regained its pre-fire level of productivity within 2 years, according to an assessment of post-fire vegetation productivity from 2004 to 2021."

 The surface of Antarctica is continuously shaped by erosion, blowing snow and deposition, resulting in diverse aeolian bedforms akin to those observed in subtropical sand deserts. However, although dunes are universally recognized as a climate and environmental proxy, the properties of snow dunes are not well understood. Here, using satellite images covering most of Antarctica, we report the widespread occurrence (>95% of the area studied) of linear dunes that are between 100 and 1,000 m in length and aligned with the local resultant snow drift direction (61% are longitudinal dunes). On the basis of sand dune theory, we suggest that these snow dunes grow by elongation, often under unidirectional wind regimes. The predominance of the elongating mode indicates a low availability of mobile snow particles. This limited availability prevails at the continental scale due to a subtle balance between snow sintering, which limits erosion, and strong winds, which rapidly remove snowfall. These characteristics result from specific meteorological conditions that distinguish Antarctica from other snow-covered regions, and may shift with future climate changes. We suggest that snow sintering not only influences Antarctic aeolian landform evolution but also regulates the amount of snow sublimated during transport, an uncertain term in the ice-sheet mass balance.

Previous studies using the lidar observations derived the temperature trends and solar responses solely from the traditional nocturnal measurements. While these archived results are more or less in agreement with modeling studies, one of the main uncertainties in these studies is the potential biases induced by the trends of the diurnal tide forced in the lower atmosphere, and that of the in situ exothermal reactions involving the photolysis. In the MLT, the diurnal tide has significant seasonal variations, considerable amplitude and is one of the dominant dynamic sources. However, its potential effects in the trend studies have rarely been discussed. In this paper, we present and compare the long‐term temperature trends in the upper mesosphere utilizing the daily mean and nightly mean temperature profiles measured by a Sodium (Na) Doppler lidar at midlatitude.

A customized multi‐linear regression (MLR) model is applied to determine the linear trends and the other fitting parameters, such as ENSO and solar F10.7 responses in the upper mesosphere. This study indicates the daily mean cooling trend between 84 and 98 km is larger than that of nightly mean trend by ∼−1 K/decade, while differences in the solar response are within the fitting uncertainties."

Kok;Michael Schulz,Where Dust Comes From: Global Assessment of Dust Source Attributions With AeroCom Models,"The source of dust in the global atmosphere is an important factor to better understand the role of dust aerosols in the climate system. However, it is a difficult task to attribute the airborne dust over the remote land and ocean regions to their origins since dust from various sources are mixed during long‐range transport. Recently, a multi‐model experiment, namely the AeroCom‐III Dust Source Attribution (DUSA), has been conducted to estimate the relative contribution of dust in various locations from different sources with tagged simulations from seven participating global models. The BASE run and a series of runs with nine tagged regions were made to estimate the contribution of dust emitted in East‐ and West‐Africa, Middle East, Central‐ and East‐Asia, North America, the Southern Hemisphere, and the prominent dust hot spots of the Bodélé and Taklimakan Deserts. The models generally agree in large scale mean dust distributions, however models show large diversity in dust source attribution. The inter‐model differences are significant with the global model dust diversity in 30%–50%, but the differences in regional and seasonal scales are even larger. The multi‐model analysis estimates that North Africa contributes 60% of global atmospheric dust loading, followed by Middle East and Central Asia sources (24%). Southern hemispheric sources account for 10% of global dust loading, however it contributes more than 70% of dust over the Southern Hemisphere. The study provides quantitative estimates of the impact of dust emitted from different source regions on the globe and various receptor regions including remote land, ocean, and the polar regions synthesized from the seven models."

In some regions, the methane burden and budget are still not well understood due to the lack of in situ observations, especially vertical profile observations. Here, we present the first high‐resolution aircraft‐based tropospheric vertical profiles of CH4 across the Indian subcontinent. Observations show significant variability, with the largest variability seen in the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP) during post‐monsoon (September). The IGP also shows the highest concentrations and a peak in the boundary layer. By contrast, observations over western India show lower variability, especially during the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) (July). During ASM, when CH4 emissions peak, the vertical updraft of CH4 and other tracers is observed, leading to a peak between 4 and 5 km. During winter, the peak occurs in the boundary layer, and a decrease with altitude is observed. Model simulations slightly overestimate CH4 at the surface during some seasons but underestimate it at higher altitudes during all seasons. Integrated over the observed column, model simulations slightly underpredict CH4 (0.5%–3.1%) during all seasons. Calculations made using the observed CO/CH4 enhancement ratios show that in addition to anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions, other sources, such as rice cultivation and wetlands, need to be considered to reproduce the observed CH4 concentrations."

However, there is limited understanding of the detailed chemical composition, size distribution, and optical properties of RB aerosols in this region. To characterize these important aerosol properties, ambient PM2.5 and size resolved aerosols from RB emissions in Lhasa were collected during summer 2019. Organic functional group (OFG) and inorganic ion composition was measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ion chromatography, respectively. The ambient PM2.5 was dominated by organic components, with the OFG concentrations significantly higher during religious events, reflecting the substantial impact of RB emissions on local air quality. The RB aerosols were characterized by high fractions of alkane (34%), hydroxyl (29%), and carboxylic acid (13%) groups, with peak mass in the accumulation mode (0.56–1.00 μm). The high abundance of hydroxyl group and the size distribution pattern suggested that the RB aerosols were formed from volatilization of fuel materials followed by unaltered condensation, a process that may be unique to the low‐temperature, low‐oxygen burning in the scattered burners at the temples. The absorption coefficient of RB aerosols showed similar size distribution to the mass size distribution, but the absorption Ångström exponent displayed the lowest value in the 0.56–1.00 μm size mode. This specific size distribution aligned with the mass fraction of carboxylic acids and mirrored the mass proportion of alkanes, suggesting that smaller and larger particles were enriched with substances that have higher light‐absorbing capabilities."

Analysis reveals that Amazon thunderstorms are likely composed of ice crystals smaller but more numerous than those in the Congo Basin, resulting in half as many flashes per PF on average in the Amazon, for similar Ice Water Content (IWC) or Area of 30 dBZ at −10°C (Acharge). The increase of the flash count following an increase of the IWC (Acharge) is only 72% (61%) as effective in the Amazon as it would be in the Congo Basin area. PFs with similar 30 dBZ radar echo top heights exhibit lower Brightness Temperatures (TBs) in the 85/89, 165, and 183 GHz frequencies over the Amazon, indicating more numerous smaller ice particles compared to those over the Congo Basin, which tend to show colder TBs at 37 GHz, possibly due to more numerous large graupel or hail particles. Comparisons of TBs in PFs with similar 30 dBZ echo top temperature between the Amazon and 3 × 3º global grids show that the median TB in Amazon is higher than that in most oceanic areas but is comparable to areas having high oceanic lightning activity (e.g., South Pacific Convergence Zone).

We report on measurements of particle composition, particle size, ice nucleating particle (INP) composition, and INP size during an ice fog period (29 January–3 February). During this period, coarse particulate matter (PM10) concentrations increased by 150% in association with a decrease in air temperature, a stronger temperature inversion, and relatively stagnant conditions. Results also show a 18%–78% decrease in INPs during the ice fog period, indicating that particles had activated into the ice fog via nucleation. Peroxide and heat treatments performed on INPs indicated that, on average, the largest contributions to the INP population were heat‐labile (potentially biological, 63%), organic (31%), then inorganic (likely dust, 6%). Measurements of levoglucosan and bulk and single‐particle composition corroborate the presence of dust and aerosols from combustion sources. Heat‐labile and organic INPs decreased during the peak period of the ice fog, indicating those were preferentially activated, while inorganic INPs increased, suggesting they remained as interstitial INPs. In general, INP concentrations were unexpectedly high in Fairbanks compared to other locations in the Arctic during winter. The fact that these INPs likely facilitated ice fog formation in Fairbanks has implications for other high latitude locations subject to the hazards associated with ice fog."

Although there exist numerical models with realistic BC morphologies, these models are mostly limited to particle‐scale studies and have not been coupled to large‐scale atmospheric or climate models. In this study, a multidimensional parameterization scheme is developed by an accurate numerical algorithm for BC optical property calculation in global climate models, by incorporating their mixing state and nonspherical structure as well as heterogeneous coating distribution. The scheme was coupled and tested with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) by a weighted averaging algorithm for individual particles and integration for particle ensembles. The simulation results indicate that BC morphology has a limited influence on the aerosol absorption cross section (Cabs), and the differences in Cabs between irregularly coated fractal aggregates and ideal core‐shell spherical (CS) counterparts are ∼3% on average. However, the relative positions between the BC core and coating parts may introduce Cabs variations of up to 69% as compared with the CS results. The BC mixing state introduce ∼20% relative variations in the global average aerosol absorption optical depth, which is comparable to that of heterogeneity of coating distribution and three times greater than that of particle nonsphericity. Furthermore, the normalized mean biases of modeled single scattering coalbedo (1−SSA, i.e., the ratio of absorption to extinction) compared to those observed in BC‐rich regions are reduced by 20%∼80% when applying our new parameterization in CAM6."

Nitrous acid (HONO), as the predominant source of hydroxyl radicals (OH), are acknowledged to be essential for secondary pollution. However, HONO concentrations are usually underestimated by current air quality models due to the inadequate representations of its sources. In the present study, we revised the Weather Research and Forecasting & Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) model by incorporating additional HONO sources, including primary emissions, photo‐/dark oxidation of NOx, heterogeneous uptake of NO2 on surfaces, and nitrate photolysis. By combining in‐situ measurements in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, we found the improved model show much better performance on HONO simulation and is capable of reproducing observed high concentrations. The source‐oriented method is employed to quantitatively understand the relative importance of various processes, which showed that heterogeneous NO2 uptake on the ground surface was the major contributor to HONO formation in urban areas. Comparatively, photo‐oxidation of NOx is a main contributor in rural areas. The introduction of multiple sources of HONO led to an apparent increase in OH and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The promoted HO2 levels further increased diurnal O3 concentration by 4.5–12.9 ppb, while secondary inorganic and organic concentrations were also increased by 14%–32% during a typical secondary pollution event. The improved description of HONO emission and formation in the model substantially narrowed the gaps between simulations and observations, highlighting the great importance in understanding and numerical representations of HONO in secondary pollution study."

The sintering was found to be the major emission process of ODSs, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methyl halide (CH3Cl), methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide and halogenated very short‐lived substances. The median emission factors of CFC‐113, CFC‐115, HCFC‐22, and CH3Cl for typical sintering processes are 1.7, 0.7, 44.5 and 237.0 mg/t, respectively.

Annual amounts of ODS and CFC‐11‐equivalent emissions were estimated to be 1,785 tons and 78 tons in 2019 over mainland China, respectively.

We leverage data collected during the RALI‐THINICE airborne campaign that took place near Svalbard in August 2022 to evaluate the simulation of mid‐level clouds associated with Arctic cyclones. Simulations are carried out with the new limited‐area configuration of the ICOLMDZ model which combines the recent icosahedral dynamical core DYNAMICO and the physics of LMDZ, the atmospheric component of the IPSL‐CM Earth System Model. Airborne radar and microphysical probes measurements are then used to evaluate the simulated clouds. A comparison method has been set‐up to guarantee as much as possible the spatiotemporal co‐location between observed and simulated cloud fields. We mostly focus on the representation of ice and liquid in‐cloud contents and on their vertical distribution. Results show that the model overestimates the amount of cloud condensates and exhibits a poor cloud phase spatial distribution, with too much liquid water far from cloud top and too much ice close to it. The downward gradual increase in snowfall flux is also not captured by the model. This in‐depth model evaluation thereby pinpoints priorities for further improvements in the ICOLMDZ cloud scheme."

Satellite‐based instruments capture NO2 amounts through the atmospheric column with global coverage at regular spatial resolution, but do not directly measure surface NO2. This study compares regression methods using satellite NO2 data from the TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to estimate annual surface NO2 concentrations in varying geographic and land use settings across the continental U.S. We then apply the best‐performing regression models to estimate surface NO2 at 0.01° by 0.01° resolution, and we term this estimate as quasi‐NO2 (qNO2). qNO2 agrees best with measurements at suburban sites (cross‐validation (CV) R2 = 0.72) and away from major roads (CV R2 = 0.75). Among U.S. regions, qNO2 agrees best with measurements in the Midwest (CV R2 = 0.89) and agrees least in the Southwest (CV R2 = 0.65).

In this study, plumes from open burning of corn straw were introduced into a smog chamber to explore the evolution of Eabs during photochemical aging. The light absorption of BC was measured with and without coating materials by using a thermodenuder, while the size distributions of aerosols and composition of BC coating materials were also monitored. Eabs was found to increase initially, and then decrease with an overall downward trend. The lensing effect dominated in Eabs at 520 nm, with an estimated contribution percentages of 47.5%–94.5%, which is far greater than light absorption of coated brown carbon (BrC). The effects of thickening and chemical composition changes of the coating materials on Eabs were evaluated through comparing measured Eabs with that calculated by the Mie theory. After OH exposure of 1 × 1010 molecules cm−3 s, the thickening of coating materials led to an Eabs increase by 3.2% ± 1.6%, while the chemical composition changes or photobleaching induced an Eabs decrease by 4.7% ± 0.6%. Simple forcing estimates indicate that coated BC aerosols exhibit warming effects that were reduced after aging. The oxidation of light‐absorbing CxHy compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to CxHyO and CxHyO>1 compounds in coating materials may be responsible for the photobleaching of coated BrC."

In this study, melted samples of the seasonal snow collected from northern Xinjiang, northwestern China, were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to investigate the photolytic transformations of WSOC. Molecular characteristics and chemical composition of WSOC and its brown carbon (BrC) constituents were investigated using high‐performance liquid chromatography interfaced with a photodiode array detector and a high‐resolution mass spectrometer. Upon illumination, formation of nitrogen‐ and sulfur‐containing species with high molecular weight was observed in snow samples influenced by soil‐ and plant‐derived organics. In contrast, the representative sample collected from remote region showed the lowest molecular diversity and photolytic reactivity among all samples, in which no identified BrC chromophores decomposed upon illumination. Approximately 65% of chromophores in urban samples endured UV irradiation. However, most of BrC composed of phenolic/lignin‐derived compounds and flavonoids disappeared in the illuminated samples containing WSOC from soil‐ and plant‐related sources. Effects of the photochemical degradation of WSOC on the potential modulation of snow albedo were estimated. Apparent half‐lives of WSOC estimated as albedo reduction in 300–400 nm indicated 0.1–0.4 atmospheric equivalent days, which are shorter than typical photolysis half‐lives of ambient biomass smoke aerosol.

Although numerous studies have examined the characteristics and sources of PrM in the atmosphere, its interactions with atmospheric oxidants remain uncertain. A 1‐year observation of PrM characteristics in PM2.5 was performed in both urban Nanchang (eastern China) and suburban Guiyang (southwestern China), respectively. Glycine was the dominant free amino acid (FAA) species in urban Nanchang. In contrast, proline dominated both total free amino acids (FAAs) and total combined amino acids (CAAs) in suburban Guiyang. We found that oxidative degradation can significantly promote the release of FAAs, especially glycine, from CAAs in Nanchang. The controlled experiment on protein oxidation by hydroxyl radical suggested that the contribution of free glycine to the total FAA fraction tended to increase during the oxidative degradation of CAAs, supporting the predominance of glycine in FAAs in Nanchang and most previous observations. The composition of FAAs was mainly influenced by primary sources in suburban Guiyang with weak atmospheric degradation of PrM. These results suggest that the degradation of aerosol PrM by atmospheric oxidants can be responsible for the difference in FAA composition between the biosphere and the atmosphere, and also imply that the oxidative degradation of aerosol PrM may be a potential source of secondary organic nitrogen compounds in aerosols. Thus, this study can improve the current understanding of the composition characteristics of PrM in the biosphere and the atmosphere, as well as the liquid phase reactions of proteinaceous compounds with atmospheric oxidants."

Here, we reveal the CRE variations between positive and negative DA events and elucidate the slowing impacts of CRE on sea ice thickness (SIT) changes. The DA triggers robust meridional winds and transpolar drift, markedly reducing SIT in the Beaufort Sea (BeS), Chukchi Sea (CS), and East Siberian Sea (ESS), while increasing it in the Greenland Sea (GS). CRE significantly slow SIT changes, contributing +14.4, +4.4, +16.4, and −26.7 cm to changes from June to August, against total changes of −55.9, −29.4, −39.8, and +42.8 cm in September over BeS, CS, ESS, and GS, respectively.

Hourly dust plume observations of the Dust Belt from geostationary‐orbit satellites are analyzed for the 2017‐12–2022‐11 period.

This method advances over traditional source allocation techniques that rely on polar‐orbiting satellites based on a few daily passes and meteorological wind fields for backtracking. Our findings indicate that Boreal summer is the most intense season for most sources, except in the Southern Sahara, which experiences winterly winds. Our analysis also reveals significant contributions from regions within the Sahara that experience expansive but infrequent dust storms, highlighting the importance of considering both frequency and magnitude in understanding dust emissions."

Based on the latest satellite observational inundation data, we constructed a model to map the long‐term time series of wetland extents over the Sudd floodplain, which has recently been identified as an important source of wetland CH4 emissions. Our analysis reveals an annual, total wetland extent of 5.73 ± 2.05 × 104 km2 for 2003–2022, with a notable accelerated expansion rate of 1.19 × 104 km2 yr−1 during 2019–2022 driven by anomalous upstream precipitation patterns.

One of the unresolved problems is that liquid‐ice mixing is highly inhomogeneous, but it has not been well understood and quantified for parameterization. In this study, the liquid‐ice mixing homogeneity (χ) is quantified using the information‐theoretic entropy based on airborne measurements. It is demonstrated that χ is positively correlated with the condensed water content (CWC). Cloud regions with low χ are consist of liquid and ice clusters. With the increase in χ, the size and frequency of continuous mixed‐phase clusters increase. For a given CWC, χ is lower at relatively warm temperatures as sedimentation of large ice crystals can enhance the inhomogeneity. The strong positive relationship between CWC and χ indicates CWC should be considered when parameterizing the liquid‐ice mixing in models."

Hence, it is desirable to predict before SSW onset if an event will propagate downward. The predictability of the downward response of SSWs is considered in seven subseasonal‐to‐seasonal forecast models for 16 major SSWs between 1998 and 2022, a larger sample size than considered by previous works. The models successfully predict before SSW onset which SSWs have a stronger downward response to 100 hPa, however they struggle to predict which have a stronger tropospheric response. The downward response is stronger if the magnitude of the deceleration of the 10 hPa winds is more accurately predicted. Downward response is stronger for split and absorbing SSWs. In contrast, there is little relationship between SSWs whose onset can be predicted at earlier leads and the downward response."

This event was the strongest of at least the last decade (2014–2023). The westward winds reached −80 m/s at 82 km of altitude in late March, and decreased with increasing altitude and latitude. A considerable increase in the diurnal tide amplitude was also observed. The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere‐ionosphere eXtension constrained to meteorological reanalysis up to ∼50 km does not capture the observed low‐latitude behavior. Additionally, these strong mesospheric winds developed during the westerly phase of the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation, in accordance with the filtering mechanism of gravity waves in the stratosphere proposed in previous works.

The negative trends in the BH SLP are associated with the changes in the background SLP over the Arctic basin. However, the vorticity of the winter BH tends to intensify under SSP5‐8.5, but shows no robust increase under SSP2‐4.5. The intensification is associated with the enhanced ridge over the Western Arctic. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the dynamic aspects of the BH, such as vorticity. Based on this assessment, under the most likely emissions scenario, the winter BH is likely to weaken through the 21st century, in terms of SLP, but shows no robust changes in term of vorticity."

We found that the decadal transition of winter NSWS in northern China (NC) was 10 years earlier than in southern China (SC), which could be linked to the changes in intensities of the eastward wave‐activity flux and Siberian High (SH) induced by the Warm Arctic‐Cold Eurasia (WACE) dipole pattern. From 1973 to 1990, the WACE pattern from positive to negative phases confined the eastward wave trains to high latitudes with a decreasing SH, inducing an NSWS reduction. From 1991 to 2000, the WACE strengthened from negative to positive phases, causing a decadal transition in NSWS first in NC. After 2000, accompanied by the strengthening of the positive WACE, the eastward wave trains propagated downstream to lower latitudes, the SH and the meridional pressure gradient enhanced. Therefore, the transition of decadal NSWS occurred in SC until 2000."

Here, we quantified forest resilience with optimized Bayesian models. With the use of multisource satellite and modeling data, our study revealed that forests on the Loess Plateau and in the Qinba Mountains in China are experiencing rapid resilience loss and are already facing mortality warnings after 2010. Reductions in resilience also drove the marked decoupling of GPP from EPE. Notably, the decline in resilience was accompanied by a decrease in EPE in about 74% of the forests while GPP increased. The mechanism underlying this decoupling could be attributed to enhanced atmospheric water demand and soil water constraints. The dynamic relationships found here could help to improve forest mortality models and enhance photosynthesis‐based GPP evaluation."

By comparing with multi‐type observational data, we find that with the implementation of this scheme, the model captures the seasonal variations of BrC light absorption well in China.

Since 2000, spring precipitation decreased by 14% on average across 26 unregulated headwater basins, but this decrease did not fully account for the reduced streamflow. In drier springs, increases in energy from reduced cloud cover, and lowered surface albedo from earlier snow disappearance, coincided with potential evapotranspiration (PET) increases of up to 10%. Combining spring precipitation decreases with PET increases accounted for 67% of the variance in post‐2000 streamflow deficits.

Using the newly developed Low lAtitude long Range Ionospheric raDar (LARID) at Dongfang (19.2°N, 108.8°E, dip lat. 13.8°N), China, an extremely long‐range experiment for observing EPB irregularities in a range of ±9,600 km to the radar site was first carried out. The results show that EPB irregularities with ranges up to 7,000 and 9,500 km were observed by the east and west beams of LARID, respectively. By incorporating simultaneous observations from GNSS receiver and ionosonde networks, it is demonstrated that the EPBs generated from post‐sunset to sunrise over a very wide longitude of ∼140°, from Pacific to Africa could be observed by LARID. The results, for the first time, demonstrate the possibility for tracing global EPBs in real time using a few low latitude over‐the‐horizon radars."

But how to factor in the urban form into the UHI assessment remains unresolved. We propose an every‐pair‐interaction model that meaningfully incorporates urban size and fractal dimension to characterize the UHI intensity. Regression on the summertime surface UHI intensity of 5,000 European cities shows that the model outperforms the simple linear combination of logarithmic size and fractal dimension. Subject to the interplay between the range of the every‐pair interaction and the urban fractal shape, the model also represents a generalization as it includes power‐law, logarithmic, and saturating size dependence of UHI—all three possibilities have been reported empirically in the literature. Our theoretical framework indicates that the surface UHI intensity saturates with urban size, opening up new research perspectives around UHI intensity."

While this is partly due to biases between the models and observations, we propose that another uncertainty is rooted in the choice of statistic used to determine the ‘jet latitude’ — one measure used to quantify the jet position. We use seven different jet latitude statistics, four climate reanalysis products, and CMIP6 simulations to assess the relative importance of different uncertainties associated with lower‐tropospheric North Pacific Jet (NPJ) trends. Our results show a statistically significant poleward trend in the observed winter NPJ across all reanalyzes and using all jet latitude statistics. The magnitude of this trend is most sensitive to the choice of statistic. Furthermore, we find that the NPJ shifts poleward in Autumn under high emission scenarios, which is robust to the choice of jet statistic."

This study re‐examines the relationship between low‐level convergence and the Atlantic doldrums. By analyzing the frequency distribution of low wind speed events in reanalysis and buoy data, we show that the doldrums are largely confined between the edges of the ITCZ marked by enhanced surface convergence. While the region between the edges is a region of high time‐mean precipitation, low wind speed events occur in the absence of precipitation. Based on these results, we hypothesize that low wind speed events occur in regions of low level divergence rather than convergence."

We study the forced and internal variability of the ASL using our new reconstruction in concert with existing large ensembles of climate model simulations. Our findings robustly demonstrate that an atmospheric teleconnection originating from the tropical Indo‐Pacific is the main driver of ASL variability at the multi‐decadal time scale, with resemblance to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation.

The circulation analogs‐based dynamic adjustment reveals that approximately 38% and 35% of these trends result from shifts in zonal dipolar circulation patterns over the North Atlantic (NA) and Europe, crucial for the enhanced warming compared to the global land average. The circulation changes are associated with warming sea surface temperatures in the NA. This warming pattern resembles the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and is predominantly induced by greenhouse gases. Moreover, the stronger air temperature response in ME to decreased aerosols amplifies warming, contributing to the rapid increase in heatwave frequency.

Previous studies have suggested ice cloud water or non‐convective precipitation as a predictor of RI from different perspectives. However, few studies have focused on the impact of TC intensity or comprehensive comparisons to identify better indicators. During RI, hydrometeor contents in weak TCs increase over the entire region, whereas they increase mainly in the inner‐core region and decrease in advance in the outer‐core region for strong TCs. Hydrometeor contents in the inner‐core are higher in RI than in slow intensification, and their maxima location is related to TC intensity and intensification rate. Cloud water path (CWP) in the inner‐core region is most correlated with the intensification rate, especially in weak TCs. Therefore, the CWP can serve as a predictor of RI and can be applied to all TC intensities."

This metric generally has a relatively uniform distribution of positive values across the tropics. However, selected land regions are characterized by exceptionally low autocorrelation values. Low values correspond to the dominance of high frequency variance in precipitation, and specifically of high frequency convectively coupled equatorial waves. Consistent with previous work, we show that CMIP6 climate models overestimate the autocorrelation. Global kilometer‐scale models capture the observed autocorrelation when deep convection is explicitly simulated. When a deep convection parameterization is used, though, the autocorrelation increases over land and ocean, suggesting that land surface‐atmosphere interactions are not responsible for the changes in autocorrelation. Furthermore, the metric also tracks the accuracy of the representation of the relative importance of high frequency and low frequency convectively coupled equatorial waves in the models."

The observationally constrained reanalysis data indicates that significant sea surface warming in the western equatorial Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea is likely driving this increase in rainfall by enhancing the cross‐equatorial monsoonal flow and associated evaporation. We demonstrate that the strengthening of the cross‐equatorial monsoon winds is due to the rapid warming of the Indian Ocean and the enhanced Pacific Ocean trade winds, which result from the poleward shift and expansion of the Hadley cell. These strengthened winds boost the latent heat flux (evaporation), leading to increased moisture transport to Northwest India."

Population aging and imbalance in regional economy are thus anticipated to have important implications on ozone (O3)‐related health impacts. Here we provide a driver analysis for O3 mortality burden due to respiratory disease in China over 2013–2050 driven by population aging and regional inequity. Unexpectedly, we find that population aging is estimated to result in dramatic rises in annual O3 mortality burden in China; by 56, 101–137, and 298–485 thousand over the periods 2013–2020, 2020–2030, and 2030–2050, respectively. This reflects the exponential rise in baseline mortality rates with increasing age. The aging‐induced mortality burden rise in 2030–2050 is surprisingly large, as it is comparable to the net national mortality burden due to O3 exposure in 2030 (359–399 thousand yr−1). The health impacts of O3 pollution, shown as mortality burden per capita, are inequitably distributed, with more severe effects in less developed provinces than their developed counterparts by 23.1% and 21.5% in 2019 and 2030, respectively. However, the regional inequity in O3 mortality burden is expected to be mitigated in 2050.

Our health burden estimation framework uses GEOS‐Chem simulations, satellite‐derived NO2, and ground‐based observations of PM2.5, O3, and NO2. We estimate 19,000, 3,300, and 8,500 premature deaths owing to long‐term exposure to PM2.5, O3, and NO2, respectively, and 23,000 NO2‐associated childhood asthma incidences in 2016. Next, we calculate anthropogenic emission contributions to these four health burdens from each species and grid cell using adjoint sensitivity analysis. Domestic sources account for 56%, 38%, 87%, and 88% of marginal emission contributions to the PM2.5‐, O3‐, and NO2‐associated premature deaths and the NO2‐associated childhood asthma incidences, respectively. We project health burdens to 2050 using UNEP domestic emission scenarios (Baseline and Mitigation) and population forecasts from Statistics Korea. Because of population aging alone, there are 41,000, 10,000, and 20,000 more premature deaths associated with PM2.5, O3, and NO2 exposure, respectively, and 9,000 fewer childhood asthma incidences associated with NO2. The Mitigation scenario doubles the NO2‐associated health benefits over the Baseline scenario, preventing 24,000 premature deaths and 13,000 childhood asthma incidences by 2050. It also slightly reduces PM2.5‐ and O3‐associated premature deaths by 9.9% and 7.0%, unlike the Baseline scenario where these pollutants increase.

Estimates of the climatic impact of this global reduction in anthropogenic sulfate aerosols vary widely. Here, we contribute to narrowing this uncertainty with two sets of climate model simulations using UKESM1. Using fixed sea‐surface temperature atmosphere‐only simulations, we estimate an IMO2020 global effective radiative forcing of 0.139 ± 0.019 Wm−2 and show that most of this forcing is due to aerosol‐induced changes to cloud properties. Using coupled ocean‐atmosphere simulations, we note significant changes in cloud top droplet number concentration and size across regions with high shipping traffic density, and—in the North Atlantic and North Pacific—these microphysical changes translate to a decrease in cloud albedo. We show that IMO2020 increases global annual surface temperature on average by 0.046 ± 0.010°C across 2020–2029; approximately 2–3 years of global warming. Furthermore, our model simulations show that IMO2020 helps to explain the exceptional warming in 2023, but other factors are needed to fully account for it. The year 2023 also had an exceptionally large decrease in reflected shortwave radiation at the top‐of‐atmosphere. Our results show that IMO2020 made that more likely, yet the observations are within the variability of simulations without the reduction in shipping emissions.

Vegetation Burn Severity (VBS) can be derived from satellite observations. However, Soil Burn Severity (SBS) assessment—critical for mitigating hydrologic and geologic hazards—requires costly and laborious field recalibration of VBS maps. Here, we develop a physics‐informed Machine Learning model capable of accurately estimating SBS while revealing the intricate relationships between soil and vegetation burn severities. Our SBS classification model uses VBS, as well as climatological, meteorological, ecological, geological, and topographical wildfire covariates. This model demonstrated an overall accuracy of 89% for out‐of‐sample test data. The model exhibited scalability with additional data, and was able to extract universal functional relationships between vegetation and soil burn severities across the western US. VBS had the largest control on SBS, followed by weather (e.g., wind, fire danger, temperature), climate (e.g., annual precipitation), topography (e.g., elevation), and soil characteristics (e.g., soil organic carbon content). The relative control of processes on SBS changes across regions. Our model revealed nuanced relationships between VBS and SBS; for example, a similar VBS with lower wind speeds—that is, higher fire residence time—translates to a higher SBS. This transferrable model develops reliable and timely SBS maps using satellite and publicly accessible data, providing science‐based insights for managers and diverse stakeholders."

This paper considers the utility of proactively developing the capacity to respond to emergent tipping element threats at the poles as a matter of risk management. It then examines both the air and ground infrastructure that would be required to operationalize such capability by 2040 and finds that this would require a funded launch decision by a financially credible actor by roughly 2030."

Both summer monsoon drying, and winter warming pose considerable challenges for rapidly declining groundwater. However, their impacts on irrigation water demands and groundwater storage under the observed and projected future climate remain unexplored. Using in situ observations, satellite data, and a hydrological model that considers the role of irrigation and groundwater pumping, we show that summer monsoon drying and winter warming accelerate groundwater depletion in north India during the observed climate, which will continue in the projected future climate. Summer monsoon precipitation has significantly (P‐value = 0.04) declined (∼8%) while winters have become warmer in north India during 1951–2021. Both satellite (GRACE/GRACE‐FO) and hydrological model‐based estimates show a rapid groundwater depletion (∼1.5 cm/year) in north India with a net loss of 450 km3 of groundwater during 2002–2021. The summer monsoon drying followed by winter warming cause a substantial reduction in groundwater storage due to reduced groundwater recharge and enhanced pumping to meet irrigation demands. Summer monsoon drying and winter warming will continue to affect groundwater storage in north India in the future. For instance, summer monsoon drying (10%–15% deficit for near‐far periods) followed by substantial winter warming (1–4°C) in the future will further accelerate groundwater depletion by increasing (6%–20%) irrigation water demands and reducing groundwater recharge (6%–12%). Groundwater sustainability measures including reducing groundwater abstraction and enhancing the groundwater recharge during the summer monsoon seasons are needed to ensure future agricultural production."

However, previous studies largely overlooked this sediment‐caused wetland expansion, and the spatiotemporal variation in these wetlands and future response to sea‐level rise (SLR) have not been determined. Here, we employed satellite observations to quantify the seaward expansion of coastal lands in China over the past two decades. A total land expansion of 6,651 km2 was found, and wetlands and artificial surfaces dominated, accounting for 32% and 25%, respectively. Subsequently, we utilized an integrated model to estimate the response of these new wetlands to SLR in the 21st century, that is, we estimated the wetland gain from sediment deposition and loss due to SLR. The results indicate that under the current condition of sediment availability, the area of China's new coastal wetlands is projected to increase by 200%–261% compared to that in 2020 based on four SLR scenarios, despite the unavoidable impact of SLR. These increases are accompanied by the continuous enhancement of carbon accumulation. Wetland changes are influenced by factors such as sediment deposition, SLR and storm surges, as well as the continued effect of local natural and anthropogenic factors. These results show the importance of understanding the ecological effects of new wetlands and constructing specific protection measures for sustainable development."

Taking advantage of the modulation of free tropospheric relative humidity by vertical motions, we derive analytical relationships that allow us to retrieve vertical motions in clear air from geostationary measurements of brightness temperature in the infrared absorption band of water vapor. The new observations have a resolution of 1 hr and 2 km in time and space, respectively. They capture the variability of mesoscale and large‐scale vertical velocity measured during field campaigns. In the mid‐troposphere, clear‐sky vertical motions are mostly subsiding but highly heterogeneous in space and time. Around organized deep convective systems, strong subsidence (>500 hPa·day−1) is observed within a distance of a few hundred kilometers. In contrast, transient upward motions of up to 100 hPa·day−1 can occur at the mesoscale. Vertical motions in the clear‐sky atmosphere appear to be primarily associated with buoyancy and gravity waves at the mesoscale, and with radiative cooling and equatorial waves at larger spatial scales. This new retrieval reveals a rich range of dynamical features that were previously invisible, thus shedding new light on tropical meteorology."

There are, however, concerns that protons produced during SO2 oxidation may cause rapid acidification of aerosol water and thereby quickly shut down the fast reactions favored at high pH. Here, we show that the sustainability of sulfate production is controlled by the competing effects of multiphase buffering and acidification, which can be well described by a characteristic buffering time, τbuff. Both GEOS‐Chem simulations and observations show that globally, τbuff is long enough (days) to sustain sulfate production over most populated regions, where the acidification of aerosol water is counteracted by the strong buffering effect of NH4+/NH3.

Estimates of the organic mass fraction of sea spray vary widely, and some results show a significant dependence on biological activity in the source seawater. We present airborne observations of the organic mass fraction of individual sea spray particles measured using the Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry (PALMS) instrument during the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission, which sampled a wide range of latitudes and altitudes over the remote Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across four seasons, from the marine boundary layer to the upper troposphere. The measured sea spray particles of about 0.15–0.7 μm dry diameter showed higher average organic mass fractions at smaller sizes, but values were low overall, with regional integrated submicron means almost always <10%. Atmospheric aging adds organics to sea spray particles, leading to higher mean organic mass fractions (sometimes exceeding 50%) in the free troposphere than in the marine boundary layer. The average submicron sea spray organic mass fractions are on the low end of previously reported values and show weak seasonal variability for most regions. These results imply that recent biological activity in the surface ocean has only weak control over how much organic matter is in nascent submicron sea spray particles over the remote oceans, in contrast to findings from some observational studies and global numerical simulations."

The link between the drought impact and recovery of the total carbon pools and its biogeochemical drivers is still unknown. With satellite‐constrained net carbon exchange and its component fluxes including gross primary production and fire emissions, we show that the total carbon loss caused by the 2015–2016 El Niño had not recovered by the end of 2018. Forest ecosystems over the Northeastern (NE) Amazon suffered a cumulative total carbon loss of ∼0.6 GtC through December 2018, driven primarily by a suppression of photosynthesis whereas southeastern savannah carbon loss was driven in part by fire. We attribute the slow recovery to the unexpected large carbon loss caused by the severe atmospheric aridity coupled with a water storage deficit during drought. We show the attenuation of carbon uptake is three times higher than expected from the pre‐drought sensitivity to atmospheric aridity and ground water supply. Our study fills an important knowledge gap in our understanding of the unexpectedly enhanced response of carbon fluxes to atmospheric aridity and water storage deficit and its impact on regional post‐drought recovery as a function of the vegetation types and climate perturbations. Our results suggest that the disproportionate impact of water supply and demand could compromise resiliency of the Amazonian carbon balance to future increases in extreme events."

Although the dynamical characteristics of the vortex itself were generally unexceptional, the excess moisture initially raised PSC formation threshold temperatures above typical values. Cold conditions, especially in early July, prompted ice PSC formation and unusually severe irreversible dehydration at higher levels (500–700 K), while atypical hydration occurred at lower levels (380–460 K). Heterogeneous chemical processing was more extensive, both vertically (up to 750–800 K) and temporally (earlier in the season), than in prior Antarctic winters. The resultant HCl depletion and ClO enhancement redefined their previously observed ranges at and above 600 K. Albeit unmatched in the satellite record, the early‐winter upper‐level chlorine activation was insufficient to induce substantial ozone loss. Chlorine activation, denitrification, and dehydration processes ran to completion by July/August, with trace gas evolution mostly following the climatological mean thereafter, but with chlorine deactivation starting slightly later than usual. While cumulative ozone losses at 410–550 K were relatively large, probably because of the delayed chlorine deactivation, they were not unprecedented. Thus, ozone depletion was unremarkable throughout the lower stratosphere. Although Hunga enhanced PSC formation and chemical processing in early winter, saturation of lower stratospheric denitrification, dehydration, and chlorine activation (as is typical in the Antarctic) prevented an exceptionally severe ozone hole in 2023."

This work utilizes knowledge of weather, fuels, topography, and firefighting, combined with machine learning and other statistical methods, to generate 1‐ and 2‐day forecasts of fire radiative energy (FRE). The models are trained on data covering 2019 and 2021 and evaluated on data for 2020. For the 1‐day (2‐day) forecasts, the random forest model shows the most skill, explaining 48% (25%) of the variance in observed daily FRE when trained on all available predictors compared to the 2% (<0%) of variance explained by persistence for the extreme fire year of 2020. The random forest model also shows improved skill in forecasting day‐to‐day increases and decreases in FRE, with 28% (39%) of observed increase (decrease) days predicted, and increase (decrease) days are identified with 62% (60%) accuracy. Error in the random forest increases with FRE, and the random forest tends toward persistence under severe fire weather. Sensitivity analysis shows that near‐surface weather and the latest observed FRE contribute the most to the skill of the model. When the random forest model was trained on subsets of the training data produced by agencies (e.g., the Canadian or US Forest Services), comparable if not better performance was achieved (1‐day R2 = 0.39–0.48, 2‐day R2 = 0.13–0.34).

These emissions are difficult to quantify accurately due to a lack of observations, particularly in remote ocean regions. In this study, we used long‐term, near‐source observations in areas with a dominance of anthropogenic iron emissions in various parts of the world to better estimate the total amount of anthropogenic iron emissions. We also used a statistical source apportionment method to identify the anthropogenic components and their sub‐sources from bulk aerosol observations in the United States. We find that the estimates of anthropogenic iron emissions are within a factor of 3 in most regions compared to previous inventory estimates. Under‐ or overestimation varied by region and depended on the number of sites, interannual variability, and the statistical filter choice. Smelting‐related iron emissions are overestimated by a factor of 1.5 in East Asia compared to previous estimates. More long‐term iron observations and the consideration of the influence of dust and wildfires could help reduce the uncertainty in anthropogenic iron emissions estimates."

Observations of cloud and radiative properties from two field campaigns in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica were compared with two global climate model simulations. A cyclone compositing method was used to quantify “dynamics‐cloud‐radiation” relationships relative to the extratropical cyclone centers. Observations show larger asymmetry in cloud and radiative properties between western and eastern sectors at McMurdo compared with Macquarie Island. Most observed quantities at McMurdo are higher in the western (i.e., post‐frontal) than the eastern (frontal) sector, including cloud fraction, liquid water path (LWP), net surface shortwave and longwave radiation (SW and LW), except for ice water path (IWP) being higher in the eastern sector. The two models were found to overestimate cloud fraction and LWP at Macquarie Island but underestimate them at McMurdo Station. IWP is consistently underestimated at both locations, both sectors, and in all seasons. Biases of cloud fraction, LWP, and IWP are negatively correlated with SW biases and positively correlated with LW biases. The persistent negative IWP biases may have become one of the leading causes of radiative biases over the high southern latitudes, after correcting the underestimation of supercooled liquid water in the older model versions. By examining multi‐scale factors from cloud microphysics to synoptic dynamics, this work will help increase the fidelity of climate simulations in this remote region."

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of Greenland ice‐cores from 936 to 943 CE, revealing a complex volatile record and cryptotephra with numerous geochemical populations. Transitional alkali basalt tephra matching Eldgjá are found in 939–940 CE, while tholeiitic basalt shards present in 936/937 CE and 940/941 CE are compatible with contemporaneous Icelandic eruptions from Grímsvötn and Bárðarbunga‐Veiðivötn systems (including V‐Sv tephra). We also find four silicic tephra populations, one of which we link to the Jala Pumice of Ceboruco (Mexico) at 941 ± 1 CE. Triple S isotopes, Δ33S, spanning 936–940 CE are indicative of upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric transport of aerosol sourced from the Icelandic fissure eruptions. However, anomalous Δ33S (down to −0.4‰) in 940–941 CE evidence stratospheric aerosol transport consistent with summer surface cooling revealed by tree‐ring reconstructions. Tephra associated with the anomalous Δ33S have a variety of compositions, complicating the attribution of climate cooling to Eldgjá alone. Nevertheless, our study confirms a major S emission from Eldgjá in 939–940 CE and implicates Eldgjá and a cluster of eruptions as triggers of summer cooling, severe winters, and privations in ∼940 CE."

The districts with PM2.5 concentration above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) level of 40 μg/m3 show a higher risk of neonatal (OR‐1.86, CI 1.418–2.433), postneonatal (OR‐2.04, CI 1.399–2.971), child (OR‐2.19, CI 0.999–4.803) and adult death (OR‐1.13, CI 1.060–1.208). The absence of a separate kitchen shows a higher probability of neonatal (OR: 1.18, CI 1.074–1.306) and adult death (OR‐1.06, CI 1.027–1.088). The interaction between PM2.5 levels above NAAQS and HAP leads to a substantial rise in mortality observed for neonatal (OR 1.19 CI 1.051–1.337), child (OR 1.17 CI 1.054–1.289), and adult (OR 1.13 CI 1.096–1.168) age groups. This study advocates that there is a strong positive association between ambient and HAP and mortality risk. PM2.5 pollution significantly contributes to the mortality risk in all age groups. Children are more vulnerable to HAP than adults. In India, policymakers should focus on reducing the anthropogenic PM2.5 emission at least to reach the NAAQS, which can substantially reduce disease burden and, more precisely, mortality."

Gooseff,Response of a Terrestrial Polar Ecosystem to the March 2022 Antarctic Weather Anomaly,"Record high temperatures were documented in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, on 18 March 2022, exceeding average temperatures for that day by nearly 30°C. Satellite imagery and stream gage measurements indicate that surface wetting coincided with this warming more than 2 months after peak summer thaw and likely exceeded thresholds for rehydration and activation of resident organisms that typically survive the cold and dry conditions of the polar fall in a freeze‐dried state. This weather event is notable in both the timing and magnitude of the warming and wetting when temperatures exceeded 0°C at a time when biological communities and streams have typically entered a persistent frozen state. Such events may be a harbinger of future climate conditions characterized by warmer temperatures and greater thaw in this region of Antarctica, which could influence the distribution, activity, and abundance of sentinel taxa. Here we describe the ecosystem responses to this weather anomaly reporting on meteorological and hydrological measurements across the region and on later biological observations from Canada Stream, one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems within the McMurdo Dry Valleys."

Wild,Persistent Extreme Surface Solar Radiation and Its Implications on Solar Photovoltaics,"Climatic extreme events are important because they can strongly impact humans, infrastructure, and biodiversity and will be affected by a changing climate. Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) is the primary energy source for solar photovoltaics (PV), which will be indispensable in future zero‐emissions energy systems. Despite their pivotal role, extreme events in SSR remain under‐documented. We provide a starting point in extreme SSR analysis by focusing on events caused by internal variability alone and therefore building a baseline for future extreme SSR research. We analyze extreme SSR events using daily‐mean data from the pre‐industrial control simulations (piControl) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—Phase 6. We investigate their role in PV energy generation using the Global Solar Energy Estimator with the intent of strengthening the energy system's resilience. Our results show a pronounced asymmetry between consecutive days with extremely high and extremely low solar radiation over land, the former occurring more frequently than the latter. Moreover, our results call for detailed PV generation modeling that includes panel geometry. Simple models based on linear SSR representations prove insufficient due to pronounced seasonal variations and strong non‐linear SSR dependency of high extremes. Our results demonstrate how climate model results can be leveraged to understand persistent radiation extremes that are relevant for future energy systems."

In recent decades, the Siberian wildfire regime has been shifting; however, less is known about its process‐based feedback mechanisms. By integrating in‐situ and satellite observational data sets as well as chemistry‐climate coupled modeling, we find that central Siberia has featured the most prominent wildfire escalation during the past two decades, which is closely related to hydrological drought with decreasing rainfall and drying soil under a fast‐warming Arctic. Furthermore, fire‐emitted aerosols compound the increasing wildfires via serving as cloud condensation nuclei and suppressing precipitation, forming self‐amplifying feedback. As the Arctic warming is projected to continue, wildfires are estimated to more than double by the end of this century. This work highlights the great importance of fire risk management based on a fundamental scientific understanding of the complex climate system."

NOAA's growth rate estimates, derived from in situ observations at the marine boundary layer (MBL), serve as the benchmark in policy and science. However, NOAA's MBL‐based method encounters challenges in accurately estimating the whole‐atmosphere CO2 growth rate at sub‐annual scales. Here we introduce the Growth Rate from Satellite Observations (GRESO) method as a complementary approach to estimate the whole‐atmosphere CO2 growth rate utilizing satellite data. Satellite CO2 observations offer extensive atmospheric coverage that extends the capability of the current NOAA benchmark. We assess the sampling errors of the GRESO and NOAA methods using 10 atmospheric transport model simulations. The simulations generate synthetic OCO‐2 satellite and NOAA MBL data for calculating CO2 growth rates, which are compared against the global sum of carbon fluxes used as model inputs. We find good performance for the NOAA method (R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.12 ppm year−1 or 0.25 PgC year−1). GRESO demonstrates lower sampling errors (R = 1.00; RMSE = 0.04 ppm year−1 or 0.09 PgC year−1). Additionally, GRESO shows better performance at monthly scales than the NOAA method (R = 0.76 vs. 0.47, respectively). Due to CO2's atmospheric longevity, the NOAA method accurately captures growth rates over 5‐year intervals. GRESO's robustness across partial coverage configurations (ocean or land data) shows that satellites can be promising tools for low‐latency CO2 growth rate information, provided the systematic biases are minimized using in situ observations. Along with accurate and calibrated NOAA in situ data, satellite‐derived growth rates can provide information about the global carbon cycle at sub‐annual scales."

This study examines the association between trimester-specific and weekly means of air pollution throughout gestation and placental inflammatory markers at delivery. In a prospective cohort study of 263 pregnant women in Rochester, NY, we measured interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in placental tissue and estimated gestational exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 using a high-resolution spatial-temporal model. Exposure to PAHs was estimated using urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) concentrations collected once per trimester. Using distributed lag models with a penalized spline function, each interquartile range (2.6 μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 concentration during gestational weeks 6–11 was associated with decreased placental IL-6 levels (−22.2%, 95% CI: −39.0%, −0.64%). Using multiple linear regression models, each interquartile range increase of 1-OHP was associated with an increase in TNF-α in the first trimester (58.5%, 95% CI: 20.7%, 74.2%), third trimester (22.9%, 95% CI: 0.04%, 49.5%), and entire pregnancy (29.6%, 95%CI: 3.9%,60.6%).

We conducted a health impact analysis using dynamic estimates of population, baseline mortality rates, and satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations to estimate mortality attributable to long-term PM2.5 exposure every five years between 2001 and 2021, applying risk estimates from the 2006 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) to the population aged 25 and older. We conducted a decomposition analysis to examine the influences of population exposure, size, and health status on trends in PM2.5-attributable mortality. Between 2001 and 2021, population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 declined by 18% in Canada, with improvements occurring in most urban areas. In recent years, these changes have led to 4,400 (95% CI: 3,700–5,000) to 4,700 (95% CI: 4,100–5,400) fewer PM2.5-attributable deaths annually based on log–linear and log–log shapes of concentration–response. However, a growing population alongside higher baseline mortality risks in several regions, likely due to aging, has led to a small net increase in total PM2.5-attributable deaths between 2001 and 2021.

Source-to-health benefit relationships are quantified using a benefit-per-ton (BPT) metric, accounting for the impacts on premature mortality due to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter. In the base analysis, the approach used a 12 km resolution, four 2-week episodes chosen to capture annual responses, emissions for 2016, and the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to link exposures to premature mortality. Here, we investigate the impacts those choices have on results using a range of sensitivity analyses. The choice of four representative episodes led to relatively little bias and error. Finer model resolution, investigated by comparing 36, 12, 4, and 1 km simulations over two urban areas, tended to increase BPT estimates, though the impact was inconsistent between different regions. While BPTs and burden estimates were consistent across resolutions over New York City, they sharply increased for Los Angeles, particularly for NOx and ammonia, leading to 90% increase in burden estimates at 1 km resolution. We find that, for primary PM2.5 emissions, better resolved population distribution is the main contributing factor to higher BPTs, but for secondary precursor emissions (ammonia and NOx), higher model resolution that avoids dilution in coarser grids is more important. Changing emissions from 2016 to 2001 and 2028 resulted in fairly consistent primary PM2.5 BPTs but impacted the BPTs for NOx and ammonia more significantly due to changes in SO2 emissions. We found that BPTs tend to stabilize, as emission changes in 2028 lead to a lower deviation from 2016 BPTs compared to changes from the 2001 episode. The role of the epidemiological model also led to relatively modest uncertainties, 15–30% depending on the species, even when different shapes of concentration–response functions were employed. We found the impact of the choice of CRF to be larger or comparable in size to the reported epidemiological model uncertainties for log–linear CRFs. The adjoining approach proved robust to modeling choices in providing BPT estimates that are highly granular across locations and emitted species."

The complexity in wildfire smokes, as well as limited coverage of ground measurements, poses a big challenge to estimate surface PM2.5 during wildfire season in Alaska. Here we aim at proposing a quick and direct method to estimate surface PM2.5 over Alaska, especially in places exposed to strong wildfire events with limited measurements. We compare the AOD–surface PM2.5 conversion factor (η = PM2.5/AOD; AOD, aerosol optical depth) from the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (ηGC) and from observations (ηobs). We show that ηGC is biased high compared to ηobs under smoky conditions, largely because GEOS-Chem assigns the majority of AOD (67%) within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) when AOD > 1, inconsistent with satellite retrievals from CALIOP. The overestimation in ηGC can be to some extent improved by increasing the injection height of wildfire emissions. We constructed a piecewise function for ηobs across different AOD ranges based on VIIRS-SNPP AOD and PurpleAir surface PM2.5 measurements over Alaska in the 2019 summer and then applied it on VIIRS AOD to derive daily surface PM2.5 over continental Alaska in the 2021 and 2022 summers. The derived satellite PM2.5 shows a good agreement with corrected PurpleAir PM2.5 in Alaska during the 2021 and 2022 summers, suggesting that aerosol vertical distribution likely represents the largest uncertainty in converting AOD to surface PM2.5 concentrations. This piecewise function, η′obs, shows the capability of providing an observation-based, quick and direct estimation of daily surface PM2.5 over the whole of Alaska during wildfires, without running a 3-D model in real time."

The ML model uses σ-profiles from the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) as molecular descriptors. The main advantages in using σ-profiles instead of other types of molecular representations are the relatively small size of the descriptor and the fact that the addition of new elements does not affect the size of the descriptor. The ML model was trained separately for liquid and solid compounds using experimental vapor pressures at various temperatures. The 95% confidence intervals of the error in the liquid- and solid-phase log10(psat/Pa) are 1.02 and 1.4, respectively. Especially our solid-phase model outperforms all group-contribution models in predicting experimental sublimation pressures of solid compounds. To demonstrate its applicability, the model was used to predict psat of atmospherically relevant species, and the values were compared with those obtained from a new experimental method.

Among 58 PFAS analyzed in air (sum of gas and particulate phases), fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) were found at the highest concentrations (1900 ± 2000 pg/m3).

We found significant temporal variations in PFAS concentrations, with concentrations higher in warmer than colder months.

An important toxicity pathway is thought to follow oxidative stress from the formation of exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body, a proxy of which is oxidative potential (OP). As redox-active transition metals and organic species are important drivers of OP in urban environments, we investigate how seasonal changes in emission sources, aerosol chemical composition, acidity, and metal dissolution influence OP dynamics. Using a kinetic model of the lung redox chemistry, we predicted ROS (O2•–, H2O2, •OH) formation with input parameters comprising the ambient concentrations of PM2.5, water-soluble Fe and Cu, secondary organic matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone across two years and two urban sites in Canada. Particulate species were the largest contributors to ROS production. Soluble Fe and Cu had their highest and lowest values in summer and winter, and changes in Fe solubility were closely linked to seasonal variations in chemical aging, the acidity of aerosol, and organic ligand levels. The results indicate three conditions that influence OP across various seasons: (a) low aerosol pH and high organic ligand levels leading to the highest OP in summer, (b) opposite trends leading to the lowest OP in winter, and (c) intermediate conditions corresponding to moderate OP in spring and fall. This study highlights how atmospheric chemical aging modifies the oxidative burden of urban air pollutants, resulting in a seasonal cycle with a potential effect on population health."

Smith,Optical Properties of Biomass Burning Aerosols from Simulated Wildfires and Prescribed Fires with Representative Fuel Beds from the Southeast United States,"We report measurements of the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) and single scattering albedo (SSA) of biomass burning aerosol from the combustion of fuel beds representing three eco-regions of the Southeast U.S. (Piedmont, Coastal Plain, and Blue Ridge Mountains) with moisture content representative of wildfires and prescribed fires. We find a strong correlation between the AAE and SSA for both simulated wildfires (low fuel moisture) and prescribed fires (higher fuel moisture). For wildfires, the AAE and SSA are strongly dependent on the eco-region of the fuel bed and span a much wider range (AAE = 1.3–4.2, SSA = 0.75–0.97) than they do for prescribed fires (AAE = 2.4–3.1, SSA = 0.88–0.96). The AAE and SSA are also found to be correlated with the fraction of total carbon that is elemental carbon (fEC) for both wildfires and prescribed fires, but the range of fEC observed (0.02–0.14) from the fuel beds is much smaller than that reported previously from laboratory studies using individual fuels. The observations from the present study suggest that fuel-bed composition and moisture content are significant factors in determining the relative amount of organic material in biomass burning aerosols and, consequentially, their optical properties."

We constructed fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in the Southeastern U.S. and varied the fuel-bed moisture content to simulate either prescribed fires or drought-induced wildfires. Based on decreasing fire radiative energy normalized by fuel-bed mass loading (FREnorm), the combustion conditions were grouped into wildfire (Wild), prescribed fire (Rx), and wildfire involving duff ignition (WildDuff). The emitted BrC ranged from weakly absorbing (WildDuff) to moderately absorbing (Rx and Wild) with the imaginary part of the refractive index (k) values that were well-correlated with FREnorm. We apportioned the BrC into water-soluble (WSBrC) and water-insoluble (WIBrC). Approximately half of the WSBrC molecules detected using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry were potential chromophores. Nevertheless, k of WSBrC was an order of magnitude smaller than k of WIBrC. Furthermore, k of WIBrC was well-correlated with FREnorm while k of WSBrC was not, suggesting different formation pathways between WIBrC and WSBrC. Overall, the results signify the importance of combustion conditions in determining BrC light-absorption properties and indicate that variables in wildland fires, such as moisture content and fuel-bed composition, impact BrC light-absorption properties to the extent that they influence combustion conditions."

The resolution dependence of simulated η warrants further investigation. In this study, we calculate geophysical PM2.5 with simulated η from the GEOS-Chem model in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) at cubed-sphere resolutions of C360 (∼25 km) and C48 (∼200 km) and satellite AOD at 0.01° (∼1 km). Annual geophysical PM2.5 concentrations inferred from satellite AOD and GCHP simulations at ∼25 km and ∼200 km resolutions exhibit remarkable similarity (R2 = 0.96, slope = 1.03). This similarity in part reflects opposite resolution responses across components with population-weighted normalized mean difference (PW-NMD) increasing by 5% to 11% for primary species while decreasing by −30% to −5% for secondary species at finer resolution. Despite global similarity, our results also identify larger resolution sensitivities of η over isolated pollution sources and mountainous regions, where spatial contrast of aerosol concentration and composition is better represented at fine resolution. Our results highlight the resolution dependence of representing near-surface concentrations and the vertical distribution of chemically different species with implications for inferring ground-level PM2.5 from columnar AOD."

Measured time series of trace gases and radical concentrations are compared to zero-dimensional box model calculations, based on the Master Chemical Mechanism (agreement within 30%) and complemented by state-of-the-art structure–activity relationships (SAR). Including RO2 isomerization reactions from SAR, validated with theoretical calculations, improves particularly the model–measurement agreement by ∼20% for n-hexane. The photooxidation of the chosen compounds generates different types of peroxy radicals (RO2) which produce HO2 after one or multiple RO2+NO reaction steps, depending on the formed alkoxy radical (RO). Measurements show that the HO2/RO2 ratio is up to ∼40% lower and the number of odd oxygen (Ox = O3+NO2) formed per OH+VOC reaction (P(Ox)VOC) is up to ∼30% higher if RO regenerates RO2 instead of forming HO2 directly. Though, the formation of organic nitrates nearly completely compensates for the ozone production from the second NO reaction step for nitrate yields higher than 20%.

Veres,Online Calibration of a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer for Multifunctional Biogenic Organic Nitrates,"Multifunctional organic nitrates derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds are important for understanding ozone and secondary organic aerosol production from oxidation reactions in the presence of nitrogen oxides. Their measurement is challenging, in part because the quantification of these compounds is difficult and time consuming due to the techniques required to synthesize and purify authentic standards. We describe a novel online synthesis and separation technique and demonstrate its use for calibration of a chemical ionization mass spectrometer using iodide reagent ions (I– CIMS) to measure four isomers of isoprene hydroxy nitrate (IHN; C5H9NO4), two isomers of methyl vinyl ketone hydroxy nitrate (MVKHN; C4H7NO5), and four isomers of monoterpene hydroxy nitrate (MTHN; C10H17NO4). We further apply our separation technique to an isoprene + NO3 + HO2 online reactor to calibrate for six isomers of isoprene hydroperoxide nitrate (C5H9NO5). We find a large range of detection sensitivities and ion molecule reactor (IMR) temperature dependencies among the reported analytes measured as iodide (I–) clusters. We report a wide range of normalized sensitivities (normalized Hz pptv–1; nHz pptv–1) normalized by the [I·H2O]− reagent ion signal for this class of analytes (0.2–82 nHz pptv–1). The (4,3)-MVKHN isomer is exceptional for its high sensitivity with this ion chemistry (82 ± 5 nHz pptv–1), which can lead to an inaccurate representation of the organic nitrate budget if a moderate sensitivity is assumed. The I– CIMS demonstrates a much smaller range of sensitivities to IHNs (10–34 nHz pptv–1), with the two most abundant isomers having similar sensitivities ((1,2): 24 ± 3 nHz pptv–1; (4,3): 30 ± 4 nHz pptv–1). These calibrations reveal a significantly different distribution of organic nitrates than would be determined assuming uniform sensitivity for measurements with an I– CIMS at a ground site in Pasadena, CA, during the summer of 2021. A comparison with another calibrated CIMS (using CF3O– reagent ions) for select compounds showed good agreement for IHN and MVKHN."

Their aqueous extracts were nebulized simultaneously to an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and a recently developed extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) mass spectrometer, for bulk and near-molecular organic aerosol (OA) composition, respectively. Carbonate was quantified using EESI and a total organic carbon analyzer to separate inorganic carbon from dust. Via isotopically-labelled internal standards and positive matrix factorization, seven water-soluble sources were quantified separately using the AMS- and EESI-based analyses, with consistent types, concentrations, and correlations. These include dust, solid fuel combustion (SFC)-related, nitrogen- (and sulfur-) containing, summer/winter oxygenated OAs, and a cigarette-related OA only in EESI. When accounting for water-solubility, SFC-related OAs were the largest (53%) sources in Chongqing, while dust (consisting of 77% OA and 23% carbonates) was the largest (30%) source in Xi’an. Overall, this study presents one of the first times that complementary mass spectrometric techniques independently resolved consistent OA sources─with added chemical information─over multiple seasons and locations of complex pollution. The methods and quantified sources are essential for subsequent chemical, modelling, and health studies, and policy making for air pollution mitigation."

Sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are two of the largest contributors to PM2.5 in Mexico City, but uncertainties exist regarding their sources, distribution across individual particles, and ability to form organosulfates. Herein, we show using electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy that only 41 ± 1% and 25 ± 1% of particles (aerodynamic diameter, 0.32–0.56 μm) by number at two sites in Mexico City, respectively, contain sulfur. Vibrational spectroscopy (Optical-Photothermal Infrared + Raman Microspectroscopy) shows that these sulfur-containing particles consist of inorganic sulfate (SO42–) and organosulfates (ROSO3–). In addition, we unexpectedly measured abundant isoprene-derived SOA from low nitric oxide reaction pathways, specifically organosulfates (methyltetrol sulfates = avg. 50 ng/m3, max. 150 ng/m3) and polyols (methyltetrols = avg. 70 ng/m3, max. 190 ng/m3) using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Differences in SO2 and NOx concentrations between sites likely contribute to these spatial differences in sulfate, organosulfate, and SOA formation. These findings improve understanding of sulfur distribution and sources of SOA in Mexico City, which can inform efforts to improve air quality."

Although it is generally assumed that deposition is the major sink, aqueous reactions in aerosols and clouds may be possible but have yet to be considered. Here, we report a study of the aqueous reactions of urea with methylglyoxal as a function of pH using optical property measurements as a proxy for reaction. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy is used to monitor bulk-phase browning while cavity ringdown and photoacoustic spectroscopies are used to measure the aerosol optical properties. We observe the reaction of urea with methylglyoxal produces brown carbon at low and high pH, with little absorption at mid-pH ranges. The urea brown carbon products absorb well into the visible range, providing a greater overlap with the solar emission spectrum than previously studied brown carbon systems including that of methylglyoxal and ammonium. These experiments suggest that urea could be chemically transformed in aqueous aerosol with the products contributing to aerosol absorption."

To characterize measurement uncertainty, we examine controlled release (CR) data from five different technology providers including quantitative gas imaging (QOGI), tunable diode laser-absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS); and airborne near-infrared hyperspectral (NIR HS) imaging. We introduce a novel empirical method to develop probability distributions of measurements given a true emission rate using the CR data. The approach includes flexible likelihoods which capture complex relationships in the data. An algorithm which provides the distribution of the true emission rate given a measurement is also developed, which synthesizes the measurement with the CR data and external information about the possible true emission rate. The results show that flexible models that accommodate complex nonlinear behavior are needed to adequately model measurement error. We also show that measurement error can vary under different conditions. We demonstrate that measurement uncertainty can be reduced by performing repeated measurements. A limitation of the study is that the collected CR data is collected under controlled conditions that may differ from those in industrial settings. As new CR data become available, the models presented in this paper can be refit to consider more diverse scenarios. The methodology can be extended to explicitly model different conditions to improve performance."

Burns were conducted under conditions representative of wildfires, which are common unplanned occurrences in Southeastern forests (low fuel moisture content), and prescribed fires, which are commonly used in forest management (higher fuel moisture content). Upon exposure to radiation from UV lamps equivalent to approximately 5 h in the atmosphere, the absorption spectra of all six samples exhibited up to 40% photobleaching in the UV range (280–400 nm) and as much as 30% photo-enhancement in the visible range (400–500 nm). Together, these two effects reduced the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), a measure of the wavelength dependence of the spectrum, from 6.0–7.9 before photolysis to 5.0–5.7 after. Electrospray ionization ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry analysis shows the potential formation of oligomeric chromophores due to aqueous photolysis.

There is limited knowledge of how NO2 inequalities vary in urban air quality contexts, in part from the lack of time-varying neighborhood-level NO2 measurements. First, we demonstrate that daily TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs) resolve a major portion of census tract-scale NO2 inequalities in Houston, comparing NO2 inequalities based on TROPOMI TVCDs and spatiotemporally coincident airborne remote sensing (250 m × 560 m) from the NASA TRacking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment–Air Quality (TRACER-AQ). We further evaluate the application of daily TROPOMI TVCDs to census tract-scale NO2 inequalities (May 2018–November 2022). This includes explaining differences between mean daily NO2 inequalities and those based on TVCDs oversampled to 0.01° × 0.01° and showing daily NO2 column-surface relationships weaken as a function of observation separation distance. Second, census tract-scale NO2 inequalities, city-wide high O3, and mesoscale airflows are found to covary using principal component and cluster analysis. A generalized additive model of O3 mixing ratios versus NO2 inequalities reproduces established nonlinear relationships between O3 production and NO2 concentrations, providing observational evidence that neighborhood-level NO2 inequalities and O3 are coupled. Consequently, emissions controls specifically in Black, Latinx, and Asian communities will have co-benefits, reducing both NO2 disparities and high O3 days city wide."

Focusing on non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) properties measured by high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS), the research extends to organic aerosol (OA) sources identified via positive matrix factorization of high-resolution MS data. The models achieved good predictive accuracy (R2 > 0.90) for all species concentrations, except for hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) due to frequent concentration fluctuations. The model outcomes aligned well with those previously achieved using conventional methods (chemical transport model and correlational analysis), confirming that relative humidity is associated with nocturnal nitrate concentration and photochemistry associated with sulfate concentration in the summertime in Seoul. Importantly, the models revealed mostly nonlinear relationships between atmospheric factors, such as temperature and particulate matter (PM) components, thereby deepening the understanding of formation processes. Notably, different potential formation mechanisms were discerned for more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) and oxidized primary OA (OPOA). For MO-OOA, SHAP analysis showed a plateau in SHAP values at an Ox concentration of 0.085 ppm, which suggested potential fragmentation from further oxidation and agreed with previous chamber experiments. Conversely, the lack of a plateau in the Ox values for OPOA implied potential ongoing oxidation, suggesting a higher and longer atmospheric oxidation potential. This approach offers rapid and potential insights into complex atmospheric aerosol formation processes. It is essential to acknowledge that SHAP values do not establish causality, and knowledge of the underlying physical and chemical processes was required to conclude valid and comprehensive interpretations of the ML results."

Moreover, the degradation of EA forms carbonyl species, which are precursors to brown carbon (BrC) formation. In this study, we investigated the aging of EA-containing particles mediated by NO3– photolysis under different relative humidity (RH) and initial pH conditions under 300 nm UV irradiation. The more acidic (pH 0.0, 0.2, and 0.6) particles (EA:H+ molar ratio = 4:4.25, 4:4.5, 4:5 at 70% RH) exhibited an increase in pH, while the less acidic (pH 5.0, 4.8, 4.7, and 5.1) particles (EA:H+ = 4:4 at 40%, 55%, 70%, and 85% RH) showed a decrease in pH as a result of photooxidation. We attributed these contrary pH changes to the combination of the HONO evaporation, which increases the pH, and the EA reactions, which decrease the pH. The decay rates of NO3– and EA appear not to be sensitive to RH and pH within experimental uncertainties. We proposed EA reaction pathways in the presence of oxidants produced from NO3– photolysis based on product speciation. We also observed the formation of water-soluble organics (BrC and an organic phase) as a potential secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This study sheds light on the particulate sink of EA and its potential in BrC and SOA formation mediated by NO3– photolysis in the atmosphere, providing new insights into the aging of amines in atmospheric aerosols."

Organic aerosol (OA) is often the bottleneck of further reducing PM pollution. To devise effective control measures, the sources of OA must be identified and quantified first. This study expanded the capability of cutting-edge iodide-based chemical ionization mass spectrometry in a source apportionment study by measuring a variety of oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs). A workflow was developed to find suitable tracers from these OOMs. The source apportionment research of OAs was advanced by incorporating these OOM tracers with traditional nonpolar/polar organic tracers. The OOMs-incorporated positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to two unique groups of aerosol samples collected in an inland megacity and an ocean expedition. PMF without OOM tracers overestimated the OA contribution from fossil fuel combustion, plastic burning, and monoterpene SOA. On average, PMF with OOM tracers assigned 28.8% and 44.1% of OA in inland megacity and marine samples, respectively, to 4 new factors: aliphatic SOA, highly oxidized aromatic SOA, sulfur-containing SOA, and nitrogen-containing SOA.

However, the key factors affecting OS formation in nearly dry and weakly acidic aerosol conditions remain elusive. This topic was resolved by examining the composition and formation of OSs in PM2.5 collected in Urumqi (dry and dusty) over a one-year period. Anthropogenic OSs accounted for 49 ± 8% of the total OSs, indicating a large anthropogenic contribution to OS formation in Urumqi (particularly in winter). The low aerosol liquid water (ALW) concentration (2 ± 2 μg m–3) and weak particle acidity (pH = 7 ± 2) during the summer were important factors limiting anthropogenic OS formation. However, increased ALW (100 ± 70 μg m–3) and particle acidity (pH = 5 ± 1) during the winter significantly promoted anthropogenic OS production. The formation of most of isoprene- and monoterpene-derived OSs during summer was also constrained by unfavorable ALW concentration and particle acidity, resulting in biogenic OS levels being lower in summer than in winter.

In each phase, we generate the 1-pentoxy radical from the photolysis of n-pentyl nitrite, run the chemistry under conditions in which RO2 radicals react with NO, and detect the products in real time using an ammonium chemical ionization mass spectrometer (NH4+ CIMS). The condensed-phase chemistry shows an increase in formation of organic nitrate (RONO2) from the downstream RO2+NO reaction, which is attributed to potential collisional and solvent-cage stabilization of the RO2–NO complex. We further observe an enhancement in the yield of carbonyl relative to hydroxy carbonyl products in the condensed phase, indicating changes to RO radical kinetics. The different branching ratios in the condensed phase impact the product volatility distribution as well as HOx-NOx chemistry, and may have implications for nitrate formation, aqueous aerosol formation, and radical cycling within atmospheric particles and droplets."

One potentially important source is catalytic heaters, which  have largely escaped attention in regulatory and mitigation efforts despite being ubiquitous at upstream production sites in cold climate regions. This study reports direct in situ measurements of the exhaust streams of 38 natural gas-fired catalytic heaters at upstream production sites in British Columbia, Canada. All heaters in the sample showed consistently poor methane conversion with mean destruction efficiencies of 61 ± 5% while releasing 235 [+31/–28] g of methane per cubic meter of fuel. Although individual units are generally small methane sources (mean of 0.28 ± 0.04 kg/h), their prevalence means they could represent 6% of the total provincial upstream methane inventory and as an aggregate methane source could be 5× more significant than abandoned wells. Notably, these heaters are seasonal sources whose emissions would be missed in measurement campaigns occurring solely in summer months. However, additional measurements from a small number of heat medium burners demonstrate that, where feasible, methane emissions can be reduced by approximately 425× by replacing catalytic heaters with centralized heat systems."

However, detected OSs cannot fully account for the sulfur content released from reacted 2-MTS, indicating the existence of sulfur in forms other than OSs such as inorganic sulfates. This work investigated the formation of inorganic sulfates through heterogeneous •OH oxidation of 2-MTS aerosols. Remarkably, high yields of inorganic sulfates, defined as the moles of inorganic sulfates produced per mole of reacted 2-MTS, were observed in the range from 0.48 ± 0.07 to 0.68 ± 0.07. These could be explained by the production of sulfate (SO4•–) and sulfite (SO3•–) radicals through the cleavage of C–O(S) and (C)O–S bonds, followed by aerosol-phase reactions. Additionally, nonsulfated products resulting from bond cleavage were likely volatile and evaporated into the gas phase, as evidenced by the observed aerosol mass loss (≤25%) and concurrent size reduction upon oxidation. This investigation highlights the significant transformation of sulfur from its organic to inorganic forms during the heterogeneous oxidation of 2-MTS aerosols, potentially influencing the physicochemical properties and environmental impacts of isoprene-derived SOAs."

However, its effects on SO42–and air quality in different regions remain unexplored. In this study, we implement a detailed model representation of SO42– formation via NO3– photolysis into the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. Our results find considerable impacts of NO3– photolysis on surface SO42–, especially over India and other coastal regions (up to 15% increment of annual average concentrations), which were previously unaccounted for in most models. The effects are mainly due to S(IV) oxidation by OH, H2O2, and O3 following renoxification, which outcompetes aqueous oxidation by N(III), contrary to previous laboratory and modeling studies. Further analysis suggests that past studies might have underestimated the particle-to-gas transfer of N(III) in ambient aerosols. We suggest that future modeling works should use experiment-derived parameters with caution and a thorough understanding of the mechanism before implementing them into models, especially when dealing with those from large particles or bulk solutions involving mass transfer."

We measured HbA1c in 577 samples repeatedly collected from 224 pregnant people in Rochester, NY, and estimated residential concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 using high-resolution spatiotemporal models. We observed a U-shaped trajectory of HbA1c during pregnancy with average HbA1c levels of 5.13 (±0.52), 4.97 (±0.54), and 5.43 (±0.40)% in early-, mid-, and late pregnancy, respectively. After adjustment for the U-shaped trajectory and classic GDM risk factors, each interquartile range increase in 10 week NO2 concentration (8.0 ppb) was associated with 0.09% (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.16%) and 0.18% (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.28%) increases in HbA1c over the entire pregnancy and in late pregnancy, respectively.

However, endeavors to mitigate air pollution and health benefits have displayed considerable heterogeneity across different regions. Therefore, comprehending the changes in air pollutant concentrations and health impacts within an urbanization context is imperative for promoting environmental equity. This paper uses gross domestic product (GDP)- and population-weighted methods to distinguish anthropogenic emissions from urban and non-urban areas in China and quantified their contributions to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in 2010 and 2019.

However, the current understanding of the source of NO2–/HONO is insufficient and therefore hinders the accurate quantification of atmospheric oxidation capacity. Herein, we highlighted an overlooked HONO source by the reaction between nitrophenols (NPs) and •OH in the aqueous phase and provided kinetic data to better evaluate the contribution of this process to atmospheric HONO. Three typical NPs, including 4-nitrophenol (4NP), 2-nitrophenol (2NP), and 4-nitrocatechol (4NC), underwent a denitration process to form aqueous NO2– and gaseous HONO through the •OH oxidation, with the yield of NO2–/HONO varied from 15.0 to 33.5%. According to chemical composition and structure analysis, the reaction pathway, where the ipso addition of •OH to the NO2 group on 4NP generated hydroquinone, can contribute to more than 61.9% of the NO2–/HONO formation. The aqueous photooxidation of NPs may account for HONO in the atmosphere, depending on the specific conditions.

The products result from a redox process that takes place at the liquid–solid interface through contact electrification, where no external potential is applied. Oxidation is initiated by superoxide radical anions (O2–) that originate from the oxygen in the air surrounding the microdroplets and from the hydroxyl radicals (OH•) originating from the water–air interface. Two spin traps (TEMPO and DMPO) capture these radicals as well as NH2OH+•, HNO, NO•, NO2•, and NOOH, which are detected by mass spectrometry. We also directly observed N2O2–• by the same means. We found that the hydrogen atom from the ammonia molecule can be set free not only in the form of H• but also as H2, which is detected using a residue gas analyzer. The oxidation process can be significantly enhanced by a factor of 3 when the sprayed microdroplets are irradiated with ultraviolet light (265 nm, 5 W). 35% of 300 μM ammonia can be degraded within 20 μs, and the nitrate conversion rate is estimated to be 15 nmol·mg–1·h–1."

We associated the risk of stillbirth simultaneously with dust and nondust components of PM2.5 and developed a nonlinear joint exposure–response function. Next, we estimated the burden of stillbirths attributable to the PM2.5 mixture. The concentration index was used to evaluate whether the burden of PM2.5-related stillbirths was disproportionally distributed among pregnancies exposed to dust-rich particles. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in dust PM2.5 was associated with a 14.5% (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 24.2%) increase in the odds of stillbirth. Based on the risk assessment across 137 countries, sand dust contributed to about 15% of the PM2.5 exposure but to about 45% of the PM2.5-related stillbirths during 2003–2019.

Pelletized biomass fuels are promoted as a cleaner alternative, particularly for those who cannot afford the high costs of gas/electricity, but their emission characteristics and potential effects remain poorly understood. The present laboratory-based study evaluated pollution emissions from pelletized biomass burning, including CH4 (methane), NMHC (nonmethane hydrocarbon compounds), CO, SO2, NOx, PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm), OC (organic carbon), EC (element carbon), PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), EPFRs (environmentally persistent free radicals), and OP (oxidative potential) of PM2.5, and compared with those from raw biomass burning. For most targets, except for SO2 and NOx, the mass-based emission factors for pelletized biomass were 62–96% lower than those for raw biomass. SO2 and NOx levels were negatively correlated with other air pollutants (p < 0.05). Based on real-world daily consumption data, this study estimated that households using pelletized biomass could achieve significant reductions (51–95%) in emissions of CH4, NMHC, CO, PM2.5, OC, EC, PAHs, and EPFRs compared to those using raw biomass, while the differences in emissions of NOx and SO2 were statistically insignificant. The reduction rate of benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent emissions was only 16%, much lower than the reduction in the total PAH mass (78%). This is primarily attributed to the more PAHs with high toxic potentials, such as dibenz(a,h)anthracene, in the pelletized biomass emissions. Consequently, impacts on human health associated with PAHs might be overestimated if only the mass of total PAHs was counted. The OP of particles from the pellet burning was also significantly lower than that from raw biomass by  96%. The results suggested that pelletized biomass could be a transitional substitution option that can significantly improve air quality and mitigate human exposure."

In this process, carbon loss is controlled by lignin, but the mechanisms of production of CO2 and CH4 during lignin photolysis are ambiguous. In this study, the photomineralization of plant litter and the lignocellulosic component collectively indicate that lignin is a major source of CO2 and CH4 emissions. Characterization and free radical analysis reveal that the production of CO2 is due to the oxidation and ring-opening reaction of the coniferyl alcohol unit, with the subsequent decarboxylation of carboxylic acid as an oxidation product. This reaction involves o-quinone formation by the reactions between O2, superoxide radical (O2·–), and persistent free radicals (PFRs)-bearing lignin. Of this, O2·– contributes to 43.2% of the photogenerated CO2, as a new pathway, derived from the electron transfer from PFRs to O2. Interestingly, photoinduced demethylation of the dimethoxybenzene-type compounds as the photolysis products of lignin results in a never-before-reported CH4 formation chemical route independent of that of O2. This mechanistic insight into the role of lignin in volatile carbon production from the irradiative plant litter will contribute to a deeper understanding of carbon balance in water-limited ecosystems."

Herein, we explored the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the potential risks of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) on DSMs. At environmentally relevant concentrations, the conjugate transfer frequency (CTF) of ARGs increased by 1.34–2.37 folds by 20 μg/m3 of atmospheric water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), and it increased by 2.62–2.86 folds by 80 ng/m3 of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Total suspended particulates (TSP) further promoted the CTF in combination with WSIIs or PAHs. Under WSII and PAH exposure, gene expression levels related to oxidative stress, cell membrane, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were upregulated. WSIIs predominantly induced cellular contact, while PAHs triggered ATP formation and membrane damage. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that WSIIs and PAHs reduced membrane lipid fluidity and increased membrane permeability through interactions with the phosphatidylcholine bilayer. DSM filtering performance decreased, and the CTF of ARGs increased with the wearing time. The gut simulator test showed that ARB disrupted the human gut microbial community and increased total ARG abundance but did not change the ARG abundance carried by ARB themselves.

Here we identify key sources for co-control that prioritize the mitigation of PM2.5-related health burdens, given the homogeneous impacts of CO2 emissions from various sources. By applying an integrated analysis framework that consists of a detailed emission inventory, a chemical transport model, a multisource fused dataset, and epidemiological concentration–response functions, we systematically evaluate the contribution of emissions from 390 sources (30 provinces and 13 socioeconomic sectors) to PM2.5-related health impacts and CO2 emissions, as well as the marginal health benefits of CO2 abatement across China. The estimated source-specific contributions exhibit substantial disparities, with the marginal benefits varying by 3 orders of magnitude. The rural residential, transportation, metal, and power and heating sectors emerge as pivotal sources for co-control, with regard to their relatively large marginal benefits or the sectoral total benefits. In addition, populous and heavily industrialized provinces such as Shandong and Henan are identified as the key regions for co-control.

However, quantifying hydroxyl radicals (•OH), essential for H2O2 formation, remains challenging due to their short lifespan and low concentration. This study addresses this gap by presenting a highly sensitive and selective surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensor specifically designed for quantifying •OH within water microdroplets. Utilizing a phthalhydrazide (Phth) probe, the SERS technique enables rapid, interference-free detection of •OH at nanomolar concentrations. It achieves a linear detection range from 2 nM to 2 μM and a limit of detection as low as 0.34 nM. Importantly, the SERS sensor demonstrates robustness and accuracy within water microdroplets, paving the way for comprehensive mechanistic studies of H2O2 generation in the atmosphere.

This requires identifying and understanding a proxy that is well-correlated with ground-level ozone variation and available with spatiotemporal high-resolution data. This study introduces a high-resolution ozone modeling method utilizing the XGBoost algorithm with satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) as the primary predictor. Focusing on China in 2019, our model achieved a cross-validation R2 of 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13.51 μg/m3. We provide detailed maps highlighting ground-level ozone concentrations in urban areas, uncovering spatial variations previously unresolved, along with time series aligning with established understandings of ozone dynamics. Our local interpretation of the machine learning model underscores the significant contribution of LST to spatiotemporal ozone variations, surpassing other meteorological, pollutant, and geographical predictors in its influence. Validation results indicate that model performance decreases as spatial resolution becomes coarser, with R2 decreasing from 0.91 for the 1 km model to 0.85 for the 25 km model.

However, we know little about their ability to nucleate ice and their impact on ice formation in clouds. Ice nucleation by microplastics could also limit their long-range transport and global distribution. The present study explores the heterogeneous ice-nucleating ability of seven microplastic samples in immersion freezing mode. Two polypropylene samples and one polyethylene terephthalate sample froze heterogeneously with median freezing temperatures of −20.9, −23.2, and −21.9 °C, respectively. The number of ice nucleation sites per surface area, ns(T), ranged from 10–1 to 104 cm–2 in a temperature interval of −15 to −25 °C, which is comparable to that of volcanic ash and fungal spores. After exposure to ozone or a combination of UV light and ozone, simulating atmospheric aging, the ice nucleation activity decreased in some cases and remained unchanged in others. Our freezing data suggest that microplastics may promote ice formation in cloud droplets. In addition, based on a comparison of our freezing results and previous simulations using a global transport model, ice nucleation by microplastics will impact their long-range transport to faraway locations and global distribution."

However, accurately measuring the fine-mode aerosol optical depth (fAOD) is highly uncertain in most existing satellite-based aerosol products. Deep learning offers promise for inferring fAOD, but little has been done using multiangle satellite data. We developed an innovative angle-dependent deep-learning model (ADLM) that accounts for angular diversity in dual-angle observations. The model captures aerosol properties observed from dual angles in the contiguous United States and explores the potential of Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite-2’s (GOSAT-2) measurements to retrieve fAOD at a 460 m spatial resolution. The ADLM demonstrates a strong performance through rigorous validation against ground-based data, revealing small biases. By comparison, the official fAOD product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) during wildfire events is underestimated by more than 40% over western USA. This leads to significant differences in estimates of aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) from wildfires.

Woehl,Imaging Dissolution Dynamics of Individual NaCl Nanoparticles during Deliquescence with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy,"Water vapor condensation on hygroscopic aerosol particles plays an important role in cloud formation, climate change, secondary aerosol formation, and aerosol aging. Conventional understanding considers deliquescence of nanosized hygroscopic aerosol particles a nearly instantaneous solid to liquid phase transition. However, the nanoscale dynamics of water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence remain obscure due to a lack of high spatial and temporal resolution single particle measurements. Here we use real time in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of individual sodium chloride (NaCl) nanoparticles to demonstrate that water adsorption and aerosol particle dissolution prior to and during deliquescence is a multistep dynamic process. Water condensation and aerosol particle dissolution was investigated for lab generated NaCl aerosols and found to occur in three distinct stages as a function of increasing relative humidity (RH). First, a < 100 nm water layer adsorbed on the NaCl cubes and caused sharp corners to dissolve and truncate. The water layer grew to several hundred nanometers with increasing RH and was rapidly saturated with solute, as evidenced by halting of particle dissolution. Adjacent cube corners displayed second-scale curvature fluctuations with no net particle dissolution or water layer thickness change. We propose that droplet solute concentration fluctuations drove NaCl transport from regions of high local curvature to regions of low curvature. Finally, we observed coexistence of a liquid water droplet and aerosol particle immediately prior to deliquescence. Particles dissolved discretely along single crystallographic directions, separated by few second lag times with no dissolution. This work demonstrates that deliquescence of simple pure salt particles with sizes in the range of 100 nm to several microns is not an instantaneous phase transition and instead involves a range of complex dissolution and water condensation dynamics."

Radionuclides are one of the contaminants that can be remobilised through ice melting and accumulate in cryoconite material on the surface of glaciers. To understand the cycling of radionuclides in polar glacial contexts, we evaluate the radioactivity of cryoconite samples from Flade Isblink, a High Arctic ice cap in northeast Greenland. The measured radioactivity is among the highest reported across the High Arctic and the highest from Greenland. The high variability observed among the samples is explained by considering the different macroscopic features of single cryoconite deposits.

While many studies have developed empirical models to elucidate the effects of meteorology on ozone variability, they predominantly focus on local weather conditions, overlooking the influences from high-altitude and broader regional meteorological patterns. Here, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a technique typically applied to image recognition, to investigate the influence of three-dimensional spatial variations in meteorological fields on the daily, seasonal, and interannual dynamics of ozone in Shenzhen, a major coastal urban center in China. Our optimized CNNs model, covering a 13° × 13° spatial domain, effectively explains over 70% of daily ozone variability, outperforming alternative empirical approaches by 7 to 62%. Model interpretations reveal the crucial roles of 2-m temperature and humidity as primary drivers, contributing 16% and 15% to daily ozone fluctuations, respectively. Regional wind fields account for up to 40% of ozone changes during the episodes. CNNs successfully replicate observed ozone temporal patterns, attributing −5–6 μg·m–3 of interannual ozone variability to weather anomalies. Our interpretable CNNs framework enables quantitative attribution of historical ozone fluctuations to nonlinear meteorological effects across spatiotemporal scales, offering vital process-based insights for managing megacity air quality amidst changing climate regimes."

 Urbanization has exerted considerable impacts on urban water systems and ecological environments, yet its effects on local meteorological drought remain under-explored. The primary challenge to local-scale drought analysis is the scarcity of meteorological datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. To address the research gap, we initially proposed a two-step fusion framework, integrating both surface (i.e., gridded data)-surface and point (i.e., in-situ data)-surface fusion. The framework was applied to generate daily precipitation and average/maximum/minimum air temperature at a 1 km resolution through the integration of high-resolution remotely sensed datasets across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China. The final fused data demonstrated excellent performance, achieving a PCC (RMSE) of 0.806 (5.414 mm/day), 0.993 (1.138 °C), 0.987 (1.443 °C), and 0.988 (1.376 °C) for precipitation and average/maximum/minimum air temperature, respectively. A comparison of our fused data with CPC, ERA5-Land, CMFD, CHIRPS, IMERG, and TMPA products confirmed its capability in capturing local-scale meteorological dynamics by improving spatial resolution from 0.1°-0.25° to 1 km. Utilizing these high-resolution datasets, we quantified urbanization's impacts on local drought across 52 major cities in the YRB. We found that urbanization significantly magnified extreme Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and drought severity in 69.2% and 61.5% of these cities, respectively. The effects of urbanization on extreme SPEI were amplified by the increase of urbanization rates, with a slope of −0.24 (p < 0.05). To further examine the spatial patterns of urbanization-induced local drought, we proposed a drought spatial field identification method, utilizing it in three representative urban regions: Chengdu, Wuhan, and the Yangtze River Delta. Our findings revealed that urbanization led to more intense peak drought intensity and average drought severity. In addition, urban drought fields showed lower effective radius, indicating more concentrated drought towards urban regions. While urbanization is projected to continue alongside rapid population growth in the future, the advanced application of remote sensing data and technology in this study not only improves our understanding of urban water resource challenges but also equips urban planners with the necessary data to develop effective drought mitigation strategies."

 Changes in the net carbon sink of boreal forests constitute a major source of uncertainty in the future global carbon budget and, hence, climate change projections. The annual net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) controlling the terrestrial carbon stock results from the small difference between respiratory CO2 release and the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by vegetation. The boreal forest, and the boreal biome in general, is regarded as a persistent and even increasing net carbon sink. However, decreases in photosynthetic CO2 uptake and/or concurrent increases in respiratory CO2 release under a changing climate may turn boreal forests from a net sink to a net source of CO2. Here, we assessed the interannual variability of the boreal forest net CO2 sink-source strength and its two component fluxes from 1981 to 2018. Our remote sensing approach - trained by net CO2 flux observations at eddy covariance sites across the circumpolar boreal forests - employs satellite-derived retrievals of snowmelt timing, landscape freeze-thaw status, and yearly maximum estimates of the normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for peak vegetation productivity. Our results suggest that for the period 2000–2018, the mean annual evergreen boreal forest CO2 photosynthetic uptake (gross primary productivity) was 2.8±0.2 Pg C y−1 (1.6±0.1 Pg C y−1 for Eurasia and 1.2±0.1 Pg C y−1 for North America). In contrast to earlier studies results obtained here do not indicate a clear increasing trend in the circumpolar evergreen boreal forest CO2 sink. The increase in photosynthetic CO2 uptake is compensated by increasing respiratory releases with both component fluxes showing considerable interannual variabilities."

 Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a new technique to provide L-band bistatic measurements for ocean wind speed retrieval, in which traditional geophysical model functions (GMFs) or shallow neural networks (NNs) are normally used. However, it is still challenging to identify and consider all relevant parameters in the GMF. Meanwhile, NN models face limitations due to the degradation problem, which restricts their depth and consequently their performance. Furthermore, the interpretation of NN models for GNSS-R wind retrieval is another issue. To this end, we propose a residual fully connected network (RFCN) fusing auxiliary information such as geometry, receiver gain, significant wave height, and current speed with track-wise corrected σ0. Referred to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 wind product, the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of RFCN winds are 1.031 m/s and -0.0003 m/s, respectively, with a 6% improvement in RMSE compared to debiased NOAA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) Version 1.2 (V1.2) wind speed retrieval. Moreover, in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) area with large current speeds, the RMSE and bias are 1.006 m/s and -0.022 m/s: an improvement of 11.6% and 87.9% compared to debiased NOAA CYGNSS V1.2 winds. The bias ‘strips’ in these areas are nearly eliminated. Daily averaged error analyses also demonstrate that RFCN winds are more robust and consistent with ECMWF winds. For wind speeds larger than 20 m/s, referred to Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 3 final wind products, the RMSE and bias of fine-tuning RFCN (FT_RFCN) winds are reduced by 25.7% and 91.5% compared to NOAA winds. Finally, the RMSE and bias of retrievals in tropical cyclones, measured by Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) during 2021-2022, reveal an improvement of 3.5% and 21.2% compared to NOAA winds. Through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) models developed for RFCN and FT_RFCN, the contribution of each feature is quantitatively evaluated, while providing insights into their interactions within the ‘black-box’ NN models with clear physical meanings."

Specifically, we have validated the S5P/TROPOMI GRASP, Suomi-NPP/VIIRS DB and MODIS/TERRA DT + DB aerosol products with the ground-based AERONET referenced measurements using the same methodology and intercompare the validation results. In addition, the global pixel-to-pixel intercomparisons of the aerosol products (AOD, fine/coarse mode AOD and SSA) are performed over different surfaces, i.e., ocean and land surface with different NDVIs. Besides, we compared the S5P/TROPOMI GRASP, MODIS MCD43 surface BRDF/albedo as well as OMI, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY Lambertian-Equivalent Reflectivity (LER) albedo climatology developed by Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) with the surface reference dataset generated based on the synergetic retrieval of AERONET and S5P/TROPOMI measurements.

Overall, generally good agreement was observed between independent aerosol and surface datasets with a high percentage of pixels satisfying the Optimal and Target requirements. We would emphasize two advantages for TROPOMI/GRASP aerosol and surface products: (i) it provides spectral AOD together with detailed aerosol properties, such as fine/coarse mode AOD, spectral AAOD and SSA at UV, VIS, NIR and SWIR wavelengths, which are important for constraining aerosol environmental and climate effects; (ii) the TROPOMI/GRASP aerosol and surface products are globally retrieved simultaneously in a fully consistent manner."

 The launch of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in 2015 has resulted in significant achievements in global soil moisture mapping. Nonetheless, spatiotemporal discontinuities in the soil moisture products have arisen due to the limitations of its orbit scanning gap and retrieval algorithms. To address these issues, this paper presents a physics-constrained gap-filling method, PhyFill for short. The PhyFill method employs a partial convolutional neural network technique to explore spatial domain features of the original SMAP soil moisture data. Then, it incorporates variations in soil moisture induced by precipitation events and dry-down events as penalty terms in the loss function, thereby accounting for monotonicity and boundary constraints in the physical processes governing the dynamic fluctuations of soil moisture. The PhyFill model was applied to SMAP soil moisture data, resulting in continuous spatially daily soil moisture data on a global scale. Three validation strategies are employed: visual inspection through global pattern, simulated missing-region validation, and soil moisture validation with in situ measurements. The results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture achieved a higher spatial coverage with satisfactory spatial continuity with neighbouring pixels. The simulated validation of the missing regions revealed that the averaged unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) and correlation coefficient (R) were 0.01 m3/m3 and 0.99, respectively versus the gap filled SMAP product. The core validation sites demonstrated that the reconstructed soil moisture data has a consistent ubRMSD compared with the original SMAP soil moisture data (0.04 m3/m3 vs. 0.04 m3/m3). The PhyFill method can generate globally continuous, high accurate soil moisture estimates, providing remarkable support for advanced hydrological applications, e.g., global soil moisture dry-down events and patterns."

 Seasonal snow plays a crucial role in society and understanding trends in snow depth and mass is essential for making informed decisions about water resources and adaptation to climate change. However, quantifying snow depth in remote, mountainous areas with complex topography remains a significant challenge. The increasing availability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations from active microwave satellites has prompted opportunistic use of the data to retrieve snow depth remotely across large spatial and frequent temporal scales and at a high spatial resolution. Nevertheless, these novel SAR-based snow depth retrieval methods face their own set of limitations, including challenges for shallow snowpacks, high vegetation cover, and wet snow conditions. In response, here we introduce a machine learning approach to enhance SAR-based snow depth estimation over the European Alps. By integrating Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, optical snow cover observations, and topographic, forest cover and snow class information, our machine learning retrieval method more accurately estimates snow depth at independent in-situ measurement sites than current methods. Further, our method provides estimates at 100 m horizontal resolution and is capable of better capturing local-scale topography-driven snow depth variability. Through detailed feature importance analysis, we identify optimal conditions for SAR data utilization, thereby providing insight into future use of C-band SAR for snow depth retrieval."

 Transparent, accurate, and affordable monitoring of CO2 emissions from power plants is crucial for realization of transition away from fossil fuels. Satellite remote sensing has emerged as a recent research focus, enabling emission estimation without the cooperation of emitters. In 2022, China launched the world's first CO2 monitoring satellite based on laser detection, DQ-1. Equipped with ACDL, it enables accurate detection even under nighttime and high aerosol load conditions, serving as a significant complement to existing optical satellite systems. However, the feasibility of laser detection with narrow swath width for monitoring power plant emissions remains uncertain. This work presents, for the first time, the practical capability of using spaceborne LIDAR to estimate CO2 emissions from power plants. We employ the Gaussian dispersion model as the transport model and quantify emission rates using genetic and trust-region algorithms. Through satellite observations from June to December 2022, we conducted emission estimation experiments for 15 globally distributed power plants. Results indicate that using ACDL's XCO2 yields approximately unbiased estimates (∼2%) of power plant emissions overall, despite a single-overpass uncertainty of 18%. This performance is comparable to OCO-2/3, suggesting consistent benchmarks for different satellite mechanisms in reporting power plant emissions. Consequently, combining their results enhances monitoring of global power plants. We advocate the joint use of diverse CO2 monitoring satellites employing various detection mechanisms to gather a more comprehensive XCO2 dataset, aiming to achieve routine satellite-based verification of power plant emissions."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) which can be estimated from appropriate measurements of the surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiance. LST varies on a very short time scale and closely depends on the illumination and scan angles considered. To fully exploit LST products, a method for reconstructing the temporal profile and the angular dependence at the same time is proposed here. A combined visible-thermal envelope method (VT-KDTC) is built using kernel-driven (KD) and diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models, referring to the surface structure and thermal factors, respectively. To demonstrate the reliability of the approach, TIR data from the geostationary satellite Himawari 8 are combined with visible and near-infrared (VNIR) data from the polar orbit satellite Sentinel-3A/3B. In addition to satellite observations, a synthetic dataset from the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model is also generated. Considering an anisotropy model in addition to the DTC model leads to a method displaying a better ability to simulate LSTs with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.48 K against the original satellite results, compared to only the DTC model up to 1.44 K. By utilizing the field measurements as a reference, the reconstructed results are improved with a total bias of 0.72K and an RMSE of 2.58 K. Compared to the original results without correction, approximately 41% and 10% decreases are obtained in bias and RMSE, respectively. Our proposed method can also achieve LST downscaling supported by the higher spatial resolution of VNIR data when the temperature difference is assumed to be homogeneous within the coarse pixels. Thus, a simple achievable solution can be used for temperature reconstruction to enhance the quality of the LST product."

 The choice of ice particle model is critical for microwave remote sensing of ice clouds. Using a model-observation closure method, the global applicability of a series of single crystal and aggregate ice particle models is evaluated based on satellite-based microwave measurements from the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) high-frequency channels. The results indicate that the ice water path (IWP) retrievals from radar observations are highly dependent on the ice particle model, with the maximum difference between models exceeding a factor of 13. Although aggregate models generally perform better than single crystals, none of them can be well adapted to retrievals for all types of ice clouds on the global scale. A columnar single crystal works better for low IWP clouds, while a small block aggregate for high IWP. Consequently, a mixing scheme combining both with weighting by IWP is then proposed for global ice cloud measurements. By using this double-model mixing scheme, the simulations can well reproduce simultaneous active and passive microwave observations, regardless of the IWP. Specifically, the differences between CPR radar reflectivity simulations and observations do not exceed 0.1 dBZ, while the mean biases of brightness temperatures on all high-frequency channels of GMI are <1.5 K. This is expected to improve the retrieval accuracy of global ice clouds."

 Atmospheric aerosols have strong impact on climate, environment, and health. To account correctly for such impact, extended aerosol characterization, including spectral Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), spectral Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) etc., are required to be derived globally from space-borne observations. Together with the aerosol, the Earth's surfaces are an important component of climate system, reflecting and absorbing solar and atmospheric radiation and being sources of emission of different natural aerosol, for example, sea-salt, mineral dust or organic aerosol.Since the beginning of space-borne atmospheric observation it was recognized that the most comprehensive extended aerosol and surface characterization can be achieved from multi-angular polarimetric measurements. In this paper, we show that the extended aerosol characterization can be obtained even from single viewing radiance only satellite measurements when several crucial conditions are fulfilled both for the observations and retrieval algorithm: (i) wide spectral range (for example, covering UV, VIR, NIR and SWIR spectra) providing rich spectral information about aerosol and surface; (ii) wide swath of measurements ensuring frequent overpassing over the same ground pixel to account for the different temporal variability of aerosol and surface properties as well as for angular dependence of surface reflectance; (iii) applied algorithm should be able to treat multi-temporal and multi-spatial observation accounting for spatial and temporal dependencies of aerosol and surface characteristics.The new possibilities of retrieval of aerosol and surface properties are investigated by applying the advanced GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties) algorithm to the space-borne S5P/TROPOMI observations. The most optimal for these purposes forward and inversion approaches are discussed, and the quality of retrieved aerosol and surface properties is evaluated.

 Human-transformed agricultural and aquacultural ponds, collectively referred to as “dike-pond systems”, play a crucial role in ensuring food security but also contribute to the widespread loss of natural wetlands. However, spatially and temporally explicit patterns of dike-pond systems have not been thoroughly documented globally. Here, we map the distribution of dike-pond systems over both global inland and coastal regions during three periods (1984 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, 2011 to 2020) using 30-m resolution satellite observations. Results show that the total area of dike-pond systems was 132,886 km2 globally, with about 2/3 contributed from inland wetlands. From 1984 to 2020, the net gain of inland dike-pond systems (26,385 km2 or 92.7%) was 1.6 times that of coastal wetlands (16,371 km2 or 83.3%), due primarily to reduced coastal dike-pond systems in the last decade. We identified significant contributions of dike-pond systems to fishery production, and further revealed occurrences of dike-pond systems within protected areas. Our study highlights the importance of prioritizing the conservation and management of more intensively inland dike-pond systems, and our global synthesis provides a critical benchmark for assessing potential consequences of dike-pond system and for future restoration efforts."

 Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is the main energy source for the Earth's system and a dominant component of the radiation budget. Although many algorithms have been proposed for estimating DSR, most models only consider either the radiative effects of terrain or atmosphere, and no research has considered the conditions of clouds on the mountainside. In this paper, a high-resolution Mountain Radiative Transfer model with Clouds (MRTC) is proposed to characterize the cloud-terrain coupling effects on DSR under different surface positions relative to the clouds. To operate the MRTC, a look-up table is employed to obtain initial radiative parameters. The comparison with Monte-Carlo based radiative transfer indicates that MRTC can be applied to conditions of clouds on the mountainside. And the reliability of MRTC under conditions when clouds are above mountains is also validated against in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 149.9 W/m2, a bias of 28.3 W/m2, and an R2 of 0.74. By using more accurate cloud cover data extracted from All-Sky images, the accuracy of MRTC has improved, with the RMSE decreasing to 115.8 W/m2, and the R2 increasing to 0.8. This suggests that the uncertainty in satellite cloud products significantly contributes to errors in DSR estimations. MRTC is expected to more accurately represent cloud-terrain coupling effects on DSR, and improve the accuracy of DSR estimation over rugged terrain under cloudy skies."

 River ice plays a crucial role in hydrology, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems in mid-to-high latitude regions. However, there is a notable gap in the analysis of patterns and trends in river ice phenologies and their influence factors at the river level. In this study, we developed a practical method to identify river ice phenologies by leveraging Landsat observations from 2000 to 2021, and established a comprehensive dataset encompassing 7970 river segments across the entire Northern Hemisphere. Our results revealed that the mean freeze-up date, break-up date, and ice duration for these river segments were October 24, May 4, and 192.1 days, respectively. Notably, 56% of the river segments exhibited a warming trend, with the average freeze-up date delayed by 2.7 days per decade, break-up date advanced by 2.5 days per decade, and ice duration shortened by 5.5 days per decade—nearly five times the documented decrease rate over the past 150 years. Furthermore, high-latitude polar regions and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau demonstrated the most pronounced decreases in ice duration, exceeding 7.0 days per decade on average. We observed a substantial relative contribution, reaching up to 70%, of surface air temperature (SAT) in middle and low latitude regions characterized by relatively high winter temperatures. However, as winter temperatures decrease, the relative influence of SAT diminishes, while the contributions of precipitation, solar radiation, and residuals increase. Our dataset provided essential baseline for further understanding the fundamental physical processes within river systems, offering crucial insights for river management, hydrological disaster risk control, climate change research, and ecosystem conservation efforts."

 The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) onboard the Aeolus wind mission was the first High Spectral Resolution Lidar operating in the Ultra Violet (UV) region deployed in space. This study explores and documents the feasibility of deriving ocean optical properties using data from ALADIN. A three steps (i.e. data screening, analytical estimation of the total in-water signal contribution, Look Up Table-based estimation of the in-water attenuation) retrieval algorithm was developped combining data analysis and signal simulations from a radiative transfer model. The algorithm has been implemented using the signal acquired by the Mie channel, and tested for 1-year of Aeolus observations. This approach allowed estimating the first Aeolus derived Ocean Color (OC) products in terms of the total in-water signal contribution and the in-water attenuation term in a spectral region (355 nm) not covered, during Aeolous lifetime, by operational OC products. The validation process involved comparing these products with both Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) field measurements and satellite OC dataset distributed by ESA Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative across a set of 7 selected oceanic regions representing diverse open-ocean scenarios. These validation exercises attested the general accordance between OC reference measurements and the proposed Aeolus OC parameters. Thus, this study was able to provide statistical evidence of the sensitivity of the retrieved Aeolus in-water lidar attenuation term to the CDOM variability on a temporal/seasonal and spatial/regional basis. A preliminary estimation of the uncertainty associated to the retrieved quality controlled Klid, was performed assuming the radiometric noise as unique source of uncertainty. As a result, a median/average value of absolute relative percent difference of about 50/80% was obtained. Limits of the developed technique, possible improvements, potential adaptation to planned/future space lidar missions are discussed."

 Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter affecting global climate, weather disasters, and marine resources. Acquiring SST data that covers large areas and spans over long periods is one of the most essential tasks for various scientific research. During the past decades, meteorological satellites (e.g., the Himawari 8) have been able to provide large-scale, high-resolution continuous observations (via a number of visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands), but have always been affected by active atmospheric activities (i.e., clouds). A detailed literature review on SST analysis or estimation shows that limitations or challenges associated with the existing tools and the state-of-the-art approaches have not been fully resolved yet. Through integrating the knowledge from interdisciplinary domains, hence, we proposed a physically-informed machine learning approach (i.e., a physically-consistent, virtual-gauge approach in the machine learning framework) to elegantly reconstruct daily SSTs under both cloud and cloud-free areas. By this central idea, we developed the TS-RBFNN (i.e., Temporal-Spatial Radial Basis Function Neural Network) and suggested an adequate procedure (with artificial clouds) for model assessment since the data in the cloudy region was unavailable. A systematic study in terms of model implication (i.e., the meaning of network architecture), model validation (i.e., the performance of learning and generalization), and model applications (i.e., in open ocean and coastal seas with different cloud coverage over the four seasons) was conducted. In particular, a pattern similarity analysis (examining SST distributions for several selected sections) and a daily-based error analysis (presenting the variations and distributions of RMSEs for each season) were carried out to clarify the relationship between varying cloud conditions and model performances (inferenced by sunny areas). Overall, the TS-RBFNN would better perform full SST reconstruction with significant improvement up to 60%, compared to the DINEOF (i.e., Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Function). Currently, the TS-RBFNN model is being implemented into the operational system of Taiwan's Central Weather Administration to provide all-weather SST products. In the near future, a long-term societal impact would be expected as the reconstructed SST data could be broadly employed in various scientific applications."

Smith,Improved global estimation of seasonal variations in C3 photosynthetic capacity based on eco-evolutionary optimality hypotheses and remote sensing,"•Photosynthetic nitrogen other than RuBisCO constrains the acclimation ofVcmax25. •This constraint is captured using remotely sensed SIF and leaf chlorophyll content. •The accuracy of the simulatedVcmax25improves after considering this constraint. 
 The maximum carboxylation rate of plant leaves (Vcmax) at 25 °C (Vcmax25) is a fundamental parameter in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) to estimate carbon assimilation of C3 biomes. It has been reported that ignoring the seasonal variations in Vcmax25 induces considerable uncertainties in TBMs. Recently, a model was developed to estimate Vcmax25 of C3 biomes mechanistically from climate data based on eco-evolutionary optimality hypotheses, which hypothesized that plants acclimate to the environment to achieve maximum carbon assimilation with minimum related costs. However, uncertainties of this optimality-based model (EEO model) have been found to correlate to leaf nitrogen content, partly due to the lack of parameterization on how the acclimation of Vcmax25 is constrained by photosynthetic nitrogen other than that in RuBisCO. This constraint could be parametrized by remote sensing methods globally. In this study, we developed remote sensing methods to estimate leaf absorptance of radiation based on MODIS LCC (leaf chlorophyll content) data and the ratio of the maximum electron transport rate of plant leaves (Jmax) to Vcmax at 25 °C (rJV25) based on TROPOMI SIF (solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence) data (RS-rJV25). These two parameters contain photosynthetic nitrogen information related to light harvesting, electron transport, and carboxylation, and they were then incorporated into the EEO model to constrain how Vcmax25 acclimates to the environment. The simulated Vcmax25 constrained by MODIS LCC and RS-rJV25 agreed well with seasonal variations in field-measured Vcmax25 at 18 sites (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 13.40 μmol·m−2·s−1), showing better accuracy than the simulation without incorporating leaf absorptance and rJV25 (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 31.59 μmol·m−2·s−1). Our results indicated that variations in leaf absorptance and rJV25 constrained the acclimation of Vcmax25 to the environment and contributed to the variation in Vcmax25 that cannot be fully captured by environmental factors alone in the EEO model. The remote-sensing-based leaf absorptance and rJV25 captured the sensitivity of these two parameters to environmental conditions on the global scale. The influence of leaf absorptance on Vcmax25 was primarily affected by the irradiance level, while rJV25 was determined by the growing season mean temperature. The simulated Vcmax25 had large spatiotemporal variations on the global scale, and the environment drove the variation pattern more greatly than the biome distribution. With reasonably accurate seasonal variations in Vcmax25, this study can help improve the global carbon cycle and leaf trait modelling."

 Satellite observations from instruments such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) show significant potential for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of NO2, however they typically provide vertically integrated measurements over the tropospheric column. In this study, we introduce a machine learning approach entitled ‘S-MESH’ (Satellite and ML-based Estimation of Surface air quality at High resolution) that allows for estimating daily surface NO2 concentrations over Europe at 1 km spatial resolution based on eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) model using primarily observation-based datasets over the period 2019–2021. Spatiotemporal datasets used by the model include TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column density, night light radiance from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), observations of air quality monitoring stations from the European Environment Agency database and modeled meteorological parameters such as planetary boundary layer height, wind velocity, temperature. The overall model evaluation shows a mean absolute error of 7.77 μg/m3, a median bias of 0.6 μg/m3 and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.66. The model performance is found to be influenced by NO2 concentration levels, with the most reliable predictions at concentration levels of 10–40 μg/m3 with a bias of <40%. The spatial and temporal error analyses indicate the spatial robustness of the model across the study area, with better prediction accuracy during the winter months and the associated higher NO2 concentrations. Despite the complexity and the continental scale of the study area, the XGBoost-based model shows fast execution potential in providing daily estimates of surface NO2 concentrations over Europe. The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis highlights TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric column density as the main source of information in deriving surface NO2 concentrations, indicating its significant potential for such studies. The SHAP values also indicate the importance of anthropogenic emission proxy inputs such as VIIRS night lights, in complementing TROPOMI NO2 values for deriving higher resolution and detailed spatial patterns of NO2 variations."

 Satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) have been extensively used in monitoring vegetation dynamics at local, regional, and global scales. While numerous studies have explored various factors influencing VIs, a remarkable knowledge gap persists concerning their applicability in mountain areas with complex topographic variations. Here we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the topographic effects on ten widely used VIs. We used three evaluation strategies, including: (i) an analytic radiative transfer model; (ii) a 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer model; and (iii) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The two radiative transfer models provided theoretical evaluation results under specific terrain conditions, aiding in the first exploration of the interactions of both shadow and spatial scale effects on VIs. The MODIS-based evaluation quantified the discrepancies in VIs between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over flat and rugged terrains, providing new insights into real satellite data across different temporal scales (i.e., from daily to multiple years). Our evaluation results were consistent across these three strategies, revealing three key findings. (i) The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generally outperformed the other VIs, yet all VIs did not perform well in shadow areas (e.g., with a mean relative error (MRE) of 14.7% for NDVI in non-shadow areas and 26.1% in shadow areas). (ii) The topographic impacts exist at multiple spatiotemporal scales. For example, the MREs of NDVI reached 28.5% and 11.1% at 30 m and 3 km resolutions, respectively. The quarterly and annual VIs deviations between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua also increased with slope. (iii) We found the topography-induced interannual variations in multiple VIs both in simulated data and MODIS data. VIs trend deviations between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020 increased as the slope steepened (i.e., NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) trend deviations generally doubled). Overall, the sun-target-sensor geometry changes induced by topography, causing shadows in mountains along with obstructions in sensor observations, compromised the reliability of VIs in these terrains. Our study underscores the considerable impacts of topography, particularly shadow effects, on multiple VIs at various spatiotemporal scales, highlighting the imperative of cautious application of VIs-based trend calculation in mountains."

 In this era of global warming, the regular and accurate mapping of vegetation conditions is essential for monitoring ecosystems, climate sustainability and biodiversity. In this context, this work proposes a physics-guided data-driven methodology to invert radiative transfer models (RTM) for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables. A hybrid paradigm is proposed by incorporating the physical model to be inverted into the design of a neural network architecture, which is trained by exploiting unlabeled satellite images. In this study, we show how the proposed strategy allows the simultaneous probabilistic inversion of all input PROSAIL model parameters by exploiting Sentinel-2 images. The interest of the proposed self-supervised learning strategy is corroborated by showing the limitations of existing simulation-trained machine learning algorithms. Results are assessed on leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) in-situ measurements collected on four different field campaigns over three European tests sites. Prediction accuracies are compared with performances reached by the well-established Biophysical Processor (BP) of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). Obtained overall accuracies corroborate that the proposed methodology achieves performances equivalent to or better than the state-of-the-art methods."

 Downward Surface Shortwave Radiation (DSSR) plays a crucial role in ecological, hydrological, and solar photovoltaic studies. The estimation of DSSR at higher spatial resolutions is increasingly popular. However, the impact of increasing spatial resolution on spatial information content and accuracy of DSSR estimates is not well understood. Addressing this knowledge gap, an all-sky DSSR dataset at varying spatial resolutions (0.8° to 0.01°) in China was estimated using MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance data. Subsequently, the spatial heterogeneity and accuracy of the DSSR dataset as well as its driving factors were analyzed. The results indicate that the magnitude of the increase in spatial heterogeneity varies across different regions as the spatial resolution increases. On the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the spatial heterogeneity experiences the most significant increase. To quantify the factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of DSSR, the Correlation Coefficients (CC) were calculated between the Coefficient Of Variation (COV) of DSSR and the COVs of relevant factors. In cloudy-sky conditions, the CC between the COV of DSSR and cloud optical thickness ranged from 0.54 to 0.62, whereas the CC between DSSR COV and Column Water Vapor (CWV) COV was between 0.72 and 0.78. Under clear-sky conditions, the COV of CWV, aerosol optical depth, and PM2.5 showed more significant correlations with DSSR COV compared to altitude COV. Validation using ground-based measurements revealed that the accuracy of DSSR decreased at coarser spatial resolutions due to the presence of mixed pixel samples. Moreover, it was demonstrated that a spatial resolution of 0.05° offered the highest cost-effectiveness when estimating DSSR. These insights significantly advance our understanding of the role of spatial resolutions in DSSR estimation and are instrumental in guiding the selection of optimal resolutions for such studies."

 Global warming has shown an “Arctic amplification effect” in recent decades, leading to pronounced changes in pan-Arctic soil surface temperature (SST). SST plays a direct role in energy exchange between soil and atmosphere and serves as an indicator of the land–atmosphere energy balance. Remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) data is able to indicate near-surface temperature, but influences from environment factors, such as vegetation and snow, can introduce biases between LST and SST. In this study, the importances of five environment factors (vegetation, snow, surface soil composition, topography, and solar radiation) to monthly mean SST estimation from MODIS LST in pan-Arctic were analyzed. Then a method for pan-Arctic monthly mean SST estimation from MODIS LST by incorporating these environment factors and monthly-based modeling based on random forest (RF) algorithm was proposed. The results reveal that all the selected environment factors contribute to monthly-based modeling, with vegetation exerting the greatest importance from May to October and snow in March and April. The root mean square error (RMSE) of pan-Arctic monthly SST estimated by the proposed method from 2003 to 2022 ranges from 0.89 to 1.88 °C, which is a 42.95–––53.35 % reduction compared to the widely used season-based multivariate linear regression (MLR) models based solely on LST (RMSE between 1.56 and 4.03 °C). The accuracy is notably improved in areas with lower and no vegetation (grassy woodlands, grasslands, permanent wetlands, and barrens) in the cold season (September to the following April), and in higher vegetation (forests) areas in the warm season (May to August). The proposed method can contribute to producing high-precision monthly mean SST data from LST, estimating permafrost extent and active layer thickness, and understanding the land–atmosphere energy balance in pan-Arctic."

 Multispectral remote sensing image-based sea fog detection (SFD) is both important and challenging. Deep learning methods for SFD have become mainstream due to their powerful nonlinear learning capabilities and flexibility. However, existing methods have not fully utilized the physical difference priors in multispectral images (MSI) for SFD, making it difficult to skillfully capture the shape and appearance characteristics of sea fog, thus leading to uncertainties in SFD. We propose the spatial–spectral difference network (S2DNet), a deep encoding–decoding framework that merges inter-spectral and intra-spectral heterogeneous difference features. Specifically, inspired by physics-based difference threshold methods, we developed a physics-inspired inter-spectral difference module (PIDM) that combines feature-level difference with deep neural networks to capture the shape characteristics of sea fog. We designed the intra-spectral difference module (ISDM) using difference convolution to represent sea fog’s fine-grained and dynamic appearance information. Furthermore, inspired by multi-view learning, we propose heterogeneous feature mutual learning (HFML) that seeks robust representations by focusing on semantically invariant aspects within heterogeneous difference features, adapting to the dynamic nature of sea fog. HFML is achieved through global feature mutual learning using an adversarial procedure and local feature mutual learning supported by a novel information-theoretic objective function that links maximizing statistical correlation with expectation maximization. Experiments on two SFD datasets show that integrating physical difference priors into deep learning improves SFD. In both continuous temporal and high spatial resolution SFD tasks, S2DNet outperforms existing advanced deep learning methods. Moreover, S2DNet demonstrates stronger robustness under degraded remote sensing image conditions, highlighting its potential usefulness and practicality in real-world applications."

 Snow depth (SD) is essential for studying climate change and hydrological cycle on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Despite the effectiveness of passive microwave remote sensing for large-scale SD measurement, its low spatial resolution and scanning gaps limit its application, particularly in the TP region where the terrain is complex and snow distribution exhibits obvious heterogeneity. This study developed Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SD downscaling models for the TP using ensemble learning methods and AMSR2 brightness temperature data from October 1, 2012, to April 30, 2021. We employed five ensemble methods—AdaBoost, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest—with LightGBM achieving the highest accuracy (RMSE=2.66 cm). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was applied to the LightGBM model, optimizing factor selection and maintaining high accuracy. The models excelled in estimating shallow snow areas (SD<5 cm) with an RMSE of 1.60 cm. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to quantify global and local contributions of each factor in the modeling process. Key factors included snow cover days, meteorological influences, and brightness temperature (BT) at 89 GHz with horizontal polarization, although their contributions varied significantly across the TP due to environmental gradients. The resulting 500 m SD estimates offer detailed and accurate snow distribution information in complex mountainous regions. Our results help to improve water resource management and climate change analysis on the TP."

 Thin cloud interference presents a significant challenge for the semantic segmentation of optical satellite imagery, which directly degrades the model accuracy and causes difficulties in sample selection. This paper generated a dataset named Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis discrimination (PTD), containing both cloudless and thin cloud scenarios. Based on this PTD dataset, an enhanced Atmospheric Scattering Model with Nonlinear Optimization (ASM_NL) was proposed to simulate high-fidelity thin clouds by incorporating two vital nonlinear terms: the point spread function and the Perlin noise. Additionally, we adopt a strategy of mixing simulated thin cloud-covered images (STCI) into the training set at a certain proportion to improve the semantic segmentation accuracy in thin cloud-covered scenarios. The conclusions are as follows: 1) ASM_NL can simulate high-fidelity clouds at an average Jensen-Shannon distance of 0.0699. 2) When dealing with medium- and high-cloud density datasets, mixing STCI proved to be more effective than cloud removal in mitigating thin cloud interference, resulting in average macro F1 score improvements of 0.164 and 0.094, respectively. 3) The semantic segmentation accuracy improved significantly by mixing STCI with a minimal proportion of 1/60, demonstrating the activation of model transfer capabilities.

 Aerosols are crucial constituents of the atmosphere, with significant impacts on air quality. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is critical in assessing solar resources and modeling sky radiance. However, comprehensive aerosol studies at a continental scale are limited, and existing methodologies need to consider spatial characteristics. This study develops a spatio-temporal unmixing with heterogeneity (STUH) model to evaluate spatial patterns and temporal trends of atmospheric aerosols across the African continent. The spatio-temporal AOD data cube, comprising monthly averaged MODIS-derived AOD data from 2001 to 2015, was decomposed using spatially non-negative matrix variabilization to explore the spatial determinants and the impacts of their interactions to AOD using a geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model. Our findings reveal an increasing trend of aerosol levels across Africa in the past 15 years, combined with the spatio-temporal AOD pattern explained by five abundance variables. We find that in different regions across Africa, the impact of natural variables on AOD was 1.56 to 3.01 times the impact of human variables, with significant spatial variations. These results are essential for understanding the climatic implications of atmospheric aerosols in Africa."

 It is crucial to clarify the nonlinear effects of urban multidimensional characteristics on land surface temperature (LST). However, the combined consideration of the urban green space (UGS), water bodies, buildings, and socio-economic factors is limited. And the diurnal differences in their thermal effects have been less considered. In this study, central Beijing was taken as study area. Local climate zones (LCZ) were firstly applied to reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LST. Then, the interpretable machine learning methods were utilized to quantitatively reveal nonlinear thermal effects of urban multidimensional characteristics, i.e., the UGS, water bodies, and building landscape features, and socio-economic features. The results indicated that built type LCZs have a higher average LST compared to natural type LCZs. And the LST of built type LCZs is simultaneously influenced by buildings’ density and height characteristics. Daytime LST is mainly affected by the landscape proportions of UGS, buildings, and trees, while nighttime LST is more influenced by socio-economic and building characteristics. The thermal effects of key factors exhibit nonlinear characteristics. Whether during the day or night, the impact of building coverage on LST is greater than that of building height, consistently exhibiting a warming effect. While, the building height and water body edge density factors both exhibited a reversal trend in their thermal impact between day and night. Our study also emphasized the importance of trees type in UGS and provided recommendations for UGS planning based on sensitivity and contribution considerations.

 Although high-resolution satellite and in situ airborne observations are becoming a common data source for fire monitoring, reconstruction of the historical fire record is based on less suitable data. In many regions, managers and policy-makers rely solely on coarse resolution global fire datasets. This study assessed the suitability of readily available products to accurately depict several fire metrics by comparing them to the manually derived fire scars within three natural reserves in South Africa (2003–2020). Contrary to previous findings, we showed that MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 products detected the majority of the burned area (70–97 %) within protected areas and showed high temporal consistency. Additionally, active and burned area products accurately detected the length and the peak of the fire season. Nonetheless, we found neither medium nor coarse resolution data suitable for evaluating long-term changes in fire size distribution. Coarse resolution burned area products demonstrated a very limited capacity to detect fires smaller than 100 ha, while a lack of sufficient non-cloudy Landsat images led to substantial gaps in fire reconstruction, bringing an unknown level of uncertainties in fire metrics estimates. Similarly, the only available medium-resolution burned area product (GABAM) was unsuitable for fire monitoring since unmapped areas were classified as unburned, making no distinction between regions with an absence of data and an absence of fires. Meanwhile, the performance of FireCCILT11 was ranked the lowest among all the available fire products. Given the lack of resources in many protected areas in South Africa and the pressing need to evaluate current and historical fire management practices and policies, we conclude that, in the absence of a more accurate higher-resolution alternative, MCD64A1 was the most suitable product for capturing year-to-year fluctuations in fire activity and a combination of MODIS and VIIRS active fire products for monitoring changes in fire seasonality."

 The Himawari-8 satellite has the capability to rapidly retrieve sea surface temperature (SST) data at a high frequency of 10 min, demonstrating significant potential for various scientific applications. However, the presence of cloud often results in missing SST data at cloud locations, or can reduce the accuracy of retrieved SST. In contrast to the method of reconstructing missing SST data, this study focuses on exploring the potential of inverting SST under all-sky conditions. This study proposes a three-layer stacked machine learning model (TLSM), specifically designed for SST under all-sky conditions. The model integrates cloud properties into its input features to effectively account for the influence of cloud cover. Validation using 30 % match-up pairs generated an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.71 °C, a Bias of −0.01 °C, and an R2 of 0.91 based on 6383 samples. For clear-sky conditions, TLSM demonstrates a noteworthy enhancement in SST inversion accuracy (R2 = 0.98, RMSE=0.35 °C) compared to the official SST product (R2 = 0.86, RMSE=0.88 °C). In cases of optically thin clouds and clouds with low cloud top pressure, TLSM exhibits commendable proficiency in the inversion of SST. The Bias and RMSE for these cloud types indicate better performance compared to the official clear-sky SST data. While including cloud samples may reduce the overall accuracy of the TLSM, it substantially enhances the spatial coverage of the inverted SST. Considering the performance for each cloud type, TLSM may serve as an alternative approach for SST retrieve under thin clouds."

 There is an urgent need for accurate and effective Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWS). Most LEWS are currently based on temporally-aggregated measures of rainfall derived from either in-situ measurements or satellite-based rainfall estimates. Relying on a summary metric of precipitation may not capture the complexity of the rainfall signal and its dynamics in space and time in triggering landslides. Here, we present a proof-of-concept for constructing a LEWS based on an integrated spatio-temporal modelling framework. Our proposed methodology builds upon a recent approach that uses a daily rainfall time series instead of the traditional scalar aggregation. Specifically, we partition the study area into slope units and use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to process satellite-derived rainfall time series and combine the output features with a second neural network (NN) tasked with capturing the effect of terrain characteristics. To assess if our approach enhances accuracy, we applied it in Vietnam and benchmarked it against a modelling counterpart where we replaced the rainfall time series with the corresponding scalar representative of the cumulated precipitation. The corresponding duration was set at 14 days as it proved to produce the best performance. Our results show that our protocol leads to better performance in hindcasting landslides when making use of the rainfall as a continuous signal over time. While not tested here, our approach can be extended to rainfall obtained from weather forecasts, potentially leading to actual landslide forecasts."

 Since the arid regions of Central Asia (ACA) are located in the interior of Eurasia, water resources play a vital role in the stability of its ecosystem and economic development. Based on the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we analyze the observed characteristics of the TWSA over the ACA during 2003–2014. Results indicate that the terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the region showed an overall declining trend from 2003 to 2014, and the autumn TWS in this region is the smallest compared to other seasons and exhibits a strong decreasing trend at least −4.5 cm/decade. This means water resources over the ACA are scarcer and more vulnerable in autumn. The Distance between Indices of Simulation and Observation (DISO) method is employed to evaluate the performance of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) models in simulating the autumn TWSA over the ACA. Compared with observational results, the autumn TWSA values captured by CMIP6 models are larger and the declining TWS trends are weaker. Using the optimal CMIP6 models, the statistical downscaling method constrains the projection results of autumn TWSA values over the ACA using the GRACE datasets. It shows autumn TWS will continue to decrease in most parts of the ACA in the future, and water scarcity will be the most severe in Tajikistan and southwestern Kazakhstan. Under SSP126, Tajikistan’s TWSA is projected to decrease by 11.0 cm in the long term. This study reveals the current situation and possible future changes in TWS over the ACA in autumn, providing references for water resource management and sustainable development policies in this area to avoid losses caused by water scarcity."

 Water quantity and quality in lakes are closely linked to the compounding effects of climate change and human activities in their catchments, especially for lakes located in semi-arid and arid regions where water resources are scarce. Whilst knowledge gaps exist for these effects in semi-arid and arid region lakes due mainly to the lack of long-term in situ monitoring data. By using satellite remote sensing data, this study firstly investigated the variations of water level, chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and turbidity in Lake Qadisiyah, Iraq between 2000 and 2019. Results showed that the average water level was 138.3 m in 2000–2019, it decreased clearly in 2001, 2009, 2015 and 2018 with the lowest value of 120 m in July 2015. The mean Chl-a was 6.3 mg/m3 and it showed an overall increasing trend during 2000 and 2019. Turbidity showed extremely high values (>10 NTU) in 2009 and 2017–2018 compared to the mean value of 3.6 NTU in 2000–2019. The boosted regression tree (BRT) was then used to explore the relationship between those variations and El Niño-Southern Oscillation, droughts, meteorological factors and land use land cover changes in the catchment. Results revealed that water level declines were mainly associated with droughts led by La Niña events. Chl-a increase in the lake were mainly explained by built-up area increase and water area decrease in the catchment, with a relative contribution of 29.2 % and 28.6 % respectively. Water area changes in the catchment were the main factor influencing turbidity explaining 55.3 % of the variation. An exception water level decline in 2014–2016 was also observed when there was no drought, which was most likely caused by the cut off of water flow upstream and the release of water from the dam during periods of war. The findings in this study underscored the impacts of climate and human activities on water quantity and quality in semi-arid region lakes. Actions such as improving water use efficiency, establishing water storages, and enhancing cross-border cooperation are therefore recommended to deal with extreme events. Pollution control measures in the catchment are also suggested to prevent water quality deterioration in the lake."

 Shrub encroaching on grasslands threatens grassland ecosystems and negatively affects human land use and livelihood. However, existing research on this subject is limited, having focused on small areas, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of the diverse patterns of large-scale shrub invasions into grasslands. In recent decades, a significant encroachment of shrubs into Xilin Gol grassland has been observed in China, resulting in considerable damage to the grasslands. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the rapid expansion of shrub-encroached grassland (SEG) from 1990 to 2020 in the Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, using long-term Landsat images. The spatial distribution characteristics of the new SEG areas were analyzed. The main factors driving the shrub encroachment in the study area were identified using a geographic detector. Our results revealed a continuous expansion of SEG in the study area over the past three decades, marked by an increase of 48.76 × 103 km2 and an average annual gain rate of 9.41 %. The increased SEG was primarily owing to grassland transition. The sprawl of the SEG was the most prominent in the western and northern regions of the study area, extending to gentle slopes of approximately 5° and low-middle elevations between 600–1300 m above mean sea level. Shrub encroachment was primarily influenced by surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity, with elevation, slope, and precipitation exerting relatively weaker influences. Rather than being driven by a singular factor, the expansion was a result of the combined influence of various factors. This study provides a valuable case study for understanding shrub invasion dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions globally."

 Due to the rapidly changing climate conditions, precipitation nowcasting poses a daunting challenge because it is impossible to make accurate short-term forecasts due to the rapid fluctuations in weather conditions.

With the help of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, including deep neural networks, transformers and generative models, complex precipitation nowcasting tasks can be performed in an efficient way. To address this critical task and enhance proactive emergency disaster management, we propose an innovative method based on transformer-based generative models for precipitation nowcasting.

To develop a precipitation nowcasting model, radar composite data from 10 weather radars across South Korea is used. By utilizing radar reflective data in order to train our model, we are able to effectively predict future precipitation patterns, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic weather conditions caused by heavy rainfalls. This dataset covers reflectivity data from 2018 to 2022, with a spatial resolution of 1km over a 960 × 1200 grid. Normalization using the min–max scaler method is applied to this reflectivity data, which is then transformed into grayscale images for uniform comparison. We enhance performance effectively by employing transfer learning with pre-trained Transformer models. Initially, we train the model using a comprehensive dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tune it for precipitation nowcasting using radar reflective data. This adaptation improves the accuracy of rainfall forecasting by capturing crucial features. Leveraging prior task knowledge through transfer learning not only enhances prediction accuracy but also increases overall efficiency. In terms of predictive accuracy, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based nowcasting model outperforms related approaches, including conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), U-Net, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), pySTEP. As a result of this research, disaster preparedness and response will be greatly improved through improved weather prediction."

On 27 June 2023 a major upgrade, Cy48R1, became operational. Comparisons with in situ, surface remote sensing, aircraft, and balloon and satellite observations show that the new CAMS system is a significant improvement. The results quantify the skill of CAMS to forecast impactful events, such as wildfires, dust storms and air pollution peaks. 
 The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)  provides daily analyses and forecasts of the composition of the atmosphere, including the reactive gases such as O3, CO, NO2, HCHO and SO2; aerosol species; and greenhouse gases. The global CAMS analysis system (IFS-COMPO) is based on the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) for numerical weather prediction (NWP) and assimilates a large number of composition satellite products on top of the meteorological observations ingested in IFS. The CAMS system receives regular upgrades, following the upgrades of IFS. The last upgrade, Cy48R1, operational since 27 June 2023, was major with a large number of code changes, both for IFS-COMPO and for NWP. The main IFS-COMPO innovations include the introduction of full stratospheric chemistry; a major update of the emissions; a major update of the aerosol model, including the representation of secondary organic aerosol; several updates of the dust life cycle and optics; updates to the inorganic chemistry in the troposphere; and the assimilation of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) CO. The CAMS Cy48R1 upgrade was validated using a large number of independent measurement datasets, including surface in situ, surface remote sensing, routine aircraft, and balloon and satellite observations. In this paper we present the validation results for Cy48R1 by comparing them with the skill of the previous operational system (Cy47R3), with the independent observations as reference, for the period October 2022 to June 2023, during which daily forecasts from both cycles are available. Major improvements in skill are found for the ozone profile in the lower–middle stratosphere and for stratospheric NO2 due to the inclusion of full stratospheric chemistry. Stratospheric trace gases compare well with the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observations between 10 and 200 hPa, with larger deviations between 1 and 10 hPa. The impact of the updated emissions is especially visible over East Asia and is beneficial for the trace gases O3, NO2 and SO2. The CO column assimilation is now anchored by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instead of the Measurements Of Pollution in The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument, which is beneficial for most of the CO comparisons, and the assimilation of TROPOMI CO data improves the model CO field in the troposphere. In general the aerosol optical depth has improved globally, but the dust evaluation shows more mixed results. The results of the 47 comparisons are summarised in a scorecard, which shows that 83 % of the evaluation datasets show a neutral or improved performance of Cy48R1 compared to the previous operational CAMS system, while 17 % indicate a (slight) degradation.  This demonstrates the overall success of this upgrade."

Simpson;Kirk Ullmann;Armin Wisthaler,Using observed urban NOx sinks to constrain VOC reactivity and the ozone and radical budget  in the Seoul Metropolitan Area,"Ozone (O3) is a pollutant formed from the reactions of gases emitted from various sources. In urban areas, the density of human activities can increase the O3 formation rate (P(O3)), thus impacting air quality and health.  Observations collected over Seoul, South Korea, are used to constrain P(O3). A high local P(O3) was found;  however, local P(O3) was partly reduced due to compounds typically ignored. These observations also provide constraints for unmeasured compounds that will impact P(O3). 
 Ozone (O3) is an important secondary pollutant that impacts air quality and human health. Eastern Asia has high regional O3 background due to the numerous sources and increasing and rapid industrial growth, which also impacts the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). However, the SMA has also been experiencing increasing O3 driven by decreasing NOx emissions, highlighting the role of the local in situ O3 production on the SMA. Here, comprehensive gas-phase measurements collected on the NASA DC-8 during the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER)/NASA Korea–United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) study are used to constrain the instantaneous O3 production rate over the SMA. The observed NOx oxidized products support the importance of non-measured peroxy nitrates (PNs) in the O3 chemistry in the SMA, as they accounted for ∼49 % of the total PNs. Using the total measured PNs (ΣPNs) and alkyl and multifunctional nitrates (ΣANs), unmeasured volatile organic compound (VOC) reactivity (R(VOC)) is constrained and found to range from 1.4–2.1 s−1. Combining the observationally constrained R(VOC) with the other measurements on the DC-8, the instantaneous net O3 production rate, which is as high as ∼10 ppbv h−1, along with the important sinks of O3 and radical chemistry, is constrained. This analysis shows that ΣPNs play an important role in both the sinks of O3 and radical chemistry. Since ΣPNs are assumed to be in a steady state, the results here highlight the role that ΣPNs play in urban environments in altering the net O3 production, but ΣPNs can potentially lead to increased net O3 production downwind due to their short lifetime (∼1 h). The results provide guidance for future measurements to identify the missing R(VOCs) and ΣPN production."

The instrumentation enabled us to see elevated nucleation mode particle and SO2 concentrations at the surface when air masses transported from polluted areas are mixed in the boundary layer. 
 The optical, physical, and chemical properties of aerosol particles have been previously studied in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but there is still a gap in the knowledge of particle sources and in the horizontal and vertical transport of aerosol particles and their precursors in the area. To investigate how aerosol particle and SO2 concentrations at the surface responded to changes in horizontal and vertical transport, we used data from a 1-year measurement campaign at a background site where local sources of SO2 were expected to be minimal. The measurement campaign provided a combination of in situ measurements at the surface and the boundary layer evolution from vertical and horizontal wind profiles measured by a Doppler lidar. The diurnal structure of the boundary layer in the UAE was very similar from day to day, with a deep, well-mixed boundary layer during the day transitioning to a shallow nocturnal layer, with the maximum boundary layer height usually being reached around 14:00 local time. Both SO2 and nucleation-mode aerosol particle concentrations were elevated for surface winds coming from the east or western sectors. We attribute this to oil refineries located on the eastern and western coasts of the UAE. The concentrations of larger cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-sized particles and their activation fraction did not show any clear dependence on wind direction, but the CCN number concentration showed some dependence on wind speed, with higher concentrations coinciding with the weakest surface winds. Peaks in SO2 concentrations were also observed despite low surface wind speeds and wind directions unfavourable for transport. However, winds aloft were much stronger, with wind speeds of 10 m s−1 at 1 km common at night and wind directions favourable for transport; surface-measured concentrations increased rapidly once these particular layers started to be entrained into the growing boundary layer, even if the surface wind direction was from a clean sector. These conditions also displayed higher nucleation-mode aerosol particle concentrations, i.e. new particle formation events occurring due to the increase in the gaseous precursor."

Pendergrass;Michael P. Byrne;Oliver Watt-Meyer;Penelope Maher;Mark J. Webb,Impact of ITCZ width on global climate: ITCZ-MIP,"The width of the tropical rain belt affects many aspects of our climate, yet we do not understand what controls it. To better understand it, we present a method to change it in numerical model experiments. We show that the method works well in four different models. The behavior of the width is unexpectedly simple in some ways, such as how strong the winds are as it changes, but in other ways, it is more complicated, especially how temperature increases with carbon dioxide. 
 The width of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) affects tropical rainfall, Earth's albedo, large-scale circulation, and climate sensitivity. To better understand the ITCZ width and its effects on global climate, we present a protocol to force changes in ITCZ width in climate models. Starting from an aquaplanet configuration with a slab ocean, adding surface heat fluxes in the deep tropics forces the ITCZ to narrow, and subtracting them causes it to widen. The protocol successfully generates changes in ITCZ width in all four climate models used in this study. ITCZ width in each model responds linearly to forcing magnitude and sign. Comparing across the four climate models, a response to varying ITCZ width that is remarkably consistent among models is the ITCZ strength, which is greater the narrower the ITCZ. On the other hand, the effect of varying ITCZ width on climate sensitivity is divergent among our four models, varying even in sign. Results from this pilot study highlight the connections between surface fluxes, ITCZ width, and the wider climate. A comprehensive model intercomparison project (MIP) has the potential to advance understanding of both the physical processes shaping ITCZ width and its influence on remote atmospheric circulations and global climate."

Ho,Global ocean carbon uptake enhanced by rainfall,"About 6% of the total uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean is due to rainfall, according to an analysis of satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2008 to 2018. 
 Rain alters local sea surface physical and biogeochemical properties but its spatiotemporal variability has led to its overlook in global ocean carbon uptake studies. Different physical and chemical processes in the gaseous and liquid phases control the transfer of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and ocean. Rain impacts the interfacial flux by (1) increasing turbulence in the ocean and (2) modulating the air–sea CO2 concentration gradient. Concurrently, raindrops inject CO2 absorbed during their fall into the ocean through wet deposition. Here this study presents a comprehensive estimate of these effects on the global ocean carbon uptake over 2008–2018 based on observational products (satellite and in situ) and reanalysis. Using various representations of the ocean surface response to rainfall and different rain products, we show that rain increases the ocean carbon sink by +0.14–0.19 PgC yr−1 over 2008–2018, representing an increase of 5–7% of the ocean carbon uptake (2.66 PgC yr−1). Rain-induced interfacial flux and wet deposition have comparable orders of magnitude. The former mainly increases the CO2 sink in the tropics because strong rain rates and weak winds induce noticeable salinity and CO2 dilution. The latter is important in the tropics, storm track regions and the Southern Ocean. About 6% of the total uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean is due to rainfall, according to an analysis of satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2008 to 2018."

 The Pacific Walker circulation—the tropical Pacific zonal overturning circulation of the atmosphere—and the associated sea surface temperature distribution in the tropical Pacific significantly impact global climate. However, climate model historical simulations cannot capture the observed Walker circulation enhancement since around 1980. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed change, quantitative discussion and clues for reconciling the model-observation discrepancy have not yet been settled. Here we show that the Walker circulation strengthening between 1980 and 2020 can be quantitatively explained by the remote influence of subtropical and extratropical sea surface temperature changes. This conclusion is obtained from climate model pacemaker experiments in which sea surface temperature anomalies outside the tropics are restored towards observations. Influence from the southeastern Pacific, which cools the eastern tropical Pacific, is especially crucial for the Walker circulation strengthening. This equatorward influence occurs mostly through the atmosphere and its thermal coupling with the ocean. We further show that current generation climate models have biases in southeastern Pacific surface temperature changes, which may cause the failure in reproducing the Walker circulation trend. Our results suggest that improved representation of air–sea coupling in this region could enable better projections of future climate. Subtropical and extratropical sea surface temperature changes can explain recent observed Walker circulation strengthening, according to climate model experiments."

 Understanding the causes for discrepancies between modelled and observed regional climate trends is important for improving present-day climate simulation and reducing uncertainties in future climate projections. Here, we analyse the performance of coupled climate models in reproducing regional precipitation trends during the satellite era. We find statistically significant observed drying in southwestern North America and wetting in the Amazon during the period 1979–2014. Historical climate model simulations do not capture these observed precipitation trends. We trace this discrepancy to the inability of coupled simulations to capture the observed Pacific trade wind intensification over this period. A linear adjustment of free running historical simulations, based on the observed strengthening of the Pacific trade winds and modeled ENSO teleconnections, explains the discrepancy in precipitation trends. Furthermore, both the Pacific trade wind trends and regional precipitation trends are reproduced in climate simulations with prescribed observed sea surface temperatures (SST), underscoring the role of the tropical Pacific SST patterns."

 Spring Central Asian precipitation (SCAP) holds significant implications for local agriculture and ecosystems, with its variability mainly modulated by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The ENSO–SCAP relationship has experienced pronounced interdecadal shifts, though mechanisms remain elusive. Based on observations and climate model simulations, these shifts may result from transitions in ENSO-induced meridional circulation and Rossby wave trains triggered by North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. During high (low) correlation periods, ENSO induces strong (weak) vertical motion anomalies over Central Asia, while NA SST anomalies exert a weak (strong) counteracting effect, modulated by the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). In the positive (negative) phase of PDO, a slow (fast) decaying ENSO triggers a strong (weak) NA horseshoe-like SST anomaly in the post-ENSO spring, affecting the ENSO–SCAP relationship. Our study identifies a strengthening trend in the ENSO–SCAP relationship since the 2000s, indicating improved predictability for SCAP in recent decades."

 Mesoscale dipoles compose two counter-rotating mesoscale eddies. They are observed in oceans worldwide and significantly impact the biogeochemical cycle, marine ecosystems, and ocean water transport. This study investigates the evolution of asymmetric dipole eddies based on the satellite altimeter data for the period January 1993–December 2020. The coupling and decoupling of eddy dipoles impact various eddy properties. When the movement of eddies has a dipolar structure, a gentle convergence in parameters (rotational speed, amplitude, eddy kinetic energy, propagation speed, and advective nonlinearity) between the asymmetric dipole eddies is observed–this study refers to it as the “gear-like” process. Kinematic characteristics further indicate that the stronger dipole eddies generally drive the weaker ones to revolve during the “gear-like” process. The revolution direction remains consistent with the rotation direction of stronger dipole eddies. Additionally, eddy size remains relatively stable during the “gear-like” process. The composites of sea level anomaly (SLA) demonstrate that dipole eddies are compressed into a kidney-like shape along the line through their centers. This shape is confirmed by the composites of sea surface temperature anomalies, which closely correspond to the structure of SLA. These findings augment the knowledge regarding the evolution of asymmetric dipole eddies and provide a novel perspective for studying dipoles and eddy-eddy interactions."

 Plant adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf sides have different reflectances and transmittances, and this r-t dorsiventrality has been explored and modeled in several studies. The emitted chlorophyll fluorescence is also not identical when different leaf sides are illuminated; although this f dorsiventrality has already been discovered, its effects on canopy-level fluorescence have not been explored, and there is a lack of models for explaining this phenomenon. This study develops two radiative transfer models, LFD (Leaf chlorophyll Fluorescence with Dorsiventrality) and CFD (Canopy chlorophyll Fluorescence with leaf Dorsiventrality), to model leaf dorsiventrality (including r-t and f dorsiventrality) at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively, and to explore its influence on canopy fluorescence. Evaluation of LFD against the measured spectra revealed that the proposed model accurately simulated leaf fluorescence with an RMSE of 0.056 W/m2/µm/sr, an NRMSE of 3.3%, and an R2 of 0.963. Evaluation of CFD under various conditions via comparison with the ray-tracing discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model revealed that CFD is consistent with DART, with an RMSE of 0.031 W/m2/µm/sr, an NRMSE of 1.0%, and an R2 of 0.998. The influences of leaf dorsiventrality are then analyzed based on the developed models and measured spectra. The results show that neglecting both r-t and f dorsiventrality induces a maximum relative error above 30% and a maximum NRMSE of 15.7%. In contrast, neglecting only the f dorsiventrality induces a maximum relative error of more than 30% and a maximum NRMSE of 9.3%. It is concluded that leaf dorsiventrality is an important influencing factor in canopy chlorophyll fluorescence, and the proposed models can accurately and efficiently simulate this dorsiventrality."

 The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is one of the most widely used socioeconomic indicators, serving as an integral component for climate change impact analysis. However, a national scale assessment may induce considerable bias because it conceals any internal variations within a country. The lack of a long-term sub-national scale GDP data is a substantive hinderance. Leveraging the close relationship between nighttime lights and GDP, we address this gap by developing a novel methodological framework in two steps. First, under the modeling philosophy of spatial statistics, we developed a novel approach based on deep and machine learning techniques to establish a complex mapping between two inconsistent nighttime lights (NTL) datasets: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP) and the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The models achieve accuracies ranging from 0.945 to 0.980 (correlation coefficients). By taking the estimations ensemble of the two techniques, the time series of DMSP data was extended to 2021. Next, a novel modeling strategy based on multi-layer perceptron was developed to derive the non-linear relationship between NTL and GDP per capita at sub-national scale to alleviate scale effects at this granularity, while explicitly capturing regional heterogeneity effect. The trained models achieve average accuracies of 0.967, 0.959, and 0.959 on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. We evaluate the developed dataset at the global, national, and sub-national scales from various perspective, and the results offer solid evidence on the reliability of the estimated economic data. By linking to historical global climate change data, we quantify global economic losses attributed to extreme heat to demonstrate how the estimated GDP data can be useful in the climate change impact analysis."

Although the drying influence of global warming is well established, the role of existing drylands in their own expansion is relatively unknown. In this work, by tracking the air flowing over drylands, we show that the warming and drying of that air contributes to dryland expansion in the downwind direction. As they dry, drylands contribute less moisture and more heat to downwind humid regions, reducing precipitation and increasing atmospheric water demand, which ultimately causes their aridification. In ~40% of the land area that recently transitioned from a humid region into a dryland, self-expansion accounted for >50% of the observed aridification. Our results corroborate the urgent need for climate change mitigation measures in drylands to decelerate their own expansion."

This study uses pacemaker experiments with a state-of-the-art model to quantify the relative contributions of the three tropical oceans to the interannual WNPAC variability. We find that the Pacific accounts for over 50% of the interannual variance in boreal winter and the following spring, while the roles of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans become more pronounced in the spring. In the summer, all three oceans contribute significantly and equally. The Indian Ocean sea surface temperature is influenced by remote forcing from the Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic Ocean operates more independently, with no evident effect from other oceans."

In this study, we analysed the performance of 28 water vapour records between 1988 and 2014. We find sensitivity to surface warming generally outside expected ranges, attributed to breakpoints in individual record trends and differing representations of climate variability. The implication is that longer records are required for high confidence in assessing climate trends. 
 Since 2011, the Global Energy and Water cycle Exchanges (GEWEX) Water Vapor Assessment (G-VAP) has provided performance analyses for state-of-the-art reanalysis and satellite water vapour products to the GEWEX Data and Analysis Panel (GDAP) and the user community in general. A significant component of the work undertaken by G-VAP is to characterise the quality and uncertainty of these water vapour records to (i) ensure full exploitation and (ii) avoid incorrect use or interpretation of results. This study presents results from the second phase of G-VAP, where we have extended and expanded our analysis of total column water vapour (TCWV) from phase 1, in conjunction with updating the G-VAP archive. For version 2 of the archive, we consider 28 freely available and mature satellite and reanalysis data products, remapped to a regular longitude–latitude grid of 2° × 2° and on monthly time steps between January 1979 and December 2019. We first analysed all records for a “common” short period of 5 years (2005–2009), focusing on variability (spatial and seasonal) and deviation from the ensemble mean. We observed that clear-sky daytime-only satellite products were generally drier than the ensemble mean, and seasonal variability/disparity in several regions up to 12 kg m−2 related to original spatial resolution and temporal sampling. For 11 of the 28 data records, further analysis was undertaken between 1988–2014. Within this “long period”, key results show (i) trends between −1.18 ± 0.68 to 3.82 ± 3.94 kg m−2 per decade and −0.39 ± 0.27 to 1.24 ± 0.85 kg m−2 per decade were found over ice-free global oceans and land surfaces, respectively, and (ii) regression coefficients of TCWV against surface temperatures of 6.17 ± 0.24 to 27.02 ± 0.51 % K−1 over oceans (using sea surface temperature) and 3.00 ± 0.17 to 7.77 ± 0.16 % K−1 over land (using surface air temperature). It is important to note that trends estimated within G-VAP are used to identify issues in the data records rather than analyse climate change. Additionally, breakpoints have been identified and characterised for both land and ocean surfaces within this period. Finally, we present a spatial analysis of correlations to six climate indices within the long period, highlighting regional areas of significant positive and negative correlation and the level of agreement among records."

Fuentes;Elie Bou-Zeid,Estimating scalar turbulent fluxes with slow-response sensors in the stable atmospheric boundary layer,"The significance of surface–atmosphere exchanges of aerosol species to atmospheric composition is underscored by their rising concentrations that are modulating the Earth's climate and having detrimental consequences for human health and the environment. Estimating these exchanges, using field measurements, and offering alternative models are the aims here. Limitations in measuring some species misrepresent their actual exchanges, so our proposed models serve to better quantify them. 
 Conventional and recently developed approaches for estimating turbulent scalar fluxes under stable atmospheric conditions are evaluated, with a focus on gases for which fast sensors are not readily available. First, the relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) classical approach and a recently proposed mixing length parameterization, labeled A22, are tested against eddy-covariance computations. Using high-frequency measurements collected from two contrasting sites (the frozen tundra near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, and a sparsely vegetated grassland in Wendell, Idaho, during winter), it is shown that the REA and A22 models outperform the conventional Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) utilized widely to infer fluxes from mean gradients. Second, scenarios where slow trace gas sensors are the only viable option in field measurements are investigated using digital filtering applied to fast-response sensors to simulate their slow-response counterparts. With a filtered scalar signal, the observed filtered eddy-covariance fluxes are referred to here as large-eddy-covariance (LEC) fluxes. A virtual eddy accumulation (VEA) approach, akin to the REA model but not requiring a mechanical apparatus to separate the gas flows, is also formulated and tested. A22 outperforms VEA and LEC in predicting the observed unfiltered (total) eddy-covariance (EC) fluxes; however, VEA can still capture the LEC fluxes well. This finding motivates the introduction of a sensor response time correction into the VEA formulation to offset the effect of sensor filtering on the underestimated net averaged fluxes. The only needed parameter for this correction is the mean velocity at the instrument height, a surrogate of the advective timescale. The VEA approach is very suitable and simple to use with gas sensors of intermediate speed (∼ 0.5 to 1 Hz) and with conventional open- or closed-path setups."

The model directly incorporates the NO2 mixing height (NMH) into the methodological framework. The study underscores the importance of considering NMH when estimating ground-level NO2 from satellite column measurements and highlights the significant advantages of new-generation geostationary satellites in air quality monitoring. 
 The major link between satellite-derived vertical column densities (VCDs) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level concentrations is theoretically the NO2 mixing height (NMH). Various meteorological parameters have been used as a proxy for NMH in existing studies. This study developed a nested XGBoost machine learning model to convert VCDs of NO2 into ground-level NO2 concentrations across China using Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) measurements. This nested model was designed to directly incorporate NMH into the methodological framework to estimate satellite-derived ground-level NO2 concentrations. The inner machine learning model predicted the NMH from meteorological parameters, which were then input into the main XGBoost machine learning model to predict the ground-level NO2 concentrations from its VCDs. The inclusion of NMH significantly enhanced the accuracy of ground-level NO2 concentration estimates; i.e., the R2 values were improved from 0.73 to 0.93 in 10-fold cross-validation and from 0.88 to 0.99 in the fully trained model. Furthermore, NMH was identified as the second most important predictor variable, following the VCDs of NO2. Subsequently, the satellite-derived ground-level NO2 data were analyzed across subregions with varying geographic locations and urbanization levels. Highly populated areas typically experienced peak NO2 concentrations during the early morning rush hour, whereas areas categorized as lightly populated observed a slight increase in NO2 levels 1 or 2 h later, likely due to regional pollutant dispersion from urban sources. This study underscores the importance of incorporating NMH in estimating ground-level NO2 from satellite column measurements and highlights the significant advantages of geostationary satellites in providing detailed air pollution information at an hourly resolution."

In this region, the geostrophic balance breaks down, and the equatorial balance approximation takes over. The study encourages the use of RO wind fields for mesoscale climate monitoring for the equatorial region, showing a small improvement in the troposphere when including the meridional wind in the zonal-mean total wind speed. 
 Globally available and highly vertically resolved wind fields are crucial for the analysis of atmospheric dynamics for the benefit of climate studies. Most observation techniques have problems to fulfill these requirements. Especially in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere more wind data are required. In this study, we investigate the potential of radio-occultation (RO) data for climate-oriented wind field monitoring in the tropics, with a specific focus on the equatorial band within ± 5° latitude. In this region, the geostrophic balance breaks down, due to the Coriolis force term approaching zero, and the equatorial-balance equation becomes relevant. One aim is to understand how the individual wind components of the geostrophic-balance and equatorial-balance approximations bridge across the Equator and where each component breaks down. Our central aim focuses on the equatorial-balance approximation, testing its quality by comparison with ERA5 reanalysis data. The analysis of the zonal and meridional wind components showed that while the zonal wind was well reconstructed, it was difficult to estimate the meridional wind from the approximation. However, we still found a somewhat better agreement from including both components in the zonal-mean total wind speed in the troposphere. In the stratosphere, the meridional wind component is close to zero for physical reasons and has no relevant impact on the total wind speed. In general, the equatorial-balance approximation works best in the stratosphere. As a second aim, we investigated the systematic data bias between using the RO and ERA5 data and find it smaller than the bias resulting from the approximations. We also inspected the monthly-mean RO wind data over the full example year of 2009. The bias in the core region of highest quality of RO data, which is the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, was generally smaller than ± 2 m s−1. This is in line with the wind field requirements of the World Meteorological Organization. Overall, the study encourages the use of RO wind fields for regional-scale climate monitoring over the entire globe, including the equatorial region, and also showed a small improvement in the troposphere when including the meridional wind component in the zonal-mean total wind speed."

Data assimilation experiments were conducted to demonstrate the robustness and investigate the feasibility and applicability of NUCAS. The assimilation of ecosystem carbonyl sulfide (COS) fluxes improved the model performance in gross primary productivity, evapotranspiration, and sensible heat, showing that COS provides constraints on parameters relevant to carbon-, water-, and energy-related processes. 
 Modeling and predicting changes in the function and structure of the terrestrial biosphere and its feedbacks to climate change strongly depends on our ability to accurately represent interactions of the carbon and water cycles and energy exchange. However, carbon fluxes, hydrological status, and energy exchange simulated by process-based terrestrial ecosystem models are subject to significant uncertainties, largely due to the poorly calibrated parameters. In this work, an adjoint-based data assimilation system (Nanjing University Carbon Assimilation System; NUCAS v1.0) was developed, which is capable of assimilating multiple observations to optimize process parameters of a satellite-data-driven ecosystem model – the Biosphere–atmosphere Exchange Process Simulator (BEPS). Data assimilation experiments were conducted to investigate the robustness of NUCAS and to test the feasibility and applicability of assimilating carbonyl sulfide (COS) fluxes from seven sites to enhance our understanding of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. Results showed that NUCAS is able to achieve a consistent fit to COS observations across various ecosystems, including evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, C3 grass, and C3 crop. Comparing model simulations with validation datasets, we found that assimilating COS fluxes notably improves the model performance in gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration, with average root-mean-square error (RMSE) reductions of 23.54 % and 16.96 %, respectively. We also showed that NUCAS is capable of constraining parameters through assimilating observations from two sites simultaneously and achieving a good consistency with single-site assimilation. Our results demonstrate that COS can provide constraints on parameters relevant to water, energy, and carbon processes with the data assimilation system and opens new perspectives for better understanding of the ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchanges."

Traditional models struggle with accurately simulating burned areas due to simplified processes. By combining the predictive power of machine learning with a land model, our hybrid framework better captures fire dynamics. This approach enhances our understanding of wildfire behavior and aids in developing more effective climate and fire management strategies. 
 Wildfires have shown increasing trends in both frequency and severity across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). However, process-based fire models have difficulties in accurately simulating the burned area over the CONUS due to a simplification of the physical process and cannot capture the interplay among fire, ignition, climate, and human activities. The deficiency of burned area simulation deteriorates the description of fire impact on energy balance, water budget, and carbon fluxes in the Earth System Models (ESMs). Alternatively, machine learning (ML) based fire models, which capture statistical relationships between the burned area and environmental factors, have shown promising burned area predictions and corresponding fire impact simulation. We develop a hybrid framework (ML4Fire-XGB) that integrates a pretrained eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) version 2.1. A Fortran-C-Python deep learning bridge is adapted to support online communication between ELM and the ML fire model. Specifically, the burned area predicted by the ML-based wildfire model is directly passed to ELM to adjust the carbon pool and vegetation dynamics after disturbance, which are then used as predictors in the ML-based fire model in the next time step. Evaluated against the historical burned area from Global Fire Emissions Database 5 from 2001–2020, the ML4Fire-XGB model outperforms process-based fire models in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal variations. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the ML4Fire-XGB well captures the responses of the burned area to rising temperatures. The ML4Fire-XGB model has proved to be a new tool for studying vegetation-fire interactions, and more importantly, enables seamless exploration of climate-fire feedback, working as an active component in E3SM."

The tested PCPs include a perfume, a roll-on deodorant, a body spray, a hair spray, and a hand lotion. Indoor use of these PCPs emitted over 200 VOCs and resulted in indoor VOC mixing ratios of several parts per million. The VOC emission factors for the PCPs varied from 2 to 964 mg g–1. We identified strong emissions of terpenes and their derivatives, which are likely used as fragrant additives in the PCPs. When using the PCPs in the presence of indoor ozone, these reactive VOCs underwent oxidation reactions to form a variety of gas-phase oxidized vapors and led to rapid new particle formation (NPF) events with particle growth rates up to ten times higher than outdoor atmospheric NPF events.

Ultimate goal of the project is a better understanding of the modern and past ocean and climate. Operations started in 2019 in the Northeast Atlantic, and will focus on the Tropical Eastern Pacific from 2023 until 2025. Laboratories for air and seawater analyses are equipped with down‐sized and automated state‐of‐the‐art technology for a comprehensive description of the marine carbon system including CO2 concentration in the air and sea surface, pH, macro‐, and micro‐nutrient concentration (e.g., Fe, Cd), trace metals, and calcareous plankton. Air samples are obtained from ca. 13 m above sea surface and analyzed for particles (incl. black carbon and aerosols) and greenhouse gases. Plankton nets and seawater probes are deployed over the custom‐made A‐frame at the stern of the boat. Near Real‐Time Transfer of underway data via satellite connection allows dynamic expedition planning to maximize gain of information. Data and samples are analyzed in collaboration with the international expert research community. Quality controlled data are published for open access. The entire suite of data facilitates refined proxy calibration of paleoceanographic and paleoclimate archives at high temporal and spatial resolution in relation to seawater and atmospheric parameters."
10.1029/2024JD040998,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇研究论文主要关注城市环境中温室气体排放的监测和评估。研究者利用大气反演模型（AIM）结合地面塔观测数据和气象模型模拟结果来推断城市温室气体排放通量。论文重点探讨了如何将非下午时段的观测数据纳入AIM模型，以更全面地评估城市温室气体排放的昼夜变化。研究发现，在风速较高的条件下，气象模型能够较好地模拟边界层高度，因此可以将这些非下午时段的观测数据用于AIM模型。这项研究对于提高城市温室气体排放评估的准确性和完整性具有重要意义。,"['Greenhouse gas', 'Atmospheric inversion modeling', 'Urban emissions', 'CO2', 'CH4', 'Tower-based measurements', 'Meteorological modeling', 'Diurnal cycle']",V. C. Monteiro;J. C. Turnbull;N. L. Miles;K. J. Davis;Z. Barkley;A. Deng,"Assimilating Morning, Evening, and Nighttime Greenhouse Gas Observations in Atmospheric Inversions","Improved urban greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimates are crucial for informing policy and mitigation efforts. Atmospheric inversion modeling (AIM) is a widely used technique combining atmospheric measurements of trace gas, meteorological modeling, and a prior emission map to infer fluxes. Traditionally, AIM relies on mid‐afternoon observations due to the well‐represented atmospheric boundary layer in meteorological models. However, confining flux assessment to daytime observations is problematic for the urban scale, where air masses typically move over a city in a few hours and AIM therefore cannot provide improved constraints on emissions over the full diurnal cycle. We hypothesized that there are atmospheric conditions beyond the mid‐afternoon under which meteorological models also perform well. We tested this hypothesis using tower‐based measurements of CO2 and CH4, wind speed observations, weather model outputs from INFLUX (Indianapolis Flux Experiment), and a prior emissions map. By categorizing trace gas vertical gradients according to wind speed classes and identifying when the meteorological model satisfactorily simulates boundary layer depth (BLD), we found that non‐afternoon observations can be assimilated when wind speed is >5 m/s. This condition resulted in small modeled BLD biases (<40%) when compared to calmer conditions (>100%). For Indianapolis, 37% of the GHG measurements meet this wind speed criterion, almost tripling the observations retained for AIM. Similar results are expected for windy cities like Auckland, Melbourne, and Boston, potentially allowing AIM to assimilate up to 60% of the total (24‐hr) observations. Incorporating these observations in AIMs should yield a more diurnally comprehensive evaluation of urban GHG emissions."

Kaiser,Impact of Heatwaves and Declining NOx on Nocturnal Monoterpene Oxidation in the Urban Southeastern United States,"Nighttime oxidation of monoterpenes (MT) via the nitrate radical (NO3) and ozone (O3) contributes to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This study uses observations in Atlanta, Georgia from 2011 to 2022 to quantify trends in nighttime production of NO3 (PNO3) and O3 concentrations and compare to model outputs from the EPA's Air QUAlity TimE Series Project (EQUATES). We present urban‐suburban gradients in nighttime NO3 and O3 concentrations and quantify their fractional importance (F) for MT oxidation. Both observations and EQUATES show a decline in PNO3, with modeled PNO3 declining faster than observations. Despite decreasing PNO3, we find that NO3 continues to dominate nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) MT oxidation (FNO3 = 60%) in 2017, 2021, and 2022, which is consistent with EQUATES (FNO3 = 80%) from 2013 to 2019. This contrasts an anticipated decline in FNO3 based on prior observations in the nighttime residual layer, where O3 is the dominant oxidant. Using two case studies of heatwaves in summer 2022, we show that extreme heat events can increase NO3 concentrations and FNO3, leading to short MT lifetimes (<1 hr) and high gas‐phase organic nitrate production. Regardless of the presence of heatwaves, our findings suggest sustained organic nitrate aerosol formation in the urban SE US under declining NOx emissions, and highlight the need for improved representation of extreme heat events in chemistry‐transport models and additional observations along urban to rural gradients."

However, the anomalous circulation and transportation processes of water vapor, which may have played a crucial role in inducing the extreme drought, have not been fully studied. In this study, we analyze the water vapor circulation during the 2019 drought event using the land‐atmosphere water balance and a backward trajectory model for moisture tracking. Our results indicate that the precipitation in the M‐LMRB from May to October 2019 was only 71.9% of the long‐term climatological mean (1959–2021). The low precipitation during this drought event can be attributed to less‐than‐normal external water vapor supply. Specifically, the backward trajectory model reveals a decrease in the amount of water vapor transported from the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the Pacific Ocean, which are the main moisture sources for precipitation in the region. Comparing the atmospheric circulation patterns in 2019 with the climatology, we identify anomalous anticyclone conditions in the Bay of Bengal, anomalous westerlies in the Northeast Indian Ocean, and an anomalous cyclone in the Western Pacific Ocean, collectively facilitating a stronger export of water vapor from the region. Therefore, the dynamic processes played a more significant role than thermodynamic processes in contributing to the 2019 extreme drought event."

 Predicting heavy precipitation remains scientifically challenging. Here we combine Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) temperature and moisture soundings and weather forecast winds to predict the formation of thermodynamic conditions favourable for convection in the hours following satellite overpasses. Here we treat AIRS retrievals as air parcels that are moved adiabatically to generate time-varying fields. Over much of the Central-Eastern Continental U.S. during the non-winter months of 2019–2020, our derived convective available potential energy alone predicts intense precipitation. For hourly precipitation above the all-hours 99.9th percentile, performance is marginally lower than forecasts from a convection permitting model, but similar to the ERA5 reanalysis and substantially better than using the original AIRS soundings. Our results illustrate how mesoscale advection is a major contributor to developing heavy precipitation in the region. Enhancing the full AIRS record as described here would provide an alternative approach to quantify multi-decade trends in heavy precipitation risk.

 Photovoltaic (PV) panel deployment for decarbonization may reduce local terrestrial albedo, triggering a positive radiative forcing that counteracts the desired negative radiative forcing from carbon emission reductions. Yet, this potential adverse impact remains uncertain due to limited observations at PV sites. Herein we employ a robust linear parameterization method to quantify PV-induced albedo changes based on satellite data globally. We find an overall albedo decrease of −1.28 (−1.80, −0.90) × 10−2 (median and interquartile range), specific for land-cover types and climate regimes. However, the extent of albedo reduction is markedly lower than simplistic assumed values in simulating climate feedback for solar farming in Earth system models. Moreover, the albedo-induced positive radiative forcing can be offset by negative radiative forcing from clean solar generation in most PV farms within one year. Our findings underscore PV’s potential in mitigating global warming and stress the need for more accurate model estimations.

It is based on a microphysical model of cloud formation and may be applied to long-distance atmospheric transport models (> 100 km) and climatic models. This model is applied to the two most extreme precipitating cloud types in terms of both relative humidity and vertical extension: cumulonimbus and stratus. 
 With dry deposition and below-cloud scavenging, in-cloud scavenging is one of the three components of aerosol transfer from the atmosphere to the ground. There is no experimental validation of in-cloud particle scavenging models for all cloud types that is not impacted by uncertainties concerning below-cloud scavenging. In this article, the choice was made to start with a recognised and validated microphysical cloud formation model (the DEtailed SCAvenging Model, DESCAM) to extract a scheme of aerosol scavenging by clouds, valid for different cloud types. The resulting model works for the two most extreme precipitation clouds: from cumulonimbus to stratus. It is based on data accessible a priori from numerical weather prediction (NWP) outputs, i.e. the intensity of the rain and the relative humidity in the cloud. The diagnostic of the altitude of the cloud base proves to be a key parameter, and accuracy in this regard is vital. This new in-cloud scavenging scheme is intended for use in long-distance (> 100 km) atmospheric transport models (ATMs) or global climate models (GCMs)."

Gratz,Elevated oxidized mercury in the free troposphere: analytical advances and application at a remote continental mountaintop site,"Mercury (Hg) is a globally distributed neurotoxic pollutant. Atmospheric deposition is the main source of Hg in ecosystems. However, measurement biases hinder understanding of the origins and abundance of the more bioavailable oxidized form. We used an improved, calibrated measurement system to study air mass composition and transport of atmospheric Hg at a remote mountaintop site in the central US. Oxidized Hg originated upwind in the low to middle free troposphere under clean, dry conditions. 
 Mercury (Hg) is a global atmospheric pollutant. In its oxidized form (HgII), it can readily deposit to ecosystems, where it may bioaccumulate and cause severe health effects. High HgII concentrations are reported in the free troposphere, but spatiotemporal data coverage is limited. Underestimation of HgII by commercially available measurement systems hinders quantification of Hg cycling and fate. During spring–summer 2021 and 2022, we measured elemental (Hg0) and oxidized Hg using a calibrated dual-channel system alongside trace gases, aerosol properties, and meteorology at the high-elevation Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) above Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Oxidized Hg concentrations displayed diel and episodic behavior similar to previous work at SPL but were approximately 3 times higher in magnitude due to improved measurement accuracy. We identified 18 multi-day events of elevated HgII (mean enhancement of 36 pg m−3) that occurred in dry air (mean ± SD of relative humidity = 32 ± 16 %). Lagrangian particle dispersion model (HYSPLIT–STILT, Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory–Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport) 10 d back trajectories showed that the majority of transport prior to events occurred in the low to middle free troposphere. Oxidized Hg was anticorrelated with Hg0 during events, with an average (± SD) slope of −0.39 ± 0.14. We posit that event HgII resulted from upwind oxidation followed by deposition or cloud uptake during transport. Meanwhile, sulfur dioxide measurements verified that three upwind coal-fired power plants did not influence ambient Hg at SPL. Principal component analysis showed HgII consistently inversely related to Hg0 and generally not associated with combustion tracers, confirming oxidation in the clean, dry free troposphere as its primary origin."

Simpson;Kirk Ullman,Impact of improved representation of volatile organic compound emissions and production of NOx reservoirs on modeled urban ozone production,"Human activities result in the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to air pollution. Detailed VOC measurements were taken during a field study in South Korea. When compared to VOC inventories, large discrepancies showed underestimates from chemical products, liquefied petroleum gas, and long-range transport. Improved emissions and chemistry of these VOCs better described urban pollution. The new chemical scheme is relevant to urban areas and other VOC sources. 
 The fraction of urban volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions attributable to fossil fuel combustion has been declining in many parts of the world, resulting in a need to better constrain other anthropogenic sources of these emissions. During the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) field study in Seoul, South Korea, during May–June 2016, air quality models underestimated ozone, formaldehyde, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), indicating an underestimate of VOCs in the emissions inventory. Here, we use aircraft observations interpreted with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (version 13.4.0) to assess the need for increases in VOC emissions and for a revised chemical mechanism to improve treatment of VOC speciation and chemistry. We find that the largest needed VOC emissions increases are attributable to compounds associated with volatile chemical products, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas emissions, and long-range transport. Revising model chemistry to better match observed VOC speciation together with increasing model emissions of underestimated VOC species increased calculated OH reactivity by +2 s−1 and ozone production by +2 ppb h−1. Ozone increased by +6 ppb below 2 km and +9 ppb at the surface, and formaldehyde and acetaldehyde increased by +30 % and +120 % aloft, respectively, all in better agreement with observations. The larger increase in acetaldehyde was attributed to ethanol emissions, which we found to be as important for ozone production as isoprene or alkenes. The increased acetaldehyde significantly reduced the model PAN bias. The need for additional unmeasured VOCs, however, was indicated by a remaining model bias of −0.8 ppb in formaldehyde and a −57 % and −52 % underestimate in higher peroxynitrates (PNs) and alkyl nitrates (ANs), respectively. We added additional chemistry to the model to represent an additional six PNs from observed VOCs but were unable to account for the majority of missing PNs. However, four of these PNs were modeled at concentrations similar to other commonly measured PNs (> 2 % of PAN) indicating that these should be measured in future campaigns and considered from other VOC emission sources (e.g., fires). We hypothesize that emissions of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) such as ≥ C5 aldehydes from cooking and/or alkenes associated with volatile chemical products could produce both PNs and ANs and improve remaining model biases. Emerging research on the emissions and chemistry of these species will soon allow for modeling of their impact on local and regional photochemistry."

Advection is decomposed into terms related to the basic state of the atmosphere and transient eddies and compared against a non‐warming experiment. During summer, horizontal moisture advection increases mainly by transient eddies advecting moisture from the lower latitudes. During winter, enhanced evaporation due to reduced sea ice becomes a source of moisture diminishing the role of transient eddies moistening the atmosphere. This effect intensifies under extreme global warming, turning the change in total horizontal advection in the lower troposphere negative. Diminished horizontal advection during winter is counteracted by vertical advection accompanied with enhanced evaporation and upper‐level horizontal advection maintaining the increase in column moisture. These results improve our understanding of how the water cycle in the Arctic responds via atmospheric processes under global warming."

Conventionally, recovery is defined as a return to the pre‐disturbance state, assuming ecosystem stationarity. However, this view does not account for the impact of external forces like climate change, imposing non‐stationarity and trends. Alternatively, the counterfactual approach views recovery as the state the ecosystem would have achieved if the disturbance had not occurred, accounting for external forces. Here, we present a simple method to estimate the counterfactual recovery time. By implementing our method to the greening of the Arctic region, we showed that counterfactual greening recovery is twice as long as conventional recovery over the region. We argue that the well‐documented greening of the region acts as an external force, leading to such a large difference. We advocate for embracing the counterfactual definition of recovery, as it aligns with realistic decision‐making processes."

For a fixed collision kinetic energy (CKE), filament breakups can occur at all values of eccentricity but events of coalescence decrease, and that of sheet breakup increase with increasing eccentricity in absence of EH. However, as EH increases to ∼300 kVm−1 it opposes the variability of the coalescence and sheet breakup events with eccentricity. When EH exceeds ∼300 kVm−1 the collision outcomes might be determined only by the CKE and EH. The calculated value of coalescence efficiency and total number of fragments after a binary collision decreases with an increase in EH. It is argued that an electric field can significantly modify drop size distribution in thunderclouds and needs to be considered for development of precipitation."

We find strong agreement of 2022 anomalies between the modeled and the measured data. The observed tracer‐tracer relations between nitrous oxide (N2O) and HCl indicate a significant role of chemical processing in the observed HCl reduction, especially during the austral winter of 2022. Further examining the roles of chlorine gas‐phase and heterogeneous chemistry, we find that heterogeneous chemistry emerges as the primary driver for the chemical loss of HCl, and the reaction between hypobromous acid (HOBr) and HCl on sulfate aerosols is the dominant loss process."
10.1029/2024GL110039,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了全球变暖背景下，拉尼娜事件对印度洋偶极子负位相（nIOD）的影响减弱现象。研究发现，自1999年以来，拉尼娜年出现nIOD的频率下降到1999年前的三分之一。这主要归因于印度夏季风提前到来和拉尼娜强度减弱，而Bjerknes反馈变化的影响相对较小。模型模拟表明，未来全球变暖将继续削弱拉尼娜对nIOD的影响，这将使印度洋海气耦合更加复杂。该研究利用了卫星观测数据和气候模型模拟，分析了海气相互作用和气候变化对印度洋区域的影响，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['La Niña', 'Indian Ocean Dipole', 'climate change', 'satellite observations', 'air-sea coupling']",Yongcan Zu;Shuangwen Sun;Yue Fang;Lin Liu;Libao Gao;Guijun Guo;Jun Li,Weakening of La Niña Impact on Negative Indian Ocean Dipole Under Global Warming,"As global warming intensifies, the coupling relationship between negative Indian Ocean Dipole (nIOD) and La Niña has substantially changed. However, the characteristics and mechanisms of these changes are not yet fully understood. Here, we find that the impact of La Niña on nIOD has considerably weakened since 1999, with the frequency of nIOD occurrences during La Niña years plummeting to a mere one‐third of the pre‐1999 levels. This is primarily attributed to the early onset of Indian summer monsoon and the decrease in La Niña intensity, while the effect of variations in Bjerknes feedback is relatively minor. Model simulations suggest that the influence of La Niña on nIOD will continue to weaken under future global warming through similar mechanisms as in the observations, increasing the complexity of air‐sea coupling in the Indian Ocean."

New,Africa's Climate Response to Marine Cloud Brightening Strategies Is Highly Sensitive to Deployment Region,"Solar climate intervention refers to a group of methods for reducing climate risks associated with anthropogenic warming by reflecting sunlight. Marine cloud brightening (MCB), one such approach, proposes to inject sea‐salt aerosol into one or more regional marine boundary layer to increase marine cloud reflectivity. Here, we assess the potential influence of various MCB experiments on Africa's climate using simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) as its atmospheric component. We analyzed four idealized MCB experiments under a medium‐range background forcing scenario (SSP2‐4.5), which brighten clouds over three subtropical ocean regions: (a) Northeast Pacific (MCBNEP); (b) Southeast Pacific (MCBSEP); (c) Southeast Atlantic (MCBSEA); and (d) these three regions simultaneously (MCBALL). Our results suggest that the climate impacts of MCB in Africa are highly sensitive to the deployment region. MCBSEP would produce the strongest global cooling effect and thus could be the most effective in decreasing temperatures, increasing precipitation, and reducing the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes across most parts of Africa, especially West Africa, in the future (2035–2054) compared to the historical climate (1995–2014). MCB in other regions produces less cooling and wetting despite similar radiative forcings. While the projected changes under MCBALL are similar to those of MCBSEP, MCBNEP and MCBSEA could see more residual warming and induce a warmer future than under SSP2‐4.5 in some regions across Africa. All MCB experiments are more effective in cooling maximum temperature and related extremes than minimum temperature and related extremes."

 Aerosol hygroscopic behavior plays a central role in determining climate effects and environmental influence of atmospheric particulates. Water-soluble organic acids (WSOAs) constitute a significant fraction of organic aerosols. These organic acids have a complex impact on aerosol hygroscopicity due to their physical and chemical interactions with atmospheric inorganic salts. The mixing of WSOAs with inorganic salts exerts a multiple influence on the hygroscopic growth and phase behaviors of aerosol particles, largely depending on the composition ratio, acid properties, particle size and interactions between particle components. The WSOAs play a critical role in determining water uptake characteristics of aerosol particles, especially in the low and moderate RH ranges. The previous studies reveal the occurrence of aerosol chemistry related to chloride/nitrate/ammonium depletions in aerosol droplets containing WSOAs and inorganic salts. The potential influence of WSOAs on the atmospheric recycling of HCl/HNO3/NH3 due to the chloride/nitrate/ammonium depletion may contribute to the atmospheric budget of reactive gases. A fundamental understanding for the hygroscopic behavior and aerosol chemistry of inorganic–WSOA systems is essential for the accurate parameterization of aerosol behaviors in atmospheric models. However, there is still lack of a comprehensive understanding of the hygroscopicity and related aerosol chemistry of internally mixed inorganic–WSOA systems. The present review comprehensively summarizes the impacts of WSOAs on hygroscopicity and phase changes of atmospherically relevant inorganic salts in aerosol particles especially under subsaturated conditions, and overviews the recent advances on aerosol chemistry related to the hygroscopic process for the internally mixed inorganic–WSOA aerosols."

 Electric vehicles are promoted as ‘clean’ technologies and offer promising reductions in transportation emissions. Nevertheless, their environmental benefits critically depend on the local electricity grid mix and the type of emission being considered. Here, we conduct a comparative life cycle assessment of the four dominant light-duty vehicle categories at both the global scale and in three representative countries: Norway, the US, and China. By analyzing different environmental indicators, particularly global warming potential and respiratory effects, and quantifying related parametric uncertainties, we reveal that the advantages of electric vehicles vary across these regions and across environmental impact types. While electric vehicles offer considerable decarbonization potential as the grid mix becomes cleaner, they might not mitigate other environmental impacts, such as increased respiratory effects on rural, low-income communities. Our results support stakeholders in identifying environmentally friendly vehicle and policy options while considering multiple factors, and emphasize the importance of tailored approaches over one-size-fits-all solutions in sustainable transportation.

This is usually measured by lidar, which has limitations, most notably the assumption of a lidar ratio. Our study shows that routine surface-level aerosol measurements are able to predict this lidar ratio reasonably well within the lower layers of the atmosphere and thus provide a relatively simple and cost-effective method to improve lidar measurements. 
 In this study, we utilised ground-based in situ measurements of the aerosol chemical composition and particle size distribution, along with meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), to predict vertical profiles of aerosol optical properties, including the aerosol scattering coefficient, backscatter coefficient, extinction coefficient, and lidar ratio. The predicted ambient profiles were compared to retrievals by a multi-wavelength Raman lidar during the Ruisdael Land–Atmosphere Interactions Intensive Trace-gas and Aerosol (RITA) campaign in the Netherlands in 2021 for 26 time periods of approximately 1 h each. Predicted and retrieved extensive aerosol properties (scattering, backscatter, and extinction coefficient) were comparable only approximately 35 % of the time, mostly under the condition of well-mixed boundary layers. In this case, ground-based measurements can provide a way to extend extinction profiles to lower altitudes, where they cannot be retrieved, and to verify the lidar-measured profiles. Accurate representation of hygroscopic growth is required for adjusting the dry size distribution to ambient size distribution, and the estimated relative humidity profile may have a substantial influence on the shape of the calculated profiles. On the other hand, the lidar ratio profiles predicted by ground-based data also compared reasonably well to the retrieved lidar profiles (starting at 800 m) for conditions where the predicted and retrieved backscatter profiles differed considerably. The difference in the predicted and retrieved lidar ratio is usually less than ±30 %. Our study thus shows that, for well-mixed boundary layers, a representative lidar ratio can be estimated from ground-based in situ measurements of chemical composition and dry size distribution. This approach offers a method of providing lidar ratios calculated from independent in situ measurements for simple backscatter lidars or at times when Raman lidar profiles cannot be measured (e.g. during the daytime). It only uses data that are routinely available at aerosol measurement stations and is therefore not only useful for further validating lidar measurements but also for bridging the gap between in situ measurements and lidar remote sensing."

Flynn;James C. Barnard;Brian D. Ermold;Jennifer M. Comstock,Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric (SAS-He): design and evaluation,"Conventional ground-based radiometers commonly measure solar radiation at a few wavelengths within a narrow spectral range. These limitations prevent improved retrievals of aerosol, cloud, and surface characteristics. To address these limitations, an advanced ground-based radiometer with expanded spectral coverage and hyperspectral capability is introduced. Its good performance is demonstrated using reference data collected over three coastal regions with diverse types of aerosols and clouds. 
 A novel ground-based radiometer, referred to as the Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric (SAS-He), is introduced. This radiometer uses the shadow-band technique to report total irradiance and its direct and diffuse components frequently (every 30 s) with continuous spectral   coverage (350–1700 nm) and moderate spectral (∼ 2.5 nm ultraviolet–visible and ∼ 6 nm shortwave-infrared) resolution. The SAS-He's performance is evaluated using integrated datasets collected over coastal regions during three field campaigns supported by the US Department of Energy's  Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program, namely the (1) Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP; Cape Cod, Massachusetts), (2) Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER; in and around Houston, Texas), and (3) Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE; La Jolla, California). We compare (i) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total optical depth (TOD) derived from the direct irradiance, as well as (ii) the diffuse irradiance and direct-to-diffuse ratio (DDR) calculated from two components of the total irradiance. As part of the evaluation, both AOD and TOD derived from the SAS-He direct irradiance are compared to those provided by a collocated Cimel sunphotometer (CSPHOT) at five (380, 440, 500, 675, 870 nm) and two (1020, 1640 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Additionally, the SAS-He diffuse irradiance and  DDR  are contrasted with their counterparts offered by a collocated multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) at six (415, 500, 615, 675, 870, 1625 nm) wavelengths. Overall, reasonable agreement is demonstrated between the compared products despite the challenging observational conditions associated with varying aerosol loadings and diverse types of aerosols and clouds. For example, the AOD- and TOD-related values of root mean square error remain within 0.021 at 380, 440, 500, 675, 870, 1020, and 1640 nm wavelengths during the three field campaigns."

Yet, such models are more adept at predicting specific water compartments, such as soil moisture, rather than others, which consequently impedes accurately forecasting of TWS. Here we show that machine learning can be used to uncover relations between nonseasonal terms of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived total water storage and the preceding hydrometeorological drivers, and these relations can subsequently be used to predict water storage up to 12 months ahead, and even exceptional droughts on the basis of near real‐time observational forcing data. Validation by actual GRACE observations suggests that the method developed here has the capability to forecast trends in global land water storage for the following year. If applied in early warning systems, these predictions would better inform decision‐makers to improve current drought and water resource management."

Results showed that the Guliya dust concentration has exhibited a declining trend since the 1960s (−751 μg kg−1 yr−1). Applying an attribution approach, we discovered that low dust emission (80.3%) was the main cause of the drop in dust concentration, with changes related to transportation (5.2%) and deposition (14.5%) making only minor contributions.

 Intensifying hydroclimatic changes in North Africa are causing unprecedented floods, droughts, and land degradation patterns that are increasingly associated with human casualties, socioeconomic instabilities, and outflow migrations. These patterns’ and their future forecasts remain largely unquantified, aggravating the impacts on several populous areas. To address this deficiency, we employ pixel-based remote sensing data correlation analysis and soil loss modeling to constrain the uncertainties on the decadal hydroclimatic and ecosystem changes in North Africa. Using cloud-based big data analysis in Google Earth Engine, we establish the convolution between precipitation patterns and surface textural characteristics, evaluating the spatial distribution of soil erosion risks at the continental scale. Our investigation uses a multi-step approach, integrating risk areas derived from soil erosion with high-resolution population data, offering critical insights into zones of different vulnerabilities. Our results unveiled a significant escalation in soil erosion anomalies over the past two decades. In particular, 15 % of the areas receiving precipitation in all of North Africa are currently at medium to high risk of soil erosion versus only 7 % in 2002. These risks are concentrated in urban areas, where each year, ∼29,000 people become highly vulnerable to these hazards, up from ∼22,000 in 2002. These increases are primarily associated with the surge in semi-unformal urban settings and the rise in rain aggressiveness and storminess. These factors, combined with the poor public perception of the imminence of these risks, create hotspots where the impacts are becoming insurmountable, as considered herein for the case of the recent catastrophic floods in Derna, Libya, used as a validation site. We conclude that increased soil erosion will modulate the impacts of upcoming catastrophic floods. As such, a pressing change in urban and land use policies in expansive areas of North Africa is called for to increase their resilience to upcoming hydroclimatic fluctuations."

 High spatial resolution XCO2 data is key to investigating the mechanisms of carbon sources and sinks. However, current carbon satellites have a narrow swath and uneven observation points, making it difficult to obtain seamless and full-coverage data. We propose a novel method combining extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to construct the relationship between OCO-2 XCO2 data and auxiliary data (i.e., vegetation, meteorological, anthropogenic emissions, and LST data), and to map the seamless monthly XCO2 concentration in East Asia from 2015 to 2020. Validation results based on TCCON ground station data demonstrate the high accuracy of the model with an average R2 of 0.93, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.33 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.24 % in five sites. The results show that the average atmospheric XCO2 concentration in East Asia shows a continuous increasing trend from 2015 to 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 2.21 ppm/yr. This trend is accompanied by clear seasonal variations, with the highest XCO2 concentration in winter and the lowest in summer. Additionally, anthropogenic activities contributed significantly to XCO2 concentrations, which were higher in urban areas. These findings highlight the dynamics of regional XCO2 concentrations over time and their association with human activities. This study provides a detailed examination of XCO2 distribution and trends in East Asia, enhancing our comprehension of atmospheric CO2 dynamics."

Here, we evaluated the impacts of PD on grassland growth at the seasonal scale based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our findings showed that grassland growth during spring was mostly affected by PD in arid regions, with PD occurring during the nongrowing season and spring causing mean standardized anomalies (SAs) of −0.83 and −0.54, respectively, for the NDVI. In semiarid and subhumid regions, summer PD caused not only the largest negative response in summer (with SAs of −0.94 and −0.80 for semiarid and subhumid regions, respectively) but also in autumn (−0.80 and −0.74). PD in autumn had a less adverse effect on grassland growth. The divergent seasonal responses primarily stemmed from shifts in the dominant factors influencing grassland growth across seasons. PD reduced soil moisture in spring and summer, which in turn affected grassland growth. However, summer PD affected autumn grassland growth primarily through the carryover effect. Our results highlighted the importance of the timing of PD and suggested that precipitation in the previous season should receive more attention when considering the relationship between vegetation and precipitation at the seasonal scale."

The accuracy – i.e., mean absolute error – improved from 1.28 K to 0.67 K between the seasons thanks to an improved camera setup and temperature stabilization. The dataset represents a major advance in the validation of satellite measurements and physical snow models over a complex topography. 
 The surface temperature of snow cover is a key variable, as it provides information about the current state of the snowpack, helps predict its future evolution, and enhances estimations of the snow water equivalent. Although satellites are often used to measure the surface temperature despite the difficulty of retrieving accurate surface temperatures from space, calibration–validation datasets over snow-covered areas are scarce. We present a dataset of extensive measurements of the surface radiative temperature of snow acquired with an uncooled thermal-infrared (TIR) camera. The set accuracy goal is 0.7 K, which is the radiometric accuracy of the TIR sensor of the future CNES/ISRO TRISHNA mission. TIR images have been acquired over two winter seasons, November 2021 to May 2022 and February to May 2023, at the Col du Lautaret, 2057 m a.s.l. in the French Alps. During the first season, the camera operated in the off-the-shelf configuration with rough thermal regulation (7–39 °C). An improved setup with a stabilized internal temperature was developed for the second campaign, and comprehensive laboratory experiments were carried out in order to characterize the physical properties of the components of the TIR camera and its calibration. Thorough processing, including radiometric processing, orthorectification, and a filter for poor-visibility conditions due to fog or snowfall, was performed. The result is two winter season time series of 130 019 maps of the surface radiative temperature of snow with meter-scale resolution over an area of 0.5 km2. The validation was performed against precision TIR radiometers. We found an absolute accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE) of 1.28 K during winter 2021–2022 and 0.67 K for spring 2023. The efforts to stabilize the internal temperature of the TIR camera therefore led to a notable improvement of the accuracy. Although some uncertainties persist, particularly the temperature overestimation during melt, this dataset represents a major advance in the capacity to monitor and map surface temperature in mountainous areas and to calibrate–validate satellite measurements over snow-covered areas of complex topography.

They are usually attributed to subauroral electron heating by inner magnetospheric heat flux (IMHF). However, the role of IMHF in changing the ionosphere‐thermosphere (IT) still remains elusive. We conduct controlled numerical experiments with the Thermosphere‐Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). Coulomb collisional heat flux derived with the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere Ionosphere (CIMI) model and empirical subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are implemented in TIEGCM. The heat flux causes electron temperature enhancement, electron density depletion, and consequently SAR arcs formed in the dusk‐to‐midnight subauroral ionosphere region. SAPS cause more substantial plasma and neutral heating and plasma density variations in a broader region. The maximum enhancement of subauroral red line emission rate is comparable to that caused by the heat flux. However, the visibility of SAR arcs also depends on the relative enhancement to the background brightness."

 Wildfire activity in Arctic and boreal regions is rapidly increasing, with severe consequences for climate and human health. Regional long-term variations in fire frequency and intensity characterize fire regimes. The spatial variability in Arctic–boreal fire regimes and their environmental and anthropogenic drivers, however, remain poorly understood. Here we present a fire tracking system to map the sub-daily evolution of all circumpolar Arctic–boreal fires between 2012 and 2023 using 375 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fire detections and the resulting dataset of the ignition time, location, size, duration, spread and intensity of individual fires. We use this dataset to classify the Arctic–boreal biomes into seven distinct ‘pyroregions’ with unique climatic and geographic environments. We find that these pyroregions exhibit varying responses to environmental drivers, with boreal North America, eastern Siberia and northern tundra regions showing the highest sensitivity to climate and lightning density. In addition, anthropogenic factors play an important role in influencing fire number and size, interacting with other factors. Understanding the spatial variability of fire regimes and its interconnected drivers in the Arctic–boreal domain is important for improving future predictions of fire activity and identifying areas at risk for extreme events.

Enhancing urban green space quality and quantity offers vast potential for improving outdoor cooling adaptation and reducing its global inequality. 
 Climate warming disproportionately impacts countries in the Global South by increasing extreme heat exposure. However, geographic disparities in adaptation capacity are unclear. Here, we assess global inequality in green spaces, which urban residents critically rely on to mitigate outdoor heat stress. We use remote sensing data to quantify daytime cooling by urban greenery in the warm seasons across the ~500 largest cities globally. We show a striking contrast, with Global South cities having ~70% of the cooling capacity of cities in the Global North (2.5 ± 1.0 °C vs. 3.6 ± 1.7 °C). A similar gap occurs for the cooling adaptation benefits received by an average resident in these cities (2.2 ± 0.9 °C vs. 3.4 ± 1.7 °C). This cooling adaptation inequality is due to discrepancies in green space quantity and quality between cities in the Global North and South, shaped by socioeconomic and natural factors. Our analyses further suggest a vast potential for enhancing cooling adaptation while reducing global inequality.

 Despite the profound societal impacts of intense tropical cyclones (TCs), prediction of future changes in their regional occurrence remains challenging owing to climate model limitations and to the infrequent occurrence of such TCs. Here we reveal projected changes in the frequency of major TC occurrence (i.e., maximum sustained wind speed: ≥ 50 m s−1) on the regional scale. Two independent high-resolution climate models projected similar changes in major TC occurrence. Their spatial patterns highlight an increase in the Central Pacific and a reduction in occurrence in the Southern Hemisphere—likely attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, this study suggests that major TCs can modify large-scale sea-level pressure fields, potentially leading to the abrupt onset of strong wind speeds even when the storm centers are thousands of kilometers away. This study highlights the amplified risk of storm-related hazards, specifically in the Central Pacific, even when major TCs are far from the populated regions.

During the 2021 summer COVID-19 lockdown in Yangzhou, we found that PM2.5 levels did not decrease despite reduced primary emissions. Aged black-carbon particles increased substantially due to higher O3 levels and transported pollutants. High humidity and low wind also played key roles. The results highlight the importance of a regionally balanced control strategy for future air quality management. 
 Black-carbon-containing (BCc) particles are ubiquitous in ambient air, significantly contributing to particulate matter (PM) pollution. The unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2021 prompted a localized and prolonged lockdown in Yangzhou, situated in the Yangtze River Delta, China. This lockdown led to significant alteration of local anthropogenic emissions, while neighboring cities continued regular operations, providing a unique opportunity for the investigation of BCc particle characteristics influenced by varying emission conditions. Single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPA-MS) analysis revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of freshly emitted BCc particles during the lockdown (LD) period. However, PM2.5 concentrations remained relatively unchanged, with an observed increase in the proportion of aged BCc particles during LD compared to the period before the lockdown (BLD). The study also underscores the significant role of regional transport in PM2.5 pollution during the campaign. Moreover, reactive trace gases (e.g., NOx, SO2, and volatile organic compounds – VOCs) could form thick coatings on pre-existing particles, likely via enhanced heterogeneous hydrolysis under high relative humidity (RH), resulting in significant BCc particle growth (∼ 600 nm), as well as PM2.5 concentration, during LD. Our study highlights that short-term, strict local emission controls may not effectively reduce PM pollution due to the complex production and transmission characteristics of BCc particles and the nonlinear responses of PM2.5 to its precursors. Achieving further effective PM2.5 reduction mandates a focus on nuanced control of BCc particles and necessitates a comprehensive and extensive approach with a regionally coordinated and balanced control strategy through joint regulation."

 To retrieve columnar intensive aerosol properties from sun–sky photometers, both irradiance and radiance calibration factors are needed. For the irradiance the solar calibration constant, V0, which denotes the instrument counts for a direct normal solar flux extrapolated to the top of the atmosphere, must be determined. The solid view angle, SVA, is a measure of the field of view of the instrument, and it is important for obtaining the radiance from sky diffuse irradiance measurements.

Some clouds are composed of supercooled liquid water (SLW; water held in liquid form below 0 °C) and are difficult to forecast by models. We performed in situ observations of SLW clouds at Concordia Station using SLW sondes attached to meteorological balloons in summer 2021–2022. The SLW clouds were observed in a saturated layer at the top of the planetary boundary layer in agreement with ground-based lidar observations. 
 Clouds in Antarctica are key elements that affect radiative forcing and thus Antarctic climate evolution. Although the vast majority of clouds are composed of ice crystals, a non-negligible fraction constitutes supercooled liquid water (SLW; water held in liquid form below 0 °C). Numerical weather prediction models have great difficulty in forecasting SLW clouds over Antarctica, favouring ice at the expense of liquid water and therefore incorrectly estimating the cloud radiative forcing. Remote-sensing observations of SLW clouds have been carried out for several years at Concordia Station (75° S, 123° E; 3233 m above mean sea level), combining active lidar measurements (SLW cloud detection) and passive HAMSTRAD microwave measurements (liquid water path, LWP). The present project aimed at in situ observations of SLW clouds using sondes developed by the company Anasphere, specifically designed for SLW content (SLWC) measurements. These SLWC sondes were coupled to standard meteorological pressure–temperature–humidity sondes from Vaisala and released under meteorological balloons. During the 2021–2022 summer campaign, 15 launches were made, of which 7 were scientifically exploitable above a height of 400 m above ground level, a threshold height imposed by the time the SLWC sonde takes to stabilize after launch. The three main outcomes from our analyses are as follows: (a) the first in situ observations so far of SLW clouds in Antarctica with SLWC sondes; (b) on average, the consistency of SLW cloud heights as observed by in situ sondes and remote-sensing lidar; and (c) the liquid water path (vertically integrated SLWC) deduced by the sondes being generally equal to or greater than the LWP remotely sensed by HAMSTRAD. In general, the SLW clouds were observed in a layer close to saturation (U > 80 %) or saturated (U ∼ 100 %–105 %) just below or at the lowermost part of the entrainment zone, or capping inversion zone, which exists at the top of the planetary boundary layer and is characterized by an inflection point in the potential temperature vertical profile. Our results are consistent with the theoretical view that SLW clouds form and remain at the top of the planetary boundary layer."

Their observation in the middle atmosphere is challenging and rare, as it requires continuous measurements with a high temporal resolution. In this paper, temperature time series of a ground-based microwave radiometer were analyzed with a spectral filter to derive thermal tide amplitudes and phases in an altitude range of 25–50 km at the geographical locations of Payerne and Bern (Switzerland). 
 In recent decades, theoretical studies and numerical models of thermal tides have gained attention. It has been recognized that tides have a significant influence on the dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere; as they grow in amplitude and propagate upward, they transport energy and momentum from the lower to the upper atmosphere, contributing to the vertical coupling between atmospheric layers. The superposition of tides with other atmospheric waves leads to non-linear wave–wave interactions. However, direct measurements of thermal tides in the middle atmosphere are challenging and are often limited to satellite measurements in the tropics and at low latitudes. Due to orbit geometry, such observations provide only a reduced insight into the short-term variability in atmospheric tides. In this paper, we present tidal analysis from 5 years of continuous observations of middle-atmospheric temperatures. The measurements were performed with the ground-based temperature radiometer TEMPERA (TEMPErature RAdiometer), which was developed at the University of Bern in 2013 and was located in Bern (46.95° N, 7.45° E) and Payerne (46.82° N, 6.94° E). TEMPERA achieves a temporal resolution of 1–3 h and covers the altitude range between 25–50 km. Using an adaptive spectral filter with a vertical regularization (ASF2D) for the tidal analysis, we found maximum amplitudes for the diurnal tide of approximately 2.4 K, accompanied by seasonal variability. The maximum amplitude was reached on average at an altitude of 43 km, which also reflected some seasonal characteristics. We demonstrate that TEMPERA is suitable for providing continuous temperature soundings in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere with a sufficient cadence to infer tidal amplitudes and phases for the dominating tidal modes. Furthermore, our measurements exhibit a dominating diurnal tide and smaller amplitudes for the semidiurnal and terdiurnal tides in the stratosphere."

We tested three devices and found notable differences between their fluorescence measurements. Each one showed potential for pollen identification, but the large variability between them needs to be addressed. 
 The study evaluated a new model of a Plair SA airflow cytometer, Rapid-E+, and assessed its suitability for airborne pollen monitoring within operational networks. Key features of the new model are compared with the previous one, Rapid-E. A machine learning algorithm is constructed and evaluated for (i) classification of reference pollen types in laboratory conditions and (ii) monitoring in real-life field campaigns. The second goal of the study was to evaluate the device usability in forthcoming monitoring networks, which would require similarity and reproducibility of the measurement signal across devices. We employed three devices and analysed (dis-)similarities of their measurements in laboratory conditions. The lab evaluation showed similar recognition performance to that of Rapid-E, but field measurements in conditions when several pollen types were present in the air simultaneously showed notably lower agreement of Rapid-E+ with manual Hirst-type observations than those of the older model. An exception was the total-pollen measurements. Comparison across the Rapid-E+ devices revealed noticeable differences in fluorescence measurements between the three devices tested. As a result, application of the recognition algorithm trained on the data from one device to another led to large errors. The study confirmed the potential of the fluorescence measurements for discrimination between different pollen classes, but each instrument needed to be trained individually to achieve acceptable skills. The large uncertainty of fluorescence measurements and their variability between different devices need to be addressed to improve the device usability."

To ensure precise measurements and correct the atmospheric spectrum, we employed hot-cold calibration along with continuous tipping curve calibration. Prior to the retrieval process, both pointing and frequency offsets were corrected. We provide stratospheric ozone profiles from 2016 to 2021 which are compared with collocated satellite observations. 
 A ground-based 110 GHz radiometer was designed to measure the stratospheric ozone vertical profile by observing the 110.836 GHz ozone emission spectrum and the instrument has been operational at Sookmyung Women’s University (37.54° N, 126.97° E) in Seoul, Korea. In this paper, we detail the instrumental design, calibration procedures, correction methods, and the retrieved ozone vertical profile. The instrument is a heterodyne total power radiometer. It down-converts the observed 110.836 GHz ozone frequency to 0.609 GHz, with a frequency resolution of 61 kHz and a bandwidth of 800 MHz. The spectral intensity is digitized using a fast Fourier transform spectrometer. For hot-cold calibration, we use microwave absorbers at room temperature and liquid nitrogen as calibration targets. Tropospheric opacity is corrected using the continuous tipping curve calibration. The measured opacities were compared with simulated values from the Korea Local Analysis and Prediction System (KLAPS) data.

However, the use of satellite data is usually conservative and imperfect. In this study, a better spatial representation of satellite observations is discussed and explored by a so-called footprint function or operator, highlighting its added value through a case study and diagnostics. 
 The microwave radiances are key observations, especially over data-sparse regions, for operational data assimilation in numerical weather prediction (NWP). An often applied simplification is that these observations are used as point measurements; however, the satellite field of view may cover many grid points of high-resolution models. Therefore, we examine a solution in high-resolution data assimilation to better account for the spatial representation of the radiance observations. This solution is based on a footprint operator implemented and tested in the variational assimilation scheme of the AROME-Arctic (Application of Research to Operations at MEsoscale – Arctic) limited-area model. In this paper, the design and technical challenges of the microwave radiance footprint operator are presented. In particular, implementation strategies, the representation of satellite field-of-view ellipses, and the emissivity retrieval inside the footprint area are discussed. Furthermore, the simulated brightness temperatures and the sub-footprint variability are analysed in a case study, indicating particular areas where the use of the footprint operator is expected to provide significant added value. For radiances measured by the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) sensors, the standard deviation of the observation minus background (OmB) departures is computed over a short period in order to compare the statistics of the default and the implemented footprint observation operator. For all operationally used AMSU-A and MHS tropospheric channels, it is shown that the standard deviation of OmB departures is reduced when the footprint operator is applied. For AMSU-A radiances, the reduction is around 1 % for high-peaking channels and about 4 % for low-peaking channels. For MHS data, this reduction is somewhere between 1 %–2 % by the footprint observation operator."

Among other parameters, inorganic particle and gas-phase species were alternatingly measured in the gym’s supply duct and weight room. The Indoor Model of Aerosols, Gases, Emissions, and Surfaces (IMAGES) uses the inorganic aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium model, ISORROPIA, to estimate the partitioning of inorganic aerosols and corresponding gases. In this study herein, measurements from the ATHLETIC campaign were used to evaluate IMAGES’ performance. Ammonia emission rates, nitric acid deposition, and particle deposition velocities were related to observed occupancy, which informed these rates in IMAGES runs. Initially, modeled indoor inorganic aerosol concentrations were not in good agreement with measurements. A parametric investigation revealed that lowering the temperature or raising the relative humidity used in the ISORROPIA model drove the semivolatile species more toward the particle phase, substantially improving modeled-measured agreement. One speculated reason for these solutions is that aerosol water was enhanced by increasing the RH or decreasing the temperature. Another is that thermodynamic equilibrium was not established in this indoor setting or that the thermodynamic parametrizations in ISORROPIA are less accurate for typical indoor settings. This result suggests that applying ISORROPIA indoors requires further careful experimental validation."

The adjoint model provides benefits per ton (BPTs) that are location-specific and applicable to various sectors. BPTs show significant variability across locations, such that only 20% of primary PM2.5 emissions in each country makes up more than half of its burden. The greatest benefits in terms of BPTs are for primary PM2.5 reductions, followed by ammonia. Seasonal differences in benefits vary by pollutant: while PM2.5 benefits remain high across seasons, BPTs for reducing ammonia are much higher in the winter due to the increased ammonium nitrate formation efficiency. Based on our location-specific BPTs, we estimate a total of 91,000 U.S. premature mortalities attributable to natural and anthropogenic emissions."

A recently developed fast 3D radiation parameterization scheme gains some success in quantifying horizontal radiative transfer through cloud sides using cloud area fraction. Based on 3D Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer through an idealized single‐layer cloud with Koch‐shaped fractal geometry edges, here we show that radiative energy transport through cloud sides correlates more significantly with cloud area fraction than with cloud perimeter length. The results exemplify the importance of accounting for the horizontal radiative energy exchanges between cloud‐free and cloudy regions with cloud area fraction. Results from additional sensitivity simulations show that increased cloud vertical extent often enhances cloud‐side sunlight leak more significantly than cloud‐side sunlight interception. At low sun elevations, cloud‐side sunlight interception is enhanced more than cloud‐side sunlight leak does with the increase of cloud mass."

Recently, neural networks start to be applied for the development of parameterizations of interface turbulent heat flux. However, these new parameterizations are primairily developed for specific regions and have not been tested in real atmosphere‐ocean coupled models. In this study, we propose a new air‐sea heat flux parameterization using a physical‐informed neural network (PINN) based on multiple observational data sets worldwide. Evaluated with an independent observation data set, it is shown that the PINN can significantly reduce the RMSE of latent heat flux by at least about 48.6% compared to three traditional bulk formulas. Moreover, the PINN can be flexibly updated with new observational data by transfer learning. To test the performance of the new parameterization in realistic application, we implement the PINN into a global ocean‐atmosphere coupled model and make seasonal forecasts for the first time. The PINN markedly reduce the errors of equatorial SST forecast, indicating a good performance of the PINN‐based air‐sea turbulent heat flux scheme. Noticeably, due to limited observational data, the NN‐based parameterizations tend to underestimate heat flux at high wind speeds compared with bulk formula‐based parameterizations. With more data available at extreme conditions, the PINN can be improved via transfer learning and need to be futher evaluated. This study suggests that PINN‐based air‐sea heat flux parameterization is promising to improve SST simulation."

However, responses of various types of HWs (i.e., dry HWs, only high Td; humid HWs, only high Tw; hybrid HWs, both high Td and Tw; total HWs, high Td or Tw), to ACC and urbanization remain unknown. In this study, both observations and simulations show significantly increasing occurrence probability of total HWs over China during 1971–2020, whereas this increase is mainly reflected in hybrid HWs, followed by dry HWs and humid HWs. 68.2%–93.0% of the observed increases in the above four types of HWs can be attributed to ACC; on the other hand, urbanization tends to suppress humid HWs but enhance dry HWs, as a result of contributing to the increase of hybrid HWs by 10.9%. Under future ACC, total HWs are projected to be more frequent as expected, which is mainly sourced from the increasing hybrid HWs because dry/humid HWs are projected to be steady/downward. As a consequence, urban population exposure to ACC‐induced total HWs would remarkably increase to 83.55 billion person‐days by the 2090s, 89.5% of which can be attributed to hybrid HWs. Urbanization would amplify this population exposure of ACC‐induced hybrid HWs from 74.79 billion person‐days to 110.9 billion person‐days. Our results underscore the importance of improving understanding of hybrid HWs in urban areas and developing targeted adaptation planning on a warmer planet."

For 2010, we identified 13,474 rural tracts and 59,065 urban tracts. In 2019, 13,462 were rural and 59,055 urban. Urban tracts had significantly higher PM2.5 concentrations than rural tracts during this period.

We compare the remote impacts of these SO trends using historical coupled model experiments in which the model’s SO SST anomalies are nudged to observations. Compared to the control (no nudging) ensemble, the nudged ensemble shows enhanced SST warming in the tropical southeast Pacific and Atlantic, and greater Antarctic sea ice loss, during the SO warming period: analogous to the impacts of SO cooling but of opposite sign. The SO-driven response in the tropical Pacific (Atlantic) is statistically significant when considering the trend difference between the two periods, and accounts for 34% (59%) of the observed non-radiatively forced trend. Surface heat budget analysis indicates wind-evaporation-SST feedback dominates over shortwave cloud feedback in amplifying the SO-driven SST trends in the tropics during the SO warming period, opposite to that for the SO cooling period."

 Climate events that break records by large margins are a threat to society and ecosystems. Climate change is expected to increase the probability of such events, but quantifying these probabilities is challenging due to natural variability and limited data availability, especially for observations and very rare extremes. Here we estimate the probability of precipitation events that shatter records by a margin of at least one pre-industrial standard deviation. Using large ensemble climate simulations and extreme value theory, we determine empirical and analytical record shattering probabilities and find they are in high agreement. We show that, particularly in high emission scenarios, models project much higher record-shattering precipitation probabilities in a changing relative to a stationary climate by the end of the century for almost all the global land, with the strongest increases in vulnerable regions in the tropics. We demonstrate that increasing variability is an essential driver of near-term increases in record-shattering precipitation probability, and present a framework that quantifies the influence of combined trends in mean and variability on record-shattering behaviour in extreme precipitation. Probability estimates of record-shattering precipitation events in a warming world are crucial to inform risk assessment and adaptation policies.

However, the economic impact of air pollution has rarely been explored. Here, we examined the impact of exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) derived from satellite data at 1 km × 1 km resolution on the productivity of the manufacturing plants using a micro-level dataset for the period 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 across 465 districts in India. Using a system generalized methods of moments techniques, we estimated that for every 10% increase in PM2.5 exposure, labor productivity decreases by 14.8% after controlling for the confounding factors. For exposure exceeding the national ambient air quality standard of annual PM2.5 in India (40 μg m−3), the labor productivity decreases by a bigger margin (20%) for the same margin of increase in PM2.5. We found that labor productivity loss due to ambient air pollution was lower for plants using capital-intensive production techniques. The labor productivity in plants with a higher share of blue-collar workers was more sensitive to exposure to PM2.5 as opposed to plants with a higher share of supervisors or managerial staff. This suggests that plant-level managerial skill and capital-intensive production techniques (including expenditure on pollution control and abatement equipment) will be critical in mitigating air pollution-induced labor productivity loss across manufacturing plants in India."

Here, we present the first systematic assessment of vertically resolved cloud-radiative heating within the atmosphere in 20 CMIP6 (phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project) models, including a comparison to satellite-based estimates. Our analysis highlights model differences in cloud-radiative heating in both the lower and upper troposphere as well as uncertainties related to cloud ice processes. It also illustrates limitations of our ability to observe cloud-radiative heating. Not surprisingly, the response of cloud-radiative heating to surface warming is also uncertain across models. Yet, in the upper troposphere, the response is very well predicted by an upward shift of the present-day heating, which we show results from the fact that cloud-radiative heating in the upper troposphere is a function of air temperature and thus decoupled from surface temperature. Our results have three important implications for upper-tropospheric cloud-radiative heating: they establish a new null hypothesis for its response to warming, offer a physics-based prediction of its response to warming based on present-day observations, and emphasize the need for improving its representation in simulations of the present-day climate, possibly by combining the benefits of upcoming km-scale models and satellite observations."

Lee,A new aerial approach for quantifying and attributing methane emissions: implementation and validation,"Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas originating from both natural and human activities. We describe a new uncrewed aerial system (UAS) designed to measure methane emission rates over a wide range of scales. This system has been used for direct quantification of point sources and distributed emitters over scales of up to 1 km. The system uses simultaneous measurements of methane and ethane to distinguish between different kinds of natural and human-related emission sources. 
 Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas that is produced by a diverse set of natural and anthropogenic emission sources. Biogenic methane sources generally involve anaerobic decay processes such as those occurring in wetlands, melting permafrost, or the digestion of organic matter in the guts of ruminant animals. Thermogenic CH4 sources originate from the breakdown of organic material at high temperatures and pressure within the Earth's crust, a process which also produces more complex trace hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6). Here, we present the development and deployment of an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) that employs a fast (1 Hz) and sensitive (1–0.5 ppb s−1) CH4 and  C2H6 sensor and ultrasonic anemometer. The UAS platform is a vertical-takeoff, hexarotor drone (DJI Matrice 600 Pro, M600P) capable of vertical profiling to 120 m altitude and plume sampling across scales up to 1 km. Simultaneous measurements of CH4 and C2H6 concentrations, vector winds, and positional data allow for source classification (biogenic versus thermogenic), differentiation, and emission rates without the need for modeling or a priori assumptions about winds, vertical mixing, or other environmental conditions. The system has been used for direct quantification of methane point sources, such as orphan wells, and distributed emitters,  such as landfills and wastewater treatment facilities. With detectable source rates as low as 0.04 and up to ∼ 1500 kg h−1, this UAS offers a direct and repeatable method of horizontal and vertical profiling of emission plumes at scales that are complementary to regional aerial surveys and localized ground-based monitoring."

Typically, pure water cloud droplets stay liquid until around -35 °C, unless they come into contact with ice-nucleating particles (INPs). INPs are a rare subset of aerosol particles. Using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is possible to collect aerosol particles and analyse them on their ice-nucleating ability. This study describes the test and validation of a sampling setup that can be used to collect aerosol particles onto a filter. 
 A mobile sampler for the collection of aerosol particles on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was developed and deployed during three consecutive Pallas Cloud Experiment campaigns in the vicinity of the Sammaltunturi Global Atmosphere Watch site (67°58’ N, 24°7’ E, 565 m above sea level). The sampler is designed to collect aerosol particles onto Nuclepore filters, which are subsequently analysed for the temperature-dependent number concentration of ice-nucleating particles of the sampled aerosol with the Ice Nucleation Spectrometer of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (INSEKT). This setup is an easy and flexible way to connect INP concentration measurements with cloud microphysics. The sampler was flown with a fixed-wing UAV in different altitudes up to 1000 m above ground level. The total flight time ranges from 1 hour to more than 1.5 hours, depending on environmental conditions. Pressure, temperature and relative humidity are also measured to provide information about the meteorological flight conditions. The flow over the filter was maintained by a micro-diaphragm pump, providing around 10 standard litres per minute over a small filter (diameter of 25 mm) and around 11 standard litres per minute over a larger filter (diameter of 47 mm) at a pressure corresponding to 500 m above sea level. For a typical flight time of 1.5 hours, this results in a sampled air volume of about 930 to 1000 standard litres per flight, giving an INP detection limit of approximately 1.1 × 10−3 and 1.0 × 10−3 INPs per standard litre, respectively. For comparison to the flight results, a similar setup was deployed at ground level. The comparison shows a clear distinction from the water and handling blank background for both setups, proving the technical feasibility of the setups. Furthermore, for some flights, a shift between the two INP populations can be seen, indicating that ground-based INP measurements deviate from the samples collected on-board the UAV."

It is applied to the Météo-France global numerical weather prediction model, with the objective of simulating Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar reflectivity observations. Additionally, the simulation of the bright-band is addressed, and then successfully applied to model forecasts for the purpose of classifying the model columns between stratiform and convective categories. 
 Because of their high sensitivity to hydrometeors and their high vertical resolutions, space-borne radar observations are emerging as an undeniable asset for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) applications. The EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) NWP SAF (Satellite Application Facility) released an active sensor module within version 13 of the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) software with the goal of simulating both active and passive microwave instruments within a single framework using the same radiative transfer assumptions. This study provides an in-depth description of the radar simulator available within this software. In addition, this study proposes a revised version of the existing melting layer parametrization scheme of Bauer (2001) within the RTTOV-SCATT v13.1 model to provide a better fit to observations below the freezing level. Simulations are performed with and without melting layer schemes for the Dual precipitation radar (DPR) instrument onboard GPM using the ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) global NWP model running operationally at Météo-France for two different one-month periods (June, 2020 and January, 2021). Results for a case study over the Atlantic ocean show that the revised melting scheme produces more realistic simulations as compared to the default scheme both at Ku (13.5 GHz) and Ka (35.5 GHz) frequencies and these simulations are much closer to observations. A statistical assessment using more samples show significant improvement of the first-guess departure statistics with the revised scheme compared to the existing melting scheme. As a step further, this study showcases the use of melting layer simulations for the classification of precipitation (stratiform, convective and transition) using the Dual Frequency Ratio algorithm (DFR). The classification results also reveal a significant overestimation of the rain reflectivities in all hemispheres, which can either be due to a tendency of the ARPEGE model to produce a too large amount of convective precipitation, or to a mis-representation of the convective precipitation fraction within the forward operator."

We propose a framework to assess model performance. In the framework, convective cells are identified and tracked in the forecasts and observations, and then the model skill is evaluated by comparing differences between forecast and observed cells. We demonstrate the framework with 4 open-source models. 
 The rapid temporal evolution of convective rainfall poses a challenge for rainfall nowcasting models. With the growing potential of machine learning models for precipitation nowcasting to produce realistic-looking nowcasts for long lead times, it is important to investigate whether the nowcasts also produce realistic development for convective rainfall. Common verification metrics traditionally used to validate nowcasting models are often dominated by large-scale stratiform rainfall, and averaging the metrics across entire precipitation fields obscures how accurately the models replicate individual convective cells, which makes it difficult to distinguish the model skill for the growth and decay of convective rainfall. In this study, we present a convective cell tracking-based framework to investigate how accurately nowcasting models reproduce the development of convective rainfall. The framework consists of first identifying and tracking the convective cells in the input observation rainfall fields, and then identifying and tracking the cells separately in the target observations and the nowcast rainfall fields by continuing the cell tracks identified in the observations. Features describing the cells and cell tracks, such as the cell volume rain rate and area, are then extracted. In addition to the errors in these feature values, the models’ skill in reproducing the existence of convective cells is estimated by calculating several contingency-table metrics, such as the Critical Success Index. The results allow the analysis of how accurately the models reproduce the growth and decay of convective rainfall and quantify the differences between the models, for example, due to differences in how the models smooth the nowcasts, i.e., blurring. The framework also allows differentiation of the results based on the initial conditions of the cell tracks, demonstrated here by separating the tracks into decaying or growing cell tracks based on the cell status when the nowcast is created. The framework is demonstrated using four open-source advection-based models: the advection nowcast, S-PROG, and LINDA implemented in the pysteps library, and L-CNN, with data from the Swiss radar network. The results indicate that the L-CNN model reproduced the existence of convective cells best among the models and had smaller errors in the cell volume rain rate than LINDA and S-PROG. LINDA had the smallest underestimation in the cell mean rain rate, whereas S-PROG significantly overestimated the cell volume rain rate and area because of blurring."

Human respiratory deposition dose assessments of particles with varying chemical compositions were further conducted by a respiratory deposition model.

Measurement of SOA fingerprints is vitally important in revealing precursor interactions in mixed systems. In this work, anthropogenic (naphthalene (Nap) and 2-methyl naphthalene (2-MN)) and biogenic (α-pinene (Alp)) precursors and their mixture are OH-oxidized in a chamber to investigate the interaction of precursors on SOA formation. Organics formed from the single and mixed precursor systems are analyzed by using a thermal desorption comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (TD-GC×GC-MS). A pixel-based nontargeted analysis technique is deployed to resolve the mass spectra. Nearly 70% of the total response is resolved at the molecular level. The “full spectrum” template is then applied to identify SOA markers with the combination of enhancement ratios of blob quantifier responses. We found that all SOA markers in mixed systems are related to Alp, including 8-hydroxycarvotanacetone, and 5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ol.

During the 2019–2020 Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, joint observations of the coupled air‐ice‐ocean system were collected at multiple spatial scales. Here, we present observations of a strong mid‐winter cyclone that impacted the MOSAiC site as it drifted in the central Arctic pack ice. The sea ice dynamical response showed spatial structure at the scale of the evolving and translating cyclonic wind field. Internal ice stress and ocean stress play significant roles, resulting in timing offsets between the atmospheric forcing and the ice response and post‐cyclone inertial ringing in the ice and ocean. Ice motion in response to the wind field then forces the upper ocean currents through frictional drag. The strongest impacts to the sea ice and ocean from the passing cyclone occur as a result of the surface impacts of a strong atmospheric low‐level jet (LLJ) behind the trailing cold front and changing wind directions between the warm‐sector LLJ and post cold‐frontal LLJ. Impacts of the cyclone are prolonged through the coupled ice‐ocean inertial response. Local impacts of the approximately 120 km wide LLJ occur over a 12 hr period or less and at scales of a kilometer to a few tens of kilometers, meaning that these impacts occur at combined smaller spatial scales and faster time scales than most satellite observations and coupled Earth system models can resolve."

 China faces challenges in reaching its carbon neutrality goal by the year 2060 to meet the Paris Agreement and improving air quality simultaneously. Dramatic nitrogen emission reductions will be brought by this ambitious target, yet their impact on the natural ecosystem is not clear. Here, by combining two atmospheric chemistry models and two process-based terrestrial ecosystem models constrained using nationwide measurements, we show that atmospheric nitrogen deposition in China’s terrestrial land will decrease by 44–57% following two emission control scenarios including one aiming at carbon neutrality. They consequently result in a pronounced shrinkage in terrestrial net ecosystem production, by 11–20% depending on models and emission scenarios. Our results indicate that the nitrogen emission reductions accompanying decarbonization would undermine natural carbon sinks and in turn set back progress toward carbon neutrality. This unintended impact calls for great concern about the trade-offs between nitrogen management and carbon neutrality.

Solely relying on the analysis of satellite-observed Chl poses challenges in determining the phytoplankton response to mesoscale eddies. To address this, our study takes a collaborative approach, utilizing satellite-derived sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and chlorophyll anomalies (CHLA) to comprehensively investigate the dynamical-biological processes associated with eddies in the subtropical and mid-latitude North Atlantic. In the subtropics, the patterns in CHLA and SSTA predominantly exhibit a dipole nature, with the dipole component providing more than 70% of the explained variance (EV). This suggests that eddy stirring is the dominant mechanism driving the observed anomaly patterns. Conversely, in the mid-latitudes, the monopole components (TM) explain more than 60% of the EV, implying a more influential role for eddy trapping and vertical modulations. The signs of the TM of eddy SSTA persist throughout their lifetime, being consistent with the lowering (raising) of isopycnals within AEs (CEs). However, the subtropical CHLA response is higher in AEs than CEs, indicating additional factors, such as eddy-induced Ekman pumping and/or mixing to a deeper level may be important. This finding is also corroborated by subsurface observations from Argo floats. At mid-latitudes, there is a clear inverse correspondence between the CHLA and mixed layer depth. In contrast, no significant correlation is observed in the subtropics, except during winter when a positive relationship emerges. These patterns suggest that phytoplankton exhibit highly diverse responses to the physical dynamics associated with eddies. Our work offers a method to estimate eddy dynamical-biological impacts on phytoplankton using satellite products, compensating for the limitations of in-situ observations. It also reveals potential contributions to marine primary production, global carbon cycles, and the development of biogeochemical models."

We examine RSR characteristics from latitude and month perspectives, revealing decreased trends observed by CERES in both hemispheres driven by clear-sky atmospheric and cloud components at 30–50° N and cloud components at 0–50° S. AVHRR achieves symmetry criteria within uncertainty and is suitable for the long-term analysis of hemispheric RSR symmetry. 
 Averaging reflected solar radiation (RSR) over the whole year/hemisphere may mask the inter-month-/region-specific signals, limiting the investigation of spatiotemporal mechanisms and hemispheric symmetry projections. This drives us to explain RSR characteristics from latitude- and month-based perspectives. The study also explores whether longer-record radiation datasets can exhibit hemispheric symmetry of RSR to understand its temporal changes. Statistics indicate that the largest trends in decreasing RSR in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (NH and SH) occur in mid-spring and are dominated by clear-sky atmospheric and cloud components and cloud components only, respectively. The interannual negative trend in the NH RSR mainly derives from 30–50° N latitude zones, attributed to the decrease in the clear-sky atmospheric component caused by reduced anthropogenic sulfate emissions and spring/summer dust frequencies and reduced cloud fraction caused by increased sea surface temperature and an unstable marine boundary layer, thus leading to a reduced cloud component. In the SH, the significant RSR decreasing trend is widespread in 0–50° S latitude zones, which is closely related to the decrease in the cloud component caused by the decrease in cloud cover over the tropical western Pacific and Southern Ocean, partially compensated by the increase in the clear-sky atmospheric component. A new data evaluation system and an uncertainty analysis reveal that only the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) outperforms in exhibiting the Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) hemispheric RSR differences due to offsetting biases among different components and achieves hemispheric RSR symmetry criteria within its uncertainty, making it suitable for studying long-term RSR hemispheric symmetry changes. Furthermore, the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) agrees well with CERES regarding hemispheric cloud component asymmetry and can help in the study of the corresponding long-term changes and mechanisms."

Utilizing a self-built vertical observation system, a direct net photochemical O3 production rate detection system, and an observation-based model, we diagnosed the vertical distributions and formation mechanism of net photochemical O3 production rates and sensitivity in the Pearl River Delta region, one of the most O3-polluted areas in China. 
 Understanding the near-ground vertical and temporal photochemical O3 formation mechanism is important to mitigate O3 pollution. Here, we measured the vertical profiles of O3 and its precursors at six different heights, ranging from 5 to 335 m, using a newly built vertical observation system in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The net photochemical ozone production rate (P(O3)net) and O3 formation sensitivities at various heights were diagnosed using an observation-based model coupled with the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1). Moreover, to assess model performance and identify the causative factors behind O3 pollution episodes, the P(O3)net was measured at 5 m above ground level with a custom-built detection system. In total, three O3 pollution episodes and two non-episodes were captured. The identified O3 pollution episodes were found to be jointly influenced by both photochemical production and physical transport, with local photochemical reactions playing a major role. The high index of agreement (IOA) calculated by comparing the modelled and measured P(O3)net values indicated the rationality of investigating the vertical and temporal variability in O3 formation mechanisms using model results. However, the measured P(O3)net values were generally higher than the modelled P(O3)net values, particularly under high-NOx conditions, which may indicate a potential underestimation of total RO2 by the model. Throughout the measurement period, the contribution of different reaction pathways to O3 production remained consistent across various heights, with HO2 + NO as the major O3 production pathway, followed by RO2 + NO. We observed that P(O3)net decreased with an increase in measurement height, which was primarily attributed to the reduction in O3 precursors, such as oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). The O3 formation regimes were similar at different heights during both episodes and non-episodes, either being located in the VOC-sensitive regime or in the transition regime that is more sensitive to VOCs. Diurnally, photochemical O3 formation typically remained in the VOC-sensitive regime during the morning and noon, but it transitioned to the transition regime and was more sensitive to VOCs in the afternoon at around 16:00 LT (local time). Vertical and temporal photochemical O3 formation is most sensitive to OVOCs, suggesting that targeting specific VOCs for control measures is more practical and feasible at the observation site. The vertical temporal analysis of O3 formation mechanisms near the ground surface in this study provides critical foundational knowledge that can be used to formulate effective short-term emergency and long-term control strategies to combat O3 pollution in the PRD region of China."

We show that cloud response to aerosol is robust, as predicted supersaturation and cloud droplet number levels agree with those determined from in-cloud measurements. The ability to determine if clouds are velocity- or aerosol-limited allows for novel model constraints and remote sensing products. 
 The purpose of this study is to understand the drivers of cloud droplet formation in orographic clouds. We used a combination of modeling, in situ,  and remote sensing measurements at the high-altitude Helmos Hellenic Atmospheric Aerosol and Climate Change ((HAC)2) station, which is located at the top of Mt. Helmos (1314 m above sea level), Greece,  during the Cloud–AerosoL InteractionS in the Helmos Background TropOsphere (CALISHTO) campaign in fall 2021 (https://calishto.panacea-ri.gr/, last access: 1 August 2024) to examine the origins of the aerosols (i.e., local aerosol from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) or long-range-transported aerosol from the free-tropospheric layer (FTL) contributing to the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)), their characteristics (hygroscopicity, size distribution,  and mixing state), and the vertical velocity distributions and resulting supersaturations.We found that the characteristics of the PBL aerosol were considerably different from FTL aerosol and use the aerosol particle number and equivalent mass concentration of the black carbon (eBC) in order to determine when (HAC)2 was within the FTL or PBL based on time series of the height of the PBL. During the (HAC)2 cloud events we sample a mixture of interstitial aerosol and droplet residues, which we characterize using a new approach that utilizes the in situ droplet measurements to determine time periods when the aerosol sample is purely interstitial. From the dataset we determine the properties (size distribution and hygroscopicity) of the pre-cloud, activated, and interstitial aerosol. The hygroscopicity of activated aerosol is found to be higher than that of the interstitial or pre-cloud aerosol. A series of closure studies with the droplet parameterization shows that cloud droplet concentration (Nd) and supersaturation can be predicted to within 25 % of observations when the aerosol size distributions correspond to pre-cloud conditions. The analysis of the characteristic supersaturation of each aerosol population indicates that droplet formation in clouds is aerosol-limited when formed in FTL air masses – hence droplet formation is driven by aerosol variations, while clouds formed in the PBL tend to be velocity-limited and droplet variations are driven by fluctuations in vertical velocity. Given that the cloud dynamics do not vary significantly between air masses, the variation in aerosol concentration and type is mostly responsible for these shifts in cloud microphysical state and sensitivity to aerosol. With these insights, the remote sensing of cloud droplets in such clouds can be used to infer either CCN spectra (when in the FTL) or vertical velocity (when in the PBL). In conclusion, we show that a coordinated measurement of aerosol and cloud properties, together with the novel analysis approaches presented here,  allows for the determination of the drivers of droplet formation in orographic clouds and their sensitivity to aerosol and vertical velocity variations."

A sensitivity analysis regarding cloud phase and related cloud properties,"This study uses radiative transfer calculations to characterize the relation of two satellite channel combinations (namely infrared window brightness temperature differences – BTDs – of SEVIRI) to the thermodynamic cloud phase. A sensitivity analysis reveals the complex interplay of cloud parameters and their contribution to the observed phase dependence of BTDs. This knowledge helps to design optimal cloud-phase retrievals and to understand their potential and limitations. 
 This study investigates the sensitivity of two brightness temperature differences (BTDs) in the infrared (IR) window of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) to various cloud parameters in order to understand their information content, with a focus on cloud thermodynamic phase. To this end, this study presents radiative transfer calculations, providing an overview of the relative importance of all radiatively relevant cloud parameters, including thermodynamic phase, cloud-top temperature (CTT), optical thickness (τ), effective radius (Reff), and ice crystal habit. By disentangling the roles of cloud absorption and scattering, we are able to explain the relationships of the BTDs to the cloud parameters through spectral differences in the cloud optical properties. In addition, an effect due to the nonlinear transformation from radiances to brightness temperatures contributes to the specific characteristics of the BTDs and their dependence on τ and CTT. We find that the dependence of the BTDs on phase is more complex than sometimes assumed. Although both BTDs are directly sensitive to phase, this sensitivity is comparatively small in contrast to other cloud parameters. Instead, the primary link between phase and the BTDs lies in their sensitivity to CTT (or more generally the surface–cloud temperature contrast), which is associated with phase. One consequence is that distinguishing high ice clouds from low liquid clouds is straightforward, but distinguishing mid-level ice clouds from mid-level liquid clouds is challenging. These findings help to better understand and improve the working principles of phase retrieval algorithms."

Wenger;Stig Hellebust,Spatial analysis of PM2.5 using a concentration similarity index applied to air quality sensor networks,"This study presents the concentration similarity index (CSI) for a quantitative and robust comparison of PM2.5 measurements within air quality sensor networks. Developed and tested on two Irish sensor networks, the CSI revealed real spatial variations in PM2.5 and enables assessment of the representativeness of regulatory monitoring locations. It underscores the impact of solid fuel combustion on PM2.5 and highlights the importance of wintertime data for accurate exposure assessments. 
 Air quality sensor (AQS) networks are useful for mapping PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 µm or smaller) in urban environments, but quantitative assessment of the observed spatial and temporal variation is currently underdeveloped. This study introduces a new metric – the concentration similarity index (CSI) – to facilitate a quantitative and time-averaged comparison of the concentration–time profiles of PM2.5 measured by each sensor within an air quality sensor network. Following development on a dataset with minimal unexplained variation and robust tests, the CSI function is used to represent an unbiased and fair depiction of the air quality variation within an area covered by a monitoring network. The measurement data is used to derive a CSI value for every combination of sensor pairs in the network, yielding valuable information on spatial variation in PM2.5. This new method is applied to two separate AQS networks, in Dungarvan and in the city of Cork, Ireland. In Dungarvan there was a lower mean CSI value (x‾CSI, Dungarvan=0.61, x‾CSI, Cork=0.71), indicating lower overall similarity between locations in the network. In both networks, the average diurnal plots for each sensor exhibit an evening peak in PM2.5 concentration due to emissions from residential solid-fuel burning; however, there is considerable variation in the size of this peak. Clustering techniques applied to the CSI matrices identify two different location types in each network; locations in central or residential areas that experience more pollution from solid-fuel burning and locations on the edge of the urban areas that experience cleaner air. The difference in mean PM2.5 between these two location types was 6 µg m−3 in Dungarvan and 2 µg m−3 in Cork. Furthermore, the examination of winter and summer months (January and May) indicates that higher PM2.5 levels during periods of increased residential solid-fuel burning act as a major driver for greater differences (lower similarity indices) between locations in both networks, with differences in mean seasonal CSI values exceeding 0.25 and differences in mean seasonal PM2.5 exceeding 7 µg m−3. These findings underscore the importance of including wintertime PM data in analyses, as the differences between locations is enhanced during periods when solid-fuel burning activities are at a peak. Additionally, the CSI method facilitates the assessment of the representativeness of the PM2.5 measured at regulatory air quality monitoring locations with respect to population exposure, showing here that location type is more important than physical proximity in terms of similarity and spatial representativeness assessments. Applying the CSI in this manner can allow for the placement of monitoring infrastructure to be optimised. The results indicate that the population exposure to PM2.5 in Dungarvan is moderately represented (x‾CSI=0.63) by the current regulatory monitoring location, and the regulatory monitoring location assessed in Cork represented the city-wide PM2.5 levels well (x‾CSI=0.76)."

Our corrected GEMS product combines the high data density of GEMS with the accuracy of TROPOMI, supporting the combined use for analyses of East Asia air quality including emissions and chemistry. This method can be extended to other species and geostationary satellites including TEMPO and Sentinel-4. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) launched in February 2020 is now providing continuous daytime hourly observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns over eastern Asia (5° S–45° N, 75–145° E) with 3.5 × 7.7 km2 pixel resolution. These data provide unique information to improve understanding of the sources, chemistry, and transport of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with implications for atmospheric chemistry and air quality, but opportunities for direct validation are very limited. Here we correct the operational level-2 (L2) NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from GEMS with a machine learning (ML) model to match the much sparser but more mature observations from the low Earth orbit TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), preserving the data density of GEMS but making them consistent with TROPOMI. We first reprocess the GEMS and TROPOMI operational L2 products to use common prior vertical NO2 profiles (shape factors) from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. This removes a major inconsistency between the two satellite products and greatly improves their agreement with ground-based Pandora NO2 VCD data in source regions. We then apply the ML model to correct the remaining differences, Δ(GEMS–TROPOMI), using the GEMS NO2 VCDs and retrieval parameters as predictor variables. We train the ML model with colocated GEMS and TROPOMI NO2 VCDs, taking advantage of TROPOMI off-track viewing to cover the wide range of effective zenith angles (EZAs) observed by GEMS. The two most important predictor variables for Δ(GEMS–TROPOMI) are GEMS NO2 VCD and EZA. The corrected GEMS product is unbiased relative to TROPOMI and shows a diurnal variation over source regions more consistent with Pandora than the operational product."

We assess the experimental sensitivity of various functional group species and their binding energy with iodide ions in I-CIMS. A novel classification approach was introduced to significantly enhance the accuracy of semi-quantitative methods (improving R2 values from 0.52 to beyond 0.88). 
 Iodide-adduct time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometry (I-CIMS) has been developed as a powerful tool for detecting the oxidation products of volatile organic compounds. However, the accurate quantification of species that do not have generic standards remains a challenge for I-CIMS application. To accurately quantify aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation intermediates, both quantitative and semi-quantitative methods for I-CIMS were established for intermediate species. The direct quantitative experimental results reveal a correlation between sensitivity to iodide addition and the number of polar functional groups (keto groups, hydroxyl groups, and acid groups) present in the species. Leveraging the selectivity of I-CIMS for species with diverse functional groups, this study established semi-quantitative equations for four distinct categories: monophenols, monoacids, polyphenol or diacid species, and species with multiple functional groups. The proposed classification method offers a pathway to enhancing the accuracy of the semi-quantitative approach, achieving an improvement in R2 values from 0.52 to beyond 0.88. Overall, the categorized semi-quantitative method was utilized to quantify intermediates formed during the oxidation of toluene under both low-NO and high-NO conditions, revealing the differential variations in oxidation products with varying levels of NOx concentration."

While it is traditionally assumed that the long-term aerosol pH levels are determined by the relative abundances of atmospheric alkaline to acidic substances (referred to as RC/A hereinafter), we observed contrasting pH─RC/A trends at different sites globally, i.e., rising alkali-to-acid ratios in the atmosphere may unexpectedly lead to increased aerosol acidity. Here, we examined this apparently counterintuitive phenomenon using the multiphase buffer theory. We show that the aerosol water content (AWC) set a pH “baseline” as the peak buffer pH, while the RC/A and particle-phase chemical compositions determine the deviation of pH from this baseline within the buffer ranges. Therefore, contrasting long-term pH trends may emerge when RC/A increases while the AWC or nitrate fraction decreases, or vice versa. Our results provided a theoretical framework for a quantitative understanding of the response of aerosol pH to variations in SO2, NOx versus NH3, and dust emissions, offering broad applications in studies on aerosol pH and the associated environmental and health effects."

We found that the OOA species measured by an iodide-based Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsol (FIGAERO-CIMS) accounted for 16 ± 13% of OA in those urban and marine locations and represented mostly the secondary and moderate-volatility portion of ambient OA. On average, 25.1% in species number and 26.8% in mass of the OOA species detected by the FIGAERO-CIMS in a winter campaign at an urban site in Wuhan, a megacity in central China, might be attributed to thermal decomposition fragments. Our results show that the volatility and precursor of ambient OOA differed systematically according to location, season, and pollution level. The OOA in the ocean atmosphere was characterized by high fractions of extremely low volatility organic compounds (ELVOC) and aliphatic species, while the inland urban OOA was characterized by aromatic species and fell primarily into the low volatility organic compounds (LVOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) range. The volatilities of OOA in the inland urban atmosphere in summer, pollution days, and daytime were lower than those in winter, clean days, and nighttime. When the PM episode developed from clean to particle growth and then to pollution period, the OOA species shifted from Low-Mw OOA species to Median-Mw OOA species and then to highly nonvolatile species. The study of ambient OOA volatility in this work also provides important data for future closure studies of SOA formation and its precursors."

Živković,Boreal Forest Fire Causes Daytime Surface Warming During Summer to Exceed Surface Cooling During Winter in North America,"Boreal wildfires modify surface climates affecting plant physiology, permafrost thaw, and carbon fluxes. Post‐fire temperatures vary over decades because of successional vegetation changes. Yet, the underlying biophysical drivers remain uncertain. Here, we quantify surface climate changes following fire disturbances in the North American boreal forest and identify its dominant biophysical drivers. We analyze multi‐year land‐atmosphere energy exchange and satellite observations from across North America and find post‐fire daytime surface temperatures to be substantially warmer for about five decades while winter temperatures are slightly cooler. Post‐fire decadal changes are characterized by decreasing leaf area index during the first decade, by sharply increasing surface albedo during the snow cover period, and by a less efficient heat exchange between the forest and the atmosphere caused by decreasing surface roughness for about 2–3 decades. Over the first three decades, the amount of energy used for evapotranspiration increases before returning to lower values. We find that surface warming is mainly explained by less efficient forest‐atmosphere heat exchange while cooling is additionally explained by increasing surface albedo. We estimate that biome‐wide daytime surface temperatures of the Canadian boreal forest in 2024 are 0.27°C warmer in the summer and 0.02°C cooler during the winter because of fire. For a scenario with a strong increase in burned area, we estimate annual warming from fire to increase by a third until 2050. Our study highlights the potential for accelerated surface warming in the boreal biome with increasing wildfire activity and disentangles the biophysical drivers of fire‐related surface climate impacts."

Whistler mode waves play a critical role in these interactions, and up to now their properties during extreme events remained poorly sampled and understood. We employ extensive databases of spacecraft observations to specify their distribution. We show that under extreme geomagnetic conditions, lower‐band whistler mode chorus waves have a net effect of accelerating ultra‐relativistic electrons, which results in an increase of fluxes at multi‐MeV energies by several orders of magnitude. During future magnetic superstorms, the radiation levels in the outer zone could therefore experience a substantial increase beyond what has been previously observed during the space age."

 Significant strides have been made in understanding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics, yet its long-lead prediction remains challenging, especially for the El Niño events after 2000. Sea surface salinity (SSS) is known to affect ENSO development and intensity by influencing ocean stratification and heat redistribution and therefore, when combined with sea surface temperature (SST) data, can potentially enhance ENSO forecast skill. In this study, we develop a deep learning (DL) model that incorporates a multiscale-pyramid structure and spatiotemporal feature extraction blocks, and the model successfully extends effective ENSO forecast lead time to 24 months for 2000–2021 with reduced effect of the spring predictability barrier (SPB). Interpretable methods are then applied to reveal the time-dependent roles of SST and SSS in ENSO forecast. More specifically, SST is critical for short-medium lead forecasts (<1 year), while SSS is important for medium-long lead forecasts (>6 months). Furthermore, we track global SST and SSS spatiotemporal shifts related to subsequent ENSO development, highlighting the importance of ocean inter-basin and tropics-extratropics interactions.

 Volcanic CO2 is widely acknowledged as an important geochemical precursor for volcanic activity; however, obtaining observations through remote sensing remains a challenge. It is well established that volcanic CO2 diffusely degases during magma ascent, and the volatiles interact with the ecosystem on the surface through CO2 fertilization, which can improve vegetation health. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a remote sensing method that quantifies vegetation health. This study compared NDVI signals from Landsat 8, MODIS, Sentinel 2, and VIIRS to soil CO2 flux signals from 5 ground-based EtnaGas stations on Mt. Etna from 2011 to 2018. Due to variances in sensor and spectral characteristics, the NDVI values were calibrated across all 4 sensors. The 2nd derivatives of NDVI and soil CO2 flux highlight the timeframes of the increase/decrease cycles of CO2 degassing, which in turn, correspond to the change in storage levels as magma rises from an intermediate chamber to a shallow one. Between 2017 and 2018, the 2nd derivative spikes showed 16 magma recharge events in both NDVI and soil CO2 signals. A flank analysis of homogenous trees across Mt. Etna showed the same 2nd derivative spike pattern for NDVI when compared to individual EtnaGas stations, indicating that trees do not have to be located within 30 m of volcano-tectonic structures to be affected by diffusely escaping volcanic CO2. This study highlights the potential of NDVI as a remote sensing method for monitoring volcanic CO2 emissions, paving the way for innovative approaches to volcanic surveillance."

Models with higher ECS project a greater extent of static stability increase hence larger HC changes. Using the best estimate of ECS with value of 3 K (∼2.5–4.0 K) to constrain the HC projection, we reveal that the constrained projection yields a 15% (11%) decrease in the weakening (poleward shift) of the HC in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere compared to the multimodel mean under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The corresponding projection uncertainty is reduced by about 77.4% and 75.6%, respectively. Our results indicate a smaller-than-expected change in the HC in response to increased CO2 concentrations."

Here we used new measurements collected over 3 years and during dust storms at a field site in a desert region in the southwestern United States to estimate the regional dust direct radiative effect. We also used novel soil mineralogy retrieved from an airborne spectrometer to estimate this parameter with model output. We find that, in this region, dust has a minimal net cooling effect on this region's climate. 
 Mineral aerosols (i.e., dust) can affect climate and weather by absorbing and scattering shortwave and longwave radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, the direct radiative effect. Yet understanding of the direct effect is so poor that the sign of the net direct effect at top of the atmosphere (TOA) is unconstrained, and thus it is unknown if dust cools or warms Earth's climate. Here we develop methods to estimate the instantaneous shortwave direct effect via observations of aerosols and radiation made over a 3-year period in a desert region of the southwestern US, obtaining a direct effect of -14±1 and -9±6 W m−2 at the surface and TOA, respectively. We also generate region-specific dust optical properties via a novel dataset of soil mineralogy from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), which are then used to model the dust direct radiative effect in the shortwave and longwave. Using this modeling method, we obtain an instantaneous shortwave direct effect of -21±7 and -1±7 W m−2. The discrepancy between the model and observational direct effect is due to stronger absorption in the model, which we interpret as an AVIRIS soil iron oxide content that is too large. Combining the shortwave observational direct effect with a modeled longwave TOA direct effect of 1±1 W m−2, we obtain an instantaneous TOA net effect of -8±6 W m−2, implying a cooling effect of dust. These findings provide a useful constraint on the dust direct effect in the southwestern United States."

The particle pH in future China is expected to rise steadily. Consequently, this reaction could become a significant source of HONO in China. Therefore, it is crucial to coordinate the control of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions to avoid a rapid increase in the particle pH. 
 HONO plays a crucial role as a precursor to OH radicals in the tropospheric atmosphere. The incongruity between HONO concentration and NOx emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic remains puzzling. Here, we show evidence from field observations of 10 sites in China where there was a noticeable increase in NH3 concentrations during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the meteorological conditions, the significant decrease in sulfate and nitrate concentrations enhanced the conversion of NH4+ to NH3. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the decrease in anion concentrations (especially sulfate and nitrate) and the increase in cation concentrations during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in particle pH. In other words, changes in the excess ammonia drove changes in particle pH that may consequently have impacted the rate of HONO formation. The calculation of reaction rates indicates that during the epidemic, the increase in pH may promote the generation of HONO by facilitating redox reactions, which highlights the importance of coordinating the control of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions."

Here we constrained the modeling results of carbonaceous aerosols by field observation in Northeast China, a historically overlooked but recently targeted region of national clean-air actions. Our study suggested that the simulation of agricultural fire emissions and secondary organic aerosols remains challenging. 
 Light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols are important contributors to both air pollution and radiative forcing. However, their abundances and sources remain poorly constrained, as can be seen from the frequently identified discrepancies between the observed and modeled results. In this study, we focused on elemental carbon (EC; as a measure of black carbon) and light-absorbing organic carbon (i.e., BrC) in Northeast China, a new targeted region of the latest clean-air actions in China. Three campaigns were conducted during 2018–2021 in Harbin, covering distinct meteorological conditions and emission features. Various analytical methods were first evaluated, and the mass concentrations of both BrC and EC were validated. The validated BrC and EC measurement results were then used for source apportionment, together with other species including tracers (e.g., levoglucosan). The observation-based results suggested that despite the frigid winter in Harbin, the formation of secondary organic carbon (SOC) was enhanced at high levels of relative humidity (RH). This enhancement could also be captured by an air quality model incorporating heterogeneous chemistry. However, the model failed to reproduce the observed abundances of SOC, with significant underestimations regardless of RH levels. In addition, agricultural fires effectively increased the observation-based primary organic carbon (POC) concentrations and POC to EC ratios. Such roles of agricultural fires were not captured by the model, pointing to substantial underestimation of open burning emissions by the inventory. This problem merits particular attention for Northeast China, given its massive agricultural sector."

Although COS at ambient levels generally has poor storage stability, our approach involves the dilution of a gas mixture containing micromole-per-mole levels of COS, the stability of which was validated for more than 1 decade. The developed system has excellent dilution performance and will facilitate accurate instrumental calibration for atmospheric COS observation. 
 Atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) has received increasing attention as a potential tracer for investigating the global carbon cycle. Owing to the irreversible photosynthetic absorption of COS, changes in the atmospheric COS mole fraction can be related to terrestrial gross primary production. However, the instability of COS in high-pressure cylinders has hampered the accurate determination of atmospheric COS. Here, we report a dynamic dilution method for generating reference gas mixtures containing COS at ambient levels (ca. 500 pmol mol−1). Our method combined a dynamic dilution system employing a high-accuracy mass flow measurement system and a dry reference gas mixture prepared gravimetrically as a parent gas mixture containing a micromole-per-mole level of COS filled in a high-pressure aluminium cylinder. The storage stability of COS at this level was experimentally validated for three gravimetrically prepared dry reference gases over a period of more than 1 decade. We evaluated the dilution performance of the developed method using a gravimetric parent gas mixture containing approximately 1 µmol mol−1 of COS and chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). Excellent repeatability (0.2 % for COS and 0.4 % for HCFC-22 in terms of relative standard deviation; RSD), reproducibility (COS: 0.1 %; HCFC-22: 0.3 %), and dilution linearity (R2>0.99 for both COS and HCFC-22) were obtained and were corroborated by the nearly constant ratio of the normalized gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) response of COS to HCFC-22. The dilution accuracy was examined by comparing the determined HCFC-22 mole fractions in a dynamically diluted parent gas mixture from a mass flow rate measurement system and GC/MS calibrated using a gravimetrically diluted parent gas mixture. The mole fractions of HCFC-22 from these two methods agreed within an acceptable difference of approximately 2 pmol mol−1, validating the dilution accuracy of the developed method. By re-evaluating the experimental data, we determined the mole fractions of COS and HCFC-22 in an ambient-air-based reference gas mixture, with relative standard deviations of 0.1 % for COS and 0.3 % for HCFC-22. These results demonstrated that the developed method can accurately generate reference gas mixtures containing COS at ambient levels, which we expect will support long-term observations of atmospheric COS."

 This study presents advancements in the processing of satellite remote sensing data, focusing mainly on aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). The transformation of Level-2 (L2) data, which includes atmospheric-state retrievals, into higher-quality Level-3 (L3) data is crucial in remote sensing. Our contributions lie in two novel improvements to the processing algorithm. First, we improve the inverse-distance-weighting algorithm by incorporating quality flag information into the weight calculation. By assigning weights that are inversely proportional to the number of unreliable grids, the method can provide more accurate L3 products. We validate this approach through simulation studies and apply it to GEMS AOD data across various regions and wavelengths. The use of quality flags in the algorithm can provide a more accurate analysis of remote sensing. Second, we employ a spatiotemporal merging method to address both spatial and temporal variability in AOD data, a departure from previous approaches that solely focused on spatial variability. Our method considers temporal variations spanning previous time intervals. Furthermore, the computed mean fields show similar spatiotemporal patterns to previous studies, confirming their ability to capture real-world phenomena. Lastly, utilizing this procedure, we compute the mean field estimates for GEMS AOD data, which can provide a deeper understanding of the impact of aerosols on climate change and public health."
10.1021/acs.est.4c01509,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇研究论文主要关注欧洲多个国家人群中外部暴露组的社会经济不平等问题。研究者利用来自七个欧洲国家超过2500万人的数据，分析了空气污染、建筑环境和气温等外部暴露因素，并使用主成分分析法对外部暴露组进行了降维处理。研究发现，空气污染和建筑环境的暴露模式在不同国家之间存在一致性，但气温的变异性则存在区域差异。此外，研究还发现，个人和区域层面的社会经济因素（如教育、收入和失业率）对城市暴露组的影响存在显著差异。该研究结果表明，欧洲不同地区的环境健康不平等存在区域差异，需要针对不同地区采取相应的干预措施。研究中使用的空气污染和气温数据可能来自卫星观测或地面监测站，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['air pollution', 'air temperature', 'satellite observations', 'environmental health', 'socioeconomic inequalities']",Apolline Saucy;Fabián Coloma;Sergio Olmos;Christofer Åström;Natalia Blay;Jolanda M.A. Boer;Payam Dadvand;Jeroen de Bont;Rafael de Cid;Kees de Hoogh;Konstantina Dimakopoulou;Ulrike Gehring;Anke Huss;Dorina Ibi;Klea Katsouyanni;Gerard Koppelman;Petter Ljungman;Erik Melén;Mark Nieuwenhuijsen;Federica Nobile;Annette Peters;Regina Pickford;Roel Vermeulen;Danielle Vienneau;Jelle Vlaanderen;Kathrin Wolf;Zhebin Yu;Evangelia Samoli;Massimo Stafoggia;Cathryn Tonne,Socioeconomic Inequalities in the External Exposome in European Cohorts: The EXPANSE Project,"Socioeconomic inequalities in the exposome have been found to be complex and highly context-specific, but studies have not been conducted in large population-wide cohorts from multiple countries. This study aims to examine the external exposome, encompassing individual and environmental factors influencing health over the life course, and to perform dimension reduction to derive interpretable characterization of the external exposome for multicountry epidemiological studies. Analyzing data from over 25 million individuals across seven European countries including 12 administrative and traditional cohorts, we utilized domain-specific principal component analysis (PCA) to define the external exposome, focusing on air pollution, the built environment, and air temperature. We conducted linear regression to estimate the association between individual- and area-level socioeconomic position and each domain of the external exposome. Consistent exposure patterns were observed within countries, indicating the representativeness of traditional cohorts for air pollution and the built environment. However, cohorts with limited geographical coverage and Southern European countries displayed lower temperature variability, especially in the cold season, compared to Northern European countries and cohorts including a wide range of urban and rural areas. The individual- and area-level socioeconomic determinants (i.e., education, income, and unemployment rate) of the urban exposome exhibited significant variability across the European region, with area-level indicators showing stronger associations than individual variables. While the PCA approach facilitated common interpretations of the external exposome for air pollution and the built environment, it was less effective for air temperature. The diverse socioeconomic determinants suggest regional variations in environmental health inequities, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions across European countries."

Organofluorine compounds are known primarily with respect to the notorious poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and as potent greenhouse gases that can impact the climate. The use of targeted methods for every organofluorine compound in the environment is not feasible. While methods are available for TF analysis of condensed phase samples, no technique exists for gas phase TF measurements (TFg). Herein we demonstrate an in situ instrumental method for TFg via platinum catalyzed thermolysis at 1000 °C in the presence of propane. TFg is fully converted into HF and subsequently quantified by an ion selective electrode or ion chromatography for F–. The method was validated using nine organofluorine compounds with differing functional groups. We characterized TFg and compared it to common speciated measurements in the headspace of four commercial fluorosurfactants and outdoor air. Most TFg (65.0–99.8% or 1.5–10.2 ppmv F) in the fluorosurfactant headspace was unknown. In outdoor air, >50% of TFg (7.2–24.2 ppmv F) was unknown. These high quantities of unknown organofluorine indicate a measurement gap in the gas phase, which could have important implications for atmospheric sources and the burdens of PFAS and fluorinated greenhouse gases."

We report the first ground‐based tropospheric iodine monoxide (IO) radical observations over the central continental United States. Throughout April 2022, IO columns above Storm Peak Laboratory, Colorado (3,220 m.a.s.l.) ranged from 0.7 ± 0.5 to 3.6 ± 0.5 × 1012 (average: 1.9 × 1012 molec cm−2). IO was consistently elevated in air masses transported from over the Pacific Ocean. The observed IO columns were up to three times higher and the range was larger than predicted by a global model, which warrants further investigation into iodine sources, sinks, ozone loss, and particle formation. IO mixing ratios increased with altitude. At the observed levels, iodine may be competitive with bromine as an oxidant of elemental mercury at cold temperatures typical of the free troposphere. Iodine‐induced mercury oxidation is missing in atmospheric models, understudied, and helps explain model underestimation of oxidized mercury measurements."

However, the reasons remain uncertain. The Last Interglacial (LIG) climate provides a potential analog for future warming. Investigating ISMR responses to these two warming scenarios could help understand the causes of ISMR changes. Using PMIP4 simulations, we find that ISMR became “wetter and more stable” during the LIG, contrasting the future climate. The opposing changes in ISMR variability are related to divergent changes in the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) amplitudes, ENSO‐ISMR relationships, and ENSO‐induced large‐scale atmospheric circulation anomalies. During the LIG, orbital forcing weakened ENSO variability and its impacts on ISMR. A westward positioning of ENSO shifted the atmospheric circulation anomalies westward, suppressing extreme ISMR anomalies. These processes are supported by atmospheric model simulations. Our results suggest that different warming patterns (dynamic effects) are more critical than moisture‐increasing effects in controlling regional climate variability."

Here, we introduce a machine learning–based anomaly detection scheme called SPEEDe, which processes a two‐dimensional precipitation field into a re‐estimated precipitation field that can be compared with the input. Large differences identify IMERG fields with bad orbit data, separating most of the bad cases from the good cases. When modified to process the passive microwave inputs, SPEEDe can pick out orbits with bad data, enabling quality control on these IMERG inputs. SPEEDe works by producing a locally realistic‐looking precipitation field when given unphysical data, which results in a larger‐than‐normal difference between the input and the output. SPEEDe is implemented as an automated quality control for GPM precipitation products."

Ekman;Rodrigo Caballero,Moisture and Aerosols as Key Drivers of the Turbulent State of Arctic Mixed‐Phase Clouds During Idealized Moist Intrusions,"Previous studies have shown that low‐level mixed‐phase clouds that form during idealized moist intrusions into the Arctic can exist in either a stable (stratus) or a convective (stratocumulus) state. Here, we examine the conditions that promote a transition from the stable to the convective state through idealized simulations using a three‐dimensional large‐eddy simulation model coupled with a one‐dimensional multilayer sea ice model. We find that the vertical distribution of the initial dew point temperature (Td) profile fundamentally influences whether a transition between the two states occurs or not. If the initial moisture content of the advected airmass decreases rapidly with height, then a turbulent transition is likely to occur and a stratocumulus cloud can form. However, the availability and properties of aerosols as well as the cloud ice content can delay or even prevent stratocumulus formation, regardless if the conditions in terms of the initial Td profile are favorable. A low cloud ice water content promotes a stably stratified cloud layer and delays the transition. Furthermore, if no cloud condensation nuclei are available at the base of the cloud when a cloud‐layer instability forms, then there is no new droplet formation, the buoyancy remains low and the cloud remains as a stratus. Our results suggest that the low‐level mixed‐phase cloud evolution and the thermodynamic transition of an airmass during a moist intrusion into the Arctic are closely linked to the aerosol processing by the cloud, that is, a chemical transformation, and that the two processes should be considered simultaneously."

Parker;Linette Boisvert,Summer snow on Arctic sea ice modulated by the Arctic Oscillation,"Summer snow accumulation and its albedo effect on Arctic sea ice are controlled by the Arctic Oscillation atmospheric circulation pattern, according to a combined modelling and remote sensing analysis. 
 Since the 1970s, Arctic sea ice has undergone unprecedented change, becoming thinner, less extensive and less resilient to summer melt. Snow’s high albedo greatly reduces solar absorption in sea ice and the upper ocean, which mitigates sea–ice melt and ocean warming. However, the drivers of summertime snow depth variability are unknown. The Arctic Oscillation is a mode of natural climate variability, influencing Arctic snowfall and air temperatures. Thus, it may affect summertime snow conditions on Arctic sea ice. Here we examine the role of the Arctic Oscillation in summer snow depth variability on Arctic sea ice in 1980–2020 using atmospheric reanalysis, snow modelling and satellite data. The positive phase leads to greater snow accumulation, ranging up to ~4.5 cm near the North Pole, and higher surface albedo in summer. There are more intense, frequent Arctic cyclones, cooler temperatures aloft and greater snowfall relative to negative and neutral phases; these conditions facilitate a more persistent summer snow cover, which may lessen sea-ice melt and ocean warming. The Arctic Oscillation influence on summertime snow weakens after 2007, which suggests that future warming and Arctic sea-ice loss might modify the relationship between the Arctic Oscillation and snow on Arctic sea ice. Summer snow accumulation and its albedo effect on Arctic sea ice are controlled by the Arctic Oscillation atmospheric circulation pattern, according to a combined modelling and remote sensing analysis."

OA composition transitioned from being primarily SOCs before wet processes to NOCs after wet processes. Further molecular fragments identification suggested SOCs mainly comprised glycolic acid sulfate formed by aqueous-phase processing during the entire observation, and aromatic- and monoterpene-derived SOCs formed by photochemical processing before snowfall. NOCs species were diverse and dominated by highly oxidized amides and amino acids mainly produced by photochemical processing.

Drivers of this seasonality, particularly the role of water availability, remain debated. We introduce satellite-based ecophysiological indicators to demonstrate that Amazon rainforests are constrained by water during dry seasons despite light-driven canopy greening. Evidence includes a shifted partitioning of photosynthetically active radiation toward more isoprene emissions and synchronized declines in leaf and xylem water potentials. In addition, we find that convective storms attenuate light-driven ecosystem greening in the late dry season and then reverse to net leaf loss in the wet season, improving rainforest leaf area predictability by 24 to 31%.

Recent studies have suggested that the characteristics of phasic evolutions in the relationship between the Arctic warming and midlatitudes remain elusive. Therefore, this study systematically investigates this issue by using running empirical orthogonal function and moving correlation, and the results show a phasic alternation process in the relationship between the tropospheric thickness over the Barents–Kara Seas (BKS) and East Asian temperature, characterized by a phasic weak (P1: 1979–2000)–strong (P2: 2001–2011)–weak (P3: 2012–2021) connection.

Moreover, it is found that changes of the connection between the BKS warming and the East Asian winter Monsoon may contribute to this phasic evolution, and the Arctic Oscillation plays an important role in modulating their phasic evolutions.

The methodology applied used ozonesondes (SHADOZ/NASA) and satellite data (TIMED/SABER), as well as analysis with ground-based and satellite instruments, allowing a more in-depth study at both latitudes. The main motivation is to understand how latitudinal differences in the observation of ozone content can interfere with the behavior of this trace gas. 
 The behavior of ozone gas (O3) in the atmosphere varies according to the region of the globe. Its formation occurs mainly in the tropical stratosphere through the photodissociation of molecular oxygen with the aid of the incidence of ultraviolet solar radiation. Still, the highest concentrations of O3 content are found in high-latitude regions (poles) due to the Brewer–Dobson circulation, a large-scale circulation that takes place from the tropics to the pole in the winter hemisphere. This work presents a multi-instrumental analysis at two Brazilian sites, a subtropical one (Santa Maria – 29.72° S, 53.41° W) and an equatorial one (Natal – 5.4° S, 35.4° W), to investigate ozone distributions in terms of vertical profiles (2002–2020) and total abundance in terms of total columns of ozone (1979–2020). The study is based on the use of ground-based and satellite observations. Ozone profiles over Natal, from the ground up to the mesosphere, are obtained by radiosonde experiments (0–30 km) in the framework of the SHADOZ program and by satellite measurements from the SABER instrument (15–60 km). This enabled the construction of a continuous time series for ozone, including monthly values and climatological trends. There is a good agreement between the two measurements in the common observation layer, mainly for altitudes above 20 km. Below 20 km, SABER ozone profiles showed high variability and overestimated ozone mixing ratios by over 50 %. Dynamic and photochemical effects can interfere with O3 formation and distribution along higher latitudes through the Brewer–Dobson circulation. The measurements of the total ozone columns used are in good agreement with each other (TOMS/OMI × Dobson for Natal and TOMS/OMI × Brewer for Santa Maria) in time and space, in line with previous studies for these latitudes. Wavelet analysis was used over 42 years. The investigation revealed a significant annual cycle in both data series for both sites. The study highlighted that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) plays a significant role in the variability of stratospheric ozone at the two study sites – Natal and Santa Maria. The QBO's contribution was found to be stronger at the Equator (Natal) than at the subtropics (Santa Maria). Additionally, the study showed that the 11-year solar cycle also has a significant impact on ozone variability at both locations. Given the study latitudes, the ozone variations observed at the two sites showed different patterns and amounts. Only a limited number of studies have been conducted on stratospheric ozone in South America, particularly in the region between the Equator and the subtropics. The primary aim of this work is to investigate the behavior of stratospheric ozone at various altitudes and latitudes using ground-based and satellite measurements in terms of vertical profiles and total columns of ozone."

Yang et al. (2024) indicated a shift or transition from warm‐dry extremes (WDEs), common in non‐ice‐covered areas, to warm‐wet extremes (WWEs) in ice‐covered zones. Utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, this study determined the duration and frequency of WDEs and WWEs across ice‐covered and non‐ice‐covered regions. A comprehensive analysis uncovers the physical mechanisms responsible for the paradigm differences and attributes them to the weakening of land‐atmosphere interaction caused by ice‐cover, which inhibits soil moisture feedback and reduces the intensity and duration of warm events in ice‐covered areas. Both WDEs and WWEs are associated with high‐pressure systems (HPs). WDEs, situated directly beneath HPs, intensify due to adiabatic warming from subsidence motions. Conversely, WWEs, located beneath the poleward fringes of HPs, emerge from advective warming and moistening associated with poleward intrusions of warm‐moist air."

Nonetheless, disentangling the specific impacts of dust from the overlying meteorology influence on high clouds presents great challenges. In this study, we construct a meteorological pattern that successfully reveal the intricate connection between high cloud distribution and atmospheric conditions. Through this strong bounded relationship, we find that dust exhibits notable controls over the facilitation or inhibition of ice particle growth contingent upon the prevailing meteorological fields. More dust can increase precipitation rate and shorten high cloud lifetime particularly under favorable meteorology. These findings underscore the crucial role of dust concentration in mitigating global warming for future climate change."

Wright;Zengyuan Guo;Wenyu Huang;Yiran Peng,Effects of Anthropogenic Aerosols on the East Asian Winter Monsoon,"Circulation patterns linked to the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) affect precipitation, surface temperature, and air quality extremes over East Asia. These circulation patterns can in turn be influenced by aerosol radiative and microphysical effects through diabatic heating and its impacts on atmospheric vorticity. Using global model simulations, we investigate the effects of anthropogenic aerosol emissions and concentration changes on the intensity and variability of the EAWM. Comparison with reanalysis products indicates that the model captures the mean state of the EAWM well. The experiments indicate that anthropogenic aerosol emissions strengthen the Siberian High but weaken the East Asian jet stream, making the land areas of East Asia colder, drier, and snowier. Aerosols reduce mean surface air temperatures by approximately 1.5° $1.5{}^{\circ}$C, comparable to about half of the difference between strong and weak EAWM episodes in the control simulation. The mechanisms behind these changes are evaluated by analyzing differences in the potential vorticity budget. Anthropogenic aerosol effects on diabatic heating strengthen anomalous subsidence over southern East Asia, establishing an anticyclonic circulation anomaly that suppresses deep convection and precipitation. Aerosol effects on cloud cover and cloud longwave radiative heating weaken stability over the eastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau, intensifying upslope flow along the western side of the anticyclone. Both circulation anomalies contribute to reducing surface air temperatures through regional impacts on thermal advection and the atmospheric radiative balance."

As part of the Salt Lake regional Smoke, Ozone and Aerosol Study (SAMOZA), 35 VOCs were measured with two methods: a proton‐transfer‐reaction time‐of‐flight mass spectrometer (PTR‐ToF‐MS) and 2,4‐dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridges analyzed by high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Over two months, the total measured VOCs averaged 32 ± 24 ppb (mean ± standard deviation) with the hourly maximum at 141 ppb, and the total calculated OH reactivity averaged 3.7 ± 3.0 s−1 (maximum at 20.7 s−1). Among them, methanol and ethanol were the most abundant VOCs, making up 42% of the ambient mixing ratio. Isoprene and monoterpenes contributed 25% of the OH reactivity from VOCs, while formaldehyde and acetaldehyde made up another 30%. The positive matrix factorization analysis showed 5 major sources of VOCs, with 32% of abundance being attributed to secondary production/biogenic sources, 44% from the combination of traffic and personal care products, 15% from industrial solvent use, and the rest from biomass burning (10%). Moderate smoke‐impacted days elevated various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) on average by 45%–217% compared to smoke‐free days. The ratio of OH reactivity from NOx to that from VOCs showed that ozone production was mostly VOC‐limited throughout the campaign, consistent with our modeling study. VOCs and NOx both showed increased OH reactivity due to smoke influence. NOx featured increased reactivity on weekdays compared to weekends, an effect not shown for VOC reactivity during SAMOZA."

An average 1.5 TC (of any intensity) per year was observed over the Western Arabian Sea, with two asymmetrical seasons, namely May–June (30% of cyclonic days) and September–December (70%). Case studies reveal that in many instances, TC‐related rainfall extends beyond 500 km from the TC center, and that substantial rains occur one to 2 days after the lifecycle of the TC. Despite their rarity, in the otherwise arid to semi‐arid context characteristic of the region, TCs contribute in both seasons to a very high percentage of total rainfall (up to 30%–60%) over the northwestern Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden and their coastlines. Over inland northern Somalia, contributions are much lower. TCs disproportionately contribute to some of the most intense daily falls, which are often higher than the mean annual rainfall. A strong increase in the number of TCs is found from 1990 to 2020, hence their enhanced contribution to local rainfall. This increase is associated with a warmer eastern/southern Arabian Sea, a decrease in vertical wind shear, and a strong increase in tropospheric moisture content."

However, these studies using diverse data sources and methods over various periods show inconsistencies regarding the location of this increase ‐ whether in the TC inner core or outer regions ‐ and offer differing explanations for the reported trends. This study uses the Pseudo‐global warming methodology on simulations of 117 western North Pacific TCs making landfall in Southeast Asia to investigate changes in TC rainfall structure by the end of the century under the SSP2‐4.5 and SSP3‐7.0 scenarios. Specifically, it tests the sensitivity of changing trends to various analysis methods used in previous studies and identifies the underlying physical mechanisms driving these changes. The findings indicate an amplified increase in rainfall in the TC inner core across all future scenarios, along with potentially decreased rainfall in the outer region under certain future climate conditions. Among TC categories, Supertyphoons exhibit the most significant increased rainfall across future states. Changes in TC primary and secondary circulations, TC structure, and the convergence of heat and moisture are the main factors shaping future rainfall patterns, outweighing the effects of changes in atmospheric and convective stability."

 Oxidized Organic Aerosol (OOA), a major component of fine atmospheric particles, impacts climate and human health. Previous experiments and atmospheric models emphasize the importance of nocturnal OOA formation from NO3· oxidation of biogenic VOCs. This seasonal study extends the understanding by showing that nocturnal oxidation of biomass-burning emissions can account for up to half of total OOA production in fall and winter. It is the first to distinguish nocturnal OOA characteristics from daytime OOA across all seasons using bulk aerosol measurements. Summer observations of nocturnal OOA align well with regional chemistry transport model predictions, but discrepancies in other seasons reveal a common model deficiency in representing biomass-burning emissions and their nocturnal oxidation. This study underscores the significance of near-ground nocturnal OOA production, proposes a method to differentiate it using bulk aerosol measurements, and suggests model optimization strategies. These findings enhance the understanding and prediction of nighttime OOA formation."

 Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite observations and weather modeling has been widely used for investigating Earth surface-atmosphere energy exchange and radiation budget. However, satellite-derived LST has a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions and missing observations caused by clouds, while there are limitations such as potential bias and expensive computation in model calibration and simulation for weather modeling. To mitigate those limitations, we proposed a WRFM framework to estimate LST at a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of an hour by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and MODIS satellite data using the morphing technique. We tested the framework in eight counties, Iowa, USA, including urban and rural areas, to generate hourly LSTs from June 1st to August 31st, 2019, at a 1 km resolution. Upon evaluation with in-situ LST measurements, our WRFM framework has demonstrated its ability to capture hourly LSTs under both clear and cloudy conditions, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.63 K and 3.75 K, respectively. Additionally, the assessment with satellite LST observations has shown that the WRFM framework can effectively reduce the bias magnitude in LST from the WRF simulation, resulting in a reduction of the average RMSE over the study area from 4.34 K (daytime) and 4.12 K (nighttime) to 2.89 K (daytime) and 2.75 K (nighttime), respectively, while still capturing the hourly patterns of LST. Overall, the WRFM is effective in integrating the complementary advantages of satellite observations and weather modeling and can generate LSTs with high spatiotemporal resolutions in areas with complex landscapes (e.g., urban)."

Our results show the potential of TROPOMI to quantify methane emissions from various sources rather than big emitters from space after objectively excluding the artifacts in the retrieval. 
 An improved divergence method has been developed to estimate annual methane (CH4) emissions from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations. It has been applied to the period of 2018 to 2021 over the Middle East, where the orography is complicated, and the mean mixing ratio of methane (XCH4) might be affected by albedos or aerosols over some locations. To adapt to extreme changes of terrain over mountains or coasts, winds are used with their divergent part removed. A temporal filter is introduced to identify highly variable emissions and to further exclude fake sources caused by retrieval artifacts. We compare our results to widely used bottom-up anthropogenic emission inventories: Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), Community Emissions Data System (CEDS), and Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) over several regions representing various types of sources. The NOx emissions are from EDGAR and Daily Emissions Constrained by Satellite Observations (DECSO), and the industrial heat sources identified by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are further used to better understand our resulting methane emissions. Our results indicate possibly large underestimations of methane emissions in metropolises like Tehran (up to 50 %) and Isfahan (up to 70 %) in Iran. The derived annual methane emissions from oil/gas production near the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan are comparable to GFEI but more than 2 times higher than EDGAR and CEDS in 2019. Large discrepancies in the distribution of methane sources in Riyadh and its surrounding areas are found between EDGAR, CEDS, GFEI, and our emissions. The methane emission from oil/gas production to the east of Riyadh seems to be largely overestimated by EDGAR and CEDS, while our estimates as well as GFEI and DECSO NOx indicate much lower emissions from industrial activities. On the other hand, regions like Iran, Iraq, and Oman are dominated by sources from oil and gas exploitation that probably include more irregular releases of methane, with the result that our estimates, which include only invariable sources, are lower than the bottom-up emission inventories."

However, since global observations of eddy dynamics come from satellite altimetry maps that smooth eddies and distort their geometry, the strength of this cascade is underestimated. Here, we use deep learning to improve observational estimates of global surface geostrophic currents and explore the implications for the cascade. By synthesizing multi‐modal satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH) and temperature, we achieve up to a 30% improvement in spatial resolution over the community‐standard SSH product. This reveals numerous strongly interacting eddies that were previously obscured by smoothing. In many regions, these newly resolved eddies lead to nearly an order‐of‐magnitude increase in the upscale kinetic energy cascade that peaks in spring and is strong enough to drive the seasonality of large mesoscale eddies. Our study suggests that deep learning can be a powerful paradigm for satellite oceanography."

We show that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes during these dense cloud crossings lasting ∼105 years.

Based on space and aircraft observations, TGFs have been considered rare phenomena produced in association with very few lightning discharges. Space observations associated with lightning ground observations in the radio band have indicated that there exists a population of dimmer TGFs.

The TGFs were found through Monte Carlo modeling to be associated with 1015–1012 photons at source, which is several orders of magnitude below what can be seen from space.

This study used the IBIS‐CH4 (Integrated BIosphere Simulator‐Methane) model, a process‐based model integrating microbial mechanisms associated with CH4 production and oxidation processes, to simulate global wetland CH4 emissions from 2001 to 2020. Initially, we employed the IBIS‐CH4 model to evaluate its performance across 26 diverse wetland sites worldwide. The results showed that the magnitude and seasonality of observed CH4 fluxes over various wetland sites were well reproduced. We then used this model to estimate the annual global wetland CH4 emissions from 2001 to 2020, averaging 152.67 Tg CH4 yr−1, with a range of 135.72–167.57 Tg CH4 yr−1. The estimated global wetland CH4 emissions are generally in agreement with the current bottom‐up estimates (117–256 Tg CH4 yr−1) and closely overlap with independent top‐down estimates (139–183 Tg CH4 yr−1). During 2001–2020, the estimated global wetland CH4 emissions initially showed an increasing trend, followed by a decline. The peak of CH4 emissions reached in 2010, coinciding with the peak of wetland area.

 Accurate estimation of regional-scale evapotranspiration (ET) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is crucial for scientific and rational water resource management, agricultural irrigation decision-making, and ecosystem monitoring. Currently, the estimation of ETo or ET still mainly relies on observational data from surface meteorological stations or flux towers. However, due to the complexity of parameters and models, as well as the uneven distribution of observation stations, there is significant uncertainty in the estimation of ETo or ET. We have developed a semi-empirical model based on Fick's law and the optimal stomatal behavior model by combining vegetation photosynthesis indicators and meteorological parameters. We compared the potential of using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and the product of NIRv and photosynthetically active radiation (NIRvP) to estimate ETo and ET. The results indicate that NIRvP×VPD0.5 (the 0.5th power of vapor pressure deficit) has an advantage in estimating ETo. Additionally, in nonlinear models, the accuracy of estimating ET using NIRvP and VPD0.5 surpasses that of using SIF. We also revealed that temperature and atmospheric pressure are the main factors mediating the relationship between NIRvP×VPD0.5 and ETo, as well as between NIRvP and ET. The research results lay the foundation for providing more accurate and reliable methods for estimating vegetation evapotranspiration."

Here we evaluate the limiting physical constraints, for three types of systems: two- and three-dimensional infrastructure and atmospheric oxidation enhancement, focusing on removing low ( 1000 ppm) and ambient ( 2 ppm) methane from air. With the space velocities and removal efficiencies of current three-dimensional technologies, volumes of 7–350 km3 are required to remove 1 Tg CH4 yr−1. Two-dimensional solutions are limited by the transport rate of methane to a surface. If every molecule of methane that collides with the surface is removed, an area of 1130 km2 is needed to remove 1 Tg CH4 yr−1 at ambient concentration. However, research shows that per-collision reaction probabilities are 10−8 requiring a surface area of 1010–1015 km2. Finally, we examine atmospheric oxidation enhancement, where 4.8 Tg yr−1 of Cl or 8.8 Tg yr−1 of OH is required to remove 1 Tg CH4 yr−1, with precursors such as H2O2 or O3. However, limitations arise concerning multiple environmental impacts. We conclude that the physical and practical constraints are considerable, and identify the main barriers that must be addressed."

While traditional dynamic and empirical models suffer from systematic errors due to nonlinear processes, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are nonlinear in nature and have demonstrated remarkable El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and IOD forecasting skills based on oceanic predictors, particularly sea surface temperature and heat content. However, it is difficult to measure heat content and easily introduces uncertainties, prompting the need to explore atmospheric predictors for IOD forecasts. Based on sensitivity prediction experiments, we identified the sea level pressure (SLP) signal as a crucial predictor, which forecasts IOD at a 7 month lead. In addition, the CNN model improves monthly forecasting accuracy while reducing errors by 13.43%. Utilizing the heatmap analysis, we elucidated that the multi-seasonal predictability of the IOD primarily originates from mid-latitude climate variability. Besides ENSO signals in the Pacific Ocean, our study highlights the significant impact of remote climate forcing in the South Indian Ocean, tropical North Indian Ocean, and Northwest Pacific Ocean on IOD forecasts. By introducing the SLP precursor and extratropical zones into IOD forecasts, our study offers fresh insights into the underlying dynamics of IOD evolution."

Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study reveals a close linkage of the variability of spring (April–May) vegetation in MHA to the winter (December–January–February) Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. When the winter PNA pattern lies in the positive phase, the NDVI tends to decrease in most parts of the MHA region during the following spring. Further analysis suggests that the lagged influence of winter PNA on spring atmospheric circulations and hence the vegetation in MHA is accomplished by the stratospheric pathway. The positive PNA phase can enhance the upward transport of wave energy into the stratosphere over the high latitudes in winter through the linear constructive interference of zonal wavenumber 1 (WN1), consequently leading to a weaker polar vortex in the stratosphere during February-March. Subsequently, the weakened polar vortex signal propagates downward from the stratosphere to the troposphere, inducing the negative Arctic Oscillation-like circulation with an anomalous cyclonic circulation dominating the MHA region in spring. The anomalous cyclonic circulation further cools the surface air temperature in MHA via modulating downward solar radiation and temperature advection, resulting in a decrease of spring NDVI in situ."

Ryerson;Gregory J. Frost;Brian C. McDonald;Owen R. Cooper,Tropical tropospheric ozone distribution and trends from in situ and satellite data,"The study examines tropical tropospheric ozone changes. In situ data from 1994–2019 display increased ozone, notably over India, Southeast Asia, and Malaysia and Indonesia. Sparse in situ data limit trend detection for the 15-year period. In situ and satellite data, with limited sampling, struggle to consistently detect trends. Continuous observations are vital over the tropical Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, western Africa, and South Asia for accurate ozone trend estimation in these regions. 
 Tropical tropospheric ozone (TTO) is important for the global radiation budget because the longwave radiative effect of tropospheric ozone is higher in the tropics than midlatitudes. In recent decades the TTO burden has increased, partly due to the ongoing shift of ozone precursor emissions from midlatitude regions toward the Equator. In this study, we assess the distribution and trends of TTO using ozone profiles measured by high-quality in situ instruments from the IAGOS (In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System) commercial aircraft, the SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes) network, and the ATom (Atmospheric Tomographic Mission) aircraft campaign, as well as six satellite records reporting tropical tropospheric column ozone (TTCO): TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), OMI/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS)/Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI)/Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME2). With greater availability of ozone profiles across the tropics we can now demonstrate that tropical India is among the most polluted regions (e.g., western Africa, tropical South Atlantic, Southeast Asia, Malaysia and Indonesia), with present-day 95th percentile ozone values reaching 80 nmol mol−1 in the lower free troposphere, comparable to midlatitude regions such as northeastern China and Korea. In situ observations show that TTO increased between 1994 and 2019, with the largest mid- and upper-tropospheric increases above India, Southeast Asia, and Malaysia and Indonesia (from 3.4 ± 0.8 to 6.8 ± 1.8 nmol mol−1 decade−1), reaching 11 ± 2.4 and 8 ± 0.8 nmol mol−1 decade−1 close to the surface (India and Malaysia–Indonesia, respectively). The longest continuous satellite records only span 2004–2019 but also show increasing ozone across the tropics when their full sampling is considered, with maximum trends over Southeast Asia of 2.31 ± 1.34 nmol mol−1 decade−1 (OMI) and 1.69 ± 0.89 nmol mol−1 decade−1 (OMI/MLS). In general, the sparsely sampled aircraft and ozonesonde records do not detect the 2004–2019 ozone increase, which could be due to the genuine trends on this timescale being masked by the additional uncertainty resulting from sparse sampling. The fact that the sign of the trends detected with satellite records changes above three IAGOS regions, when their sampling frequency is limited to that of the in situ observations, demonstrates the limitations of sparse in situ sampling strategies. This study exposes the need to maintain and develop high-frequency continuous observations (in situ and remote sensing) above the tropical Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, western Africa, and South Asia in order to estimate accurate and precise ozone trends for these regions. In contrast, Southeast Asia and Malaysia–Indonesia are regions with such strong increases in ozone that the current in situ sampling frequency is adequate to detect the trends on a relatively short 15-year timescale."

We unravel source contributions to INPs in the eastern Mediterranean and find that biological particles are important, regardless of their origin. The parameterizations developed exhibit superior performance and enable models to consider biological-particle effects on INPs. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) are one of the most uncertain drivers of the hydrological cycle and climate change. A synergy of in situ, remote-sensing and modelling experiments were used to determine the source of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) for MPCs at Mount Helmos in the eastern Mediterranean. The influences of boundary layer turbulence, vertical aerosol distributions and meteorological conditions were also examined. When the observation site is in the free troposphere (FT), approximately 1 in ×106 aerosol particles serve as INPs around −25 °C. The INP abundance spans 3 orders of magnitude and increases in the following order: marine aerosols; continental aerosols; and, finally, dust plumes. Biological particles are important INPs observed in continental and marine aerosols, whereas they play a secondary, although important, role during Saharan dust events. Air masses in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) show both enriched INP concentrations and a higher proportion of INPs to total aerosol particles, compared with cases in the FT. The presence of precipitation/clouds enriches INPs in the FT but decreases INPs in the PBL. Additionally, new INP parameterizations are developed that incorporate the ratio of fluorescent-to-nonfluorescent or coarse-to-fine particles and predict >90 % of the observed INPs within an uncertainty range of a factor of 10; these new parameterizations exhibit better performance than current widely used parameterizations and allow ice formation in models to respond to variations in dust and biological particles. The improved parameterizations can help MPC formation simulations in regions with various INP sources or different regions with prevailing INP sources."

We find strong warming and drying effects due to the ozone-induced inhibition on plant stomatal conductance, especially over polluted regions such as the eastern US and China. These climatic perturbations further enhance surface ozone by decreasing dry deposition but reduce aerosol optical depth by increasing cloudiness and the drought tendency. 
 The coupling between surface ozone (O3) and vegetation significantly influences the regional to global climate. O3 uptake by plant stomata inhibits the photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, impacting evapotranspiration through land surface ecosystems. Using a climate–vegetation–chemistry coupled model (the NASA GISS ModelE2 coupled with the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere, or ModelE2-YIBs), we assess the global climatic responses to O3–vegetation interactions during the boreal summer of the present day (2005–2014). High O3 pollution reduces stomatal conductance, resulting in warmer and drier conditions worldwide. The most significant responses are found in the eastern US and eastern China, where the surface air temperature increases by +0.33 ± 0.87 and +0.56 ± 0.38 °C, respectively. These temperature increases are accompanied by decreased latent heat and increased sensible heat in both regions. The O3–vegetation interaction also affects atmospheric pollutants. The surface maximum daily 8 h average O3 concentrations increase by +1.46 ± 3.02 ppbv in eastern China and +1.15 ± 1.77 ppbv in the eastern US due to the O3-induced inhibition of stomatal uptake. With reduced atmospheric stability following a warmer climate, increased cloud cover but decreased relative humidity jointly reduce aerosol optical depth by −0.06 ± 0.01 (−14.67 ± 12.15 %) over eastern China. This study suggests that vegetation feedback should be considered for a more accurate assessment of climatic perturbations caused by tropospheric O3."

It will be seen that the ESGF Virtual Aggregation provides a sustainable solution to some of the problems encountered in producing analysis ready data, without the cost of data replication to different formats, albeit at the cost of more data movement within the analysis than some alternatives. If heavily used, it may also require more ESGF data servers than are currently deployed in data node deployments.

Here, we report contrasting tree-ring Hg records in three collocated conifer species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and European larch (Larix decidua), which are from a remote boreal forest. Centennial atmospheric Hg trends at the site, derived from varved lake sediments, peats, and atmospheric monitoring, indicated a steady rise from the 1800s, peaking in the 1970s, and then declining. Prior to ca. 2005, larch and spruce tree rings reproduced the peak in the atmospheric Hg trend, while pine tree rings peaked in the 1930s, likely due to the prolonged sapwood period and ambiguity in the heartwood–sapwood boundary of pine. Since ca. 2005, tree rings from all species showed increasing Hg concentrations in the physiologically active outer rings despite declining atmospheric Hg concentrations. The good agreement between Hg and nitrogen concentrations in active tree-ring cells indicates a similar transport mechanism and cautions against their applicability as atmospheric Hg archives. Our results suggest that tree-ring Hg records are controlled by atmospheric Hg and tree physiology. We provide recommendations for using tree-ring Hg archives that take tree physiology into account."

 Leaf area index (LAI) is one of key variables for depicting vegetation structures in land ecosystems. Land surface models necessitate uniform LAI inputs at varying spatial scales to ensure accurate outputs at multiscale levels, however, operational satellite LAI products are acquired only at low spatial resolutions, inhibiting their application at finer spatial scales. Spatial downscaling methods are beneficial for the spatial enhancement of LAI products, and the emergence of deep learning methods has provided promising options for land surface parameter downscaling. However, the potential of deep learning has not been well explored in LAI downscaling. To address this research gap, this study designed an original hierarchical downscaling approach facilitated by generative adversarial network (GAN), transfer learning (TL), and data augmentation techniques to retrieve LAI at fine spatial resolutions, leveraging multiscale satellite images, and cascading from 500-m to 250-m and then to 30-m scales. First, an improved super-resolution GAN (ISRGAN) model was pre-trained using the GLASS LAI and MOD09Q1 products to bridge the general non-linear relationships of LAI between the 500-m and 250-m resolutions. Subsequently, limited reference LAI images were applied to fine-tune this pre-trained ISRGAN model to address the domain shift in the 250-m resolution LAI estimations. Then, the fine-tuned LAI values and the 30-m resolution LAI reference images were utilized as the ISRGAN inputs to produce fine-resolution LAI maps. Finally, the downscaled LAI values derived from the proposed approach were separately validated against reference LAI maps and field measurements across the 250-m and 30-m resolutions. Results show that the fine-tuned transfer learning technique outperforms the pre-trained ISRGAN model and GLASS LAI, with a lower RMSE (0.78) and higher R2 (0.83) at the 250-m resolution. Moreover, the proposed hierarchical downscaling framework achieves better performances for 30-m resolution LAI estimations, regardless of the validation accuracy (R2 = 0.76; RMSE=0.95) and spatiotemporal distributions, than the ISRGAN model which was directly trained by the 500-m and 30-m resolution images. This study highlights that a hierarchical downscaling is valuable for fine-resolution LAI estimations, which leverages multiscale and multisource satellite observations via deep learning."

(2022), we created SFexp normalized to SZA =72° for NO2 and NO for every month of the year as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA). Apart from a boundary value problem at minimum SZA values originating from averaging over different times of the month, the obtained scaling factors SFexp(NO2) and SFexp(NO) as a function of SZA represent  the daytime behavior already shown in model simulations and experiments in the literature very well. This shows a well-pronounced increase in the NO2 and NO stratospheric partial column with the time of the day and a flattening of this increase after noon. In addition to the discussion of SFexp, we validate the simulation-based scaling factors SFsim(NO2) (Strode et al., 2022) and present simulation-based scaling factors for NO SFsim(NO). The simulation-based scaling factors show excellent agreement with the experiment-based ones; i.e., for NO2 and NO the mean value of the modulus between the experiment and simulation over all SZAs and months is only 0.02 %. We show that recently used model simulations can describe  the real behavior of nitrogen oxide (NOx) variability in the stratosphere very well. Furthermore, we conclude that ground-based FTIR measurements can be used for validation of the output of photochemistry models and for creating experiment-based data sets describing the daytime stratospheric NOx variability as a function of SZA. This is a contribution to improved satellite validation and a better understanding of stratospheric photochemistry."

Arora,Estimation of Canada's methane emissions: inverse modelling analysis using the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) measurement network,"Methane (CH4) emissions in Canada for 2007–2017 were estimated using Canada’s surface greenhouse gas measurements. The estimated emissions show no significant trend, but emission uncertainty was reduced as more measurement sites became available. Notably for climate change, we find the wetland CH4 emissions show a positive correlation with surface air temperature in summer. Canada’s measurement network could monitor future CH4 emission changes and compliance with climate change mitigation goals. 
 Canada has major sources of atmospheric methane (CH4), with the world's second-largest boreal wetland and the world's fourth-largest natural gas production. However, Canada's CH4 emissions remain uncertain among estimates. Better quantification and characterization of Canada's CH4 emissions are critical for climate mitigation strategies. To improve our understanding of Canada's CH4 emissions, we performed an ensemble regional inversion for 2007–2017 constrained with the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) surface measurement network. The decadal CH4 estimates show no significant trend, unlike some studies that reported long-term trends. The total CH4 estimate is 17.4 (15.3–19.5) Tg CH4 yr−1, partitioned into natural and anthropogenic sources at 10.8 (7.5–13.2) and 6.6 (6.2–7.8) Tg CH4 yr−1, respectively. The estimated anthropogenic emission is higher than inventories, mainly in western Canada (with the fossil fuel industry). Furthermore, the results reveal notable spatiotemporal characteristics. First, the modelled differences in atmospheric CH4 among the sites show improvement after inversion when compared to observations, implying the CH4 observation differences could help in verifying the inversion results. Second, the seasonal variations show slow onset and a late-summer maximum, indicating wetland CH4 flux has hysteretic dependence on air temperature. Third, the boreal winter natural CH4 emissions, usually treated as negligible, appear quantifiable (≥ 20 % of annual emissions). Understanding winter emission is important for climate prediction, as the winter in Canada is warming faster than the summer. Fourth, the inter-annual variability in estimated CH4 emissions is positively correlated with summer air temperature anomalies. This could enhance Canada's natural CH4 emission in the warming climate."

Carpenter,An improved estimate of inorganic iodine emissions from the ocean using a coupled surface microlayer box model,"Iodine-mediated loss of ozone to the ocean surface and the subsequent emission of iodine species has a large effect on the troposphere. Here we combine recent experimental insights to develop a box model of the process, which we then parameterize and incorporate into the GEOS-Chem transport model. We find that these new insights have a small impact on the total emission of iodine but significantly change its distribution. 
 Iodine at the ocean's surface impacts climate and health by removing ozone (O3) from the troposphere both directly via ozone deposition to seawater and indirectly via the formation of iodine gases that are released into the atmosphere. Here we present a new box model of the ocean surface microlayer that couples oceanic O3 dry deposition to inorganic chemistry to predict inorganic iodine emissions. This model builds on the previous work of Carpenter et al. (2013), improving both chemical and physical processes. This new box model predicts iodide depletion in the top few micrometres of the ocean surface due to rapid chemical loss to ozone competing with replenishment from underlying water. From this box model, we produce parameterized equations for HOI and I2 emissions, which are implemented into the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem along with an updated sea surface iodide climatology. Compared to the previous model, inorganic iodine emissions from some tropical waters decrease by as much as half, while higher-latitude emissions increase by a factor of ≫10. With these large local changes, global total inorganic iodine emissions increased by ∼49 % (2.99 to 4.48 Tg) compared to the previous parameterization. This results in a negligible change in average tropospheric OH (<0.2 %) and tropospheric methane lifetime (<0.2 %). The annual mean tropospheric O3 burden decreases (−1.5 % to 325 Tg); however, higher-latitude surface O3 concentrations decrease by as much as 20 %."

Diekmann;Kei Yoshimura,Assessing the potential of free-tropospheric water vapour isotopologue satellite observations for improving the analyses of convective events,"Despite its importance for extreme weather and climate feedbacks, atmospheric convection is not well constrained. This study assesses the potential of novel tropospheric water vapour isotopologue satellite observations for improving the analyses of convective events. We find that the impact of the isotopologues is small for stable atmospheric conditions but significant for unstable conditions, which have the strongest societal impacts (e.g. storms and flooding). 
 Satellite-based observations of free-tropospheric water vapour isotopologue ratios (HDO / H2O, expressed in form of the δ value δD) with good global and temporal coverage have become available recently. We investigate the potential of these observations for constraining the uncertainties of the atmospheric analyses fields of specific humidity (q), temperature (T), and δD and of variables that capture important properties of the atmospheric water cycle, namely the vertical velocity (ω), the latent heating rate (Q2), and the precipitation rate (Prcp). Our focus is on the impact of the δD observations relative to the impact achieved by the observation of q and T, which are much more easily observed by satellites and are routinely in use for atmospheric analyses. For our investigations we use an Observing System Simulation Experiment; i.e. we simulate the satellite observations of q, T, and δD with known uncertainties and coverage (e.g. observations are not available for cloudy conditions, i.e. at locations where the atmosphere is vertically unstable). Then we use the simulated observations within a Kalman-filter-based assimilation framework in order to evaluate their potential for improving the quality of atmospheric analyses. The study is made for low latitudes (30° S to 30° N) and for 40 d between mid-July and the end of August 2016. We find that q observations generally have the largest impacts on the analyses' quality and that T observations have stronger impacts overall than δD observations. We show that there is no significant impact of δD observations for stable atmospheric conditions; however, for very unstable conditions, the impact of δD observations is significant and even slightly stronger than the respective impact of T observations. Very unstable conditions are rare but are related to extreme events (e.g. storms, flooding); i.e. the δD observations significantly impact the analyses' quality of the events that have the largest societal consequences. The fact that no satellite observations are available at the location and time of the unstable conditions indicates a remote impact of δD observations that are available elsewhere. Concerning real-world applications, we conclude that the situation of δD satellite observations is very promising but that further improving the model's linkage between convective processes and the larger-scale δD fields might be needed for optimizing the assimilation impact of real-world δD observations."

Wofsy;Ritesh Gautam,Constructing a measurement-based spatially explicit inventory of US oil and gas methane emissions (2021),"We review, analyze, and synthesize previous peer-reviewed measurement-based data on facility-level oil and gas methane emissions and use these data to develop a high-resolution spatially explicit inventory of US basin-level and national methane emissions. This work provides an improved assessment of national methane emissions relative to government inventories in support of accurate and comprehensive methane emissions assessment, attribution, and mitigation. 
 Accurate and comprehensive quantification of oil and gas methane emissions is pivotal in informing effective methane mitigation policies while also supporting the assessment and tracking of progress towards emissions reduction targets set by governments and industry. While national bottom-up source-level inventories are useful for understanding the sources of methane emissions, they are often unrepresentative across spatial scales, and their reliance on generic emission factors produces underestimations when compared with measurement-based inventories. Here, we compile and analyze previously reported ground-based facility-level methane emissions measurements (n=1540) in the major US oil- and gas-producing basins and develop representative methane emission profiles for key facility categories in the US oil and gas supply chain, including well sites, natural-gas compressor stations, processing plants, crude-oil refineries, and pipelines. We then integrate these emissions data with comprehensive spatial data on national oil and gas activity to estimate each facility's mean total methane emissions and uncertainties for the year 2021, from which we develop a mean estimate of annual national methane emissions resolved at 0.1° × 0.1° spatial scales (∼ 10 km × 10 km). From this measurement-based methane emissions inventory (EI-ME), we estimate total US national oil and gas methane emissions of approximately 16 Tg (95 % confidence interval of 14–18 Tg) in 2021, which is ∼ 2 times greater than the EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Our estimate represents a mean gas-production-normalized methane loss rate of 2.6 %, consistent with recent satellite-based estimates. We find significant variability in both the magnitude and spatial distribution of basin-level methane emissions, ranging from production-normalized methane loss rates of < 1 % in the gas-dominant Appalachian and Haynesville regions to > 3 %–6 % in oil-dominant basins, including the Permian, Bakken, and the Uinta. Additionally, we present and compare novel comprehensive wide-area airborne remote-sensing data and results for total area methane emissions and the relative contributions of diffuse and concentrated methane point sources as quantified using MethaneAIR in 2021. The MethaneAIR assessment showed reasonable agreement with independent regional methane quantification results in sub-regions of the Permian and Uinta basins and indicated that diffuse area sources accounted for the majority of the total oil and gas emissions in these two regions. Our assessment offers key insights into plausible underlying drivers of basin-to-basin variabilities in oil and gas methane emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating measurement-based data when developing high-resolution spatially explicit methane inventories in support of accurate methane assessment, attribution, and mitigation.

 This work proposes a hybrid approach that combines physics and artificial intelligence (AI) for cloud cover nowcasting. It addresses the limitations of traditional deep-learning methods in producing realistic and physically consistent results that can generalise to unseen data. The proposed approach, named HyPhAICC, enforces a physical behaviour. In the first model, denoted as HyPhAICC-1, a multi-level advection dynamics is considered a hard constraint for a trained U-Net model. Our experiments show that the hybrid formulation outperforms not only traditional deep-learning methods but also the EUMETSAT Extrapolated Imagery model (EXIM) in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results. In particular, we illustrate that the hybrid model preserves more details and achieves higher scores based on similarity metrics in comparison to U-Net. Remarkably, these improvements are achieved while using only one-third of the data required by the other models. Another model, denoted as HyPhAICC-2, adds a source term to the advection equation, it impaired the visual rendering but displayed the best performance in terms of accuracy. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid physics–AI architecture provides a promising solution to overcome the limitations of classical AI methods and contributes to open up new possibilities for combining physical knowledge with deep-learning models."

Although atmospheric bases like dimethylamine (DMA) and ammonia (NH3) can enhance IA particles formation, their different efficiencies and spatial distributions make the dominant base-stabilization mechanisms of forming IA particles unclear. Herein, we investigated the IA–DMA–NH3 nucleation system through quantum chemical calculations at the DLPNO–CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ(-PP)//ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd) + aug-cc-pVTZ-PP level of theory and cluster dynamics simulations. We provide molecular-level evidence that DMA and NH3 can jointly stabilize the IA clusters. The formation rates of IA clusters initially decline before rising from the MBL to the FT, owing to variations in mechanism. In the MBL, IA–DMA nucleation predominates, while the contribution of IA–DMA–NH3 synergistic nucleation cannot be overlooked in polar and NH3-polluted regions. In the lower FT, IA–DMA–NH3 nucleation prevails, whereas in the upper FT, IA–NH3 nucleation dominates. The efficiency of IA–DMA–NH3 nucleation is comparable to that of IA-iodous acid nucleation in the MBL and sulfuric acid-NH3 nucleation in the FT. Hence, the IA–DMA–NH3 mechanism holds promise for revealing the missing sources of tropospheric IA particles."

The production process is the primary source, accounting for 55.43% of emissions, with consumption processes making up the rest. Major sources are in Asia, North America, and Europe. The inventory is verified by implementing emission data into a global atmospheric transport model to predict OPFR concentrations in the global environment and comparing modeled concentrations with field sampled data. The results indicate that the inventory is reliable except for the pristine polar region, where the emission inventory and modeled concentrations underestimate OPFR levels in the atmosphere, likely resulting from ignorance of chemical reactions and the secondary derivative of parent OPFRs during their global long-distance atmospheric transport in the model. This comprehensive data set aids in formulating OPFR emission control policies and assessing health risks."

However, the individual or joint contributions of anthropogenic emissions and/or biomass burning from outside China to surface particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over southern China have not been fully investigated. Here, five experiments were designed to investigate the impacts of these emissions in January (winter), March (pre‐monsoon), and October (post‐monsoon) for 2017. Aerosols from South Asia and Southeast Asia contributed less to southern China during winter and post‐monsoon seasons, whereas the wind patterns and emission intensity during the pre‐monsoon season were conducive to the transport of aerosols. During pre‐monsoon season, the total emissions contributed approximately 5.0 μg m−3 to surface PM2.5 in Xizang Province. Biomass burning in Southeast Asia increased PM2.5 in Yunnan Province by 37.9 μg m−3, while anthropogenic emissions increased it by 8.9 μg m−3.

 Global warming is rapidly shifting climate conditions away from what societies and ecosystems are adapted to. While the magnitude of changes in mean and extreme climate are broadly studied, regional rates of change, a key driver of climate risk, have received less attention. Here we show, using large ensembles of climate model simulations, that large parts of the tropics and subtropics, encompassing 70% of current global population, are expected to experience strong (>2 s.d.) joint rates of change in temperature and precipitation extremes combined over the next 20 years, under a high-emissions scenario, dropping to 20% under strong emissions mitigation. This is dominated by temperature extremes, with most of the world experiencing unusual (>1 s.d.) rates relative to the pre-industrial period, but unusual changes also occur for precipitation extremes in northern high latitudes, southern and eastern Asia and equatorial Africa. However, internal variability is high for 20 year trends, meaning that in the near term, trends of the opposite sign are still likely for precipitation extremes, and rare but not impossible for temperature extremes. We also find that rapid clean-up of aerosol emissions, mostly over Asia, leads to accelerated co-located increases in warm extremes and influences the Asian summer monsoons. Large-ensemble simulations suggest that strong regional trends in precipitation and temperature extremes will be common over the next two decades, even under stringent mitigation measures."

 The rainfall variabilities of the West African and South American summer monsoons, pivotal for local and global climate systems, are strongly influenced by tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies. This study investigates the impacts of two recently identified Atlantic Niño types, central and eastern Atlantic Niño (CAN and EAN), on these monsoon systems using observational data and numerical experiments. During boreal summer, EAN events exhibit increased rainfall over West Africa compared to CAN events, indicating a strengthened West African summer monsoon. Enhanced moisture flux convergence from eastern Atlantic warming drives these wetting conditions during EAN events. Conversely, CAN events have a more pronounced influence on South American monsoon rainfall during austral summer, causing a rainfall anomaly dipole between the Amazon and eastern Brazil, suggesting an eastward shift in the South American summer monsoon rainfall belt. These rainfall changes are linked to cyclonic circulation anomalies over the southwest Atlantic Ocean, attributed to central Atlantic warming during CAN events. Furthermore, a statistical model assesses hindcast skills of rainfall variability in the two summer monsoon regions, affirming the benefits of separating Atlantic Niño into CAN and EAN events for improved seasonal climate predictions."

By the end of the 21st century, winter precipitation is projected to increase by about 2–5% K−1 over most of the US. The frequency of very wet winters is also expected to increase, with 6–7 out of 30 winters exceeding the very wet threshold under the different scenarios.

 Land restoration is becoming increasingly popular as a climate change mitigation and adaptation measure. It is suggested that resulting vegetation changes can impact the local surface temperature through biophysical processes such as albedo warming and evaporative cooling. Yet, the potential effect of land restoration on the local surface temperature in Africa remains uncertain. In this study, we use Terra MODIS time series of vegetation, albedo, and land surface temperature to determine vegetation-temperature relationships at a continental scale. We show that vegetation-albedo and vegetation-temperature relationships do not only vary spatially across Africa but also temporally over different time scales, with strong cooling effects in semi-arid environments. Furthermore, we predict that land restoration can decrease local land surface temperature by around 0.2 Kelvin on average. This study gives a more detailed insight into where future land restoration provides additional positive climate impacts, and where land restoration may instead warm the local environment. Vegetation, albedo and temperature relationships vary across space and time over Africa, and cooling effects are greater in semi-arid environments than in tropical forests and humid areas, according to satellite-based time series analyses."

When SOA mixes with inorganic particles containing transition metals (e.g., Fe), chemical reactions altering physicochemical properties can occur. Here, we study Fe’s impact on the formation and chemical composition of SOA formed via dark α-pinene ozonolysis on either (NH4)2SO4 or Fe-containing (NH4)2SO4 seed particles and aged at varying relative humidities (RHs). Aerosol composition was determined using online extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, providing high-resolution chemical and temporal identification of monomers and dimers in the SOA. At high RH, Fe’s presence resulted in higher particulate SOA mass concentrations (117 ± 14 μg m–3) than those formed in its absence (70 ± 1 μg m–3). Enhanced mass is coupled with more dimers (C15–20’s), attributed to Fenton-driven oligomerization reactions. Experiments with Fe3+-containing seeds showed similar chemical composition and enhanced SOA mass, suggesting a dark reduction pathway to form Fe2+ in the presence of SOA. Overall, Fe’s presence at high RH lowers SOA volatility and enhances particulate organic mass and condensed phased reactions of higher volatility species that would normally not participate in SOA formation, which may be important when considering its formation in air quality and climate models."

CH4 flux was measured in urban Beijing using the eddy covariance method during a summer campaign. With a mean of 152.6 ± 107.9 nmol/m2/s, the CH4 flux was estimated to depend little on the intensity of human activities, with minimal influence from biogenic sources. Emission hotspots with large temporal variability were identified in the study fetch area, which increased the mean CH4 flux by 12.5%. Based on the lack of large, known biogenic sources in nonhotspot (background) areas, we attributed the CH4 flux in these areas (135.6 ± 70.56 nmol/m2/s) mainly to natural gas. Thus, we estimate as an upper limit that natural gas contributes 88.9% to the total CH4 flux in urban Beijing. However, poor alignment between the dominant sources in the inventories and the characteristics of the measured CH4 flux were observed, suggesting substantial underestimation of emissions from natural gas sources in the inventories. A leakage ratio of 1.4% (0.7–2.1%) of consumed natural gas was determined in Beijing. Pinpointing emissions with more granular methods could improve our understanding of the urban CH4 source profile in Beijing."

These signals are the air‐to‐ground coupling of impact‐generated infrasound, which propagated in an low‐altitude atmospheric waveguide. Their group velocity depends on the structure of effective sound speed in the boundary layer. Here, we conduct a Bayesian inversion of effective sound speed up to 2,000 m altitude using the group velocity measured for events S0981c, S0986c and S1034a. The inverted effective sound speed profiles are in good agreement with estimates provided by the Mars Climate Database. Differences between inverted and modeled profiles can be attributed to a local wind variation in the impact→station direction, of amplitude smaller than 2 m/s."

While recent laboratory studies underscore the importance of intermediate‐volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) as key precursors to SOA, field observations that recognize the role of both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and IVOCs in SOA formation remain scarce. In this study, we conducted concurrent measurements of VOCs and IVOCs in ambient air at urban and suburban sites in Guangzhou during a PM2.5 pollution event in winter 2021. The results reveal that between 12:00–15:00 local time, the photochemically adjusted initial concentrations of VOCs at both sites were approximately 7 times higher than that of IVOCs. However, the SOA formation potential (SOAFP) of primary hydrocarbon IVOCs exceeded that of VOCs by over 3–4 times. Receptor modeling results further indicated that while ship emissions contributed to less than 10% of the C2–C22 primary hydrocarbons concentration (VOCs + primary carbonaceous IVOCs), they accounted for the most significant source (approximately 40%) of SOA formation. This study highlights the substantial role of IVOCs in SOA formation and emphasizes the importance of future PM2.5 pollution control measures targeting major IVOCs contributors, such as ship emissions in harbor cities."

However, there is currently no clear understanding of the precise pattern of change and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Since the hydrological response in urban areas is highly sensitive to such rainfall properties, understanding these changes is critical to improving our ability to assess urban flood risk. We use 7 years of high‐resolution weather radar data (4‐ or 5‐min and 1 km) to analyze changes in patterns of rainfall intensity, spatial structure, and storm evolution across eight urban areas within Europe and the United States. The use of the same methodology across the different cities enables a consistent comparison among them. We track convective rainfall events using a storm tracking algorithm and assess changes in rainfall properties in the upwind, center, and downwind regions of each city. We also investigate changes in the frequency of storm initiations, terminations, splitting, and merging. Our results show that urban areas act to intensify rainfall—mostly over them, but sometimes on their peripheries. Overall, larger cities tend to show the largest rainfall enhancements. Our findings highlight that rainfall spatial structure is altered over the urban core; usually resulting in more spatially concentrated rainfall. We also observe increased storm initiations over most cities and increased storm splitting over one. Given that demographic projections show that future urban population will increase, our results point toward an increased future flood risk in growing cities."

 The 2022 Hunga eruptions injected an observationally unprecedented amount of moisture directly into the stratosphere. However, stratospheric moisture can also be indirectly increased following a volcanic eruption, when heating from volcanic sulfate aerosol raises the tropical cold-point temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that a 1 K increase in tropical cold-point temperatures can lead to indirect moisture increases in the stratosphere of comparable or even larger magnitude than observed for the direct injections during the Hunga eruptions. We base our reasoning on first-principle thermodynamic arguments combined with climate model and reanalysis output as well as observational data. We argue that following the next large-magnitude explosive eruption in the tropics, the strength of indirect increases in stratospheric moisture should be quantified using current measurement techniques.

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) are key properties of natural materials essential for scientific analysis. Existing retrieval techniques, however, impede the automatic retrieval of LST and LSE across various observational contexts due to the frequent unavailability of in-situ atmospheric data or blackbody references for atmospheric compensation. To address this, we propose the Inter-Channel Correlated Automatic Atmospheric Compensation (ICCAAC) method, seamlessly integrated with the ASTER-TES approach, enabling direct retrieval of LST and LSE from at-sensor radiance without prerequisite atmosphere and land surface information. ICCAAC innovatively models the inter-channel relationships among atmospheric constituents to streamline the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), which includes the transmittance reconstruction with neighboring channels and the atmospheric upwelling radiance simplification with the atmospheric vertical characteristics, tackling the complex challenge of retrieving ground-leaving radiance. Coupled with ASTER-TES and under the LSE smoothness constraint, along with a lookup table for atmospheric downwelling radiance, this method facilitates accurate LST and LSE retrieval. In controlled simulations, ICCAAC shows a maximum brightness temperature error of 1.6 K for Water Vapor Content (WVC) under 1.5 g/cm2. A spectral sensitivity analysis suggests the optimal performance of ICCAAC for full width at half maximum (FWHM) range extending beyond the channel interval. Applied to real-world airborne data from Hypercam-LW and HyTES, ICCAAC-TES validates its accuracy with an LST and LSE error margin of 1.2 K and 0.014, respectively, corroborated by seventeen distinct ground validations in Hypercam-LW imagery. Comparative analysis with five varied HyTES observation scenes reveals an LST discrepancy of around 1.2 K and notable emissivity textures in LSE images, particularly in mineral terrains. These outcomes underscore the efficacy of ICCAAC-TES, advocating its suitability for automated LST and LSE retrieval in airborne survey applications."

Light-duty vehicle emissions are the main driver of the exposure and exposure disparity, although smaller contributions from heavy-duty vehicles especially affect some overburdened groups.

The tropopause is the interface between the troposphere and the stratosphere and represents a barrier for the transport of air masses between the troposphere and the stratosphere. We consider not only the tropopause itself, but also a layer around it called the tropopause inversion layer (TIL). It is shown that the moister the underlying atmosphere is, the more this layer acts as a barrier. 
 The tropopause inversion layer (TIL) is a prominent feature of the midlatitude tropopause region, constituting a transport barrier.  Adiabatic and diabatic processes might contribute to the formation and sharpening of the inversion.  For both types of processes, relative humidity over ice is ideal for attribution; from theory and former model case studies, we expect enhanced relative humidity values with a sharp TIL.We use high-resolution radiosonde and ERA5 reanalysis data to show very good qualitative and quantitative agreement in terms of TIL features; thus, coarser ERA5 data can be used for further investigations. Next, we investigate the connection between TIL features and relative humidity measures in both radiosonde and ERA5 data, revealing a clear relationship. Moister profiles, on average, exhibit significantly higher maximum values of the Brunt–Väisälä frequency (N2), indicating a more stable stratification of the tropopause in these cases. This result holds true in both radiosonde measurements and ERA5 data. For TIL thickness, an inverse pattern emerges: moister, more stable TILs exhibit lower thickness.Because of the good agreement between radiosonde and ERA5 data, we use ERA5 data for seasonal and regional investigations. These analyses reveal consistent TIL properties in various midlatitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere under different meteorological conditions. However, differences in the strength of the dependence of TIL properties on relative humidity over ice are evident between the different regions."

In this study we evaluate these processes while focusing on low-level Arctic clouds. To achieve this we used an extensive simulation set in combination with a new diagnostic tool. This study presents our findings on the relevance of these processes and their behaviour under different thermodynamic regimes. 
 Current general circulation models struggle to capture the phase-partitioning of clouds accurately, both overestimating and underestimating the supercooled liquid substantially. This impacts the radiative properties of clouds. Therefore, it is of interest to understand which processes determine the phase-partitioning. In this study, microphysical-process rates are analysed to study what role each phase-changing process plays in low-level Arctic clouds. Several months of cloud-resolving ICON simulations using a two-moment cloud microphysics scheme are evaluated. The microphysical-process rates are extracted using a diagnostic tool introduced here, which runs only the microphysical parameterization using previously simulated days. It was found that the processes impacting ice are more efficient during polar night than polar day. For the mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), it became clear that phase changes involving the vapour phase dominated in contrast to processes between liquid and ice. Computing the rate of the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process further indicated that the MPCs frequently (42 % of the time) seemed to be glaciating. Additionally, the dependence of each process on the temperature, vertical wind, and saturation was evaluated. This showed that, in particular, the temperature influences the occurrence and interactions of different processes. This study helps to better understand how microphysical processes act in different regimes. It additionally shows which processes play an important role in contributing to the phase-partitioning in Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds. Therefore, these processes could potentially be better targeted for improvements in the ICON model that aim to more accurately represent the phase-partitioning of Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds."

Thornhill;Luke D. Ziemba;Christiane Voigt,Understanding aerosol–cloud interactions using a single-column model for a cold-air outbreak case during the ACTIVATE campaign,"We examined marine boundary layer clouds and their interactions with aerosols in the E3SM single-column model (SCM) for a case study. The SCM shows good agreement when simulating the clouds with high-resolution models. It reproduces the relationship between cloud droplet and aerosol particle number concentrations as produced in global models. However, the relationship between cloud liquid water and droplet number concentration is different, warranting further investigation. 
 Marine boundary layer clouds play a critical role in Earth's energy balance. Their microphysical and radiative properties are highly impacted by ambient aerosols and dynamic forcings. In this study, we evaluate the representation of these clouds and related aerosol–cloud interaction processes in the single-column version of the E3SM climate model (SCM) against field measurements collected during the NASA ACTIVATE campaign over the western North Atlantic, as well as intercompare results with high-resolution process level models. We show that E3SM SCM reproduces the macrophysical properties of post-frontal boundary layer clouds in a cold-air outbreak (CAO) case well. However, it generates fewer but larger cloud droplets compared to aircraft measurements. Further sensitivity tests show that the underestimation of both aerosol number concentration and vertical velocity variance contributes to this bias. Aerosol–cloud interactions are examined by perturbing prescribed aerosol properties in E3SM SCM with fixed dynamics. Higher aerosol number concentration or hygroscopicity leads to more numerous but smaller cloud droplets, resulting in a stronger cooling via shortwave cloud forcing. This apparent Twomey effect is consistent with prior climate model studies. The cloud liquid water path shows a weakly positive relation with cloud droplet number concentration due to precipitation suppression. This weak aerosol effect on cloud macrophysics may be attributed to the dominant impact of strong dynamical forcing associated with the CAO. Our findings indicate that the SCM framework is a key tool to bridge the gap between climate models, process level models, and field observations to facilitate process level understanding."

This indicates that the natural density evolution needs to be analyzed. However, the middle-atmospheric density response to sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events has rarely been reported. In this study, the density distribution and mass transport process are illustrated based on observation data and global numerical model simulations during the 2021 major SSW event. 
 Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are dramatic events in the polar winter stratosphere that are accompanied by atmospheric parameter anomalies in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Microwave Limb Sounder and Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder observations on board the Chinese FengYun 3 satellites indicate a rapid increase of over 50 % in the mesospheric density at high latitudes around the onset date during the 2021 major SSW event. The amplification of the zonal mean density around the onset is proportional to the latitude increase with a maximum increment of 83.3 % at 59 km above 80° N, which is more than 3 times larger than the climatological standard deviation (23.1 %). The horizontal density distributions are influenced by the changing polar vortex fields. A simulation using a specified dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model reproduces the global circulation and presents a severe change in the planetary wave forcing and residual meridional circulation mass flux followed by a change in the density tendency. These results demonstrate that the observed enhanced density is primarily attributed to the altered planetary waves and residual circulation during the SSW event. The observations and simulations also indicate that the density anomalies could extend to middle latitudes. Obvious density disturbances in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere were observed by the lidar deployed in Beijing (40.3° N, 116.2° E)."

A new insight was offered: the contributions of HONO and O3 to the production rates of OH on the TP are even greater than in lower-altitudes areas. This study enriches the understanding of vertical distribution of atmospheric components and explains the strong atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) on the TP. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a key role in the regional environment and global climate change; however, the lack of vertical observations of atmospheric species, such as HONO and O3, hinders a deeper understanding of the atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) on the TP. In this study, we conducted multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements at Nam Co, the central TP, to observe the vertical profiles of aerosol, water vapor (H2O), NO2, HONO and O3 from May to July 2019. In addition to NO2 mainly exhibiting a Gaussian shape with the maximum value appearing at 300=-400 m, the other four species all showed an exponential shape and decreased with the increase in height. The maximum values of monthly averaged aerosol (0.17 km−1) and O3 (66.71 ppb) occurred in May, H2O (3.68 × 1017 molec. cm−3) and HONO (0.13 ppb) appeared in July, and NO2 (0.39 ppb) occurred in June at the 200–400 m layer. H2O, HONO and O3 all exhibited a multi-peak pattern, and aerosol appeared to have a bi-peak pattern for its averaged diurnal variations. The averaged vertical profiles of OH production rates from O3 and HONO all exhibited an exponential shape decreasing with the increase in height, with maximum values of 2.61 and 0.49 ppb h−1 at the bottom layer, respectively. The total OH production rate contributed by HONO and O3 on the TP was obviously larger than that in low-altitude areas. In addition, source analysis was conducted for HONO and O3 at different height layers. The heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on wet surfaces was a significant source of HONO. The maximum values of HONO/NO2 appeared when H2O concentrations were approximately 1.0 × 1017 molec. cm−3 and aerosol concentrations were larger than 0.15 km−1 below 1.0 km. The maximum values were usually accompanied by H2O concentrations of 1.0–2.0 × 1017 molec. cm−3 and aerosol concentrations greater than 0.02 km−1 at 1.0–2.0 km. O3 was potentially sourced from the South Asian subcontinent and Himalayas through long-range transport. Our results contribute to the new understanding of vertical distribution of atmospheric components and explain the strong AOC on the TP."

Thill,Joint spectral retrievals of ozone with Suomi NPP CrIS augmented by S5P/TROPOMI,"Characterizing the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere is a challenging problem, with current Earth observation satellites using either thermal infrared (TIR) or ultraviolet (UV) instruments, sensitive to different portions of the atmosphere, making it difficult to gain a full picture. In this work, we combine measurements from the TIR and UV instruments Suomi NPP CrIS and Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI to improve sensitivity through the whole atmosphere and improve knowledge of ozone distribution. 
 The vertical distribution of ozone plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, climate change, air pollution, and human health. Over the 21st century, spaceborne remote-sensing methods and instrumentation have evolved to better determine this distribution. We quantify the ability of ozone retrievals to characterize this distribution through a sequential combination of thermal infrared (TIR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectral radiances, harnessing co-located TIR measurements from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and UV measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is on the Sentinel 5-Precursor (S5P) satellite. Using the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, MUlti-SEnsors (MUSES) algorithm, the sequential combination of TIR and UV measurements, which follows retrievals from each instrument separately, moderately improves the ability of satellites to characterize global ozone profiles over the use of each instrument/band individually. The CrIS retrievals enhanced by TROPOMI radiances in the Huggins band (325–335 nm) show good agreement with independent datasets both in the troposphere and in the stratosphere in spite of calibration issues in the TROPOMI UV. Improved performance is characterized in the stratosphere from CrIS-TROPOMI, firstly through a modest increase in the degrees of freedom for signal (DFS; often between 0.1–0.2) and secondly through comparisons with the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), where a global multi-month-long comparison shows a mean difference ∼×10 lower than either CrIS or TROPOMI individually and R2 values 3 % higher. In the troposphere, CrIS-TROPOMI and CrIS show similar degrees of freedom for signal, with about 2 globally, but these are higher in the tropics partitioned equally between the lower and upper troposphere. CrIS-TROPOMI validation with ozonesondes shows improved performance over CrIS-only validation, with a difference in the tropospheric-column bias of between 30 % and 200 % depending on the season. Cross-comparisons with satellite instruments and reanalysis datasets show similar performances in terms of correlations and biases. These results demonstrate that CrIS and CrIS-TROPOMI retrievals have the potential to improve global satellite ozone retrievals, especially with future developments. If spectral accuracy is improved in future TROPOMI calibration, the degrees of freedom for signal in the stratosphere could double when using bands 1 and 2 of TROPOMI (270–330 nm), while tropospheric degrees of freedom for signal could increase by 25 %."

Following some preprocessing and quality control, radar measurements are incorporated into a model that uses swarm intelligence to seek the most suitable DSD to produce the input measurements. 
 Having knowledge of the drop size distribution (DSD) is of particular interest to researchers as it is widely applied to quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) methods. Polarimetric radar measurements have previously been utilized to derive DSD curve characteristics frequently modeled as a gamma distribution. Likewise, approaches using dual-frequency measurements have shown positive results. Both cases have relied on the need to constrain the relationship between the DSD parameters based on location or assumed weather conditions. This paper presents a methodology for retrieving the DSD parameters using the dual-frequency and polarimetric nature of measurements from a unique data set taken at co-located S-band and C-band dual-polarization radars. Using the reflectivity and differential-phase measurements from each radar, an optimization routine employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and T-matrix computation of radar parameters is able to accurately retrieve the gamma distribution parameters without the constraints required in previous methods. Retrieved results are compared to known truth data collected using a network of OTT Parsivel disdrometers in Taiwan in order to assess the success of this procedure."

The results indicate that the assimilation of these data always has a positive impact on ozone analysis. 
 In the coming years, EUMETSAT's Meteosat Third Generation – Sounding (MTG-S) satellites will be launched with an instrument including valuable features on board. The MTG Infrared Sounder (MTG-IRS) will represent a major innovation for the monitoring of the chemical state of the atmosphere, since, at present, observations of these parameters mainly come from in situ measurements (geographically uneven) and from instruments on board polar-orbiting satellites (highly dependent on the scanning line of the satellite itself, which is limited, over a specific geographical area, to very few times per day).  MTG-IRS will present a great deal of potential in the area of detecting different atmospheric species and will have the advantage of being based on a geostationary platform and acquiring data with a high temporal frequency (every 30 min over Europe), which makes it easier to track the transport of the species of interest.The present work aims to evaluate the potential impact, over a regional domain over Europe, of the assimilation of MTG-IRS radiances within a chemical transport model (CTM), Modèle de Chimie Atmosphérique de Grande Echelle (MOCAGE), operated by Météo-France.Since MTG-IRS is not yet in orbit, observations have been simulated using the observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) approach. Of the species to which MTG-IRS will be sensitive, the one treated in this study was ozone.The results obtained indicate that the assimilation of synthetic radiances of MTG-IRS always has a positive impact on the ozone analysis from MOCAGE. The relative average difference compared to the nature run (NR) in the ozone total columns improves from −30 % (no assimilation) to almost zero when MTG-IRS observations are available over the domain. Also remarkable is the reduction in the standard deviation of the difference with respect to the NR, which, in the area where MTG-IRS radiances are assimilated, reaches its lowest values (∼ 1.8 DU). When considering tropospheric columns, the improvement is also significant, from 15 %–20 % (no assimilation) down to 3 %. The error in the differences compared to the NR is lower than for total columns (minima ∼ 0.3 DU), due also to the  lower concentrations of the tropospheric ozone field. Overall, the impact of assimilation is considerable over the whole vertical column: vertical variations are noticeably improved compared to what is obtained when no assimilation is performed (up to 25 % better)."

This study introduces the VISEA algorithm, which integrates satellite data and shortwave radiation to provide daily 0.05° gridded near-real-time ET estimates. By employing a vegetation index–temperature method, this algorithm can estimate ET without requiring additional data. Evaluation results demonstrate VISEA's comparable accuracy with accelerated data availability. 
 Accurate and timely global evapotranspiration (ET) data are crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and drought forecasting. Although numerous satellite-based ET products are available, few offer near-real-time data. For instance, products like NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment mounted on the International Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and MOD16 face challenges such as uneven coverage and delays exceeding 1 week in data availability. In this study, we refined the Variation of the Standard Evapotranspiration Algorithm (VISEA) by fully integrating satellite-based data, e.g., European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5-Land shortwave radiation (which includes satellite remote sensing data within its assimilation system) and MODIS land surface data (which include surface reflectance, temperature and/or emissivity, land cover, vegetation indices, and albedo as inputs). This enables VISEA to provide near-real-time global daily ET estimates with a maximum delay of 1 week at a resolution of 0.05°. Its accuracy was assessed globally using observation data from 149 flux towers across 12 land cover types and comparing them with five other satellite-based ET products and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data. The results indicate that VISEA provides accurate ET estimates that are comparable to existing products, achieving a mean correlation coefficient (R) of about 0.6 and an RMSE of 1.4 mm d−1. Furthermore, we demonstrated VISEA's utility in drought monitoring during a drought event in the Yangtze River basin in 2022 in which ET changes correlated with precipitation. The near-real-time capability of VISEA is, thus, especially valuable in meteorological and hydrological applications for coordinating drought relief efforts.

 Long-term PM2.5 data are essential for the atmospheric environment, human health, and climate change. PM2.5 measurements are sparsely distributed and of short duration. In this study, daily PM2.5 concentrations are estimated using a machine learning method for the period from 1959 to 2022 in the Northern Hemisphere based on near-surface atmospheric visibility. They are extracted from the Integrated Surface Database (ISD). Daily continuous monitored PM2.5 concentration is set as the target, and near-surface atmospheric visibility and other related variables are used as the inputs. A total of 80 % of the samples of each site are the training set, and 20 % are the testing set. The training result shows that the slope of linear regression with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) between the estimated PM2.5 concentration and the monitored PM2.5 concentration is 0.955 [0.955, 0.955], the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.95, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 7.2 µg m−3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 3.2 µg m−3. The test result shows that the slope within a 95 % CI between the predicted PM2.5 concentration and the monitored PM2.5 concentration is 0.864 [0.863, 0.865], the R2 is 0.79, the RMSE is 14.8 µg m−3, and the MAE is 7.6 µg m−3. Compared with a global PM2.5 concentration dataset derived from a satellite aerosol optical depth product with 1 km resolution, the slopes of linear regression on the daily (monthly) scale are 0.817 (0.854) from 2000 to 2021, 0.758 (0.821) from 2000 to 2010, and 0.867 (0.879) from 2011 to 2022, indicating the accuracy of the model and the consistency of the estimated PM2.5 concentration on the temporal scale. The interannual trends and spatial patterns of PM2.5 concentration on the regional scale from 1959 to 2022 are analyzed using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), suitable for situations with an uneven spatial distribution of monitoring sites. The trend is the slope of the Theil–Sen estimator. In Canada, the trend is −0.10 µg m−3 per decade, and the PM2.5 concentration exhibits an east–high to west–low pattern. In the United States, the trend is −0.40 µg m−3 per decade, and PM2.5 concentration decreases significantly after 1992, with a trend of −1.39 µg m−3 per decade. The areas of high PM2.5 concentration are in the east and west, and the areas of low PM2.5 concentration are in the central and northern regions. In Europe, the trend is −1.55 µg m−3 per decade. High-concentration areas are distributed in eastern Europe, and the low-concentration areas are in northern and western Europe. In China, the trend is 2.09 µg m−3 per decade. High- concentration areas are distributed in northern China, and the low-concentration areas are distributed in southern China. The trend is 2.65 µg m−3 per decade up to 2011 and −22.23 µg m−3 per decade since 2012. In India, the trend is 0.92 µg m−3 per decade. The concentration exhibits a north–high to south–low pattern, with high-concentration areas distributed in northern India, such as the Ganges Plain and Thar Desert, and the low-concentration area in the Deccan Plateau. The trend is 1.41 µg m−3 per decade up to 2013 and −23.36 µg m−3 per decade from 2014. The variation in regional PM2.5 concentrations is closely related to the implementation of air quality laws and regulations.

Winkler,DeepPhenoMem V1.0: deep learning modelling of canopy greenness dynamics accounting for multi-variate meteorological memory effects on vegetation phenology,"Our study employs long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to model canopy greenness and phenology, integrating meteorological memory effects. The LSTM model outperforms traditional methods, enhancing accuracy in predicting greenness dynamics and phenological transitions across plant functional types. Highlighting the importance of multi-variate meteorological memory effects, our research pioneers unlock the secrets of vegetation phenology responses to climate change with deep learning techniques. 
 Vegetation phenology plays a key role in controlling the seasonality of ecosystem processes that modulate carbon, water and energy fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere. Accurate modelling of vegetation phenology in the interplay of Earth's surface and the atmosphere is thus crucial to understand how the coupled system will respond to and shape climatic changes. Phenology is controlled by meteorological conditions at different timescales: on the one hand, changes in key meteorological variables (temperature, water, radiation) can have immediate effects on the vegetation development; on the other hand, phenological changes can be driven by past environmental conditions, known as memory effects. However, the processes governing meteorological memory effects on phenology are not completely understood, resulting in their limited performance of vegetation phenology represented in land surface models. A deep learning model, specifically a long short-term memory network (LSTM), has the potential to capture and model the meteorological memory effects on vegetation phenology. Here, we apply the LSTM to model the vegetation phenology using meteorological drivers and high-temporal-resolution canopy greenness observations through digital repeat photography by the PhenoCam network. We compare a multiple linear regression model, a no-memory-effect LSTM model and a full-memory-effect LSTM model to predict the whole seasonal greenness trajectory and the corresponding phenological transition dates across 50 sites and 317 site years during 2009–2018, covering deciduous broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forests and grasslands. Results show that the deep learning model outperforms the multiple linear regression model, and the full-memory-effect LSTM model performs better than the no-memory-effect model for all three plant function types (median R2 of 0.878, 0.957 and 0.955 for broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forests and grasslands). We also find that the full-memory-effect LSTM model is capable of predicting the seasonal dynamic variations of canopy greenness and reproducing trends in shifting phenological transition dates. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the full-memory-effect LSTM model to assess its plausibility, revealing its coherence with established knowledge of vegetation phenology sensitivity to meteorological conditions, particularly changes in temperature. Our study highlights that (1) multi-variate meteorological memory effects play a crucial role in vegetation phenology, and (2) deep learning opens up new avenues for improving the representation of vegetation phenological processes in land surface models via a hybrid modelling approach."

Here, we isolate the optimal atmospheric modes driving climate‐relevant decadal AMOC variability using a novel approach combining dynamical and statistical attribution (dynamics‐weighted principal component, or DPC analysis). We find that for both the subpolar (55°N) and subtropical (25°N) AMOC, the most effective independent mode of heat flux forcing closely resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation, and drives meridionally coherent AMOC anomalies through western boundary density anomalies. Conversely, established modes of wind stress variability possess limited quantitative similarity to the optimal wind stress patterns, which generate low‐frequency AMOC fluctuations by rearranging the ocean buoyancy field. We demonstrate (by running a modified version of the ECCOv4r4 state estimate) that most AMOC variability on decadal time scales can be explained by the DPCs."

This study combines conjugative in‐site and ground‐based observations to analyze the auroras and underlying physical processes. Results indicate that both electron and proton auroras appeared at low latitudes. Electron auroras predominantly arise from low‐energy electron precipitation, but proton auroras may be explained by energetic tens of keV proton precipitation. Pc1/EMIC waves are observed at low latitudes in the ionosphere, potentially accounting for mid‐latitude proton auroras.

The results indicate that the average concentrations of SOA tracers were 16.1 ± 9.8 ng m−3 in winter and 99.4 ± 57.2 ng m−3 in summer. During winter, anthropogenic SOA (ASOA, the sum of SOA derived from naphthalene and mono‐aromatic volatile organic compounds) dominated, whereas isoprene SOA (SOAI) prevailed in summer. Correlation analysis between SO42− and both SOAI and high‐order monoterpene SOA tracers (SOAM‐H) (R = 0.46–0.72, p < 0.001) revealed that higher aerosol acidity facilitated the formation of SOAI and SOAM‐H, with SO2 emissions playing a significant role in leading to higher acidity. Most biogenic SOA (BSOA) tracers exhibited a significant positive correlation with NO3−, particularly in winter, implying the remarkable influence of NOx emissions on BSOA formation. The levels of BSOA tracers increased with NH3, indicating that NH3 can enhance the formation of BSOA. In summer, SOA formation correlated with Ox (Ox = O3 + NO2), indicating the substantial impact of atmospheric oxidizing capacity on SOA formation. During winter, aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) correlated well with SOAI tracers (i.e., 3‐hydroxyglutaric acid (3‐HGA) and 3‐hydroxy‐4,4‐dimethylglutaric acid (3‐HDMGA)), and 2,3‐dihydroxy‐4‐oxopentanoic acid (DHOPA) (R > 0.5, p < 0.001), indicating the important contribution of aqueous‐phase formation of SOA.

The study spans the 2018–2021 Atlantic Basin hurricane seasons and is unique as it provides the first known analysis of total lightning (intra‐cloud and cloud‐to‐ground) observed in TCs through their extratropical transition and post‐tropical cyclone (PTC) phases. We consider the TC lifecycle stage, geographic location (e.g., land, coast, and ocean), shear strength, and quadrant relative to the storm motion and environmental shear vectors. Total lightning maxima are found in the forward right quadrant relative to storm motion and downshear of the TC center, consistent with previous studies using mainly cloud‐to‐ground lightning. Increasing environmental shear focuses the lightning maxima to the downshear right quadrant with respect to the shear vector in tropical storm phases. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission show that super‐electrically active convective precipitation features (>75 flashes) within the PTC phase of TCs have deeper mixed phase depths and higher reflectivity at −10°C than other phases, indicating the presence of more intense convection. Differences in the net convective behavior observed throughout TC evolution manifest in both the TC‐scale frequency of lightning‐producing cells and the intensity variations amongst individual convective cells. The combination of continuous lightning observations and precipitation snapshots improves our understanding of convective‐scale processes in TCs, especially in PTC phases, as they traverse the tropics and mid‐latitudes."

 During summer, ammonia emissions in Southeast Asia influence air pollution and cloud formation. Convective transport by the South Asian monsoon carries these pollutant air masses into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), where they accumulate under anticyclonic flow conditions. This air mass accumulation is thought to contribute to particle formation and the development of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). Despite the known influence of ammonia and particulate ammonium on air pollution, a comprehensive understanding of the ATAL is lacking. In this modelling study, the influence of ammonia on particle formation is assessed with emphasis on the ATAL. We use the EMAC chemistry-climate model, incorporating new particle formation parameterisations derived from experiments at the CERN CLOUD chamber. Our diurnal cycle analysis confirms that new particle formation mainly occurs during daylight, with a 10-fold enhancement in rate. This increase is prominent in the South Asian monsoon UTLS, where deep convection introduces high ammonia levels from the boundary layer, compared to a baseline scenario without ammonia. Our model simulations reveal that this ammonia-driven particle formation and growth contributes to an increase of up to 80% in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations at cloud-forming heights in the South Asian monsoon region. We find that ammonia profoundly influences the aerosol mass and composition in the ATAL through particle growth, as indicated by an order of magnitude increase in nitrate levels linked to ammonia emissions. However, the effect of ammonia-driven new particle formation on aerosol mass in the ATAL is relatively small. Ammonia emissions enhance the regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) for shortwave solar radiation by up to 70%. We conclude that ammonia has a pronounced effect on the ATAL development, composition, the regional AOD, and CCN concentrations."

 Precipitation variability is forecast to increase under climate change but its impacts on vegetation productivity are complex. Here, we use generalised additive models and remote sensing-derived datasets to quantify the effect of precipitation amount, distribution, and intensity on the gross primary productivity of dry rangelands across sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2019 and differentiate these effects from other variables. We find that total precipitation is the primary driver of productivity, but that more variable rainfall has a small negative effect across vegetation types and rainfall regimes. Temperature and soil nitrogen also have strong effects, especially in drier rangelands. Shrublands and grasslands are more sensitive to environmental variability than savannas. Our findings support a model in which the main constraints on productivity are maintenance of soil moisture and minimisation of plant water stress. This highlights the risks of climate warming and increasing variability for productivity in water-limited grass and shrublands but suggests savannas may have greater resilience in Africa.

 Peatlands store enormous amounts of carbon in a peat layer, the formation and preservation of which can only occur under waterlogged conditions. Monitoring peatland moisture conditions is critically important because a decrease in moisture leads to peat oxidation and the release of accumulated carbon back into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Optical remote sensing enables the indirect monitoring of peatland moisture conditions by identifying moisture-driven changes in vegetation spectral signatures. The vegetation of northern peatlands is dominated by Sphagnum mosses, whose spectral signatures are known to be highly sensitive to changes in moisture content. In this study, we tested methods to estimate Sphagnum moisture content from spectral data using seven spectral moisture indices, the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). This study was based on data representing nine Sphagnum species sampled from two habitats in southern boreal peatlands in Finland. Our results showed that both multi- and hyperspectral data can be used to estimate the moisture content of Sphagnum mosses. Nevertheless, the optimal retrieval method depended on habitat characteristics. Using hyperspectral data, we found that: (i) the CWT exhibited superior performance for all studied moss species (RMarg2= 0.72, ICC = 0.40), (ii) the exponential OPTRAM performed best for the mesotrophic species (RMarg2= 0.70, ICC = 0.08), and (iii) the Modified Moisture Stress Index (MMSI) yielded the best results (RMarg2= 0.68, ICC = 0.55) for the ombrotrophic species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using multispectral data instead of hyperspectral data provides comparable results in moisture estimation when used as input with OPTRAM or Moisture Stress Index (MSI). This approach could lead to new insights into the moisture dynamics in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands over the span of the multispectral satellite era."

McLinden;Enrico Dammers;Andre Fogal,Biomass burning CO emissions: exploring insights through TROPOMI-derived emissions  and emission coefficients,"Satellite-derived CO emissions provide new insights into the understanding of global CO emission rates from wildfires. We use TROPOMI satellite data to create a global inventory database of wildfire CO emissions. These satellite-derived wildfire emissions are used for the evaluation and improvement of existing fire emission inventories and to examine how the wildfire CO emissions have changed over the past 2 decades. 
 Emissions from biomass burning are a significant source of air pollution, which can adversely impact air quality and ecosystems thousands of kilometres downwind. These emissions can be estimated by a bottom-up approach that relies on fuel consumed and standardized emission factors. Emissions are also commonly derived with a top-down approach, using satellite-observed fire radiative power (FRP) as a proxy for fuel consumption. Biomass burning emissions can also be estimated directly from satellite trace gas observations, including carbon monoxide (CO). Here, we explore the potential of satellite-derived CO emission rates from biomass burning and provide new insights into the understanding of satellite-derived fire CO emissions globally, with respect to differences in regions and vegetation type. Specifically, we use the TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) high-spatial-resolution satellite datasets to derive burning CO emissions directly for individual fires between 2019 and 2021 globally. Using synthetic data (with known emissions), we show that the direct emission estimate methodology has a 34 % uncertainty for deriving CO emissions (and a total uncertainty of 44 % including wind and CO column uncertainty). From the TROPOMI-derived CO emissions, we derive biome-specific emission coefficients (emissions relative to FRP) by combining the direct emission estimates and the satellite-observed FRP from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). These emission coefficients are used to establish annual top-down CO emission inventories from biomass burning, showing that Southern Hemisphere Africa has the highest CO biomass burning emissions (over 25 % of global total of 300–390 Mt(CO) yr−1 between 2003–2021), and almost 25 % of global CO biomass burning emissions are from broadleaved evergreen tree fires. A comprehensive comparison between direct estimates, top-down and bottom-up approaches, provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each method:   FINN2.5 has higher CO emissions, by a factor between 2 and 5, than all other inventories assessed in this study. Trends over the past 2 decades are examined for different regions around the globe, showing that global CO biomass burning emissions have, on the whole, decreased (by 5.1 to 8.7 Mt(CO) yr−1), where some regions experience increased and others decreased emissions."

Using 4 years of winter and spring observations in New York City, we found that both the magnitude and variability of CO from the metropolitan area are greater than expected. Transportation emissions cannot explain the missing and variable CO, which points to energy from buildings as a likely underappreciated source of urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Carbon monoxide (CO) is a regulated air pollutant that impacts tropospheric chemistry and is an important indicator of the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels. In this study, we used 4 years (2019–2022) of winter and spring (January–May) atmospheric CO observations to quantify and characterize city-scale CO enhancements (ΔCO) from the New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA). We observed large variability in ΔCO, roughly 60 % of which was explained by atmospheric transport from the surrounding surface areas to the measurement sites, with the remaining 40 % due to changes in emissions on sub-monthly timescales. We evaluated the CO emissions from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), which has been used to scale greenhouse gas emissions, and found the emissions are much too low in magnitude. During the COVID-19 shutdown in spring 2020, we observed a flattening of the diurnal pattern of CO emissions, consistent with reductions in daytime transportation. Our results highlight the role of meteorology in driving the variability in air pollutants and show that the transportation sector is unlikely to account for the non-shutdown observed CO emission magnitude and variability, an important distinction for determining the sources of combustion emissions in urban regions like the NYCMA."

Andrioli,Trends in the high-latitude mesosphere temperature and mesopause revealed by SABER,"Disagreement in long-term trends in the high-latitude mesosphere temperature should be elucidated using one coherent measurement over a long period. Using SABER measurements at high latitudes and binning the data based on yaw cycle, we focus on long-term trends in the mean temperature and mesopause in the high-latitude mesosphere–lower-thermosphere region, which has been rarely studied via observations but is more sensitive to dynamic changes. 
 The temperature trend in the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere (MLT) region can be regarded as an indicator of climate change. Using temperature profiles measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument during 2002–2023 and binning them based on the yaw cycle, we obtain a continuous dataset with a wide local time coverage at 50° S–80° N or 80° S–50° N. The seasonal change in temperature, caused by the forward drift in the SABER yaw cycle, is removed using the climatological temperature of the Naval Research Laboratory's Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter Radar model (MSIS2.0). The corrected temperature without any waves is regarded as the mean temperature. At 50° S–50° N, the cooling trends in the mean temperature are significant in the MLT region and are in agreement with previous studies. The novel finding is that the cooling trends of ≥ l2 K per decade exhibit seasonal symmetry and reach peaks of ≥ 6 K per decade at high latitudes around the summer solstice. Moreover, there are warming trends of 1–2.5 K per decade at an altitude range of 10−2–10−3 hPa, specifically at latitudes higher than 55° N in October and December and at latitudes higher than 55° S in April and August.  Over the past 22 years, the mesopause temperature (altitude) in the northern summer polar region has been  ∼ 5–11 K (∼ 1 km) colder (lower) than that in the corresponding southern region. The trends in the mesopause temperature are dependent on latitudes and months, but they are negative at most latitudes and reach larger magnitudes at high latitudes. These results indicate that the temperature in the high-latitude MLT region is more sensitive to dynamic changes."

The underlying dynamical and chemical mechanisms are responsible for the observed ozone anomalies in both events. Our research sheds light on these processes, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of these processes for more accurate climate modeling and forecasting. 
 The impact of major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events and early final stratospheric warming (FSW) events on ozone variations in the middle atmosphere in the Arctic is investigated by performing microwave radiometer measurements above Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (79° N, 12° E), with GROMOS-C (GRound-based Ozone MOnitoring System for Campaigns). The retrieved daily ozone profiles during SSW and FSW events in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere at 20–70 km from microwave observations are cross-compared to MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder). The vertically resolved structures of polar ozone anomalies relative to the climatologies derived from GROMOS-C, MERRA-2, and MLS shed light on the consistent pattern in the evolution of ozone anomalies during both types of events. For SSW events, ozone anomalies are positive at all altitudes within 30 d after onset, followed by negative anomalies descending in the middle stratosphere. However, positive anomalies in the middle and lower stratosphere and negative anomalies in the upper stratosphere at onset are followed by negative anomalies in the middle stratosphere and positive anomalies in the upper stratosphere during FSW events. Here, we compare results by leveraging the ozone continuity equation with meteorological fields from MERRA-2 and directly using MERRA-2 ozone tendency products to quantify the impact of dynamical and chemical processes on ozone anomalies during SSW and FSW events. We document the underlying dynamical and chemical mechanisms that are responsible for the observed ozone anomalies in the entire life cycle of SSW and FSW events. Polar ozone anomalies in the lower and middle stratosphere undergo a rapid and long-lasting increase of more than 1 ppmv close to SSW onset, which is attributed to the dynamical processes of the horizontal eddy effect and vertical advection. The pattern of ozone anomalies for FSW events is associated with the combined effects of dynamical and chemical terms, which reflect the photochemical processes counteracted partially by positive horizontal eddy transport, in particular in the middle stratosphere. In addition, we find that the variability in polar total column ozone (TCO) is associated with horizontal eddy transport and vertical advection of ozone in the lower stratosphere. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that control changes in polar ozone during the life cycle of SSW and FSW events, providing a new aspect of quantitative analysis of dynamical and chemical fields."

Here, we explore the performance of the Orbitrap chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CI-Orbitrap) using ammonium ion chemistry. This study shows that ammonium-ion-based chemistry associated with the high mass resolution of the Orbitrap mass analyzer can measure almost all inclusive compounds. 
 Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) play an important role in the formation of atmospheric aerosols. Due to various analytical challenges with respect to measuring organic vapors, uncertainties remain regarding the formation and fate of OOMs. The chemical ionization Orbitrap (CI-Orbitrap) mass spectrometer has recently been shown to be a powerful technique that is able to accurately identify gaseous organic compounds due to its greater mass resolution. Here, we present the ammonium-ion-based CI-Orbitrap (NH4+-Orbitrap) as a technique capable of measuring a wide range of gaseous OOMs. The performance of the NH4+-Orbitrap is compared with that of state-of-the-art mass spectrometers, including a nitrate-ion-based chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (NO3--LTOF), a new generation of proton transfer reaction-TOF mass spectrometer (PTR3-TOF), and an iodide-based CI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (I−-CIMS). The instruments were deployed simultaneously in the Cosmic Leaving OUtdoors Droplets (CLOUD) chamber at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) during the CLOUD14 campaign in 2019. Products generated from α-pinene ozonolysis under various experimental conditions were simultaneously measured by the mass spectrometers. The NH4+-Orbitrap was able to identify the widest range of OOMs (i.e., O ≥ 2), from less-oxidized species to highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs). Excellent agreement was found between the NH4+-Orbitrap and the NO3--LTOF with respect to characterizing HOMs and with the PTR3-TOF for the less-oxidized monomeric species. OOM concentrations measured by NH4+-Orbitrap were estimated using calibration factors derived from the OOMs with high time-series correlations during the side-by-side measurements. As with the other mass spectrometry techniques used during this campaign, the detection sensitivity of the NH4+-Orbitrap to OOMs is greatly affected by relative humidity, which may be related to changes in ionization efficiency and/or multiphase chemistry. Overall, this study shows that NH4+-ion-based chemistry associated with the high mass resolution of the Orbitrap mass analyzer can measure almost all inclusive compounds. As a result, it is now possible to cover the entire range of compounds, which can lead to a better understanding of the oxidation processes."

Aerosols directly or indirectly influence the temperature in the atmosphere and can interact with clouds. Details are given on how we derived aerosol properties from our measurements and how we assessed the quality of our data before sharing them with the scientific community. A good correlation was found between the three instruments. 
 Understanding optical and radiative properties of aerosols and clouds is critical to reducing uncertainties in climate models. For over 10 years, the Observatory of Atmospheric Physics in Reunion (OPAR; 21.079° S, 55.383° E) has been operating three active lidar instruments, named lidar 1200 (Li1200), stratospheric ozone lidar (LiO3S), and tropospheric ozone lidar (LiO3T), providing time series of vertical profiles from 3 to 45 km of the aerosol extinction and backscatter coefficients at 355 and 532 nm as well as the linear depolarization ratio at 532 nm. This work provides a full technical description of the three systems, the details about the methods chosen for the signal preprocessing and processing, and an uncertainty analysis. About 1737 nighttime averaged profiles were manually screened to provide cloud-free and artifact-free profiles. Data processing consisted of Klett inversion to retrieve aerosol optical products from preprocessed files. The measurement frequency was lower during the wet season and the holiday periods. There is a good correlation between the Li1200 and LiO3S instruments in terms of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 355 nm (0.001–0.107; R=0.92±0.01) and with LiO3T in terms of Ångström exponent 355/532 (0.079–1.288; R=0.90±0.13). The lowest values of the averaged uncertainty in the aerosol backscatter coefficient for the three time series are 64.4 ± 31.6 % for LiO3S, 50.3 ± 29.0 % for Li1200, and 69.1 ± 42.7 % for LiO3T. These relative uncertainties are high for the three instruments because of the very low values of extinction and backscatter coefficients for background aerosols above Maïdo observatory. Uncertainty increases due to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decrease above 25 km for LIO3S and Li1200 and above 20 km for LiO3T. The lidar ratio (LR) is responsible for an uncertainty increase below 18 km (10 km) for LiO3S and Li1200 (LiO3T). LiO3S is the most stable instrument at 355 nm due to fewer technical modifications and fewer misalignments. Li1200 is a valuable addition meant to fill in the gaps in the LiO3S time series at 355 nm or for specific case studies about the middle and low troposphere.

This database aims to analyze the tropical deep convective systems, the evolution of their associated characteristics over their life cycle, their organization, and their importance in the hydrological and energy cycle. 
 We introduce two databases, TOOCAN (Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm using a 3D segmentatioN) and CACATOES, aimed at facilitating the study of deep convective systems (DCSs) and their morphological characteristics over the intertropical belt during the period spanning from 2012 to 2020. The TOOCAN database is constructed using a tracking algorithm called TOOCAN applied on a homogenized GEOring infrared (IR) archive and enables the documentation of the morphological parameters of each DCS throughout their life cycles. The homogenized GEOring IR database has been built from level-1 data of a fleet of geostationary platforms originating from various sources and has been intercalibrated; spectrally adjusted; and limb-darkening corrected, specifically for high cold clouds, based on a common reference, the IR channel of the Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) radiometer on board the Megha-Tropiques. The resulting infrared observations are then homogeneous for brightness temperatures (BT) <240 K, with a standard deviation lower than 1.5 K, throughout the GEOring. A systematic uncertainty analysis is carried out. First, the radiometric errors are shown to have little impact on the DCS characteristics and occurrences. We further evaluate the impact of missing data and demonstrate that a maximum of 3 h of consecutive missing images represents a favorable compromise for maintaining tracking continuity while minimizing the impact on the DCS morphological parameters. However, beyond this temporal threshold, the segmentation of DCS is significantly compromised, necessitating the interruption of the tracking process. The CACATOES database is derived from the TOOCAN database through a post-processing procedure, which involves projecting the morphological parameters of each deep convective system (DCS) onto a daily 1° × 1° grid. The resultant dataset provides a broader perspective, allowing for an Eulerian analysis of the DCS and facilitating comparisons with auxiliary gridded datasets on the same daily 1° × 1° grid box.Both the TOOCAN and CACATOES databases are provided in a common netCDF format that is compliant with the standards of Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions and the Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD).A total of 15×106 DCSs have been identified over the tropical regions and the 9-year period. The analysis of DCSs over the tropical oceans and continents reveals a large variety of DCS characteristics and organizations. They can last from few hours up to several days, and their cloud shield ranges from 1000 km2 to a few millions of squared kilometers. Oceanic DCSs are characterized by a longer lifetime duration and larger shields. Finally, the DCS geographical distribution is in line with previous DCS climatologies built from other algorithms and satellite observations.All datasets can be accessed via the repository under the following data DOIs:

 Graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming a compelling acceleration strategy for geoscience numerical models due to their powerful computing performance. In this study, AMD's heterogeneous-compute interface for portability (HIP) was implemented to port the GPU acceleration version of the   piecewise parabolic method (PPM) solver (GPU-HADVPPM) from NVIDIA GPUs to China's domestic GPU-like accelerators like GPU-HADVPPM4HIP. Further, it introduced the multi-level hybrid parallelism scheme to improve the total computational performance of the HIP version of the CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions; CAMx-HIP) model on China's domestic heterogeneous cluster. The experimental results show that the acceleration effect of GPU-HADVPPM on the different GPU accelerators is more apparent when the computing scale is more extensive, and the maximum speedup of GPU-HADVPPM on the domestic GPU-like accelerator is 28.9×faster. The hybrid parallelism with a message passing interface (MPI) and HIP enables achieving up to   a 17.2× speedup when configuring 32 CPU cores and GPU-like accelerators on the domestic heterogeneous cluster. The OpenMP technology is introduced further to reduce the computation time of the CAMx-HIP model by 1.9×. More importantly, by comparing the simulation results of GPU-HADVPPM on NVIDIA GPUs and domestic GPU-like accelerators, it is found that the simulation results of GPU-HADVPPM on domestic GPU-like accelerators have less difference than the NVIDIA GPUs. Furthermore, we also show that the data transfer efficiency between CPU and GPU has a meaningful essential impact on heterogeneous computing and point out that optimizing the data transfer efficiency between CPU and GPU is one of the critical directions to improve the computing efficiency of geoscience numerical models in heterogeneous clusters in the future."

The system is based on a regional sea ice‒ocean‒ice shelf coupled model and can assimilate sea ice concentration observations. By assessing the system's performance in sea ice forecasts, we find that the system can provide reliable Antarctic sea ice forecasts for the next 7 d and has the potential to guide ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice zone. 
 An operational synoptic-scale sea ice forecasting system for the Southern Ocean, namely the Southern Ocean Ice Prediction System (SOIPS), has been developed to support ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice zone. Practical application of the SOIPS forecasts had been implemented for the 38th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition for the first time. The SOIPS is configured on an Antarctic regional sea ice–ocean–ice shelf coupled model and an ensemble-based localized error subspace transform Kalman filter data assimilation model. Daily near-real-time satellite sea ice concentration observations are assimilated into the SOIPS to update sea ice concentration and thickness in the 12 ensemble members of the model state. By evaluating the SOIPS performance in forecasting sea ice metrics in a complete melt–freeze cycle from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, this study shows that the SOIPS can provide reliable Antarctic sea ice forecasts. In comparison with non-assimilated EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) data, annual mean root mean square errors in the sea ice concentration forecasts at a lead time of up to 168 h are lower than 0.19, and the integrated ice edge errors in the sea ice forecasts in most freezing months at lead times of 24 and 72 h maintain around 0.5×106 km2 and below 1.0×106 km2, respectively. With respect to the scarce Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) observations, the mean absolute errors in the sea ice thickness forecasts at a lead time of 24 h are lower than 0.3 m, which is in the range of the ICESat-2 uncertainties. Specifically, the SOIPS has the ability to forecast sea ice drift, in both magnitude and direction. The derived sea ice convergence rate forecasts have great potential for supporting ship navigation on a fine local scale. The comparison between the persistence forecasts and the SOIPS forecasts with and without data assimilation further shows that both model physics and the data assimilation scheme play important roles in producing reliable sea ice forecasts in the Southern Ocean."

However, TWP contributions to urban fine particles are poorly understood. Here, 72 paired gas-phase and PM2.5 samples were collected in the urban air of the Pearl River Delta, China. The concentrations of 54 compounds were determined, and 28 TWCs were detected with total concentrations of 3130–317,000 pg/m3. Most p-phenylenediamines (PPDs) were unstable in solvent, likely leading to their low detection rates. The TWCs were mainly (73 ± 26%) in the gas phase. 2-OH-benzothiazole contributed 82 ± 21% of the gas-phase TWCs and benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid contributed 74 ± 18% of the TWCs in PM2.5. Guangzhou and Foshan were “hotspots” for atmospheric TWCs. Most TWC concentrations significantly correlated with the road length nearby. More particulate TWCs were observed than model predictions, probably due to the impacts of nonexchangeable portion and sampling artifacts. Source apportionment combined with characteristic molecular markers indicated that TWPs contributed 13 ± 7% of urban PM2.5. Our study demonstrates that TWPs are important contributors to urban air pollution that could pose risks to humans. There is an urgent need to develop strategies to decrease TWP emissions, along with broader urban air quality improvement strategies."

The possible sampling error is well known, but not well quantified because we are lack of the adequate and regularly distributed measurements. The high resolution of satellite land surface temperature retrieval during night time provide a nice proxy for near surface temperature as both temperatures controlled by surface longwave radiative cooling and the nocturnal temperature inversion depress land‐atmosphere turbulent exchange. The sampling error of mean value and trend were assessed by comparing station point measurements (pixel of ∼0.01°) with grid (1°) mean and national mean from 2001 to 2021. This method permits us to make the first assessment of under‐sampling error and spatial representative error on both national mean and trend of air temperature during nighttime collected at ∼2,400 weather stations over China. The sampling error in national mean temperature is more than 3°C. The under‐sampling error due to lack of observation explains two thirds and the spatial representative error due to the difference between station and grid/regional mean elevation contribute the other one third. The sampling error in trend account for one third of the national mean trend. The urban heat island effect associated with urbanization around the weather stations (spatial representative error) can explain four fifths of the sampling error in trend, which is consistent with existing studies based on air temperature collected at paired weather station."

 Spatially continuous fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mapping with hourly updated is essential for monitoring environmental pollution and promoting public health. The intensive observation of geostationary satellite enables accurate estimation of PM2.5 at a fine-scale.

An Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Multiscale Neural Network (ASTMNN) which contains three sub-networks and an adaptive weight was proposed to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hourly PM2.5. The three subnetworks of ASTMNN are spatial adjacency module (SaM), temporal adjacency module (TaM) and global module (GM), which used to incorporate the information from spatial neighborhood, temporal neighborhood, and global spatiotemporal range, respectively.

This work uses numerical simulations to explore the impact of critical design parameters on the performance of upcoming CO2-observing satellite concepts. 
 Satellites have been providing spaceborne observations of the total column of CO2 (denoted XCO2) for over two decades now, and, with the need for independent verification of Paris Agreement objectives, many new satellite concepts are currently planned or being studied to complement or extend the instruments that already exist. Depending on whether they are targeting natural and/or anthropogenic fluxes of CO2, the designs of these future concepts vary greatly. The characteristics of their shortwave infrared (SWIR) observations notably explore several orders of magnitude in spectral resolution (from λ/Δλ ∼ 400 for Carbon Mapper to λ/Δλ ∼ 25 000 for MicroCarb) and include different selections of spectral bands (from one to four bands, among which there are the CO2-sensitive 1.6 µm and/or 2.05 µm bands). The very nature of the spaceborne measurements is also explored: for instance, the NanoCarb imaging concept proposes to measure CO2-sensitive truncated interferograms, instead of infrared spectra like other concepts, in order to significantly reduce the instrument size. This study synthetically explores the impact of three different design parameters on the XCO2 retrieval performance obtained through optimal estimation: (1) the spectral resolution, (2) the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and (3) the spectral band selection. Similar performance assessments are completed for the exactly defined OCO-2, MicroCarb, Copernicus CO2 Monitoring  (CO2M) and NanoCarb concepts. We show that improving the SNR is more efficient than improving the spectral resolution to increase  XCO2 precision when perturbing these parameters across 2 orders of magnitude, and we find that a low SNR and/or a low spectral resolution yield XCO2 with vertical sensitivities that give more weight to atmospheric layers close to the surface. The exploration of various spectral band combinations illustrates, especially for lower spectral resolutions, how including an O2-sensitive band helps to increase the optical path length information and how the 2.05 µm CO2-sensitive band contains more geophysical information than the 1.6 µm band. With very different characteristics, MicroCarb shows a CO2 information content that is only slightly higher than that of CO2M, which translates into XCO2 random errors that are lower by a factor ranging from 1.1 to 1.9, depending on the observational situation. The performance of NanoCarb for a single pixel of its imager is comparable to those of concepts that measure spectra at low SNR and low spectral resolution, but, as this novel concept would observe a given target several times during a single overpass, its performance improves when combining all the observations. Overall, the broad range of results obtained through this synthetic XCO2 performance mapping hint at the future intercomparison challenges that the wide variety of upcoming CO2-observing concepts will pose."

Variations in the light-absorption properties and molecular composition of BrC due to atmospheric photochemical aging process have not been well constrained, leading to high uncertainty in evaluating its global radiative effect. The molecular composition of atmospheric BrC were investigated to stress the BrC photobleaching in this work. In total, 896 organic compounds were identified, which accounted for 2.5%–26.1% of organic aerosol in mass concentration. We found that solar radiation led to the declined mass absorption coefficient at 375 nm (MAC375), indicating BrC photobleaching, coinciding with an elevated mass fraction of carboxylic acids (CAs). This phenomenon was more pronounced under higher-energy solar radiation. Specifically, the mass fraction of nitrocarboxylic acids (NCAs) in CAs increased during BrC photobleaching, which was potentially caused by the oxidation of nitrophenols, resulting in an ∼83.3% decrease in MAC375. Our findings provide  direct observational evidence of BrC photobleaching from a molecular-level perspective and elucidate a potential BrC photobleaching pathway in the urban atmosphere."

A heat‐budget analysis reveals coupling between cloud‐radiative effects, circulation, and SST gradients in driving multi‐decadal variability in the Eastern Pacific. Using this relationship and observed feedback estimates, we find that internal Eastern Pacific SST variability is underestimated in most models. Adjusting for model bias increases the likelihood of generating a cooling trend at least as large as observations in preindustrial control simulations by ∼ ${\sim} $56% on average. If models underestimate climate “noise,” as our results suggest, this bias should be accounted for when attributing the relative importance of forced versus unforced changes in the climate."

 Precipitation and temperature are critical factors influencing terrestrial water storage (TWS) can lead to unexpected TWS losses when compounded by dryness and high temperatures. Yet, a dynamic assessment of the individual and combined effects of these conditions on TWS is lacking. This study proposes a framework to assess TWS loss driven by compound dry-hot conditions (CDHC) and dynamically evaluates risk probabilities and thresholds for 2003–2012 and 2013–2022. Results showed that CDHC exert a greater impact on TWS than dry or hot conditions alone. The risk probabilities of global TWS loss are higher in the late period than in the early period, with risk probabilities for light and extreme levels increasing by approximately 9–11 % and 2–7 %, respectively. Although the resilience of water resource systems to CDHC has increased in some regions, it still shows a decreasing trend on a global scale. The decrease in the resilience to TWS in major hyperarid areas is primarily influenced by temperature, whereas that in arid areas is primarily affected by precipitation. These distinct patterns may be the primary factors contributing to the exacerbation of global TWS loss. This study provides a novel approach for the dynamic assessment of global TWS under CDHC. The research findings offer valuable insights for decision-makers developing adaptive strategies to mitigate future CDHC challenges."

 The frequency and intensity of global drought events are continuously increasing, posing an elevated risk of forest mortality worldwide. Accurately understanding the impact of drought on forests, particularly the distribution of mortality due to drought, is crucial for scientifically understanding global ecological drought. Atmospheric indicators and soil moisture are typically correlated with tree growth and influence tree water status and drought severity; however, they do not directly represent forest drought conditions. Optical vegetation indices reflect forest mortality but are affected by response delays, low temporal resolution, and cloud contamination. Therefore, the accuracy of current assessment methods for global drought-induced forest mortality, which are based on meteorological and vegetation variables, still needs improvement. To address this challenge, we utilized vegetation optical depth (VOD) data to characterize the changes in forest canopy moisture due to drought. VOD is a parameter that describes the transmissivity of vegetation in the microwave band and is closely related to forest water content and biomass, with longer wavelengths and greater penetration capabilities than visible and near-infrared remote sensing signals. We calculated the annual variation of VOD (ΔVOD) as a supplementary indicator to enhance the accuracy of monitoring and modeling of global drought-induced forest mortality. We integrated VOD with vegetation indices, meteorological data, terrain, and other variables to construct a predictive model of forest mortality due to drought and used this model to generate a series of global maps depicting drought-induced forest mortality. The results indicated that variables related to VOD contributed significantly to the mortality model compared with those based on vegetation or meteorological variables. Furthermore, ΔVOD exhibited a higher correlation with reference mortality rates compared to relative water content, the enhanced vegetation index, and climate water deficit. Notably, by validating the model fit with reference mortality rates, we found that incorporating ΔVOD into the model improved the accuracy of the global forest mortality map from R2 = 0.45 to R2 = 0.63. By optimizing the training points using a two-stage correlation threshold between ΔVOD and the reference mortality, map accuracy was further improved to R2 = 0.72. This study highlights the effectiveness of VOD, particularly ΔVOD, as a direct indicator of vegetation water content variation, for predicting drought-induced forest mortality. The global forest mortality map obtained from 2014 to 2018 is of significant value for the further analysis of forest carbon variations induced by extreme global drought events."

 Ongoing advances in satellite remote sensing data and machine learning methods have enabled crop yield estimation at various spatial and temporal resolutions. While yield mapping at broader scales (e.g., state or county level) has become common, mapping at finer scales (e.g., field or subfield) has been limited by the lack of ground truth data for model training and evaluation. Here we present a scale transfer framework, named Quantile loss Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (QDANN), that leverages knowledge from county-level datasets to map crop yields at the subfield level. Based on the strategy of unsupervised domain adaptation, QDANN is trained on labeled county-level data and unlabeled subfield-level data, with no requirement for yield information at the subfield level. We evaluate the proposed method applied to Landsat imagery and Gridmet weather data for maize, soybean, and winter wheat fields in the United States, using as reference data yield monitor records from roughly one million field-year observations. The model is compared with several process-based and machine learning-based benchmark approaches that train on simulated yield records or county-level data. QDANN-estimated yields achieved an R2 score (RMSE) of 48 % (2.29 t/ha), 32 % (0.85 t/ha), and 39 % (1.40 t/ha) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat in comparison with the ground-based yield measures, respectively. These performances are higher than benchmark approaches and are nearly as good as models trained on field-level data. When aggregated to the county level, the improvement achieved by QDANN is more pronounced and the R2 scores (RMSE) improved to 78 % (0.98 t/ha), 62 % (0.37 t/ha), and 53 % (1.00 t/ha) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat, respectively. This study demonstrates that the proposed scale transfer framework can serve as a reliable approach for yield mapping at the subfield level when there is no access to fine-scale yield information. Based on the QDANN model, we have generated and made publicly available 30-m annual yield maps for major crop-producing states in the U.S. since 2008."
10.5194/acp-24-9401-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了航空飞行产生的尾迹对气候的影响，以及如何通过改变飞行路线来避免尾迹形成，从而减少航空业对气候的影响。论文使用卫星观测数据和气候模型来评估尾迹和二氧化碳排放对气候的影响，并比较了不同方法计算出的气候影响结果。研究发现，不同的计算方法会导致不同的结果，但对于是否应该改变飞行路线以避免尾迹形成，最终的决策结果基本一致。论文强调了选择合适的二氧化碳当量指标对于评估尾迹避免策略的重要性，并指出这最终是一个政治决策问题。,"['contrail', 'climate impact', 'CO2-equivalence', 'satellite observation', 'air traffic', 'aviation', 'atmospheric composition', 'temperature response', 'climate modeling']",Audran Borella;Olivier Boucher;Keith P. Shine;Marc Stettler;Katsumasa Tanaka;Roger Teoh;Nicolas Bellouin,The importance of an informed choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance,"This work studies how to compare the climate impact of the CO2 emitted and contrails formed by a flight. This is applied to contrail avoidance strategies that would decrease climate impact of flights by changing the trajectory of aircraft to avoid persistent contrail formation, at the risk of increasing CO2 emissions. We find that different comparison methods lead to different quantification of the total climate impact of a flight but lead to similar decisions of whether to reroute an aircraft. 
 One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half a million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare it to the temperature response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, represented here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 17.2 µK in 2039, 13.7 µK in 2069, and 14.1 µK in 2119. Under an idealised scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.9 (−28 %), 2.6 (−19 %), and 1.9 (−13 %) µK in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice of metric implies a focus on a specific climate objective, which is ultimately a political decision."

In this study, we examined the LF magnetic fields measured in Malacca, Malaysia, to probe reflection heights of the lower ionosphere near the equator on three different nights in 2021. The results show that the virtual ionospheric height at nighttime typically ranged from 82.0 to 90.0 km, with a mean value of 85.3 km. Our measurements also revealed significant variations in the virtual ionospheric height across different regions over a spatial scale of about 800 km. The maximum height difference was about 5.0 km. Moreover, the fluctuation characteristics are observed in both estimated ionospheric height and calculated peak reflection ratio during similar periods. This fluctuation may be related to atmospheric gravity waves in the nighttime ionosphere. In addition, we compared the virtual ionospheric height estimated from CG strokes of different polarities, and the results showed that the virtual reflection height for positive CG strokes is lower than that for negative ones."

Measurements characterizing precipitation in low‐level mixed‐phase clouds, which frequently form over the SO, are rare, and our understanding of precipitation efficacy within these clouds remains limited. The simulated surface precipitation bias has an indirect effect on determining global climate sensitivity and a direct impact on the hydrological cycle. This study investigates the representation of low clouds, cloud variability, and precipitation statistics over the SO in real‐case Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) simulations at the kilometer scale. The simulations are contrasted with 48 hr of continuous shipborne observations of open and closed‐cell stratocumuli, south of Tasmania. Our simulations show the significance of heavily rimed particle formation, their in‐cloud growth, and subcloud melting to capture the observed cloud‐precipitation vertical structure. In addition, supercooled drizzle formation impacts the vertical structure and precipitation statistics. ICON captures the observed intermittency of precipitation even at a standard vertical resolution of 200 m in the boundary layer but only captures the observed sparse distribution of intense precipitation (>1 mm hr−1) when the maximum vertical resolution is reduced to 100 m. However, the simulations of the 2‐day accumulated precipitation and the radiative effect are largely insensitive to the vertical resolution. The cloud reflectivity of the broken cloud deck is underestimated due to negative biases in cloud optical depth."

To assess the effectiveness of current air pollution mitigation measures, we used a 3D global chemical transport model to analyze the projected optical depth of carbonaceous aerosol (AOD) in India under representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 over the period 2000–2100. Our results show a decrease in future emissions, leading to a decrease in modeled AOD under both RCPs after 2030. The RCP4.5 scenario shows a 48%–65% decrease in AOD by the end of the century, with the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP) experiencing a maximum change of ∼ ${\sim} $25% by 2030 compared to 2010. Conversely, RCP8.5 showed an increase in AOD of ∼ ${\sim} $29% by 2050 and did not indicate a significant decrease by the end of the century. Our study also highlights that it is likely to take three decades for current policies to be effective for regions heavily polluted by exposure to carbonaceous aerosols, such as the IGP and eastern India. We emphasize the importance of assessing the effectiveness of current policies and highlight the need for continued efforts to address the problem of air pollution from carbonaceous aerosols, both from anthropogenic sources and biomass burning, in India."

The Simplified Simple Biosphere Model version 4 (SSiB4) was coupled with the Top‐down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics Model (TRIFFID) and a mechanistic representation of SIF. Incorporating dynamic vegetation processes reduced global SIF root‐mean‐squared error (RMSE) by 12%. Offline experiments were conducted to understand the water and carbon cycles and their interactions using satellite data as constraints. Results indicate that soil hydraulic properties, the soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation (Ks) and the water retention curve, significantly impact soil moisture and SIF simulation, especially in the semi‐arid regions. The wilting point and maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (Vmax) affect photosynthesis and transpiration, then soil moisture. However, without atmospheric feedback processes, their effects on soil moisture are undermined due to the compensation between soil evaporation and transpiration. With optimized parameters based on SMAP L3 and OCO‐2 data, the global RMSE of soil moisture and SIF simulations decreased by 15% and 12%, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of integrating advanced satellite data and dynamic vegetation processes to improve land surface models, enhancing understanding of terrestrial water and carbon cycles."

While the hot channel of lightning strokes directly produce significant amounts of nitrogen oxide, no direct emission of O3 is expected. Corona discharges in convective active regions could explain local O3 increases, which remains unexplained. We present the first mathematical functions that relate the global annual frequency of in-cloud coronas with four sets of meteorological variables. 
 Four parameterizations, distinguishing between land and ocean, have been developed to simulate global distributions of thundercloud streamer corona discharges (also known as Blue LUminous Events or BLUEs) mainly producing bluish optical emissions associated with the second positive system of N2 accompanied by no (or hardly detectable) 777.4 nm light emission. BLUEs occur globally about 12 times less frequently (Soler et al., 2022) than lightning flashes. The four schemes are based on non-linear functions of the cloud-top height (CTH), the product of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and total precipitation (TP), the product of CAPE and specific cloud liquid water content (CLWC), and the product of CAPE and specific cloud snow water content (CSWC). Considering that thunderstorms occur on hourly timescales, these parameterizations have been tested using hourly ERA5 data (except for CTH, not available in ERA5) for the meteorological variables considered, finding that the proposed BLUE schemes work fine and are consistent with observations by the Atmosphere–Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM). Moreover, the parameterizations have been implemented in a global chemistry–climate model that generates annual and seasonal global distributions for present-day and end of 21st century climate scenarios. Present-day predictions are in reasonable agreement with recent observations by the ASIM.  Predictions for the end of the 21st century suggest BLUE occurrence rates that range between 13 % higher (∼ 3 % K−1) and 52 % higher (∼ 13 % K−1) than present-day average occurrences of BLUEs."

Shaw,Glaciation of mixed-phase clouds: insights from bulk model and bin-microphysics large-eddy simulation informed by laboratory experiment,"We employ two methods to examine a laboratory experiment on clouds with both ice and liquid phases. The first assumes well-mixed properties; the second resolves the spatial distribution of turbulence and cloud particles. Results show that while the trends in mean properties generally align, when turbulence is resolved, liquid droplets are not fully depleted by ice due to incomplete mixing. This underscores the threshold of ice mass fraction in distinguishing mixed-phase clouds from ice clouds. 
 Mixed-phase clouds affect precipitation and radiation differently from liquid and ice clouds, posing greater challenges to their representation in numerical simulations. Recent laboratory experiments using the Pi Cloud Chamber explored cloud glaciation conditions based on increased injection of ice-nucleating particles. In this study, we use two approaches to reproduce the results of the laboratory experiments: a bulk scalar mixing model and large-eddy simulation (LES) with bin microphysics. The first approach assumes a well-mixed domain to provide an efficient assessment of the mean cloud properties for a wide range of conditions. The second approach resolves the energy-carrying turbulence, the particle size distribution, and their spatial distribution to provide more details. These modeling approaches enable a separate and detailed examination of liquid and ice properties, which is challenging in the laboratory. Both approaches demonstrate that, with an increased ice number concentration, the flow and microphysical properties exhibit the same changes in trends. Additionally, both approaches show that the ice integral radius reaches the theoretical glaciation threshold when the cloud is subsaturated with respect to liquid water. The main difference between the results of the two approaches is that the bulk model allows for the complete glaciation of the cloud. However, LES reveals that, in a dynamic system, the cloud is not completely glaciated as liquid water droplets are continuously produced near the warm lower boundary and subsequently mixed into the chamber interior. These results highlight the importance of the ice mass fraction in distinguishing the mixed-phase clouds and ice clouds."

Wofsy,Methane retrieval from MethaneAIR using the CO2 proxy approach: a demonstration for the upcoming MethaneSAT mission,"MethaneSAT is an upcoming satellite mission designed to monitor methane emissions from the oil and gas (O&amp;G) industry globally. Here, we present observations from the first flight campaign of MethaneAIR, a MethaneSAT-like instrument mounted on an aircraft. MethaneAIR can map methane with high precision and accuracy over a typically sized oil and gas basin (~200 km2) in a single flight. This paper demonstrates the capability of the upcoming satellite to routinely track global O&amp;G emissions. 
 Reducing methane (CH4) emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) sector is crucial for mitigating climate change in the near term. MethaneSAT is an upcoming satellite mission designed to monitor basin-wide O&G emissions globally, providing estimates of emission rates and helping identify the underlying processes leading to methane release in the atmosphere. MethaneSAT data will support advocacy and policy efforts by helping to track methane reduction commitments and targets set by countries and industries. Here, we introduce a CH4 retrieval algorithm for MethaneSAT based on the CO2 proxy method. We apply the algorithm to observations from the maiden campaign of MethaneAIR, an airborne precursor to the satellite that has similar instrument specifications. The campaign was conducted during winter 2019 and summer 2021 over three major US oil and gas basins.Analysis of MethaneAIR data shows that measurement precision is typically better than 2 % at a 20×20 m2 pixel resolution, exhibiting no strong dependence on geophysical variables, e.g., surface reflectance. We show that detector focus drifts over the course of each flight, likely due to thermal gradients that develop across the optical bench. The impacts of this drift on retrieved CH4 can mostly be mitigated by including a parameter that squeezes the laboratory-derived, tabulated instrument spectral response function (ISRF) in the spectral fit. Validation against coincident EM27/SUN retrievals shows that MethaneAIR values are generally within 1 % of the retrievals. MethaneAIR retrievals were also intercompared with retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We estimate that the mean bias between the instruments is 2.5 ppb, and the latitudinal gradients for the two data sets are in good agreement.We evaluate the accuracy of MethaneAIR estimates of point-source emissions using observations recorded over the Permian Basin, an O&G basin, based on the integrated-mass-enhancement approach coupled with a plume-masking algorithm that uses total variational denoising. We estimate that the median point-source detection threshold is 100–150 kg h−1 at the aircraft's nominal above-surface observation altitude of 12 km. This estimate is based on an ensemble of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) large-eddy simulations used to mimic the campaign's conditions, with the threshold for quantification set at approximately twice the detection threshold. Retrievals from repeated basin surveys indicate the presence of both persistent and intermittent sources, and we highlight an example from each case. For the persistent source, we infer emissions from a large O&G processing facility and estimate a leak rate between 1.6 % and 2.1 %, higher than any previously reported emission levels from a facility of its size. We also identify a ruptured pipeline that could increase total basin emissions by 2 % if left unrepaired; this pipeline was discovered 2 weeks before it was found by its operator, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring by future satellite missions. The results showcase MethaneAIR's capability to make highly accurate, precise measurements of methane dry-air mole fractions in the atmosphere, with a fine spatial resolution (∼ 20×20 m2) mapped over large swaths (∼ 100×100 km2) in a single flight. The results provide confidence that MethaneSAT can make such measurements at unprecedentedly fine scales from space (∼ 130×400 m2 pixel size over a target area measuring ∼ 200×200 km2), thereby delivering quantitative data on basin-wide methane emissions."

One (referred to as LMD NLISv8.3) uses a machine-learning approach, while the other (RALv2.0) uses a more conventional optimal estimation approach. We used a variety of model and independent reference measurement data to assess both products' overall quality, their differences, and specific aspects of each product that would benefit from further analysis by the product development teams. 
 In this study, we carried out an independent validation of two methane retrieval algorithms using spectra from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) that has been aboard the Meteorological Operational Satellite A (MetOp-A) since 2006. Both algorithms, one developed by the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD), called the non-linear inference scheme (NLISv8.3), and the other by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), referred to as RALv2.0, provide long-term global CH4 concentrations using distinctively different retrieval approaches (neural network vs. optimal estimation, respectively). They also differ with respect to the vertical range covered, where LMD provides mid-tropospheric dry-air mole fractions (mtCH4), and RAL provides mixing ratio profiles from which we can derive total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (XCH4) and potentially two partial column layers (qCH4).We compared both CH4 products using the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) model, in situ profiles (range extended using CAMS model data), and ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) remote-sensing measurements. The average difference (in mtCH4) with respect to in situ profiles for LMD ranges between −0.3 and 10.9 ppb, while for RAL the XCH4 difference ranges between −4.6 and −1.6 ppb. The standard deviation (SD) of the observed differences between in situ measurements and RAL retrievals is 14.1–21.9 ppb, which is consistently smaller than that between LMD retrievals and in situ measurements (15.2–30.6 ppb). By comparing with ground-based FTIR sites, the mean differences are within ±10 ppb for both RAL and LMD retrievals. However, the SD of the differences at the ground-based FTIR stations shows significantly lower values for RAL (11–15 ppb) than for LMD (about 25 ppb).The long-term trend and seasonal cycles of CH4 derived from the LMD and RAL products are further investigated and discussed. The seasonal variation in XCH4 derived from RAL is consistent with the seasonal variation observed by the ground-based FTIR measurements. However, the overall 2007–2015 XCH4 trend derived from RAL measurements is underestimated, if not adjusted, for an anomaly occurring on 16 May 2013 due to a L1 calibration change. For LMD, we see very good agreement at the (sub)tropics (<35° N–35° S) but notice deviations in the seasonal cycle (both in the amplitude and phase) and an underestimation of the long-term trend with respect to the RAL and reference data at higher-latitude sites."

The global datasets are generated at a high spatial resolution of about 25 km with an interval of 30 min. The new datasets are compared against ground truth and verified. They will be useful for various applications such as air quality monitoring, climate research, pollution diurnal variability, long-range smoke and dust transport, and evaluation of regional and global models. 
 This comprehensive study analyzed aerosol products from six low-Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) sensors. LEO sensors like the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and VIsible InfraRed Suite (VIIRS) provide one to two daily global measurements, while GEO sensors (Advanced Himawari Imager: AHI, Advanced Baseline Imager: ABI) offer high-frequency data (∼ 10 min) over specific regions. The combination of LEO and GEO capabilities offers expanded coverage of the global aerosol system if aerosol retrievals are applied consistently across all sensors and packaged in an easy-to-use product. The Dark Target aerosol retrieval algorithm was applied to the six sensors, and the resulting Level 2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) products were gridded and merged into a Level 3 quarter-degree latitude–longitude grid with a 30 min temporal resolution, providing the necessary consistency and packaging. Validation of this packaged Level 3 AOD product against Aerosol Robotics NETwork (AERONET) measurements across global locations showcased the merged product's robustness with a correlation coefficient of 0.83, revealing a global mean bias of approximately ±0.05, with 65.5 % of retrievals falling within an expected uncertainty range, underlining the reliability of the dataset. The new gridded Level 3 dataset significantly improved daily global coverage to nearly 45 %, overcoming the limitations of individual sensors, which typically range from 12 % to 25 %. Furthermore, this merged dataset approximates the diurnal cycle of AOD observed by AERONET, thus offering insights into diurnal signatures retrieved elsewhere. The resulting dataset's high spatiotemporal resolution and improved global coverage, especially in regions covered by GEO sensors (Americas and Asia), make it a valuable tool for diverse applications. Tracking aerosol transport from phenomena like wildfires and dust storms is gaining precision, enabling enhanced air quality forecasting and hindcasting. Additionally, the study positions the merged dataset as a significant asset for evaluating and intercomparing regional or global model simulations, which was previously unattainable in such a gridded format. The dataset and fusion framework layout in this study have the potential to include data from recently (future) launched other GEO (FCI, AMI) and LEO (PACE, VIIRS-JPSS) sensors."

Comparison with two versions of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model highlight how the data can be used to assess updates to key model parameterizations. 
 A newly available radiative flux dataset specifically designed to enable the evaluation of the diurnal cycle in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes as captured by climate and Earth system models is presented. Observations over the period 2007–2012 made by the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument are used to derive monthly hourly mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and reflected shortwave (RSW) fluxes on a regular 1° latitude–longitude grid covering approximately 60° N–60° S and 60° E–60° W. The impact of missing data is evaluated in detail, and a data-filling solution is implemented using estimates of broadband fluxes from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager flying on the same Meteosat platform, scaled to the GERB observations. This relatively simple approach is shown to deliver an approximate improvement by a factor of 10 in both the bias caused by missing data and the associated variability in the error. To demonstrate the utility of this V1.1 filled GERB Observations for Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (Obs4MIPs) dataset, comparisons are made to radiative fluxes from two climate configurations of the Hadley Centre's Global Environmental Model: HadGEM3-GC3.1 and HadGEM3-GC5.0. Focusing on marine stratocumulus and deep convective cloud regimes, diurnally resolved comparisons between the models and observations highlight discrepancies between the model configurations in terms of their ability to capture the diurnal amplitude and the phase in TOA fluxes, details that cannot be diagnosed by comparisons at lower temporal resolutions. For these cloud regimes the GC5.0 configuration shows improved fidelity to the observations relative to GC3.1, although notable differences remain. The V1.1 filled GERB Obs4MIPs monthly hourly TOA fluxes are available from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis, with the OLR fluxes accessible at https://doi.org/10.5285/90148d9b1f1c40f1ac40152957e25467 (Bantges et al., 2023a) and the RSW fluxes accessible at https://doi.org/10.5285/57821b58804945deaf4cdde278563ec2 (Bantges et al., 2023b)."

While evaluating recent developments in EC-Earth3-AerChem, this study aims to understand the extent to which the Twomey effect manifests itself at larger scales. We find a reduction in the warm bias over the Southern Ocean due to model improvements. While we see footprints of the Twomey effect at larger scales, the negative relationship between cloud droplet number and liquid water drives the shortwave radiative effect. 
 Given the importance of aerosols and clouds and their interactions in the climate system, it is imperative that the global Earth system models accurately represent processes associated with them. This is an important prerequisite if we are to narrow the uncertainties in future climate projections. In practice, this means that continuous model evaluations and improvements grounded in observations are necessary. Numerous studies in the past few decades have shown both the usability and the limitations of utilizing satellite-based observations in understanding and evaluating aerosol–cloud interactions, particularly under varying meteorological and satellite sensor sensitivity paradigms. Furthermore, the vast range of spatio-temporal scales at which aerosol and cloud processes occur adds another dimension to the challenges faced when evaluating climate models.In this context, the aim of this study is two-fold. (1) We evaluate the most recent, significant changes in the representation of aerosol and cloud processes implemented in the EC-Earth3-AerChem model in the framework of the EU project FORCeS compared with its previous CMIP6 version (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6; https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/, last access: 13 February 2019). We focus particularly on evaluating cloud physical properties and radiative effects, wherever possible, using a satellite simulator. We report on the overall improvements in the EC-Earth3-AerChem model. In particular, the strong warm bias chronically seen over the Southern Ocean is reduced significantly. (2) A statistical, maximum covariance analysis is carried out between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud droplet (CD) effective radius based on the recent EC-Earth3-AerChem/FORCeS simulation to understand to what extent the Twomey effect can manifest itself in the larger spatio-temporal scales. We focus on the three oceanic low-level cloud regimes that are important due to their strong net cooling effect and where pollution outflow from the nearby continent is simultaneously pervasive. We report that the statistical covariability between AOD and CD effective radius is indeed dominantly visible even at the climate scale when the aerosol amount and composition are favourably preconditioned to allow for aerosol–cloud interactions. Despite this strong covariability, our analysis shows a strong cooling/warming in shortwave cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere in our study regions associated with an increase/decrease in CD effective radius. This cooling/warming can be attributed to the increase/decrease in low cloud fraction, in line with previous observational studies."

These adverse impacts underlined the need for better understanding of this phenomenon and to formulate mitigating actions. While previous research has focused on local weather drivers of wildfires, our knowledge about their large‐scale climatic controls remains limited, especially in tropical Africa, which stands out as a global hotspot for fire emissions. Here, we show that interannual variability of carbon emission due to fires in the southern Congo Basin is strongly linked to low‐level winds that are controlled by the Indian Ocean subtropical high. The interhemispheric transport of these emissions to West Africa relies on the intensity and position of both Indian and South Atlantic subtropical highs. Combined effects of this transport mechanism and carbon production in the source region explain a majority of the interannual variability of black carbon in West Africa."

Here, we examine the evolving behavior of NEGIS, with focus on summer speedup at Zachariae Isstrøm, one of the NEGIS outlet glaciers, which has exhibited rapid retreat and acceleration, indicative of its vulnerability to changing climate conditions. Through a combination of Sentinel‐1 data, in‐situ GPS observations, and numerical ice flow modeling from 2007, we investigate the mechanisms driving short‐term changes. Our analysis reveals a summer speedup in ice flow both near the terminus and inland, with satellite data detecting changes up to 60 km inland, while GPS data capture changes up to 190 km inland along the glacier center line. We attribute this summer speedup to variations in subglacial hydrology, where surface meltwater runoff influences basal friction over the melt season.

However, existing official cloud products from the advanced geostationary radiation imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun‐4A geostationary satellite lack spatiotemporal continuity and important micro‐physical properties. In this study, an image‐based transfer learning ResUnet (TL‐ResUnet) model was applied to realize all‐day and high‐precision retrieval of cloud physical parameters from AGRI thermal infrared measurements. Combining the observation advantages of geostationary and polar‐orbiting satellites, the TL‐ResUnet model was pre‐trained with official cloud products from advanced Himawari imager (AHI) and transfer‐trained with official cloud products from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), respectively. For comparison, a pixel‐based transfer learning random forest (TL‐RF) model was trained using the equally distributed data sets. Taking MODIS official products as the benchmarks, the TL‐ResUnet model achieved an overall accuracy of 79.82% for identifying cloud phase and root mean squared errors of 1.99 km, 7.11 μm, and 12.87 for estimating cloud top height, cloud effective radius, and cloud optical thickness, outperforming the precision of AGRI and AHI official products. Compared to the TL‐RF model, the TL‐ResUnet model utilized the spatial information of clouds to significantly improve the retrieval performance and achieve more than a 6‐fold increase in speed for single full‐disk retrieval. Moreover, AGRI TL‐ResUnet products with spatiotemporal continuity and high precision were used to accurately describe the spatial distribution characteristics of cloud fractions and cloud properties over the Tibetan Plateau, and provide the diurnal variation of cloud cover and cloud properties across different seasons for the first time."

In the context of the expanding trend of vegetation greening, the development of high‐precision vegetation data and accurate BVOC emission estimates are essential to develop effective air pollution control measures. In this study, by integrating the multi‐source vegetation cover data, we established a high‐resolution vegetation distribution (HRVD) data set to develop a high spatio‐temporal resolution emission inventory and investigated the impact of different land cover data sets on emission simulation and impact of land cover change on BVOC emissions during 2001–2020. The annual total BVOC emissions in China for 2020 was 15.66 Tg, which were mainly from trees. The emissions simulated by CNLUCC and MODIS data sets were 1.53% and 1.72% higher than those simulated by HRVD data sets, respectively. The spatial distribution of emission differences was consistent with that of land cover differences. The simulated BVOC emissions by the HRVD data set had the best accuracy as they improved the bias between modeling and observation from 69.06% to 65.35% and decreased the underprediction of observations by a factor of 2.13 compared with simulation by MEGAN default vegetation data. The annual BVOC emissions caused by changing vegetation distribution and LAIv (LAI of vegetation covered surfaces) enhanced at a rate of 72.06 Gg yr−1 during 2001–2020. LAIv was the main driver of emission variations. The total OH reactivity of the resulted BVOC emissions increased at a rate of 1.59 s−1 yr−1, with isoprene contributed the most."

Moreover, surface ozone in this region exhibits sharp spatial gradients and distinctive diurnal cycles under the influence of complex boundary layer circulations induced by the intricate coastal geometry. This study examines how surface ozone is impacted by local circulations spatially and temporally under different temperature scenarios (all summer days, hot summer days, and extreme heat days) with the help of cluster‐based meteorological conditions during the summertime of 2017–2019. The most polluted days are found to be highly associated with hot sea breeze days with weak background flow. When sea breeze development in the New York Bight is delayed and its penetration north is intercepted by the dominant westerlies during hot summer days, daily maximum 8‐hr average ozone (DMA8) in some ozone hot spots of New York City (NYC) and the south shore of Connecticut (CT) typically drops 9–10 ppb under comparable temperature levels. The average regional decrease of DMA8 for NYC and coastal CT is 6.7 and 8.3 ppb, respectively. Furthermore, we conclude that a change in early morning meridional wind direction is the most critical meteorological characteristic in controlling sea breeze onset type and helping modulate ozone exceedances in the region during extreme hot days when ozone exceedances are expected to be very common. The conclusion is further demonstrated with two case studies during the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study 2018 field campaign."

For all vertical profile techniques, SS cases exhibit a near‐linear increase in reflectivity from −30 to 0°C whereas ZDR and Kdp locally peak in the dendritic growth layer. LES cases universally exhibit negative ZDR, rather high Z, negligible Kdp, and near‐unity ρhv. Ground measurements from the past OWLeS campaign provide direct evidence that conical graupel may strongly affect these polarimetric measurements in LES bands. Aggregation efficiencies for SS cases are estimated by optimizing the theoretical number concentration (Nt) and mean volume diameter (Dm) steady‐state vertical profiles against radar‐retrieved profiles derived from 20 of the 25 synoptic storm RD‐QVPs. The median estimated aggregation efficiency is approximately 0.15 with a relatively narrow interquartile range that spans from 0.1 to just over 0.2. Values of optimized aggregation efficiencies are nearly independent of the assumed gamma distribution shape parameter. These results are used to derive temperature‐dependent, climatological steady‐state relations for vertical profiles of Nt, Dm, and liquid‐equivalent snowfall rates. These results can be used in numerical weather prediction model aggregation parameterizations and can also provide climatologically representative vertical profiles of radar and microphysical quantities."

The intricate and non-linear interactions between PM2.5 and O3 on a national scale over long-term records are not well understood. Here, we proposed a novel multi-layer network approach to bridge the gap. Our findings reveal that the variability of O3 precedes that of PM2.5 by one day. The degree, weighted degree, and edge distance follow a power-law decay distribution, suggesting that their relationship is not a random process. O3 concentration in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and eastern Shandong Province significantly impacts the PM2.5 levels in surrounding areas. Conversely, PM2.5 concentrations in Shandong Province, Henan Province, YRD and Pearl River Delta (PRD) have a strong influence on O3 levels. Moreover, we quantified the seasonality of the interactions and elucidated the underlying reasons. The results revealed the interactions between PM2.5 and O3 are intricately tied to atmospheric oxidation processes. More specifically, in summer, the atmospheric oxidation has a strong impact on the interactions in key regions, such as the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei,YRD region and Fenwei Plain. However, the PRD region experiences a more pronounced effect from atmospheric oxidation on this relationship in winter. These findings demonstrate that it is crucial to effectively regulate atmospheric oxidation to mitigate PM2.5 and O3.

Both forcing and feedbacks are related to the mean climate state. Higher magnitude cloud radiative effects generally mean larger magnitude net negative forcing and larger magnitude net positive feedback. Aerosol forcing is broadly related to the susceptibility of clouds to drop number. Feedbacks also related to susceptibility, but to a lesser extent and in different regions to aerosol forcing. Aerosol forcing and cloud feedbacks are anti‐correlated in the CAM6 PPE such that stronger negative forcing is associated with stronger positive feedbacks. Even the processes governing forcing and feedback sensitivity in the PPE are similar. These include the warm rain formation process, ice loss processes and deep convective intensity."

 The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, hosting the world’s largest alpine pastures, plays a pivotal environmental role in Asia. These ecosystems face alterations driven by both climate change and anthropogenic activities, resulting in the widespread consideration of grassland degradation. From 2000 to 2020, the northern Xizang Plateau experienced a pronounced escalation in drought conditions, particularly following a management policy aimed at combating grassland degradation, via restricting livestock numbers and implementing fencing enclosures, initiated in 2009. Specially, following the enforcement of this policy (2010–2020), there was a substantial 13.5 % reduction in soil moisture levels compared to the pre-implementation period (2000–2009), accompanied by a 42.8 % increase in drought severity (measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) and an 11.6 % rise in drought duration. Under these challenging drought conditions, we identified negative trends of potential grassland Net Primary Productivity (NPP) which in absence of anthropogenic influence, as simulated by terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM). Contrary to this simulation, satellite time series observations revealed a widespread increase in actual grassland productivity. Remarkably, despite the challenging drought conditions between 2010 and 2020, we observed a substantial increase of 4.8 % in actual NPP (measured by light use efficiency model), 2.7 % in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), 10 % in solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and 7.95 % in Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), respectively. Much of this enhancement in grassland productivity occurred in areas where livestock populations had markedly declined. Notably, the percentage of NPP increase mainly caused by degradation-combating actions doubled from 24.8 % during 2000–2009 to 49.8 % during 2010–2020 across the northern Xizang Plateau. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of large-scale degradation-combating actions to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and contribute to a greener Earth."

Here, we compare the climate and air pollution-related health damages from electric versus diesel long-haul truck fleets. We use truck commodity flows to estimate tailpipe emissions from diesel trucks and regional grid emissions intensities to estimate charging emissions from electric trucks under various grid scenarios. We use a reduced complexity air quality model combined with valuation of air pollution-related premature deaths (using two hazard ratios (HRs)) and quantify the distributional health impacts in different scenarios. We find that annual health and climate costs of the current diesel fleet are $195–$249/capita compared to $174–$205/capita for a new diesel fleet, and $156–$177/capita for an electric fleet, depending on the HR. We find that freight electrification could avoid $6.2–8.5 billion in health and climate damages annually when compared to a fleet of new diesel vehicles (with even higher benefits when compared to the current diesel fleet). However, the Midwest and parts of the Gulf Coast would experience an increase in health damages due to vehicles charging using electricity from coal power plants. If old coal power plants (operating in 1980 or earlier) are replaced with zero-emission generation, electrification of all U.S. freight would result in $32.3–39.2 billion in avoided damages annually and health benefits throughout the U.S. Electrifying transport of consumer manufacturing goods (including electronics, transport equipment, and precision instruments) and food, beverage, and tobacco products would provide the largest absolute health and climate benefits, whereas mixed freight and manufacturing goods would result in the largest benefits per tonne-km. We find small variations in health damages across race and income. These results will help policymakers prioritize electrification and charging investment strategies for the freight transportation sub-sector."

The long-term changes of growing season heatwaves, as well as their impacts on croplands productivity, are crucial to food security, but remain unclear. Here, we investigated changes in the frequency, intensity and magnitude of growing season heatwaves from the past to the future over the global croplands, based on observations and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models. We introduced an index, gross primary productivity (GPP) exposure, as a proxy of the overall impact of heatwaves on cropland productivity. The results show that the frequency and intensity of growing season heatwaves have increased since 1950 and will continue throughout the 21st century. The increase of the annual accumulated magnitude of growing season heatwaves in the future is mainly contributed by the increase of heatwave frequency. This leads to a global-scale increase in the GPP exposure to growing season heatwaves, with Asia, North America, and Europe being the most affected. The continued increase in GPP exposure is dominated by increases in heatwaves rather than GPP itself. Under the lower emission scenario SSP1-2.6, the global cropland GPP exposure will reduce by 86.11% and 330.47% relative to that under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the end of 21st century.

The drizzle processes significantly alter sub-cloud aerosol budgets and impact the ACI assessments. 
 The aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions within the cloud-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) are examined using aircraft in situ measurements from Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) and Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) field campaigns. SOCRATES clouds exhibit a larger number concentration and smaller cloud droplet effective radius (148.3 cm−3 and 8.0 µm) compared to ACE-ENA summertime (89.4 cm−3 and 9.0 µm) and wintertime clouds (70.6 cm−3 and 9.8 µm). The ACE-ENA clouds, especially during the winter, feature stronger drizzle formation via droplet growth through enhanced collision–coalescence that is attributed to a relatively cleaner environment and deeper cloud layer. Furthermore, the aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) indices from the two aircraft field campaigns exhibit distinct sensitivities, indicating different cloud microphysical responses to aerosols. The ACE-ENA winter season features relatively fewer aerosols, which are more likely activated into cloud droplets under the conditions of sufficient water vapor availability and strong turbulence. The enriched aerosol loading during ACE-ENA summer and SOCRATES generally leads to smaller cloud droplets competing for the limited water vapor and exhibiting a stronger ACI. Notably, the precipitation susceptibilities are stronger during the ACE-ENA than during the SOCRATES campaigns. The in-cloud drizzle behavior significantly alters sub-cloud cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budgets through the coalescence-scavenging effect and, in turn, impacts the ACI assessments. The results of this study can enhance understanding and aid in future model simulation and assessment of the aerosol–cloud interaction."

Gerber;Stephan Fueglistaler,Beyond self-healing: stabilizing and destabilizing photochemical adjustment of the ozone layer,"Earth's ozone layer absorbs incoming UV light, protecting life. Removing ozone aloft allows UV light to penetrate deeper, where it is known to produce new ozone, leading to ""self-healing"" that partially stabilizes total ozone. However, a photochemistry model shows that, above 40 km in the tropics, deeper-penetrating UV destroys ozone, destabilizing the total ozone. Photochemical theory reveals that this destabilizing regime occurs where overhead ozone is below a key threshold. 
 The ozone layer is often noted to exhibit self-healing, whereby depletion of ozone aloft induces ozone increases below, explained as resulting from enhanced ozone production due to the associated increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation below. Similarly, ozone enhancement aloft can reduce ozone below (reverse self-healing). This paper considers self-healing and reverse self-healing to manifest a general mechanism we call photochemical adjustment, whereby ozone perturbations lead to a downward cascade of anomalies in UV and ozone. Conventional explanations for self-healing imply that photochemical adjustment is stabilizing, damping perturbations towards the surface. However, photochemical adjustment can be destabilizing if the enhanced UV disproportionately increases the ozone sink, as can occur if the enhanced UV photolyzes ozone to produce atomic oxygen, which speeds up catalytic destruction of ozone. We analyze photochemical adjustment in two linear ozone models (Cariolle v2.9 and LINOZ), finding that (1) photochemical adjustment is destabilizing above 40 km in the tropical stratosphere and (2) self-healing often represents only a small fraction of the total photochemical stabilization. The destabilizing regime above 40 km is reproduced in a much simpler model: the Chapman cycle augmented with destruction of O and O3 by generalized catalytic cycles and transport (the Chapman+2 model). The Chapman+2 model reveals that photochemical destabilization occurs where the ozone sink is more sensitive than the source to perturbations in overhead column ozone, which is found to occur when the window of overlapping absorption by O2 and O3 is optically unsaturated, i.e., when overhead slant column ozone is below approximately 1018 molec. cm−2."

Rajeevan,"Biomass-burning sources control ambient particulate matter, but traffic and industrial sources control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and secondary-pollutant formation during extreme pollution events in Delhi","We use 111 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PM10, and PM2.5 in a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to resolve 11 pollution sources validated with chemical fingerprints. Crop residue burning and heating account for ~ 50 % of the PM, while traffic and industrial emissions dominate the gas-phase VOC burden and formation potential of secondary organic aerosols (> 60 %). Non-tailpipe emissions from compressed-natural-gas-fuelled commercial vehicles dominate the transport sector's PM burden. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) are major constituents of smog. Delhi experiences severe smog during the post-monsoon season, but a quantitative understanding of VOCs and PM sources is still lacking. Here, we conduct a source apportionment study for VOCs and PM using a  recent (2022), high-quality dataset of 111 VOCs, PM2.5, and PM10 in a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Contrasts between clean monsoon air and polluted post-monsoon air, VOC source fingerprints, and molecular tracers enabled us to differentiate paddy residue burning from other biomass-burning sources, which had previously been impossible. Burning of fresh paddy residue, as well as residential heating and waste burning, contributed the most to observed PM10 levels (25 % and 23 %, respectively) and PM2.5 levels (23 % and 24 %, respectively), followed by heavy-duty vehicles fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG), with a PM10 contribution of 15 % and a PM2.5 contribution of 11 %. For ambient VOCs, ozone formation  potential, and secondary-organic-aerosol (SOA) formation potential, the top sources were petrol four-wheelers (20 %, 25 %, and 30 %, respectively), petrol two-wheelers (14 %, 12 %, and 20 %, respectively), industrial emissions (12 %, 14 %, and 15 %, respectively), solid-fuel-based cooking (10 %, 10 %, and 8 %, respectively), and road construction (8 %, 6 %, and 9 %, respectively). Emission inventories tended to overestimate residential biofuel emissions at least by a factor of 2 relative to the PMF output. The major source of PM pollution was regional biomass burning, while traffic and industries governed VOC emissions and secondary-pollutant formation. Our novel source apportionment method even quantitatively resolved similar biomass and fossil fuel sources, offering insights into both VOC and PM sources affecting extreme pollution events. This approach represents a notable advancement compared to current source apportionment approaches, and it could be of great relevance for future studies in other polluted cities and regions of the world with complex source mixtures."

Here we investigate trends of OMI FNRs from 2005 to 2021, and they have increased in major cities, suggesting a transition from radical- to NOx-limited regimes. OMI also observed the impact of reduced emissions during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown that resulted in increased FNRs. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) formation depends on the relative abundance of precursor species, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Advancements in satellite retrievals of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column densities (VCDs), and the corresponding HCHO/NO2 ratios (FNRs), provide the opportunity to diagnose the spatiotemporal evolution of O3 production sensitivity regimes. This study investigates trends of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-derived summertime VCD HCHO, NO2, and FNRs in the Northern Hemisphere from 2005 to 2021. FNR trends were analyzed for polluted regions, specifically for 46 highly populated cities, over the entire 17-year period and in 2020 when global anthropogenic emissions were reduced due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. It was determined that OMI-derived FNRs have increased on average by ∼ 65 % across cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Increasing OMI-derived FNRs indicates a general transition from radical-limited to NOx-limited regimes. The increasing trend is driven by reduced NO2 concentrations because of emission-control strategies of NOx. OMI FNR trends were compared to ground-based in situ measurements in US cities, and it was determined that they can capture the trends in increasing FNRs (R=0.91) and decreasing NO2 (R=0.98) occurring at the surface. OMI FNRs in urban areas were higher (∼ 20 %) in 2020 for most cities studied here compared to 2019 and 2021. In addition to studying the longest period of OMI FNRs across the Northern Hemisphere to date, the capabilities and challenges of using satellite VCD FNRs to study surface-level O3 production sensitivity regimes are discussed."

Harrison,"The behaviour of charged particles (ions) during new particle formation events in urban Leipzig, Germany","Ions enhance the formation and growth rates of new particles, affecting the Earth's radiation budget. Despite these effects, there is little published data exploring the sources of ions in the urban environment and their role in new particle formation (NPF). Here we show that natural ion sources dominate in urban environments, while traffic is a secondary source. Ions contribute up to 12.7 % of the formation rate of particles, indicating that they are important for forming urban PM. 
 Air ions are electrically charged particles in air. They are ubiquitous in the natural environment and affect the Earth's radiation budget by accelerating the formation and growth of new aerosol particles. Despite this, few datasets exist exploring these effects in the urban environment. A neutral cluster and air ion spectrometer was deployed in Leipzig, Germany, to measure the number size distribution of charged particles from 0.8 to 42 nm, between 27 July and 25 August 2022. Following previous analyses, charged particles were classified into small (0.8–1.6 nm), intermediate (1.6–7.5 nm), and large (7.5–22 nm) fractions by mass diameter, and their mean concentrations (sum of positive and negative polarities) during the campaign were 405, 71.6, and 415 cm−3, respectively. The largest peaks in intermediate and large ions were explained by new particle formation (NPF), with intermediate ions correlating well with sulfuric acid dimer. Smaller morning and evening peaks were coincident with black carbon concentrations and attributed to primary emissions. NPF events, observed on 30 % of days, coincided with intense solar radiation and elevated sulfuric acid dimer. Small charged particles were primarily associated with radioactive decay and highest during the early hours, and they are unrelated to primary emissions or NPF. The apparent contributions of charged particles to 3 and 7.5 nm particle formation rates were 5.7 % and 12.7 %, respectively, with mean growth rates of 4.0 nm h−1 between 3–7.5 nm and 5.2 nm h−1 between 7.5 and 22 nm. The ratio of charged to total particle formation rates at 3 nm suggests a minor role for charged particles in NPF. We conclude that NPF is a primary source of > 3 nm ions in our data, with primary emissions being the major source in the absence of NPF."

This study offers a valuable reference for developing parameterizations of other nucleation systems and is meaningful for the accurate quantification of the environmental and climate impacts of new particle formation. 
 Clustering of gaseous sulfuric acid (SA) enhanced by dimethylamine (DMA) is a major mechanism for new particle formation (NPF) in polluted atmospheres. However, uncertainty remains regarding the SA–DMA nucleation parameterization that reasonably represents cluster dynamics and is applicable across various atmospheric conditions. This uncertainty hinders accurate three-dimensional (3-D) modeling of NPF and the subsequent assessment of its environmental and climatic impacts. Here we extensively compare different cluster-dynamics-based parameterizations for SA–DMA nucleation and identify the most reliable one through a combination of box model simulations, 3-D modeling, and in situ observations. Results show that the parameterization derived from Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code (ACDC) simulations, incorporating the latest theoretical insights (DLPNO-CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory) and adequate representation of cluster dynamics, exhibits dependable performance in 3-D NPF simulation for both winter and summer conditions in Beijing and shows promise for application in diverse atmospheric conditions. Another ACDC-derived parameterization, replacing the level of theory with RI-CC2/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z//M06-2X/6–311++G(3df,3pd), also performs well in NPF modeling at relatively low temperatures around 280 K but exhibits limitations at higher temperatures due to inappropriate representation of SA–DMA cluster thermodynamics. Additionally, a previously reported parameterization incorporating simplifications is applicable for simulating NPF in polluted atmospheres but tends to overestimate particle formation rates under conditions of elevated temperature (>∼300 K) and low-condensation sink (<∼3×10-3 s−1). Our findings highlight the applicability of the new ACDC-derived parameterization, which couples the latest SA–DMA nucleation theory and holistic cluster dynamics, in 3-D NPF modeling. The ACDC-derived parameterization framework provides a valuable reference for developing parameterizations for other nucleation systems."

AOD retrievals require Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption (ozone, NO2, etc.) corrections. We analysed the NO2 (which has a high spatiotemporal variation) uncertainty impact on AOD  retrievals using the synergy of co-located ground-based instruments with a long-term dataset at worldwide sites and found significant AOD over- or underestimations. 
 This work aims at investigating the effect of NO2 absorption on aerosol-optical-depth (AOD) measurements and Ångström exponent (AE) retrievals of sun photometers by the synergistic use of accurate NO2 characterization for optical-depth estimation from co-located ground-based measurements. The analysis was performed for ∼ 7 years (2017–2023) at several sites worldwide for the AOD measurements and AE retrievals by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometers which use OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) climatology for NO2 representation. The differences in AOD and AE retrievals by NO2 absorption are accounted for using high-frequency columnar NO2 measurements by a co-located Pandora spectroradiometer belonging to the Pandonia Global Network (PGN). NO2 absorption affects the AOD measurements in UV-Vis (visible) range, and we found that the AOD bias is the most affected at 380 nm by NO2 differences, followed by 440, 340, and 500 nm, respectively. AERONET AOD was found to be overestimated in half of the cases, while also underestimated in other cases as an impact of the NO2 difference from “real” (PGN NO2) values. Overestimations or underestimations are relatively low. About one-third of these stations showed a mean difference in NO2 and AOD (at 380 and 440 nm) above 0.5 × 10−4 mol m−2 and 0.002, respectively, which can be considered a systematic contribution to the uncertainties in the AOD measurements that are reported to be of the order of 0.01. However, under extreme NO2 loading scenarios (i.e. 10 % highest differences) at highly urbanized/industrialized locations, even higher AOD differences were observed that were at the limit of or higher than the reported 0.01 uncertainty in the AOD measurement. PGN NO2-based sensitivity analysis of AOD difference suggested that for PGN NO2 varying between 2 × 10−4 and  8 × 10−4 mol m−2, the median AOD differences were found to rise above 0.01 (even above 0.02) with the increase in NO2 threshold (i.e. the lower limit from 2 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−4 mol m−2). The AOD-derivative product, AE, was also affected by the NO2 correction (discrepancies between the AERONET OMI climatological representation of NO2 values and the real PGN NO2 measurements) on the spectral AOD. Normalized frequency distribution of AE (at 440–870 and 340–440 nm wavelength pair) was found to be narrower for a broader AOD distribution for some stations, and vice versa for other stations, and a higher relative error at the shorter wavelength (among the wavelength pairs used for AE estimation) led to a shift in the peak of the AE difference distribution towards a higher positive value, while a higher relative error at a lower wavelength shifted the AE difference distribution to a negative value for the AOD overestimation case, and vice versa for the AOD underestimation case. For rural locations, the mean NO2 differences were found to be mostly below 0.50 × 10−4 mol m−2, with the corresponding AOD differences being below 0.002, and in extreme NO2 loading scenarios, it went above this value and reached above 1.00 × 10−4 mol m−2 for some stations, leading to higher AOD differences but below 0.005. Finally, AOD and AE trends were calculated based on the original AERONET AOD (based on AERONET OMI climatological NO2), and its comparison with the mean differences in the AERONET and PGN NO2-corrected AOD was indicative of how NO2 correction could potentially affect realistic AOD trends."

 We describe a new version of the Chicago Water Isotope Spectrometer (ChiWIS), designed for airborne measurements of vapor-phase water isotopologues in the dry upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aboard research aircraft. This version of the instrument is a tunable diode laser (TDL), off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer (OA-ICOS). The instrument was designed to measure the HDO/H2O ratio in the 2017 Asian Summer Monsoon flight aboard the M-55 Geophysica during the StratoClim campaign, and so far has also flown aboard the WB-57F in the 2021 and 2022 ACCLIP campaigns. The spectrometer scans absorption lines of both H2O and HDO near 2.647 μm wavelength in a single current sweep, and has an effective path length of 7.5 km under optimal conditions. The instrument utilizes a novel non-axially-symmetric optical component which increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3. Ultra-polished, 4-inch diameter cavity mirrors suppress scattering losses, maximize mirror reflectivity, and yield optical fringing significantly below typical electrical noise levels. In laboratory conditions, the instrument has demonstrated a 5-second measurement precision of 3.6 ppbv and 82 pptv in H2O and HDO, respectively."

Reid,Chilean Observation Network De MeteOr Radars (CONDOR): Multi-Static System Configuration & Wind Comparison with Co-located Lidar,"This paper describes the installation of the Chilean Observation Network De MeteOr Radars (CONDOR) and its initial results. The routine winds are point-to-point comparable to the co-located lidar winds. The retrievals of spatially resolved horizontal wind fields, vertical winds, and temperatures are also facilitated benefiting from the extensive meteor detections. The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 and state-of-the-art wind measurements to the research community. 
 The Chilean Observation Network De MeteOr Radars (CONDOR) commenced deployment in June 2019 and became fully operational in February 2020. It is a multi-static meteor radar system consisting of three ~1º latitudinally separated stations. The main (central) station is located at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO, 30.25º S, 70.74º W) and is used for both transmission and reception. The two remote sites are located to the north and south and are used for reception only. The southern station is located at the Southern Cross Observatory (SCO, 31.20º S, 71.00º W) and the northern station is located at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO, 29.02º S, 70.69º W). The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 measurements of horizontal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), and permit the retrieval of spatially resolved horizontal winds, vertical winds, and temperatures. This is possible because of the high meteor detection rates. Over 30,000 quality controlled underdense meteor echoes are detected at the ALO each day and in total ~88,000 events are detected each day over the three sites. In this paper, we present the system configuration of the CONDOR and discuss the validation and initial results of its data products. The motivations of deploying the CONDOR system also include the combination of results with other co-located ground-based instruments at the ALO, which provide uniquely cross-validated and cross-scale observations of the MLT dynamics with multiple scientific goals."

We quantify the uncertainties of several publicly available KDP estimation methods for multiple rainfall intensities. We use C-band weather radar observations and employed a self-consistency KDP, estimated from reflectivity and differential reflectivity, as framework for the examination. Our study provides guidance in the performance, uncertainties and optimisation of the methods, focusing mainly on accuracy and robustness. 
 Accurate and precise KDP estimates are essential for radar-based applications, especially in quantitative precipitation estimation and radar data quality control routines. The accuracy of these estimates largely depends on the post-processing of the radar's measured ΦDP, which aims to reduce noise and backscattering effects while preserving fine-scale precipitation features. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several publicly available KDP estimation methods implemented in open-source libraries such as PyArt and Wradlib, and the method used in the Vaisala weather radars. To benchmark these methods, we employ a polarimetric self-consistency approach that relates KDP to reflectivity and differential reflectivity in rain, providing a reference self-consistency KDP  (KDPSC ) for comparison. This approach allows for the construction of the reference KDP observations that can be used  to assess the accuracy and robustness of the studied KDP estimation methods. We assess each method by quantifying uncertainties using C-band weather radar observations where the reflectivity values ranged between 20 and 50 dBZ."

We have implemented ultraviolet (UV) radiation inhibition of photosynthesis of four marine phytoplankton functional groups represented in the Marine Biogeochemistry Library. The new feature is tested with varying levels of UV radiation. The new feature will enable an analysis of an asteroid impact’s effect on the ozone layer and how that affects the base of the marine food web. 
 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can damage DNA and kill cells. We use laboratory and observational studies of the harmful effect of UV radiation on marine photosynthesizers to inform the implementation of a UV radiation damage function for phytoplankton photosynthesis in a modified version of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2-UVphyto). CESM2-UVphyto is capable of simulating UV inhibition of photosynthesis among modelled phytoplankton and ocean column 5 penetration of UV-A and UV-B radiation. We conduct a series of simulations with CESM2-UVphyto using the Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL) ecosystem model to calibrate estimates of the sensitivity of phytoplankton productivity to UV radiation. Results indicate that increased UV radiation shifts the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and productivity deeper into the column, causes a moderate decline in total global productivity, and changes phytoplankton community structure to favor diatoms. Our new CESM2-UVphyto model configuration can be used to quantify the potential ocean biogeochemical 10 and ecosystem impacts resulting from events that disturb the stratospheric ozone layer, such as an asteroid impact, a volcanic eruption, a nuclear war, and stratospheric aerosol injection-based geoengineering."

Pandis,Sensitivity of predicted ultrafine particle size distributions in Europe to different nucleation rate parameterizations using PMCAMx-UF v2.2,"The effect of the assumed atmospheric nucleation mechanism on particle number concentrations and size distribution was investigated. Two quite different mechanisms involving sulfuric acid and ammonia or a biogenic organic vapor gave quite similar results which were consistent with measurements in 26 measurement stations across Europe. The number of larger particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei showed little sensitivity to the assumed nucleation mechanism. 
 The three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx-UF v2.2, designed to simulate the ultrafine particle size distribution, was used to investigate the impact of varying nucleation mechanisms on the predicted aerosol number concentration in Europe. Two basic case scenarios were examined: the original ternary H2SO4-NH3-H2O parameterization and a biogenic vapor-sulfuric acid parameterization. Using the organic-based parameterization, PMCAMx-UF predicted higher N10 (particle number above 10 nm) concentrations over Europe by 40–60 % on average during the simulated period, which is a relatively small difference given the differences in the two assumed mechanisms. Adjusting the nucleation rate by an order of magnitude for both mechanisms led to an average change of ±30 % in N10 for the ternary ammonia case, and ‒30 to 40 % for the biogenic vapor case. In the biogenic organic nucleation scenario, reducing the fresh nuclei diameter from 1.7 nm to 1 nm resulted in reductions in N10 and N100 by −13 % and −1 %, respectively. Incorporating extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) as the nucleating species resulted in predicted increase in N10 concentration by 10–40 % over continental Europe compared to the ammonia parameterization. Model predictions were evaluated against field measurements from 26 stations across Europe during the summer of 2012. Among the tested scenarios, the measurements showed better agreement with the ternary ammonia and ELVOC-based parameterizations for N10, whereas for N100, all simulated cases appear to agree quite well with the field data."

This study estimated NF3 emissions and their spatial distribution in China from 2017 to 2021 based on atmospheric observations from nine background stations in China, by employing a Lagrangian-dispersion-model-based Bayesian inversion technique. We found that NF3 emissions in China increased from 0.95 (0.82–1.07) Gg yr–1 in 2017 to 1.41 (1.28–1.55) Gg yr–1 in 2021, representing a substantial growth of 48% over this period. The absolute increase in NF3 emissions in China over 2017–2020, 0.65 (0.57–0.74) Gg yr–1is comparable to the increase in global emissions (0.63 (0.50–0.75) Gg yr–1) over the same period. We identified substantial NF3 emissions in the Pearl and Yangtze River Delta regions and Hubei Province, where well-established semiconductor industries could have contributed to NF3 emissions. Moreover, large NF3 emissions were identified in northern China, including Hebei, Henan, and Shandong Provinces.

Many of these limitations are mechanistic in nature, which will require technological advances. However, there are documented quality assurance (QA) methods to promote data quality. These include laboratory and field evaluation to quantitatively assess performance, the application of corrections to improve precision and accuracy, and active management of the condition or state of health of deployed air quality sensors.

Here we employ global satellite observations, climate data records and CO2 flux measurements to calculate the time‐lag of vegetation response to climate. We analyze the time‐lags of various climate variables under distinct environmental conditions to gain insight into how the long‐term climatic regimes and tree cover influence the time‐lag effects. Our findings reveal that terrestrial ecosystems characterized by arid and cold climates show more concurrent climate‐vegetation interactions than other ecosystems. Whereas areas with higher tree cover and humid ecosystems with both high mean annual temperature and precipitation show substantial time‐lag response of vegetation to climate by up to 6 months. Since the global climate‐vegetation interaction is dominated by time‐lag effects, incorporating these effects is paramount to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics under a changing climate."

 The interaction between planets and stellar winds can lead to atmospheric loss and is, thus, important for the evolution of planetary atmospheres1. The planets in our Solar System typically interact with the solar wind, whose velocity is at a large angle to the embedded stellar magnetic field. For planets without an intrinsic magnetic field, this interaction creates an induced magnetosphere and a bow shock in front of the planet2. However, when the angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field (cone angle) is small, the interaction is very different3. Here we show that when the cone angle is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates. There is no shock on the dayside, only weak flank shocks. A cross-flow plume appears and the ambipolar field drives planetary ions upstream. Hybrid simulations with a 4° cone angle show agreement with observations by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission4 and Mars Express5. Degenerate, induced magnetospheres are complex and not yet explored objects. It remains to be studied what the secondary effects are on processes like atmospheric loss through ion escape.

 Climate models indicate that dry extremes will be exacerbated in many regions of the world1,2. However, confidence in the magnitude and timing of these projected changes remains low3,4, leaving societies largely unprepared5,6. Here we show that constraining model projections with observations using a newly proposed emergent constraint (EC) reduces the uncertainty in predictions of a core drought indicator, the longest annual dry spell (LAD), by 10–26% globally. Our EC-corrected projections reveal that the increase in LAD will be 42–44% greater, on average, than ‘mid-range’ or ‘high-end’ future forcing scenarios currently indicate. These results imply that by the end of this century, the global mean land-only LAD could be 10 days longer than currently expected. Using two generations of climate models, we further uncover global regions for which historical LAD biases affect the magnitude of projected LAD increases, and we explore the role of land–atmosphere feedbacks therein. Our findings reveal regions with potentially higher- and earlier-than-expected drought risks for societies and ecosystems, and they point to possible mechanisms underlying the biases in the current generation of climate models.

 Ozone (O3) pollution is increasing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), with significant influences from regional transport during pollution events. However, the specific contributions of different regions remain imprecisely quantified. This study estimated the regional contributions of eight regions to summer O3 in the YRD using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with a source-tagged photochemical mechanism. Non-background O3 is attributed to nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from different regions. Background O3 is the predominant contributor with average ratios of 75.0%, 65.3%, 64.8% and 63.0% for Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and the entire YRD, respectively. Locally formed O3 are 39.9, 42.0, 39.6, and 36.9 parts per billion (ppb) by volume in the above areas. North Zhejiang and south Jiangsu are the primary sources of heavy pollution episodes as the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations in these regions increase the most. NOX is the predominant contributor to heavy pollution episodes with the maximum increment attributed to NOX (O3N) of 14.3 ppb, while VOCs only contribute to 2.1 ppb (O3V) in Jiangsu. Relative humidity is crucial in heavy pollution episodes while high temperature, low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height and the wind field are associated with regional transport. Diurnal variation underscores the importance of understanding O3 formation in the afternoon (12:00–16:00), which is essential for devising effective mitigation policies."

 The interaction between ozone and temperature on cardiovascular biomarkers has not been thoroughly examined. A panel study was conducted among 40 college students with four equal interval follow-ups in Hefei, Anhui Province, China between August and October 2021. Real-time concentrations of ozone were collected from a nearby monitoring device. Temperature variability parameters included diurnal temperature range (DTR), the standard-deviation of temperature (SDT), and temperature variability (TV). A set of cardiovascular biomarkers were measured, including markers of inflammation (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF and serum amyloid A, SAA), coagulation (D-dimer and ADAMTS13), oxidative stress (Myeloperoxidase, MPO and Growth differentiation factor-15, GDF-15), endothelial function (vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGFA), and stress hormone (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). Linear mixed-effect models were conducted to analyze the associations between ozone, temperature variability, and all blood markers. The results showed significant associations among ozone, DTR, SDT, TV, and blood markers, suggesting harmful effects on markers. For instance, a 10-μg/m3 increase in ozone at lag 2d was associated with higher levels of SAA by 19.65% (95%CI: 13.70, 25.60), VEGFA by 10.90% (95%CI: 4.57, 17.22), GDF-15 by 5.33% (95%CI: 0.59, 10.06), and GM-CSF by 2.52% (95%CI: 1.70, 3.34), but 13.09% lower D-dimer (95%CI: 6.99, 19.19). We also found statistically significant interaction between ozone and TV exposures for GM-CSF and SAA. This study shows that ambient ozone and personal TV exposures may independently have acute effects on markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, endothelial function, and neuroendocrine stress response. Simultaneous exposure to these factors may also lead to interactive effects on inflammation markers. These findings offer valuable insights for developing comprehensive strategies in cardiovascular disease control and prevention."

 Atmospheric background monitoring provides insights into the long-term changes in atmospheric composition resulting from human activities on both global and regional scales. It is important to understand the local characteristics of key air pollutants to evaluate and manage air quality control policies effectively. This study analyzed 13 years of continuous data of PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm) concentration from the only atmospheric background station in Northeastern China, the Longfengshan (LFS) World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) regional station. The results revealed a significant decrease of 58.02% in PM10 concentrations in the LFS from 2007 to 2019, which was primarily influenced by transport from Changchun and Harbin. Over periods exceeding eight months, the correlation between PM10 levels at the LFS atmospheric background station and those in Changchun and Harbin became more pronounced. The observed decline in PM10 concentrations at the LFS atmospheric background station was largely attributed to reduced emissions from urban residential and agricultural sources. Emissions of carbon monoxide and ammonia from these sources, along with temperature and relative humidity (RH), significantly affected the PM10 concentrations. Using machine learning (ML) methods and PM10 data from the LFS atmospheric background station, this study effectively predicted PM10 concentrations in neighboring cities, demonstrating that the LFS atmospheric background station can effectively assess the trend of PM10 changes in Northeast China. This study quantified the influence of urban areas on atmospheric background stations, highlighting the effectiveness of existing environmental policies, and offering a reference for similar studies and forecasts in other regions."

 Particulate Matter (PM), a primary atmospheric pollutant, is characterized by diverse emission sources and complex influencing factors. Particulate matter source profiles (PM-SPs) reported in different studies exhibited significant variability, and their uncertainty is not well documented, highlighting the urgent need for further research. To scientifically evaluate PM-SPs, this study begins with the construction process of PM-SPs, identifying key stages (sampling, weighing, and chemical analysis) that influence their uncertainty. The uncertainty components at each stage, as well as the comprehensive uncertainty, are then quantitatively assessed, resulting in the development of an assessment method that quantifies the uncertainty of PM-SPs. The industrial PM-SPs are evaluated as a case study, which indicate this full-chain method can quantitatively identify the uncertainties introduced at various stages. The sampling uncertainties are mostly below 40%, primarily resulting from errors in repeat sampling. The weighing uncertainties are generally minor, while the impact of the chemical analysis process varies significantly across different components. Among the fifty-three evaluated PM-SPs, 80% have average comprehensive uncertainties below 40%, with only five profiles exhibiting relatively high uncertainties. In practical applications, the uncertainty assessment of PM-SPs should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, considering the importance of different components, with special attention given to marker components."

 Isocyanates are known as widespread hazardous environmental pollutants emitted from various combustion products in our lives because they cause health effects to the nervous system and respiratory systems through sensitization. In this study, to obtain data on the concentration and composition of isocyanates in indoor and outdoor air, we developed a novel passive sampler (PSG-DBA) for monitoring gaseous and particulate isocyanates; e.g. isocyanic acid (ICA), methyl isocyanate (MIC), ethyl isocyanate (EIC), and propyl isocyanate (PIC), and acquired basic data of isocyanates on the behavior in general households. This proposed method allows for continuous sampling over a week, making it possible to calculate not only intermittent data but also low concentrations and average concentrations of isocyanate in our daily lives. In addition, from the results of this monitoring, in particular, ICA and MIC were frequently detected in ambient air. In summer, indoor concentrations were typically higher than those outdoors in most houses, e.g., mean concentrations; ICA; 0.21 ppb (summer), 011 ppb (winter); MIC; 0.0052 ppb (summer), 0.0038 ppb (winter). These were also affected by temperature fluctuations due to climate change during summer. PSG-DBA can monitor a wide range of environments to further investigate the environmental dynamics of isocyanates in the future."

 The detrimental impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on human health, climate, ecosystems, crops, and building materials are well-established. However, there remain unresolved inquiries regarding the precise location of the sources of PM2.5. This study is the first attempt to use a calibrated sensors-based ambient air quality monitoring network (SAAQM network) and regulatory government monitors to train micro-satellite images for high spatial-resolution air pollution field determination of PM2.5 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. A hybrid approach is developed to integrate three different datasets that include microsatellite images, PM2.5 ground measurements, and supporting information (meteorological parameters and geographical coordinates), to be fed into a Random Trees-Random Forest- Convolutional Neural Network (RT-RF-CNN) joint model to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a sub-km level. The RT-RF-CNN joint model can derive PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 500 m with statistically significant indicators such as spatial r of 0.9, a low root-mean-square error of 26.9 μg/m3 and a mean absolute error of 17.2 μg/m3. Based on our approach, the PM2.5 prediction maps using micro-satellite images (spatial resolution of 3m/pixel) and RT-RF-CNN joint model were generated for each day throughout the study period (December 2021–December 2022). The inter-grid comparison of these maps revealed the intra-urban local hotspots and coolspots at a fine-granular level seasonally, monthly, and daily. It is observed that the monsoon season has the highest number of coolspots (67%), while winter (0.1%), post-monsoon (0.5%) and summer (11%) have fewer. It is noted that the high temporal-spatial information of PM2.5 estimates from our integrated approach is not achievable by ground-based measurements and other existing satellite-based estimates alone. The findings of this study have potential applications on a diverse array, encompassing near real-time daily PM2.5 predicted maps, specific air pollution hotspot identification, PM2.5 exposure assessment at the neighbourhood level, and integration of remote sensing-based micro-satellite images and ground-based measurements."

 Accurate modeling of aerosol-cloud interactions is essential for reliable weather and air quality simulations, given their significant impact on precipitation patterns, cloud dynamics, and aerosol distributions. This study employed the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine the impact of enhanced meteorological simulations, achieved through advanced microphysics parameterization supported by data assimilation techniques, on air quality across Texas on August 19 and 20, 2022. We tested four distinct configurations: (1) the Morrison two-moment bulk microphysics scheme, (2) Morrison's with observation nudging, (3) the Spectral Bin Microphysics (SBM), and (4) SBM with observation nudging. While the SBM scheme is known for its detailed representation of aerosol-cloud interactions, our focus was on how improvements in meteorological accuracy translate to more precise air quality simulations. Our findings demonstrated a progressive improvement in simulation accuracy, starting with the Morrison's scheme and further enhanced by adopting the SBM scheme, complemented by incorporating observation nudging. Specifically, the combination of the SBM scheme and the nudging substantially enhanced the model's ability to capture convective precipitation events, as shown by better alignment with NEXRAD radar reflectivity, with R increasing from −0.21 to 0.82, IOA from 0.10 to 0.87, and NMB decreasing from 99% to 34% in Houston. The enhanced meteorology translated into more accurate PM2.5 concentration simulations, particularly through the more accurate representation of aerosol washout during precipitation events. In Houston, the SBM scheme with nudging improved the model's PM2.5 simulations significantly, with NMB decreasing from −20% to 5% and IOA improving from 0.43 to 0.61. In San Antonio, improvements were also notable, with NMB improved from −27% to −22%, R increased from 0.48 to 0.82, and IOA increased from 0.66 to 0.86. Our results underscore the crucial role of accurate meteorological simulations in refining our understanding of aerosol behaviors in relation to precipitation patterns, directly enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of air quality modeling."

 With the development of industry, the issue of air pollution is of great concern. Due to the sparsity of monitoring stations, acquiring full-coverage PM2.5 concentration remains challenging. The satellite remote sensing datasets provide a potential solution for estimation tasks by its spatiotemporal virtue. In this study, the ellipsoidal coordinate system was introduced for the first time to improve the spatial coding method. A two-stage algorithm using satellite datasets and ground-site values was proposed to impute the missing AOD and estimate PM2.5 concentrations. Firstly, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was utilized for imputing the missing AOD, achieving superior accuracy (R2 = 0.929). Secondly, the training efficiency and the accuracy of traditional algorithm were enhanced by innovatively utilizing an efficient attention mechanism and a novel embedding layer. The concept of combining convolutional layers with different output channels and novel spatial preprocessing methods were also innovatively proposed. Consequently, the Spatiotemporal Multi-Sample Parallel Network (STMSPNet) was constructed to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations. Finally, the best performance of this model was obtained by 10-fold cross-validation with R2 of 0.913 and RMSE of 10.637 μg/m3. In addition, this study analyses the changing patterns of PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2019 to 2023, taking into account the COVID-19 outbreak and extreme weather. The reasons for the changes are also discussed in depth through the air pollution control policies enacted by the Chinese government and regional factors.

 Economic development has historically led to environmental challenges, notably in China where fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter no greater than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), has significantly influenced human health and social issues. However, the scarcity and uneven distribution of ground-based PM2.5 observation sites hinder studies about air pollution impacts at regional and national scales. Although PM2.5 datasets based on remote sensing retrieval algorithms have provided long-term and high-resolution gridded near surface PM2.5 concentration data recently, comparisons on accuracy between datasets were not conducted by previous studies. This study evaluated eight publicly accessible PM2.5 datasets (i.e., CHAP, GHAP, GWRPM25, HQQPM25, LGHAP v1, LGHAP v2, MuAP, and TAP) across China using independent records at 1020 monitoring sites from 2017 to 2022 at monthly and annual granularities. Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) showed a seasonal trend, with higher errors in winter and lower in summer. Datasets exhibited a bias towards overestimation or underestimation based on concentration levels. CHAP, GWRPM25, and HQQPM25 had better estimation control. Additionally, the incorporation of spatiotemporal features into original machine learning based algorithms was likely credited to the outperformance compared to conventional PM2.5 simulation methods. Overall, this study contributed to comprehensive references for PM2.5 concentration dataset users and potential explanations to the variations within and among datasets."

 Aromatherapy can relieve stress and lower blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in humans. However, whether exposure to ambient aromas in the workplace has positive or negative cardiovascular effects remains unclear. We recruited 356 healthy office workers from 10 companies in Northern Taiwan to conduct a prospective observational study from 2019 to 2022. Six repeated visits were conducted for each worker to measure HR, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), perceived stress scale (PSS), and exposure to particulate air pollution and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) at the workplace. Mixed-effects models were used to explore the association between air pollution exposure and cardiovascular effects. The results showed significant associations between TVOCs, particulate air pollution and adverse cardiovascular effects, including increased HR and BP among office workers with heavy use of essential oils (office workers who used and/or were exposed to essential oils for more than 1 h per day in the workplace and home). No significant association between air pollution exposure and cardiovascular effects was observed among workers without essential oils usage. However, an association between TVOCs exposure and beneficial cardiovascular effects (decreased HR and BP) was observed among workers with light use of essential oils. Moreover, workers with heavy use of essential oils were significantly associated with increased PSS scores. We concluded that workers with heavy use of essential oils exposed to TVOCs in the workplace may lead to adverse cardiovascular effects and increased self-reported stress."

 As the core city in northwestern China, Xi'an has suffered from serious O3 pollution in recent years. An observational model, coupled with the Master Chemical Mechanism (V3.3.1) and comprehensive data, analyzed atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC), O3 formation mechanism, precursor sensitivity and control strategies in Xi'an. The study examined two periods (period I and II), with notable temperature and humidity differences. Despite lower precursor levels in period I, an O3 episode (peak value: 102.68 ppb) occurred only in period I, highlighting the crucial influence of meteorological conditions. Higher removal rate of primary pollutants occurs in period I, but meteorological conditions may not alter the dominant factor of AOC. Period I exhibited markedly high OH reactivity, with aromatics, alkenes, and NOx being the main contributors. HONO photolysis (50.78%) in the morning and O3 photolysis (34.13%) in the afternoon were the main HOx sources in period I, while HONO photolysis (62.86–80.68%) was significant at daytime for period II. Higher temperatures in period I accelerated all reaction rates involved in radical cycling, especially emphasizing RO2 + NO → RO + NO2. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that O3 sensitivity regime is VOC-limited in Xi'an, but the specific reactive species target VOC reductions emissions exhibited discrepancies for two distinct periods. A 20% decrease in VOCs and a 50% decrease in NOx (VOCs/NOx = 0.4) was proposed to be the optimal solution to achieve the O3 control target in period I. This study enhances our understanding of O3 formation under different meteorological conditions and provides scientific evidence for O3 pollution abatement policies in northwestern China, with potential applicability to other cities in this region and similar countries."

 Bioaerosols, prevalent in the atmosphere, serve as carriers for microbe transmission and can also act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nuclei (IN), exerting significant influence on cloud microphysics, radiative forcing, precipitation processes, and global climate dynamics. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of airborne fungi from the Northwest Pacific to the Arctic Ocean. During the 9th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (Chinare, 2018) cruise, total suspended particulate matter (TSP) samples were collected, followed by high-throughput sequencing to determine the microbial community's structure. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are widespread in marine fungal aerosols along this route, with a notably higher abundance of Epicoccum and Cladosporium in fungal aerosols from the low-latitude Northwest Pacific compared to the high-latitude Arctic Ocean region. The composition of fungal communities depended on air mass transport processes and environmental factors. Long-range transport of terrestrial air masses not only enriches the abundance of fungal aerosols but also increases the relative abundance of dominant genera such as Basidiomycota, Epicoccum and Cladosporium. The knowledge gap about fungal aerosols over the Arctic route from the Northwest Pacific to the Arctic Ocean was filled in part by this work. This study deepens our understanding of how environmental factors and terrestrial air masses influence the composition and distribution of fungal community, offering valuable insights into the interconnections between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and their potential impacts on climate and atmospheric processes."

 The National Park Service (NPS) has a need to measure real-time PM2.5 and haze levels across its many park units to inform the public of unhealthy air and track visual degradation of park scenic vistas. To fulfill this need, the NPS deployed PurpleAir monitors (PA) in several park units. PA monitors are inexpensive monitors promoted as particle counters capable of measuring particle size distributions. Each PA is equipped with two Plantower (PMS) particle counters and a temperature, relative humidity (RH) and pressure sensor. In 2022, the NPS initiated a field study to evaluate PA limitations, uncertainties, and how the measurements relate to particle light scattering. The study was conducted in Fort Collins, CO where five nephelometers, particle sizing instruments, semi-continuous ion concentration measurements, and seven PAs were deployed. One nephelometer and two PA's sampled air from an RH controlled chamber with RH ≤ 40%. The PA temperatures were accurate, but the PA RH measurements were systematically underreported RH by ∼28% and it is recommended to scale these data by 1.35. The PMS reported size distributions are shown to be invalid. PA instruments mounted without protection from wind exhibited biases of ±160% for wind speeds exceeding 5 mph. Hourly CH1 data were precise, with errors of ∼100% at low concentrations of 30 #/dl and 15% for concentrations ≥1000 #/dl. Normalizing all PMS sensors to each other reduced the errors to 20% and 8% for low and higher particle concentrations respectively. The reported total particle count, i.e. ≥0.3 μm channel (CH1), was biased low, and the bias decreased linearly with mean scattering diameter (MSD). The ratio of measured ≥0.3 μm to PA CH1 channel increases linearly with MSD. The overall normalized mean deviation (NMD) between the two measurements is 121.8%. The CH1 channel also increases as a function of RH primarily due to the growth of hygroscopic aerosols. On average, the relationship between the atmospheric scattering coefficient (bsp) and the PMS ≥0.3 μm CH1 channel is described by the equation bsp = 0.015 × CH1 for MSD levels less than 0.35 μm. The PMS CH1 response decreases linearly with MSD. The NMD between ambient PMS derived bsp and measured ambient bsp is 27.0%. Recommendations are made for PA network deployment."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120787,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究主要关注两种杀虫剂（甲基嘧啶磷和嘧啶胺）在不同条件下（湿度、温度、颗粒类型）与羟基自由基（OH）发生异相反应的速率，并由此推算出它们在大气中的寿命。研究结果表明，这两种杀虫剂在颗粒物表面上的降解速率受颗粒物表面性质、湿度和温度的影响，并得出它们在大气中的寿命在9.9-46.1小时之间。该研究对理解杀虫剂在大气中的转化过程，以及评估其对空气质量的影响具有重要意义。,"['atmospheric lifetime', 'OH radicals', 'heterogeneous degradation', 'particle-associated pesticides', 'air quality']",Ru Chen;Dandan Chen;Qiang Niu;Lu Fan;Mingchao Sun;Zhengzheng Yang;Changgeng Liu,Heterogeneous degradation kinetics of typical pyrimidine pesticides toward OH radicals,"•> Heterogeneous degradation kinetics of PMM and PM toward OH radicals was studied. •> Impacts of humidity level, particle type, and temperature on kinetics were explored. •> Atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM ranged from 9.9 to 46.1 h. 
 Pirimiphos-methyl (PMM) and pirimicarb (PM) are two typical N,N-dialkyl substituted pyrimidine pesticides widely applied in agriculture. They are emitted into the atmosphere via spraying and post-application volatilization, but their heterogeneous degradation kinetics toward OH radicals has not been well characterized. Therefore, the degradation rates of particle-associated PMM and PM with OH radicals were studied under different conditions including particle type, relatively humidity (RH), and temperature. The experimental results indicated that the degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on hydrophilic SiO2 particles were faster than those adsorbed on hydrophobic SiO2 particles, suggesting that heterogeneous kinetics was affected by surface properties of SiO2 particles. The degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on these two kinds of SiO2 particles under experimental conditions ranged from (10.8 ± 0.7) × 10−12 and (6.1 ± 0.8) × 10−12 to (28.0 ± 1.7) × 10−12 and (13.5 ± 1.2) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. Additionally, these rate constants showed a negative relationship with increasing RH level (20−80%) while a positive relationship with elevating temperature (5−35 °C). Arrhenius expressions for their heterogeneous degradation and the corresponding activation energies were calculated. According to the obtained degradation rates, the atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM toward OH radicals were in the ranges of 9.9–25.8 and 20.7−46.1 h, respectively, suggesting that OH-initiated heterogeneous degradation might be an important pathway during their atmospheric transformation processes. The experimental kinetic data obtained in this work are in favor of improving the understandings of atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM, and also highlight that the environmental factors including particle type, RH, and temperature should be seriously taken into account for determining the atmospheric lifetimes of pesticides."

 Aerosols and droplets are the main factors of visibility reduction by scattering and absorbing light. In this study we use the 3-D meteorology fields from the 9-km WRF-ADAS Real-Time Modeling System (WARMS) to drive the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. A visibility forecasting framework is developed by combining extinction due to hydrometeors and aerosols, based on WARMS and CMAQ predictions. We have analyzed the results of a one-month forecasting period during the winter of 2021–2022 to assess the performance of the WARM-CMAQ model and to understand the impact of hydrometeor and aerosol extinction on operational visibility forecasting in Shanghai, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and part of the North China Plain (NCP). With our newly developed framework, we generally find improved or comparable results in visibility forecasts when compared to recent studies. We find that for the city of Shanghai, aerosol extinction has a minor impact on the model's performance when forecasting visibility below 1 km, but it becomes crucial for predictions spanning 1–10 km. Comparison against observations shows that the framework well captures the general contributions from various chemical constituents with nitrate as the most important factor in aerosol extinction (∼60%). Finally, our assessment of the YRD and part of the NCP highlights that in highly polluted areas aerosols could be significant for visibility below 1 km. This study emphasizes the necessity of integrating both aerosol and hydrometeor extinction in visibility forecasting during haze-fog processes, particularly for regions characterized by diverse pollutant levels and environmental conditions."

Mason,Improving a continuous mercury analyzer with circulated carrier gas: Economic and operational advancements,"•Industrial mercury emissions have led to global ecological and health issues, demanding international cooperation and monitoring. •Traditional Hg analyzers require frequent and costly carrier gas replenishments, limiting their use in remote environments. •A new Hg analyzer prototype reduces carrier gas usage by 99%, reducing operational costs in isolated locations. 
 Elevated mercury (Hg) emissions since industrialization have created worldwide elevated levels of Hg in environment, causing ecosystem and human health impacts. Addressing these concerns requires across-nation efforts and international cooperation. In cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through its implementation of the Minamata Convention (MC), several international and intranational projects have monitored Hg levels in the atmosphere, water, soil and biota for decades. Obviously, these global monitoring projects require substantial resources, such as government funding, human resources, and analytic instruments. Different types of Hg analyzers have been developed and used in these global monitoring projects, however, most of them require inert carrier gas (i.e. Ar, He) supply, especially if detection requires fluorescence spectroscopy. Frequent consumption and replenishment of carrier gas during normal operation incur substantial financial and human resource costs. Therefore, these instruments cannot operate autonomously for long periods of time and require a carrier gas cylinder exchange, a limitation especially in remote regions and on ocean research cruise campaigns where it is challenging to function autonomously for long duration, limiting data collection in these locations. To address this issue, we developed a novel prototype automated Hg analyzer with a new design using a circulated carrier gas system. This development decreases the carrier gas consumption and increases the Hg analyzer operation duration, saving up to 99% on carrier gas consumption compared to the widely used Tekran 2537 and NIC AM-6F atmospheric Hg analyzers instruments. By using the circulated carrier gas design, our Hg analyzer only consumes 1 L per week. Overall, this improvement not only saves carrier gas but also enhances the instrument's self-operating capability in remote areas and reduces the financial and human resource costs associated with frequent replacement of the carrier gas."

 The use of a high-precision a priori zenith wet delay can effectively improve the convergence time and increase the accuracy of precise point positioning (PPP). Considering the limitations of empirical and blind ZWD models, a new lightweight ZWD model was developed based on GNSS observations and ERA5 precipitable water vapor (PWV) and temperature information that can provide reliable ZWD with 0.25° spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution without relying on massive meteorological parameters. The correlation between the ERA5 PWV/temperature and the GNSS-derived ZWD was first analyzed in 2020 in this study. Subsequently, a functional mapping model based on machine learning was established, considering the effects of spatial and temporal factors, such as time, topography, geographical location. The validation results showed the proposed model's RMSE/STD/Bias were 1.70/1.70/0cm compared with GNSS ZWD, respectively. Furthermore, an independent GNSS and radiosonde ZWD in 2021, was introduced to validate the generalization ability of the proposed model, and the RMSE/STD/Bias values were 1.63/1.49/0.2cm and 2.77/2.63/0.23cm, respectively. The ZWD model developed in this study effectively reduces the dependence on meteorological data from numerical weather models, which is beneficial for broadcasting ZWD data and enhances precise regional positioning and navigation."

 Black carbon (BC) is a harmful pollutant to human health and the environment. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the local contribution of road traffic and residential biomass burning to BC pollution levels at urban scale by implementing an integrated modelling approach with high spatial and temporal resolution. The traffic emission was extended to include BC emission factors considering road network as line emission sources. A new module to calculate emissions from residential biomass burning was developed based on the heating degree days methodology and local surveys. The modelling approach implemented in Coimbra, Portugal, was validated with observations collected during a six-month monitoring campaign at urban traffic and urban background stations using thermo-optical and optical methods. At the traffic station, modelling results showed that 86% of BC concentrations are related to traffic activity, which are mostly due to hot exhaust emissions (76%). Nevertheless, biomass burning has a significant contribution in the whole urban area during winter. The results of monthly average BC concentrations obtained from dispersion modelling revealed a contribution from local road traffic and residential biomass burning emissions of around 4 μg m−3 at both monitoring sites during the coldest period, but this contribution was two times higher for the hotspots identified within the urban area. Moreover, hourly values at hotspots obtained from the modelling may achieve 85 μg m−3, thus stressing the importance of spatial and temporal analysis with high resolution. The validation approach applied in this work highlight the need for more transparency in defining “black carbon” reported by modelling to ensure comparability with measurements obtained by different techniques."

 This study investigates the vertical distribution characteristics of ozone (O3) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region during spring, utilising observational data from two tall towers in urban and suburban areas of the PRD, i.e., the 600 m high Canton Tower and the 356 m high Shenzhen Meteorology Gradient Tower (SZMGT), between 2018 and 2020. The observations indicate that the peak times of O3 concentrations differ under polluted and clean conditions, with polluted conditions showing 1–3 h later peaks compared with clean conditions. The diurnal variation in the O3 concentration is more pronounced at the SZMGT than at the Canton Tower. The O3 vertical gradients differ between the two towers, with the Canton Tower showing larger daytime gradients and the SZMGT showing larger nighttime gradients under polluted conditions. The vertical O3 distribution patterns are categorised into three types: Polluted, Moderate, and Good levels. The O3 concentration initially rises with altitude and then decreases under polluted conditions. Elevated O3 is observed in the lower planetary boundary layer (PBL), approximately between 110 and 210 m in height, where the concentration is 1.1–1.4 times higher than the surface level. Both the Moderate and Good levels occur under clean conditions, in which the O3 of the Canton Tower increases with altitude, whereas the O3 of the SZMGT first increases and then decreases with altitude. The correlation between O3 and the meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed) decreases with increasing altitude. The cluster analysis of backward trajectories identifies three main transport paths affecting the O3 levels: northeasterly continental, southerly oceanic, and easterly coastal paths. Combining the observations from O3 lidar in Guangzhou and Shenzhen and two additional cities within the PRD region, Foshan and Zhongshan, the analysis of a typical pollution case indicates that different cities have different local chemical generation and regional transport contributions to O3 pollution. A conceptual model reflecting the horizontal transport paths and vertical structures of O3 pollution in the spring over the PRD is proposed, which enhances our understanding of the O3 vertical distribution in different cities and contributes to the analysis of the O3 pollution mechanism in the PRD agglomeration."

 The concentrations and behavior of nano particles (10–1000 nm) in Delhi, a densely populated megacity, in different seasons (winter, spring, summer, monsoon, and autumn) are examined, for the first time. The concentration of particles is classified into four different sizes as Nnuc (10–30 nm, nucleation), Nsatk (30–50 nm, small Aitken), Nlatk (50–100 nm, large Aitken), and Nacc (100–1000 nm, accumulation mode), and the total (10–1000 nm) particle number concentration (PNC) as Ntotal. PNC ranges between 104 cm−3 and 106 cm−3 over Delhi during the year, and the highest concentration occurs in winter. Winter concentration is 2, 1.6 and 1.3 times higher than monsoon, summer, autumn and spring concentrations, respectively. Nnuc, Nsatk, Nlatk and Nacc and their respective contributions to total PNC exhibit significant seasonal variations. During winter Nlatk and Nacc contribute more to total due to coagulation, with Nacc alone contributing >40% to total PNC. Nnuc, Nsatk, and Nlatk are higher in spring and summer during mid-day due to nucleation and/or ultrafine particle burst events. The direct primary emissions from engine exhaust produce a prominent double hump structure during morning and evening peak hours in winter and autumn. PNC and their contributions exhibit day-night variations as they are influenced by variations in emission sources and meteorological parameters (wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, solar radiation and boundary layer height) between day and night. Carbon monoxide correlates positively with Nacc in all seasons (R2 ≥ 0.5) as fossil fuel emission is a predominant source for gases and particles in the study environment. These quantitative results on seasonal variations of nano particles and air pollutants together with the knowledge on seasonal variations in meteorological parameters and atmospheric dynamics provide a foundation which can positively contribute better to the urban planning and devising mitigation measures aimed at improving air quality and public health."

 Understanding the effects of mixed anthropogenic pollutants on the photooxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is essential for unraveling the formation pathways of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Yet, it remains a highly challenging experimental target owing to the complexities in the precise measurement of molecular compositions of products and number/mass concentrations of particles as a function of pollutant concentration in the ambient atmosphere. Here, a series of well-defined chamber experiments were performed to explore the effects of NOx and NH3 on the SOA formation from photooxidation of the most abundant monoterpene, α-pinene. The results indicate that the suppression effect of NO and NO2 on the α-pinene photooxidation shows monotonous and parabolic trends, respectively. The presence of NH3 enhances particle number concentrations during the α-pinene + NOx photooxidation by participating in reactions with organic acids.

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) play a crucial role in ground-level ozone formation, yet emission quantification faces considerable uncertainties stemming from input data. Land cover data, which determines the distribution of growth forms, is an essential driving input of BVOC emissions. This study explores the uncertainty in BVOC emission estimates arising from using two land cover datasets, specifically the MODIS and ESA land cover data, and the implications for ozone mitigation strategies in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. By employing the MEGAN model for the year 2021, we estimated that ESA land cover data, with a finer 10 m resolution, yields a total BVOC emission estimate of 2299 Gg, which is over 52.9% higher than the MODIS dataset with a resolution of 500 m, attributed to the higher tree coverage (33.9% in ESA vs. 17.6% in MODIS) identified in the ESA dataset. We then simulated the ozone concentrations by both emission estimates with the WRF-CMAQ model. The elevated BVOC emissions based on the ESA data improved the underestimation of simulated isoprene concentrations and consequently resulted in more than 30% higher domain-averaged MDA8 ozone concentration compared to the MODIS-derived BVOC emission. Regarding ozone mitigation strategy, simulation with the ESA-based BVOC emissions results in 0.3–1.2 μg/m3 less ozone reductions compared to that with the MODIS-based emissions when reducing anthropogenic VOC emissions, but 0.7–2.9 μg/m3 higher ozone reductions when controlling anthropogenic NOx emissions. These disparities are more pronounced at the city level, highlighting the importance of accurate BVOC emission estimates for effective ozone control strategies."

 Air quality, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), significantly impacts human health and mortality. This study aims to quantify and compare the effects of ambient particulate matter (APM) and household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuels on unhealthy years and life-years lost in APAC from 1990 to 2019. It also examines factors influencing unhealthy years among females due to HAP. Our findings show that females were more vulnerable to HAP, whereas males were at a higher mortality risk from APM. Pacific islands encountered the greatest burden from HAP, while West Asia was most affected by APM. Over the studied period, the impact of APM on unhealthy years and life-years lost increased, primarily affecting the elderly and adults more than children and youth. Conversely, health impacts from HAP declined across all age groups in the Pacific Islands, though less so compared to other subregions. Key predictors of female unhealthy years from HAP included pollution, demographics, and women's empowerment, with no significant economic influences. Understanding these impacts, along with age and gender differences, is crucial for developing targeted environmental health policies and interventions."

 During the Lunar New Year of 2020, the Chinese government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, which may have led to changes in the distribution of pollutants. To enhance our understanding of the three-dimensional evolution of pollutants under special control scenarios, this study used vehicle lidar to obtain vertical profiles of aerosols and ozone (O3) in Wuhan during the pandemic. Combined with ground observations and WRF-Chem model simulation results, we explored the evolution characteristics of pollutants. The results showed that the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration near the ground in Wuhan City was significantly reduced (40%) during the emission control period. The aerosol concentration decreased rapidly with an increase in height, and the maximum loading height was consistent with the atmospheric boundary layer height. Conversely, due to factors such as the reduction of the precursor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and rising temperatures, the near-ground O3 concentration increased by 59%. Despite the significant reduction in emission sources, lidar observations still captured distinct aerosol transport layers on March 7 and March 10, 2020. These transport layers gradually descended, affecting the ground-level aerosol concentration. Additionally, one typical process of O3 external transport was observed in the vertical direction. Our study provides a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of pollutants during special control scenarios, aiding policymakers in formulating effective air pollution control strategies."

 Accurately predicting air quality levels in urban landscapes is a key environmental and public health challenge due to the complex interactions between pollutant emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorological conditions. Chemical transport models such as Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Weather Research and Forecasting Modeling with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) provide fundamental insights into the behavior of atmospheric pollutants but face limitations in spatial resolution and prediction accuracy. Machine learning combined with low-cost sensors can improve prediction accuracy compared to numerical models, but uneven sensor distribution may result in biased prediction results. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework that leverages a quadtree space division to refine the numerical simulations of air pollutants into higher spatial resolutions by dynamically adjusting grid sizes based on the distribution of increased sensor deployments. Using a variable-resolution grid, the study first aggregates variables into a grid and then calculates spatial dependence based on grid cells. The deep-learning-based Time Series Transformer model is then used to perform detailed temporal predictions of PM2.5 concentration across the entire grid. The spatial and temporal modeling framework is designed to use the past 48 h' aggregated data, including meteorological variables from WRF-Chem numerical simulation and PM2.5 concentrations from ground monitoring stations and sensors, to predict future 48-h’ PM2.5 concentrations and tested across entire grids within Los Angeles County from January to June 2020. The results show that the performance of variable resolution grids is better than that of fixed grids regarding four metrics: minimum resolution, overall spatiotemporal RMSE, average bias, and prediction coverage. Among them, the variable resolution grids with up to 4 sensors showed the best performance, with an overall spatiotemporal RMSE of 1.12 μg/m3, which was about 40% lower than 2-sensor and 8-sensor variable resolution grids, a significant reduction of 55% compared to a 3 km fixed grid configuration. Future work will involve additional relevant factors such as emission sources and sinks to improve prediction accuracy."

 Macao, a renowned tourist city in the Great Bay Area (GBA), faces the challenge of continuously improving its air quality. In this study, we developed a high-resolution anthropogenic emission inventory for air pollutants in Macao in 2017, tailored for regional-scale numerical modeling. This inventory was created by integrating the best available data including emission factors, statistical data, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The result shows that the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively), and ammonia (NH3) in Macao were estimated to be 4348.23, 10525.64, 2099.34, 4895.15, 586.00, 1063.72, and 263.85 10^3 kg, respectively, in 2017. On-road mobile sources were the largest contributors to CO emissions, accounting for 61% of the total emissions. NOX emissions mainly originated from ship (47%). Power plant contributed the largest SO2 emissions (70%). Solvent use accounted for the most VOCs emissions (69%). Dust source was the major emission source of PM2.5 and PM10, contributing 29% and 53% of total emissions, respectively. Sewage treatment was the primary emitter of NH3, accounting for 88% of the total emissions. These emissions were then spatially allocated to grid cells with a resolution of 500m × 500m. Ship emissions were concentrated in the Macao-Hong Kong and Macao-Shenzhen shipping channels. Local emissions were concentrated in densely populated areas, including the Macao peninsula and Taipa. Air pollutants were lower in February and the fourth quarter, due to business suspensions during Spring Festival in February and emission reductions from power plant in the fourth quarter. Macao had the highest emission intensity per km2 among GBA cities, potentially causing high exposure concentrations and human health risks. The simulation results from WRF-CMAQ indicate that local emissions have a substantial impact Macao 's air quality. This study provides crucial information on air pollutant emission characteristics in Macao, as well as data support for regional air quality modeling and local pollution emission reduction efforts."

 While air pollution due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been effectively controlled in China; the photochemical pollution characterized by elevated ozone (O3) has emerged as a major concern for air quality improvement. Except for ozone, Lhasa is one of the cleanest cities in China with the lowest annual PM2.5 concentration in 2017. The levels of major air pollutants in Lhasa are much lower than those of other cities in the eastern region of China, especially in May, when the O3 concentration peaks. This study was based on multi-source observations in combination with the Goddard Earth Observing System coupled with chemistry (GEOS-Chem) and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) models to explore the causes of O3 pollution in Lhasa in May 2023. The results indicated that during the high O3 episodes, the concentrations of O3 precursors were low in Lhasa. Surrounding cities in other parts of the Tibetan Plateau also experienced high ozone concentrations despite being in different airsheds, suggesting that the O3 pollution in Lhasa was caused by regional transport rather than purely local emissions. Stratospheric intrusion events modulated by the westerly jet led to elevated ozone in the troposphere above Lhasa City. The results of the GEOS-Chem model indicated that horizontal advection, turbulence, diffusion, and other effects led to high concentrations of ozone in the near-surface above Lhasa. Vertical transport was the dominant factor leading to ozone concentration increases during high ozone days, with a contribution of 6.33 Gg/day. In addition, high-altitude air masses with a maximum altitude of over 8000 m, were observed arriving in Lhasa during the high ozone days. This study revealed that stratospheric intrusions have a greater contribution to the high O3 concentration in Lhasa in spring and provided a scientific basis for mitigating O3 pollution in the plateau cities."

 In this study, we report significant biennial variability or oscillation (BO) in the boreal spring (March–May) Surface Air Temperature (SAT) over India and unravelled the causative mechanisms. The positive phase of the BO exhibit significant seasonal warming over India, whereas seasonal cooling is observed during the negative phase of BO. Heat wave days are more during the positive phase of BO compared to negative or neutral phase. The positive (negative) phase of BO is generally coherent with the central (eastern) Pacific warming (cooling) years. The anomalous low-level divergence associated with low-level anticyclonic circulation induces less cloudiness and intense surface solar radiation ovr India during the positive phase, favouring surface warming. The evolution of some positive and/or negative phases of BO without any large scale forcing from the equatorial Pacific suggested the possibility of alternate pathways. The strong anomalous upper-level (at 200 hPa) anticyclonic circulation provoked by mid-latitude Rossby waves is found contributing to the positive phase, thereby highlighting the role of dominant mid-latitude pathways in the biennial SAT variability in addition to El Niño forcing. The sinking motion associated with persistent high, and the associated adiabatic compression also supported surface heating during the positive phase of BO. On the other hand, the mid-latitude Rossby wave induced upper-level cyclonic circulation is found contributing to the negative phase. The sinking motion associated with persistent high, and the associated adiabatic compression also supported surface heating during the positive phase of BO. In contrast, negative soil temperature anomalies and high latent heat flux release to the atmosphere supported surface cooling during the negative phase."

 Dust storms are associated with large amounts of particulate matter (PM) that can have adverse effects on health and the environment. The contribution of natural dust to atmospheric PM levels represents a scientific challenge, especially in areas with close proximity to dust sources. To improve our knowledge in this area, we collected 300 PM filter-samples across five oasis cities on the southern edge of the Taklimakan Desert in 2016, and applied the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data to quantify the contribution of natural dust to PM on sand dust and non-sand dust days. Research has shown that the particle size distribution of mineral dust in Taklimakan dust aerosols was relatively uniform. On sand dust days, CaSO4 and Na2SO4 were directly emitted from the surface, leading to higher sulfate concentrations in PM. While the increase in the proportions of organic carbon - OC1 and OC2 was attributed to the mixed anthropogenic emissions. On non-sand dust days, SO42− concentration was significantly affected by emissions from anthropogenic sources. The automotive composite emissions and coal combustion were the main sources of elemental carbon - EC1. Based on the results of MERRA-2 reanalysis data, natural dust constituted 53 % and 70 % of the total PM2.5 and PM10, respectively.

 In this study, we investigate the atmospheric circulation anomalies related to the PM2.5 mass concentration rapid decline cases in Beijing during winter when the PM2.5 concentration is the highest. From 2014 to 2021, 66 PM2.5 concentration rapid decline days (RDDs) are identified by considering the 90 % thresholds of the difference of PM2.5 mass concentration between two adjacent days. The composite evolution of PM2.5 concentration for the rapid decline cases features a slow increase on the accumulation phase but a rapid decline on RDDs with the average daily PM2.5 concentration decreases by 69.1 %. The composite evolution of atmospheric circulation anomalies in the lower troposphere related to these PM2.5 concentration rapid decline cases exhibits the eastward shift of cyclonic/anticyclonic geopotential height anomalies from the Mongolian Plateau/Northeast Asia to the Japan Sea/western Pacific, coinciding with a southerly-to-northerly reverse of wind anomalies in Beijing. The anomalous northerly on RDDs enhances the wind speed and therefore corresponds to the rapid decline of PM2.5 concentration. Further analysis suggests that the above process is responsible for 72.7 % of RDDs, and other about one-third of RDDs display anomalous southerly in Beijing, which also result in comparable PM2.5 reduction amplitude to that resulted from the northerly RDDs. The rapid decline of PM2.5 concentration for the Southerly RDDs cases is related to the near-surface southeasterly, which extends from 125°E to the west of Beijing, bringing the clean air masses from the Bohai Sea to the Beijing region."

 The potential climate-warming impact from aircraft contrails may be similar in magnitude to the direct effect from carbon dioxide emissions across all aviation. The warming impact may be mitigated through pre-tactical flight trajectory optimization to avoid ice supersaturation regions (ISSRs) while also considering aircraft performance and CO2 emissions. The ability to perform such deviations depends on accurate predictions of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Herein we evaluated the performance of two leading global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models: the Global Forecast System (GFS) developed in the USA and the Integrated Forecast System, (IFS) developed in Europe, and a research mesoscale model, Weather Research and Forecasting configured by SATAVIA (S-WRF) to predict UTLS moisture and ISSR. We compared humidity forecasts to observations from 383 aircraft flights and 3480 radiosonde profiles comprising approximately 1.5 million measurements over Europe and the Middle East for 10 months in 2022. Neither GFS nor IFS properly reproduced the observed distribution of relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice). Moreover, in addition to not being usable for prospective flight planning, the ERA5 reanalysis only slightly improved the outcome of the IFS. Only the S-WRF model with multi-moment cloud physics and high spatial resolution (5 km grid spacing) closely reproduced the observed relative frequency distribution of RHice. Furthermore, ISSR validation using near equal-area neighborhoods when computing Matthews Correlation Coefficient and F1 score showed that S-WRF scored higher (F1 = 0.66) than the IFS (F1 = 0.62), while the GFS had near zero score due to its near complete lack of predictions of RHice greater than 100 % in stark contrast to observations. In fact, S-WRF also correctly predicts 92 % of the time when conditions were not conducive to contrail formation. Ultimately, the S-WRF model could be used to alter flight plans to deviate above or below nearly certain contrail formation regions to reduce non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation."

Within this region, volatile meteorological conditions and severe synoptic systems, including thunderstorms, turbulence, sandstorms, and notably low-level wind shear (LLWS), present safety hazards to aviation operations. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of wind shear at typical QTP airports is essential. Xining Caojiapu International Airport (ZLXN) serves as a crucial transportation hub in the northeastern QTP. The frequent incidence of LLWS events due to the airport's unique geographical and meteorological features makes it an ideal location for investigating LLWS on the plateau. This study analyzed 80 pilot reports collected from 2016 to 2021 to elucidate the spatial and temporal characteristics of LLWS events at this plateau-valley airport. Subsequently, reanalysis data and observations from ground automated weather observing systems (AWOS), a geostationary satellite, a Doppler weather radar (DWR), and a Doppler wind lidar (DWL) were comprehensively employed to investigate the underlying meteorological factors and weather patterns associated with these LLWS events. The findings revealed that LLWS events at ZLXN are predominantly triggered by convective systems, followed by cold fronts and downward momentum transportation, with a smaller proportion being induced by orographic winds and turbulence. Analysis of four representative LLWS events utilizing high-resolution DWL measurements provided insights into the types of LLWS generated and their potential impacts on aircraft operations.

 This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the seasonal characteristics of raindrop size distribution (DSD) in Metro Manila, Philippines, using two years of measurements (2018–2020) from the PARSIVEL2 disdrometer. Seasonal properties of DSD for both stratiform and convective rain types were examined during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM; June–September), Northeast Monsoon (NEM; October–February), and pre-SWM or Transition period (March–May). Key findings reveal the dominance of small raindrops (<1 mm) during the NEM period, while mid-sized (1–3 mm) to large raindrops (>3 mm) are more prevalent during the SWM and Transition periods. The study highlights notable seasonal differences in DSD at moderate rain rates (5–10 mm hr−1), indicating variations in microphysical processes between stratiform and convective rain. Furthermore, the microphysical properties of convective rain in Metro Manila are found to be influenced by both oceanic and continental convective processes based on their mass-weighted mean diameter and generalized intercept parameter for all the monsoon periods. The DSD-derived dual-polarimetric radar variables are also shown to vary with the monsoon periods. Rainfall estimates using the DSD-derived dual-polarimetric relations statistically outperformed the empirical rainfall retrieval equation currently used by operational weather radars in the Philippines. Additionally, the Gamma shape parameter found in this study aligns with existing rainfall retrieval algorithm assumptions in space-borne radars. This similarity, along with the derived microphysical relations, could provide potential improvements in rainfall retrievals of ground-based and space-borne radars in tropical coastal environments like Metro Manila."

 To analyze the physicochemical mechanisms affecting the variation in fine suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in Taichung City, the largest city in central Taiwan (the second largest city in Taiwan), during a high-pollution event from November 3 to 6, 2021, we applied the sulfur tracking method (STM) and integrated source apportionment method (ISAM) of the WRF/CMAQ model to simulate the impacts of various emission sources. The sources of pollution in Taichung City are very similar, which shows that the impacts of point, line, and area sources should not be neglected in addition to the boundary conditions. SO42− is mainly generated from point emissions and the production of H2O2, Fe, Mn, and O3. NO3− is also mainly generated from point sources in Taichung City, with HNO3 being the main source at noon and ANO3 at other times of the day. NH4+ is mainly generated from area sources in Taichung City. OM is more complex, mainly originating from line sources in Taichung City and other sources, such as point/area emissions in Taichung City and other emissions from Changhua County. The most important mechanism is low-volatility/semivolatile oxidized combustion of OC at noon, followed by low-volatility/semivolatile POA, which is produced in the morning or evening. EC mainly originates from line sources in Taichung City and Changhua County. In other nearby counties, EC is dominated by local emission sources. In addition, when the concentration of PM2.5 is high, the Neutralization Ratio (NR) is high and PM2.5 is relatively neutral or slightly alkaline. On the contrary, when the concentration of PM2.5 is low, the NR is lower than 1 and the aerosol is acidic. Besides, this study used positive matrix factorization (PMF), which indicates that the PM2.5 at the UAPRS originated from eight kinds of pollution, namely, windblown dust, oil cracking, iron and steel industry, sea salt, transport, Cl− containing exhaust, biomass burning, fossil combustion containing abundant SO42− and the heavy oil refining and coal combustion industry. The direction of the source of pollution can be traced by a conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF). Overall, fossil fuel combustion, mainly involving sulfate, is the largest source of pollution, with the heavy oil refining and coal combustion industry contributing less, and the remaining factors contribute relatively evenly."

 Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is a crucial parameter in climate research. However, obtaining high precision PWV data remains a problem. Discrepancies in water vapor elevation data from diverse observation sources pose challenges, emphasizing the need for precise vertical correction. In this paper, we proposed the precipitable water vapor model with systematic difference correction by using ERA5 (the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis) data and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data. In this proposed method, two vertical correction models, employing cubic polynomial and exponential functions, were developed. The exponential function demonstrated superior overall performance with the RMS error of 0.96 mm, effectively capturing vertical characteristics across diverse regions, while the cubic polynomial function had the RMS (Root Mean Square) error of 2.77 mm validated by ERA5 PWV. The cubic polynomial function was found more suitable for low-elevation regions, while the exponential function excelled in high-elevation regions. Validated by radiosonde PWV, the cubic polynomial function and the exponential function show a strong correlation with latitude. Both functions exhibit smaller RMS values at higher latitudes and larger RMS values at lower latitudes. Validated by GNSS PWV, the cubic polynomial function exhibits superior accuracy, with the RMS of 2.39 mm, compared to the exponential function, particularly in specific regions. Analyzing six years of data reveals significant systematic differences between ERA5 and GNSS PWV. This discrepancy exhibits a noticeable annual periodic variation. The global GNSS stations were organized into grids, with stations within the same region grouped together for correction. Models considering systematic differences exhibited substantial RMS reductions and better accuracy. These findings can provide reference in atmospheric correction and the study of extreme weather events."

 The Yangtze River basin experienced extreme flooding during the summer of 2020, leading to widespread impact and significant economic losses. However, there is a lack of specific and quantitative anthropogenic attribution analysis. Here, we used the VIC model and the Risk Ratio framework to isolate the contributions of two anthropogenic (ANT) forcings, aka greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol (AER), to this event and the associated potential risk. We also assessed future risk by employing projections from four simulations under the SSP2–4.5 scenario in 2041–2100. Our findings reveal that ANT forcing reduces the probability by 74 %, while GHG forcing increase it by 6 %, and AER forcing decreases it by 92 % at the downstream Datong station. At the middle-stream Cuntan station, ANT forcing decreases the probability of extreme floodings similar to the 2020 event by 87 %, while GHG forcing decreases it by 82 %, and AER forcing decreases it by 95 %. In the future period under the SSP2–4.5 scenario, ANT forcing reduces the probability of extreme flood events like 2020 by 78 % and 82 % at the Cuntan and Datong stations, respectively. And The GHG and AER forcings contribute positively and negatively to the probability of flooding in the Yangtze River Basin, respectively, mainly through influencing the probability of extreme precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Our study provides valuable insights for policymakers to comprehend the anthropogenic influence on extreme flooding and to guide effective risk management strategies.Plain language summaryThe Yangtze River basin experienced severe flooding in the summer of 2020, but there is no specific and quantitative anthropogenic attribution analysis yet. Therefore, we performed an attribution analysis using the hydrological model and global climate models to isolate the anthropogenic (ANT) contribution for the 1961–2020 and 2041–2100 periods. We find that ANT forcing decreases the risk of extreme flooding, similar to the 2020 event, at the middle-stream Cuntan station and the downstream Datong station. In the future, ANT forcing significantly reduces the probability of potential extreme flood events in both stations. Additionally, we discovered that the net effect of ANT forcing on extreme flood events is determined by the counterbalance of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings. Our study aims to help policymakers gain a better understanding of the human impact on extreme flooding and develop effective risk management strategies."

 The north edge of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is defined by using the isoline with average total column water vapor (TCWV) equal to 25 mm, and the relationship between the north edge of the EASM and summer extreme precipitation in North China (NC) from 1961 to 2020 is discussed. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method is used to cluster extreme precipitation in the abnormal years of the north edge in NC, and the circulation characteristics of different types of extreme precipitation are discussed. The results show that the north edge of the EASM is closely related to extreme precipitation in NC. When the north edge is northerly, both the frequency and total amount of extreme precipitation increase significantly in the monsoon marginal zone. Based on different monsoon circulation background, summer extreme precipitation events in NC are divided into four categories, namely, the central type and southern type in the northerly years of north edge, and the central type and eastern type in the southerly years of north edge. The occurrence of different types of extreme precipitation is closely related to the different characteristics of local trough, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), and wave trains in the middle and high latitudes. Specifically, the central type extreme precipitation is affected by the mid-latitude wave train in the northerly years of north edge. As for the central type extreme precipitation in the southerly years of north edge, both high-latitude and mid-latitude wave trains transfer from west to east and converge over NC. However, the wave disturbance energy is relatively weak, leading to the extreme precipitation with weak intensity."

 Based on the CLoud, Albedo and RAdiation dataset, AVHRR-based, version 2 (CLARA-A2), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B43 (TRMM-3B43), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis data, the potential cloud precipitation capacity (PCPA) of typical regions in China is compared, and the relationship between impact factors and PCPA is discussed. Results have suggested that the Tarim Basin (TB) has scarce cloud water resources, while cloud water path (CWP) values are higher in South China (SC) and Sichuan Basin (SB) under the influence of the East Asian monsoon. Moreover, different typical regions of China exhibit varying dependencies on the ice water path (IWP) and liquid water path (LWP). There is a strong correlation between the IWP and precipitation in the Tibet Plateau (TP), Northeast China (NE), SC, and SB. The precipitation in TB demonstrates a more pronounced correlation with the LWP. Through a comparison of the correlation between PCPA and influencing factors in different typical regions of China, it is found that convective available potential energy (CAPE), surface latent heat flux (SLHF), surface sensible heat flux (SSHF), and 0–3 km relative humidity (RH) exhibit stronger correlation with PCPA than 2 m temperature (T2m) and 2–5 km vertical wind shear (SHEAR). Further investigation revealed that the joint effect of CAPE, RH, and SLHF has a pronounced effect on PCPA, particularly during spring and autumn. Additionally, the PCPA of TP exhibits significant dependency on the joint effect of these three influential factors. Furthermore, the ratio of LWP to IWP (RLI) also affects PCPA. In spring and autumn, the PCPA of TB and NC exhibits a positive correlation with RLI, whereas the PCPA of TP, SC, NE, and SB shows a negative correlation with RLI. In summer, the PCPA of TB and SC exhibits a notably negative correlation with RLI. This study deepens the understanding of the formation mechanism of cloud precipitation in typical regions of China, provides the basis for climate forecast and improves the accuracy of weather forecast."

 The design of emission abatement measures to effectively reduce ozone (O3) pollution is highly complex due to non-linear chemistry, multi-source precursor emissions, and regional-scale transport. All these processes also depend on the synoptic circulation conditions. This study classified large-scale circulations to explore the synoptic controls on surface O3 pollution over eastern China (EC) during the warm seasons (May to September) from 2013 to 2022. Four prevailing circulation patterns (CPs) were identified, distinguishable by distinct differences in surface O3 anomaly distribution over the EC region. Regional meteorological variables, satellite-based precursors (NO2 and CH2O), and CH2O/NO2 ratio-based O3 formation sensitivity (OFS) were projected onto each CP to explore the underlying physiochemical mechanism of synoptic circulation modulation to surface O3 pollution. The results indicated that circulation-driven regional transport governed the spatial variability of surface O3 anomaly distribution on a synoptic timescale. Additionally, circulation-driven temperature changes caused unsynchronized changes in NO2 and CH2O across different CPs, leading to circulation-dependent OFS distribution. Geographical O3 anomaly changes generally followed the O3-NOx-VOC chemical principle in most synoptic circulation situations, thereby providing a framework for formulating spatiotemporal sensitivity-oriented mitigation strategies for forthcoming O3 pollution episodes with the assistance of synoptic circulation forecasts."

 Sensor networks provide spatially resolved information about the time variation of PM2.5 concentrations in urban areas around the world. With relatively simple improvements to the control of the temperature and humidity of incoming air, and with proper quality assurance and calibration protocols, a low cost monitor was developed that provides measurements that were highly correlated with a reference PM2.5 monitor. These have sufficient resolution and reliability to quantify small differences within an urban area. Nevertheless, many sites report similar concentrations and it can be difficult to interpret the results or distinguish local from regional effects. Generalized Additive Models are an effective Machine Learning method to distinguish the impact of factors across very different scales. As a type of Interpretable Machine Learning / eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, they provide direct information on the link between specific factors and PM2.5 concentrations. GAM simulations were developed for sensors located around Dhaka, Bangladesh, for both the dry and the wet seasons. The simulations show that the largest contributor to high PM2.5 concentration variations across both urban and peri-urban sites is the boundary layer height which represent the vertical mixing of the urban plume. Using Trajectory Cluster Concentration Impacts, the simulations showed that robust estimates of long-range transport could be obtained from measurements located within a polluted environment, and the model further showed that enhancements of more than 40μg/m3 were associated with air transport from the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the dry season. Finally, interaction maps of the effect of horizontal wind speed and direction showed that these could be associated with up to +/−20 % variation in PM2.5 from site to site. Most of the enhancements are related to very calm winds and appear to be more strongly associated with road emissions than with point sources. Overall, the sensor network shows that air is polluted throughout the Dhaka area and into the peripheries, and that a multipronged approach will be needed to improve air quality for its inhabitants."

 The newly launched Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite in the early morning contributes to forming a complete three-orbit observation system, comprehensively improving the spatial coverage of satellite data. This study highlights the importance of applying the Microwave Humidity Sounder-II (MWHS-2) data from the FY-3E satellite by exploring the impact of jointly assimilating FY-3D and FY-3E MWHS-2 data under all-sky conditions on regional typhoon forecasting. Firstly, the impact of the different observation error statistics is studied based on FY-3D all-sky MWHS-2 radiance data assimilation for Typhoon Muifa (2022). The results show that the features of adaptive observation error statistics are rather consistent based on observational and meteorological information samples over different periods. Appropriate observation errors have the potential to improve typhoon track and intensity predictions, especially for rainfall forecasts. Consistent positive benefits of the typhoon intensity forecasts are obtained with the assimilation of the cloud-affected radiances from FY-3D MWHS-2. Moreover, joint assimilation experiments using FY-3D and FY-3E MWHS-2 radiances are conducted to compare the relative impact of each sensor for both clear-sky and all-sky. Results indicate improvements in the analyses of 500 hPa geopotential height and humidity with the introduction of cloud-affected radiance in joint assimilation experiments. The forecast performance of the joint assimilation method is significantly better than that with only FY-3E MWHS-2 observations in terms of the typhoon track, intensity, and precipitation. This superiority is particularly obvious in all-sky data assimilation experiments compared to clear-sky conditions."

 In recent years, China has made certain progresses regarding the monitoring of ozone (O3) pollution. However, a comprehensive understanding of the three-dimensional distribution and evolutionary characteristics of O3 is still relatively lacking. This study analyzed an O3 pollution episode in the Pearl River Delta during September to October 2019 using data from five O3 lidars and air pollution monitoring stations combined with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation data assimilation system. The model's performance in the vertical direction improved after assimilation, with the correlation coefficient of model simulations improving by 87 %, errors decreasing by 30 %, and simulation accuracy increasing by 29 %. Results showed that O3 pollution persisted for more than a week due to high temperatures and the influence of Typhoon Mita. However, after October 2, the concentration of O3 decreased under the combined effects of southerly winds and reduced traffic emissions during the National Day period. Besides, lidar observations indicate that residual O3 at night can disrupt its typical diurnal variation patterns. Moreover, O3 pollution occurred both at ground level and greater heights. Overall, O3 is primarily produced by photochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the O3 concentration was also affected by pollutant transport from northeast to southwest at a height of 0–3 km during the pollution period, with an average transport flux of 366 μg·m−2·s−1. Anomalously high nighttime O3 concentrations (>100 μg·m−3) were observed in both coastal and inland cities. Residual O3 could lead to persistent pollution the next day.

 The Sertã wildfire started on October 15th, 2017, in a mountainous area in central Portugal, on the hottest day of an exceptionally dry month compared to the previous two decades. This dry spell was attributed to a persistent heatwave from October 1st to 16th, which impacted most of mainland Portugal. Due to the critical weather and vegetation conditions, the fire was very intense, generating a thermal plume that reached high altitudes. The main purpose of this work is to analyze and discuss the impact of the Sertã wildfire on the dynamics of atmospheric mountain circulation. To accomplish this, a numerical modeling system integrating meteorological, fire spread, and smoke dispersion models was employed. The results indicate that the interaction between the wildfire and the local mountain breeze in central Portugal, under the synoptic weather conditions in Europe, which included the Hurricane Ophelia over the Atlantic Ocean and a warm-sector polar frontal depression in northern Europe, led to a locally disturbed weather situation. The consistent, efficient, and uniform local transport of atmospheric properties at lower levels was disrupted, intensifying wind shear and developing more turbulent advection patterns.

 As a key component of rainfall estimation, the understanding of raindrop size distribution (DSD) is a long-standing goal in meteorology and hydrology. Given that weather radar can observe the precipitation microphysics over large spatial and temporal scales, it has been broadly applied in DSD estimation. Traditional polynomial regression algorithms that correlate DSD parameters and radar signatures are still widely applied due to their simple structure and acceptable accuracy. This study proposes a new DSD retrieval model using dual-polarization radar observations based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network techniques. Three schemes able to retrieve the parameters of a normalized gamma DSD (LSTM-D0, LSTM-Nw, and LSTM-μ) are proposed with different combinations of polarimetric radar measurement inputs. All LSTM estimators exhibit better performance than the polynomial regression method. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for estimates of drop median diameter (D0) and intercept parameter (Nw) increases from 0.93 and 0.70 to 0.95 and 0.93 respectively at Chilbolton station. Poor estimates of the shape parameter (μ) using the polynomial regression estimator complicate real applications, whereas the remarkable improvement of LSTM model estimation facilitates practical applications. The temporal and spatial predictability is then estimated to investigate long-term estimator performance for various radars, or at least for all radar pixels of a single radar. The predictability, measured by the Nash coefficient, increases temporally by 0.08, 0.31, and 0.39 and spatially by 0.03, 0.19, and 0.23 for the parameters D0, log10Nw, and μ respectively. This study contributes to improving quantitative precipitation estimates from radar polarimetry, enabling a better understanding of precipitation microphysics."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107641,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了华南地区季风爆发前雨季期间降雨的日变化特征。研究利用了热带降雨测量任务（TRMM）降雨雷达（PR）的17年观测降雨数据，分析了不同降雨特征的日变化及其对南海夏季风（SCSSM）的响应。研究发现，华南西部地区的降雨强度更大，但降雨频率更低，而华南东部地区的降雨频率更高，但降雨强度更弱。南海夏季风的爆发导致整个华南地区的水汽含量增加，对流有效位能增加，从而导致降雨频率、对流比例和降雨顶高显著增加。研究结果揭示了季风爆发前雨季期间降雨的日变化特征，为数值模式模拟提供了新的见解。,"['precipitation', 'rainfall', 'satellite observation', 'TRMM', 'Precipitation Radar (PR)', 'diurnal cycle', 'monsoon']",Xiaoye Fan;Banghai Wu;Yu Wang;Jing Xi,Diurnal cycles of rain storms over South China during the presummer rainy season,"•The diurnal variation in the three-dimensional features of rain storms is revealed. •The west of South China has heavier but less frequent rain storms than the east. •The monsoon has positive impacts on frequency, convection, and height of rain storms. •Rain storm features in different regions respond differently to the monsoon. 
 The variation characteristics of rain storms (RSs) are closely related to complex internal physical processes and external dynamic and thermodynamic conditions. Using a 17-year observational rainfall dataset from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR), the diurnal cycles of various RS characteristics and their responses to the South China Sea Summer Monsoon (SCSSM) are investigated in South China (SC) during the presummer rainy season (PSRS). Before SCSSM outbreaks, the RSs in the western inland region of SC (WSC) have stronger precipitation intensities and convective features due to orographic lifting, especially at night, while those in the eastern inland region of SC (ESC) have higher RS occurrence frequencies with higher moisture transport, especially in the afternoon. The onset of the SCSSM leads to abundant moisture and sufficient convective available potential energy over the entire SC area, resulting in significant increases in the occurrence frequency, convective fraction, and precipitation top height of RSs. In the WSC, the weakened upward motion and smaller convective inhibition limit RS development, resulting in weaker rainfall intensity. In the ESC, a particularly unstable atmosphere and enhanced low-level moisture transport in the afternoon lead to a larger three-dimensional size, more active convection, and greater precipitation intensity in the RSs. These results offer fresh insight into the diurnal variation in rainfall during the PSRS and can be effectively used to evaluate numerical model simulations."

 The quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) is an important component of tropical monsoon variations. In this study, the QBWO rainfall demonstrates a westward propagation across the tropical Asian monsoon region, originating from the western North Pacific, passing through the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and ultimately reaching the northwestern Indian Peninsula. Notably, the rainfall anomalies over the South China Sea precede those over the Bay of Bengal by one quarter of the QBWO life cycle. Enhanced (suppressed) rainfall is closely associated with significant positive (negative) specific humidity anomalies, primarily induced by meridional moisture transport at the lower levels, as revealed by a moisture budget analysis. Specifically, the alternating presence and westward movement of northerly anomalies on the eastern (western) flank of anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomalies are responsible for transporting low-frequency moisture across tropical Asia, thereby instigating the westward propagation of QBWO rainfall. Thus, the multiscale interactions between atmospheric circulation and moisture play a pivotal role in the development of QBWO monsoon rainfall, and understanding the moisture dynamics of this rainfall development would provide useful information for subseasonal rainfall prediction in tropical Asia."

 The influence of cold fronts on the formation of ozone (O3) pollution, particularly the contributions of physical and chemical processes to O3 abundance during the passage of cold fronts in winter over the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) region was still unclear. This study provided an in-depth analysis on the occurrence of high O3 pollution based on data from field measurements and simulation of a chemical transport model (i.e., WRF-Chem) over the PRE region during winter 2021 when cold fronts were frequently observed. Totally 7 high O3 episode days were observed during pre- and post-frontal stages at DWS (i.e., Da Wan Shan island), a downwind island site of the inland Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, which were accompanied with the prevailing northerly wind patterns with insignificant variations of wind speeds in a stable boundary layer over the whole PRE region. The quantitative analysis based on simulation results indicated that horizontal transport and chemical processes accounted for the buildup of O3 abundance at DWS, with the highest mean rates of 7.3 and 5.6 ppbv/h at pre- and post-frontal stages, respectively. The high contributions from horizontal transport to O3 levels at DWS were associated with the persistent northerly winds with small variations, while the contributions of chemical processes were varied with the abundance of precursors and meteorological conditions. However, vertical transport made negative contributions to O3 abundance, with the most significant mean diffusion rate of −2.6 ppbv/h at the frontal stage because of the control of high-pressure system, while the less influence of vertical transport at pre- and post-frontal stages was associated with the weak pressure gradient forces and wind patterns. The sensitivity analysis further demonstrated that the emissions of precursors from the inland PRD region contributed 50–76% to O3 abundance over PRE at different stages. Overall, the above results quantitatively confirmed the dominant role of transport from inland PRD to the O3 pollution over the downwind PRE region and were helpful for better understanding of O3 pollution in winter over PRE."

 Accurate precipitation data are crucial in atmospheric and hydrological studies, especially for water resource management and disaster early warning. Satellite precipitation product (SPP) with high spatiotemporal resolution has been regarded as a valuable alternative precipitation source to ground observations. However, the hourly SPP generally performs poorly compared to daily SPP, thereby bias correction is urgently required. This study investigates the viability of utilizing machine learning methods to correct the bias of the hourly Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement-Early (IMERG-E) product. Meanwhile, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is utilized to generate high-resolution fields of four hourly meteorological variables, namely, temperature at 2 m (TEMP2), specific humidity at 2 m (Q2), wind direction at 10 m (WDIR10), and wind speed at 10 m (WSPD10), which further serve as covariates in machine learning models to enhance the correction process. Four machine learning models were developed, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) without WRF-simulated covariates, and RF-WRF and Bi-LSTM-WRF with meteorological covariates. The results demonstrated that incorporating WRF-simulated meteorological covariates improved model performance. Specifically, correlation coefficient (CC) values increased from 0.47 (RF) to 0.51 (RF-WRF) and rose from 0.55 (Bi-LSTM) to 0.60 (Bi-LSTM-WRF), along with reduced root mean square error (RMSE) and increased critical success index (CSI) values. Furthermore, two Bi-LSTM models consistently outperformed two RF models. Overall, the Bi-LSTM-WRF model emerged as the most effective correction method, which increased CC from 0.43 (IMERG-E) to 0.60, reduced RMSE from 1.91 mm to 1.08 mm, and enhanced CSI from 0.34 to 0.41. This study underscores the potential of integrating high-resolution WRF meteorological outputs into machine learning frameworks for correcting hourly SPPs, contributing significantly to the advancement of precipitation estimation in meteorological and hydrological applications."

 Droughts cause significant economic damage worldwide. Evaluating their impacts on crop yield and water resources can help mitigate these losses. Using single variables such as precipitation, temperature, the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) and the vegetation condition index (VCI) to estimate drought impacts does not provide sufficient information on these complex conditions. Therefore, this study uses station-based and remote-sensing-based data to develop new composite drought indexes (CDIs), including the principal component analysis drought index (PSDI) and the gradient boosting method drought index (GBMDI). The first dataset includes historical observations of the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI) at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month timescales. The second dataset consists of remote-sensing-based data including the VCI, SMCI, temperature condition index (TCI), and precipitation condition index (PCI). We validated the results of PSDI and GBMDI by comparing them with historical drought events, in-situ drought indices, and annual winter wheat crop yield data from 2003 to 2022 using a regression model. Our temporal analysis revealed extreme to severe drought events during1990s and 2010s. GBMDI typically aligned with actual drought events and exhibited stronger correlations with in-situ drought indices than PSDI. We observed that drought intensity in winter were more severe than in summer. GBMDI was the most effective method, followed by PSDI, for assessing drought impacts on winter wheat yields. Thus, the proposed integrated monitoring framework and indexes offered a valuable and innovative approach to addressing the complexities of agricultural drought, particularly in evaluating its effects."

 Extratropical cyclones (ECs) play an important role in precipitation generation at mid-latitudes. EC circulation involves multiple precipitation-generating structures, raising questions regarding the origin of their moisture uptake. Our study aimed to identify the origin of precipitation using a Lagrangian approach by targeting EC characteristics in different regions. To achieve this goal, we focused on the 28 most intense ECs that affected the Iberian Peninsula (IP) in winter, with a detailed analysis of three cases, namely, Daniel, Elsa and Fabien, which occurred in December 2019. Our EC masking methodology defines target regions using the radius, warm conveyor belt (WCB) footprint stages, and a square root spiral contour centred on the cyclone, fitted to the decreasing mean sea level pressure field. Our results revealed that variations in the water budget radial target regions are driven by the intensity of moisture uptake over the spatial distribution. Furthermore, the moisture uptake patterns of the WCB ascent and outflow footprints closely resemble those of the central areas due to their geographical proximity. In the integral WCB uptake framework, the moisture gained from initial ascending particles within the inflow footprints effectively accounts for contributions from remote sources. Despite the broader precipitation inclusion, the spiral shape maintains systematic and efficient cyclone moisture dynamics."

 The winter sea ice over the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS) is reducing at an alarming rate, which impacts the Arctic shipping routes and the local ecosystems as well as the climate system across other regions. Consequently, it is imperative to project the winter ice-free state in this region to adequately prepare for future climate change and its impacts. However, most models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show higher climatological values, weaker decreasing trends, and lower interannual variabilities in winter BKS sea ice concentration compared to observation. Additionally, it can be also seen that there exist great uncertainties in the projections of different models on whether the BKS region will be ice-free in future winters and the ice-free period, which spans almost the entire 21st century. Therefore, the study adopts two approaches developed from distance between indices of simulation and observation (DISO) method to project the winter ice-free period of the BKS under different emission scenarios. The results indicate that under SSP1–2.6, the winter BKS will not be ice-free by 2100. For SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5, the winter BKS is projected to be ice-free during 2076–2086, 2063–2068, and 2049–2061, respectively. By employing the DISO method, the projection uncertainty is reduced and the results highlight the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to delay the winter ice-free period over the BKS. These projections are intended to provide a reference for policymakers."

 Cloud and aerosol contribution to the Earth's radiative budget constitutes one of the most significant uncertainties in future climate projections. To distinguish between clouds and cloud-free air, atmospheric scientists have been using a wide range of instruments, techniques, and algorithms with various detection thresholds. However, since the change from a cloudy to a cloud-free atmosphere may be gradual and, in some cases, far from obvious, recent research is questioning where the threshold between both phases should be established. These considerations lead to contemplate a transition zone (TZ) between cloud and cloud-free conditions. In the present study, backscatter profiles obtained by a Vaisala CL31 ceilometer were processed to assess the transition zone. First, two widely used cloud detection algorithms were applied and compared: the method provided by the ceilometer manufacturer (Vaisala) and Cloudnetpy, the algorithm from ACTRIS Cloudnet, a project devoted to aerosol, clouds, and trace gases research. Second, a sensitivity analysis was applied to the backscatter and signal-to-noise ratio thresholds used for cloud detection in Cloudnetpy. This methodology has allowed us to assess the vertical distribution of clouds, aerosols, the TZ, and its frequency of occurrence. Results indicate a gradual transition in backscatter retrievals from cloud to cloud-free, where particles detected near cloud boundaries induced higher backscatter values than those found further away. Depending on the thresholds used, we observed a 9.3% (with an estimated range of uncertainty of 5.420%) variation in cloud occurrence which can be attributed to TZ conditions. Analysing the whole backscatter profile, we found as many TZ conditions as cloudy values, which emphasises the importance of studying the vertical distribution of the TZ. Moreover, the analysis of TZ occurrence in height and time revealed that such conditions concentrate below 800 m during night periods, although annual height-hour distributions involve a remarkable variability among seasons. These findings highlight the importance of either including an additional phase between ‘pure clouds’ and ‘pure aerosols’ or treating them as a continuum of suspended particles in the atmosphere."

 This study examined three Mediterranean Sea cyclones classified as medicanes: Zorbas, Ianos, and Apollo. All three cyclones traversed warm-core eddies during their propagation. We investigated the role of those eddies in the cyclones' development and the responses of those eddies to the passage of a cyclone. Cyclones Zorbas and Apollo intensified considerably in close proximity to warm-core eddies; whereas Ianos, the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Mediterranean Sea (reaching Category 2), underwent marginal intensification. In the case of Ianos, a strong marine heatwave was present during the intensification, releasing more latent and sensible heat fluxes due to the high ocean heat content, which masked the effect of the warm core eddy. For Zorbas and Apollo, the intensification above the warm-core eddy was accompanied by moisture convergence at the warm-core eddy, yielding substantial precipitation. In the case of Ianos, the convergence of moisture and subsequent precipitation aligned with the occurrence of a marine heatwave. For Zorbas and Apollo, chlorophyll-a concentrations and Phytoplankton increased after the cyclone passed over a warm-core eddy; whereas for Ianos, they increased near the site of a marine heatwave. All three cyclones responded similarly to elevated temperatures at the mesoscale (i.e., warm-core eddy) and regional scale (i.e., marine heatwave)."

 The variations in the track and intensity of a tropical cyclone (TC) are closely correlated with the fine-scale evolution of its structure. The fine-scale track, intensity, and structural evolution of Typhoon Doksuri (2023) can be comprehensively analyzed by combining multi-source observations. The results herein show that Doksuri (2023) experienced secondary eyewall formation (SEF), concentric eyewall maintenance (CEM), and eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) processes when entering the South China Sea and prior to landfall. These processes can be further delineated into three subsequent stages. In the first stage, the SEF phase, the secondary (outer) eyewall formed, exhibiting features that were non-concentric with the inner eyewall. Concurrently, the track of Doksuri (2023) displayed notable oscillations in both its forward translational direction and speed, accompanied by the emergence of two radial maxima centers of wind speed. Subsequently, during the second stage, the CEM phase, the geometric centers of the inner and outer eyewalls of Doksuri (2023) coincided, initiating a rapid intensification process characterized by an accelerated forward translational speed. Both the inner and outer eyewalls further contracted during this phase. In the third stage, the ERC phase, the asymmetry of the inner eyewall increased, and the outer eyewall gradually contracted while the inner eyewall dissipated until the replacement was completed prior to landfall. Accordingly, Doksuri (2023) experienced rapid weakening. These findings have the potential to enhance our understanding of the physical mechanisms governing the intricate structures of TCs at fine scales, bolstering the forecast accuracy of TC tracks and intensities."

To select SI events, we used a methodology based on the analysis of the temporal variability of in-situ observed stratospheric tracers (O3, CO and RH), modeled PV along 5-day back-trajectories starting at the measurement site, and satellite measurements of total column ozone (TCO). The analysis of two case studies revealed clear fingerprints of the stratospheric air masses on the atmospheric composition at CMN: CO2 and CH4 decreases were observed in winter, while CO2 CH4 increased (decreased) in summer. For 2015–2022, 9.8% of the hourly data were selected as influenced by SI events. The systematic analysis of the SI effect on CO2 confirmed differences between vegetative and non-vegetative seasons: during May–September, air masses from the stratosphere were richer in CO2 (+1.2 ± 0.1 ppm, average ±σ/N). On the other hand, during winter, air masses from higher altitudes were characterised by a lower amount of CO2 (−1.5 ± 0.1 ppm). Furthermore, SI events were usually characterised by an overall decrease in CH4 compared to the remaining data throughout the solar year (with average values ranging from −7.6 to −16.1 ppb as a function of the seasonal period). However, based on the analysis of seasonal anomalies of residuals, it looks that SI events did not play a major role in determining the interannual variability of CO2 and CH4 at CMN."

 Eolian dust darkens the snowpack, accelerates the snowmelt and alters atmospheric radiative budget and climate. Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a typical geological cold stage, is featured by more dust and snow cover than present day, which seems to own a stronger snow-darkening. In this study, we used a couple of climate model experiments in order to evaluate the effect of dust-in-snow changes on Northern Hemispheric climate and Asian monsoon. The results show that, compared to present day, more dust and snow cover in LGM allows heavier dust deposition and snowmelt, which produces a larger snow-albedo-temperature feedback. This snow-darkening leads to an annually averaged northern hemisphere warming of 0.31 °C, stronger in boreal spring and summer. Spatially, the prominent warming centers are found around LGM ice sheets and Tibetan Plateau (TP), up to 2–3 °C annually, which significantly contributes to the melt of ice and triggers the termination of glaciation. Over Asia, the present snow-darkening weakens the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon although not significant. However, strong LGM forcing does not amplify the weakening but intensifies the Indian and East Asian monsoon and precipitation. Thus, the potential role of dust and its interaction with snow cover should be mentioned in the glacial-scale climate change."

 Previous studies are primarily based on surface air pollution for a single event, leaving research on the temporal characteristics of aerosols and wind fields in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and their associations unclear due to a lack of long-term vertical profile data. This study was the first to conduct long-term Doppler wind LiDAR measurements from Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2022 in Hefei in western Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, China. The spatiotemporal characteristics of retrieved aerosol backscatter coefficient (β) and wind profiles were analyzed from the perspective of long-term statistics and typical heavy pollution episodes (HPEs). The seasonal profile of β showed a peak in the near-surface layer meanwhile the overall β profile (<0.5 km) was the highest in winter but lowest in summer. Combined with ground-based meteorological and air quality observations, 12 HPEs were identified and classified into dust-related events and fog-haze episodes. The results showed a consistency between hourly variations in PM10 (particulate matter smaller than 10 μm) concentration and β retrieved at 300 m during a high PM10 concentration (>150 μg/m3) period. Different roles of horizontal wind at different altitudes and its associated time delay effect on surface PM10 pollution were evaluated based on correlation coefficients (Ф) and air pollution diffusion conditions. Significant positive Ф values were noticed below 0.5 km during the entire dust-related EP4 and EP6, indicating that the higher wind speeds could exacerbate PM10 pollution. In contrast, large negative Ф values meant the removal of PM10 pollutants by strong winds below 0.8 km during 24 h after peak in EP3. Combining with backward trajectory analysis and meteorological condition, notable transboundary pollution with positive contributions from upper winds (>1.5 km) was discovered in dust-related EP1, EP4, EP7, EP9, and EP10. Time delay effect (1-h/2-h lag) of upper winds (>0.8 km) on surface PM10 pollution was explored in EP5, EP6, EP7, EP8, and EP9. In spring dust-related HPEs, surface PM10 pollution was mostly contributed by long-range transport of aerosol particles at higher altitudes (>1.5 km) from the northwest direction, driven by the Mongolian cyclone and the cold front system. Transboundary aerosols originated from the northern part of Anhui province and the YRD region in the middle altitudes (∼0.5 km) was the main contributor to fog-haze HPEs. The findings demonstrated the ability of the real-time Doppler wind LiDAR system to monitor transboundary air pollution and provided a scientific reference for policy makers."

 Due to the low spatial and temporal density of early meteorological observations in China, The China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System V3.0 (CLDAS3.0) could not obtain high-quality historical, high-resolution assimilated data. In particular, with high-resolution precipitation assimilation data, it is difficult to estimate the precipitation range accurately because of its substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity. To solve this problem, our team proposes a two-stage downscaling framework for the precipitation field based on multi-task learning, CLDASSD-PRCP. It improves the accuracy of the downscaling task by predicting the precipitation classification mask first. We verify the algorithm using CLDAS3.0 and site observations as ground truth in Yunnan, China. The results show that CLDASSD-PRCP can accurately generate three types of precipitation masks and reduce the MAE of downscaling results by 0.32 mm/h after adding multi-classification masks (MutiClassesMask). In addition, the effects of light and extreme precipitation on precipitation spatial downscaling are also revealed. CLDASSD-PRCP is significant for establishing statistical downscaling models based on deep learning and provides a new way to deal with atmospheric elements with significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity."

 Utilizing three-years COSMIC-2 radio occultation (RO) bending angle (BA) observations from 1 October 2019 to 31 December 2022, composite structures of BA anomalies α−α¯env/α¯env in vertical and radial directions are generated for hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions over the ocean basins of North Atlantic, West Pacific, East Pacific, South Pacific, North Indian, and South Indian. The magnitude and altitude of the maximum BA anomaly within hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions are about (6 km, 14%), (5 km, 11%) and (3.5 km, 9%), respectively. The vertical and radial extents of BA anomaly exceeding 6% are (6 km, 450 km) and (7 km, 500 km) over North Atlantic and West Pacific oceans, respectively. The warm core of hurricane over East Pacific ocean displays the widest radial extent (650 km), while that over North India ocean has the deepest vertical extent (8.5 km). As expected, the BA anomalies of tropical storms and tropical depressions are weaker in magnitude and smaller in size than those of hurricanes. An exception is found for the maximum BA anomaly of hurricanes over South Pacific ocean is not located near hurricane centers but at the 175-km radial distance. Accordingly, the mean altitudes of the atmospheric boundary layer estimated from COSMIC-2 BA observations increase from the 175-km radial distances to both sides for hurricanes over South Pacific ocean, while those over the other five ocean basins increase from eye centers outward."

Here we show that contrail-processed soot is highly compact but that it remains unable to form ice at a relative humidity different from that required for the formation of background cirrus from the more ubiquitous aqueous solution droplets, suggesting that it will not perturb cirrus cloud formation via ice nucleation. 
 Aviation soot surrogates processed in contrails are believed to become potent ice nuclei at cirrus temperatures. This is not verified for real aviation soot, which can have vastly different physico-chemical properties. Here, we sampled soot particles from in-use commercial aircraft engines and quantified the effect of contrail processing on their ice nucleation ability at T< 228 K. We show that aviation soot becomes compacted upon contrail processing, but that does not change their ice nucleation ability in contrast to other soot types. The presence of H2SO4 condensed in soot pores, the highly fused nature of the soot primary particles and their arrangement are what limit the volume of pores generated upon contrail processing, in turn limiting sites for ice nucleation. Furthermore, we hypothesized that contrail-processed aviation soot particles emitted from alternative jet fuel would also be poor ice-nucleating particles if their emission sizes remain small (< 150 nm)."

Our findings show that biomass burning and traffic-related emissions (especially from Euro 4 diesel cars) significantly contribute to BC concentrations. This research offers crucial insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to improve air quality in cities. 
 Understanding black carbon (BC) levels and its sources in urban environments is of paramount importance due to the far-reaching health, climate, and air quality implications. While several recent studies have assessed BC concentrations at specific fixed urban locations, there is a notable lack of knowledge in the existing literature on spatially resolved data alongside source estimation methods. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation of BC levels and sources in Modena (Po Valley, Italy), which serves as a representative example of a medium-sized urban area in Europe. Using a combination of multi-wavelength micro-aethalometer measurements and a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian modelling system, we studied two consecutive winter seasons (February–March 2020 and December 2020–January 2021). Leveraging the multi-wavelength absorption analyser (MWAA) model, we differentiate sources (fossil fuel combustion, FF, and biomass burning, BB) and components (BC vs. brown carbon, BrC) from micro-aethalometer measurements. The analysis reveals consistent, minimal diurnal variability in BrC absorption, in contrast to FF-related sources that exhibit distinctive diurnal peaks during rush hours, while BB sources show less diurnal variation. The city itself contributes significantly to BC concentrations (52 ± 16 %), with BB and FF playing a prominent role (35 ± 15 % and 9 ± 4 %, respectively). Long-distance transport also influences BC concentrations, especially in the case of BB and FF emissions, with 28 ± 1 % and 15 ± 2 %, respectively. When analysing the traffic-related concentrations, Euro 4 diesel passenger cars considerably contribute to the exhaust emissions. These results provide valuable insights for policy makers and urban planners to manage BC levels in medium-sized urban areas, taking into account local and long-distance sources."

The over 200 globally detected natural and anthropogenic source regions include small-scale point sources such as individual coal mines and larger-scale source regions such as wetlands and large oil and gas fields. 
 Methane (CH4) is an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and its rising concentration in the atmosphere contributes significantly to global warming. A comparatively small number of highly emitting persistent methane sources are responsible for a large share of global methane emissions. The identification and quantification of these sources, which often show large uncertainties regarding their emissions or locations, are important to support mitigating climate change. Daily global column-averaged dry air mole fractions of atmospheric methane (XCH4) are retrieved from radiance measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite with a moderately high spatial resolution, enabling the detection and quantification of localized methane sources. We developed a fully automated algorithm to detect regions with persistent methane enhancement and to quantify their emissions using a monthly TROPOMI XCH4 dataset from the years 2018–2021. We detect 217 potential persistent source regions (PPSRs), which account for approximately 20 % of the total bottom-up emissions. By comparing the PPSRs in a spatial analysis with anthropogenic and natural emission databases, we conclude that 7.8 % of the detected source regions are dominated by coal, 7.8 % by oil and gas, 30.4 % by other anthropogenic sources like landfills or agriculture, 7.3 % by wetlands, and 46.5 % by unknown sources. Many of the identified PPSRs are in well-known source regions, like the Permian Basin in the USA, which is a large production area for oil and gas; the Bowen Basin coal mining area in Australia; or the Pantanal Wetlands in Brazil. We perform a detailed analysis of the PPSRs with the 10 highest emission estimates, including the Sudd Wetland in South Sudan, an oil- and gas-dominated area on the west coast in Turkmenistan, and one of the largest coal production areas in the world, the Kuznetsk Basin in Russia. The calculated emission estimates of these source regions are in agreement within the uncertainties in results from other studies but are in most of the cases higher than the emissions reported by emission databases. We demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically detect and quantify persistent localized methane sources of different source type and shape, including larger-scale enhancements such as wetlands or extensive oil- and gas-production basins."

 The western North Atlantic Ocean is strongly influenced by continental outflow, making it an ideal region to study the atmospheric transition from a polluted coastline to the marine environment. Utilizing eight transit flights between the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) in Hampton, Virginia, and the remote island of Bermuda from NASA's Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE), we examine the evolution of trace gas and aerosol properties off the US East Coast. The first pair of flights flew along the wind trajectory of continental outflow, while the other flights captured a mix of marine and continental air mass sources. For measurements within the boundary layer (BL), there was an offshore decline in particle N<100 nm, N>100 nm, CH4, CO, and CO2 concentrations, all leveling off around ∼900 km offshore from the LaRC. These trends are strongest for the first pair of flights. In the BL, offshore declines in organic mass fraction and increases in sulfate mass fraction coincide with increasing hygroscopicity based on f(RH) measurements. Free troposphere measurements show a decline in N<100 nm, but other measured parameters are more variable when compared to the prominent offshore gradients seen in the BL. Pollution layers exist in the free troposphere, such as smoke plumes, that can potentially entrain into the BL.

Using a large number of process-resolving simulations of marine stratocumulus, we show that solar heating drives a negative feedback mechanism that buffers the persistent negative trend in cloud water adjustment after sunrise. This finding has implications for the dependence of the cloud cooling effect on the timing of deliberate aerosol perturbations. 
 Marine low-level clouds are key to the Earth's energy budget due to their expansive coverage over global oceans and their high reflectance of incoming solar radiation. Their responses to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations remain the largest source of uncertainty in estimating the anthropogenic radiative forcing of climate. A major challenge is the quantification of the cloud water response to aerosol perturbations. In particular, the presence of feedbacks through microphysical, dynamical, and thermodynamical pathways at various spatial and temporal scales could augment or weaken the response. Central to this problem is the temporal evolution in cloud adjustment, governed by entangled feedback mechanisms. We apply an innovative conditional Monte Carlo subsampling approach to a large ensemble of diurnal large-eddy simulation of non-precipitating marine stratocumulus to study the role of solar heating in governing the evolution in the relationship between droplet number and cloud water. We find a persistent negative trend in this relationship at night, confirming that the role of microphysically enhanced cloud-top entrainment. After sunrise, the evolution in this relationship appears buffered and converges to ∼-0.2 in the late afternoon. This buffering effect is attributed to a strong dependence of cloud-layer shortwave absorption on cloud liquid water path. These diurnal cycle characteristics further demonstrate a tight connection between cloud brightening potential and the relationship between cloud water and droplet number at sunrise, which has implications for the impact of the timing of advertent aerosol perturbations."

Leveraging machine learning techniques, we constructed a long-term global sea surface DMS gridded dataset with daily resolution. Compared to previous datasets, our new dataset holds promise for improving atmospheric chemistry modeling and advancing our comprehension of the climate effects associated with oceanic DMS. 
 The oceanic emission of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) plays a vital role in the Earth's climate system and constitutes a substantial source of uncertainty when evaluating aerosol radiative forcing. Currently, the widely used monthly climatology of sea surface DMS concentration falls short of meeting the requirement for accurately simulating DMS-derived aerosols with chemical transport models. Hence, there is an urgent need for a high-resolution, multi-year global sea surface DMS dataset. Here we develop an artificial neural network ensemble model that uses nine environmental factors as input features and captures the variability of the DMS concentration across different oceanic regions well. Subsequently, a global sea surface DMS concentration and flux dataset (1° × 1°) with daily resolution spanning from 1998 to 2017 is established. According to this dataset, the global annual average concentration was ∼ 1.71 nM, and the annual total emissions were ∼  17.2 Tg S yr−1, with ∼ 60 % originating from the Southern Hemisphere. While overall seasonal variations are consistent with previous DMS climatologies, notable differences exist in regional-scale spatial distributions. The new dataset enables further investigations into daily and decadal variations. Throughout the period 1998–2017, the global annual average concentration exhibited a slight decrease, while total emissions showed no significant trend. The DMS flux from our dataset showed a stronger correlation with the observed atmospheric methanesulfonic acid concentration compared to those from previous monthly climatologies. Therefore, it can serve as an improved emission inventory of oceanic DMS and has the potential to enhance the simulation of DMS-derived aerosols and associated radiative effects.

To achieve this goal, we apply a principal component analysis (PCA) retrieval technique, also used for the OMI and SNPP/OMPS SO2 products, to N20/OMPS. For volcanic SO2 retrievals, the algorithm is identical between N20 and SNPP/OMPS and produces consistent retrievals for eruptions such as Kilauea in 2018 and Raikoke in 2019. For anthropogenic SO2 retrievals, the algorithm has been customized for N20/OMPS, considering its greater spatial resolution and reduced signal-to-noise ratio as compared with SNPP/OMPS. Over background areas, N20/OMPS SO2 slant column densities (SCDs) show relatively small biases, comparable retrieval noise with SNPP/OMPS (after aggregation to the same spatial resolution), and remarkable stability with essentially no drift during 2018–2023. Over major anthropogenic source areas, the two OMPS retrievals are generally well-correlated, but N20/OMPS SO2 is biased low, especially for India and the Middle East, where the differences reach ∼ 20 % on average. The reasons for these differences are not fully understood but are partly due to algorithmic differences. Better agreement (typical differences of ∼ 10 %–15 %) is found over degassing volcanoes. SO2 emissions (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEASURES/SO2/DATA406, Fioletov et al., 2022) from large point sources, inferred from N20/OMPS retrievals, agree well with those based on OMI, SNPP/OMPS, and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with correlation coefficients >0.98 and overall differences <10 %. The ratios between the estimated emissions and their uncertainties offer insights into the ability of different satellite instruments to detect and quantify SO2 sources. While TROPOMI has the highest ratios of all four sensors, the ratios from N20/OMPS are slightly greater than OMI and substantially greater than SNPP/OMPS. Overall, our results suggest that the version-1 N20/OMPS SO2 product will successfully continue the long-term OMI and SNPP/OMPS SO2 data records. Efforts currently underway will further enhance the consistency of retrievals between different instruments, facilitating the development of multi-decade, coherent global SO2 datasets across multiple satellites."

This may be a new paradigm for computationally intense future model applications. We initiated this work due to a need to leverage cloud computing advances and to ease the learning curve for new users. 
 The Community Multiscale Air Quality Model  (CMAQ) is a local- to hemispheric-scale numerical air quality modeling system developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and supported by the Community Modeling and Analysis System (CMAS) center. CMAQ is used for regulatory purposes by the USEPA program offices and state and local air agencies and is also widely used by the broader global research community to simulate and understand complex air quality processes and for computational environmental fate and transport and climate and health impact studies. Leveraging state-of-the-science cloud computing resources for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, CMAQ is now available as a fully tested, publicly available technology stack (HPC cluster and software stack) for two major cloud service providers (CSPs). Specifically, CMAQ configurations and supporting materials have been developed for use on their HPC clusters, including extensive online documentation, tutorials and guidelines to scale and optimize air quality simulations using their services. These resources allow modelers to rapidly bring together CMAQ, cloud-hosted datasets, and visualization and evaluation tools on ephemeral clusters that can be deployed quickly and reliably worldwide. Described here are considerations in CMAQ version 5.3.3 cloud use and the supported resources for each CSP, presented through a benchmark application suite that was developed as an example of a typical simulation for testing and verifying components of the modeling system. The outcomes of this effort are to provide findings from performing CMAQ simulations on the cloud using popular vendor-provided resources, to enable the user community to adapt this for their own needs, and to identify specific areas of potential optimization with respect to storage and compute architectures."

However, few have addressed the challenges in the prior vertical structure. A variety of observations are assimilated to examine the sensitivity of assimilation to vertical structure. Results show that assimilation can optimize the dust field in general. However, if the prior introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. 
 Modeling and observational techniques are pivotal in aerosol research, yet each approach exhibits inherent limitations. Aerosol observation is constrained by its limited spatial and temporal coverage compared to models. On the other hand, models tend to possess higher uncertainties and biases compared to observations. Aerosol data assimilation has gained popularity as it combines the advantages of both methods. Despite numerous studies in this domain, few have addressed the challenges faced in assimilating aerosol data with significant differences in magnitude and degree of freedom between the model state and observations, especially in the vertical direction. These challenges can lead to the preservation or even exacerbation of structural inaccuracies within the assimilation process. This study investigates the sensitivity of dust aerosol data assimilation to the vertical structure of the aerosol profile. We assimilate a variety of dust observations, encompassing ground-based particulate matter (PM10) measurements and satellite-derived dust optical depth (DOD) data, using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The assimilation process is elucidated, detailing the assimilation of raw ground-based and satellite-based observations for an optimized three-dimensional (3D) posterior state. To demonstrate the impact of accurate versus erroneous prior aerosol vertical profiles on the assimilation result, we select three cases of super dust storms for analysis. Our findings reveal that the assimilation of ground observations would optimize the dust field at the ground in general. However, the vertical structure presents a more complex challenge. When the prior profile accurately reflects the true vertical structure, the assimilation process can successfully preserve this structure. Conversely, if the prior profile introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. This is also found in the assimilation of DOD, which exhibits a comparable pattern in its sensitivity to the initial aerosol profile's accuracy."

However, evaluations based on field observations are limited, especially in clean marine environments. Utilizing observation data from a coastal mountain site in May 2021 in Qingdao, northern China, we reveal the important regulating effect of carbonyls in atmospheric oxidation capacity and particulate sulfur chemistry using detailed chemical box models. Photolysis of gaseous carbonyls accounted for >90% and >60% of the primary sources of HO2 and RO2, respectively, contributing 38% of net O3 production. Notably, HCHO alone constituted 80% of the primary HO2 and 15% of net O3 production. Using a multiphase model with updated HCHO-related chemistry, we determine that HCHO chemistry can account for up to 30% of total particulate sulfur (the sum of hydroxymethanesulfonate and sulfate) and address more than one-third of the simulated sulfate gap. The emission-based multiphase model indicates that the HCHO-related pathway remains significant and can account for 20% of the particulate sulfur under clean marine conditions. These findings underscore the importance of carbonyls, particularly HCHO, in regulating the atmospheric oxidation capacity and particulate sulfur chemistry in the marine atmosphere, urging further laboratory studies on chemical kinetics and field measurements of particle-phase carbonyls."

In this study we investigated the causes for the decadal trends of surface solar radiation (SSR) observed at eight stations scattered across seven islands in the Western Pacific Ocean, and extrapolated the results to the whole Western Pacific region based on the understanding of physical processes. Our results show a contrast between the causes for SSR trends in the northwestern and in the southwestern Pacific. In the Southwestern Pacific region, changes in cloud cover play a major role in the SSR decadal trends and interannual variability. The cloud cover in these areas is strongly associated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, especially those induced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Modes of variability such as ENSO and IPO affect evaporation and convection, impacting the large‐scale dynamics of the atmosphere, therefore influencing the distribution of the regions of deep convection. This consecutively impacts the cloud cover on a regional level and therefore SSR. In the Northern Hemisphere, conversely, a strong influence of these modes on cloudiness and SSR was not found. Instead, indirect evidence suggests that anthropogenic aerosol transported from Eastern Asia plays a major role in the decadal SSR trends. These results contribute to an improved understanding of the physical processes relevant for the long‐term SSR trends in remote regions."

To more deeply understand BL and mixed‐phase cloud properties during CAO conditions, the Cold‐Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) took place from late 2019 into early 2020. During COMBLE, the U.S. Department of Energy's first Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility (AMF1) was deployed to Andenes, Norway, far downstream (∼1,000 km) from the Arctic pack ice. This study examines the two most intense CAOs sampled at the AMF1 site. The observed BL structures are open cellular with high (∼3–5 km) and cold (−30 to −50 ° ${}^{\circ}$C) cloud tops, and they often have pockets of high liquid water paths (LWPs; up to ∼1,000 g m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$) associated with strong updrafts and enhanced turbulence. We use a high‐resolution mesoscale model to explore how well four turbulence closure methods represent open cellular clouds. After applying a radar simulator to model outputs for direct evaluation, cloud top properties agree well with AMF1 observations (within ∼10%), but radar reflectivity and LWP agreement is more variable. Results suggest that the turbulent Prandtl number may play an important role for the simulated BL and cloud properties. All simulations produce enhanced precipitation rates that are well‐correlated with a cloud transition. Finally, the eddy‐diffusivity/mass‐flux approach produces the deepest cloud layer and therefore the largest and most coherent cellular structures. We recommend the use of a non‐local turbulence closure approach to better capture turbulent processes in intense CAOs."

 Foreign investments in overseas coal-fired power plants (OCPs) largely impede decarbonization efforts, yet their global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have not been sufficiently quantified. Here we analyse investment data from 908 OCPs worldwide, and then reveal current annual emissions of 0.53 GtCO2 yr−1 and a historical cumulative total of 26 GtCO2. Developed nations account for 78% of these cumulative emissions on the basis of investments, while emissions from developing nations have surged from 8% in 1960 to 39% in 2022. Assuming unchanged policies and technologies, OCPs are projected to contribute an additional 15–30 GtCO2 in cumulative emissions by 2060 directly. Furthermore, they could stimulate local coal power growth in emerging economies, potentially adding 6.3–45.0 GtCO2 emissions indirectly. Our study underscores the critical importance of low-carbon policy interventions in emerging countries to curb the power-sector carbon emissions increasingly influenced by international capital.

 Many insects utilise optical information in linearly polarised light for navigation, with the degree of linear polarisation (DoLP) determining whether the ‘visibility’ of such optical information is available to them. However, changes in degree of linear polarisation in response to increased atmospheric levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are poorly understood. We present analyses based on both ground-based monitoring and particulate matter modelling, establishing a quantitative relationship between PM2.5 mass concentration and the DoLP. We apply this relationship to a global PM2.5 projection for 2050 and estimate the increase in number and spatial extent of low visibility days for honeybees. We find an increase by up to 20% in the geographical extent of low visibility days in 2050, with an augmented frequency of low visibility days across an area exceeding 0.75 million km2 in India and 2 million km2 in China. More frequent and widespread low visibility conditions can reduce the ability of insects to navigate, especially in hotspot regions.

 The accurate estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) is the basis for plantation forest carbon trading. This study focused on Picea crassifolia artificial plantations, extracting individual tree crown diameters and heights using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) data and calculating the individual tree biomass using allometric growth equations. These results were then used to train a satellite image AGB prediction model. In additional, satellite images were resampled to different resolutions to assess the impact of satellite image resolution on model the accuracy. Finally, the model with the highest accuracy among the deep learning algorithms was selected to predicts the AGB within the P. crassifolia plantation forest. The results indicated that the accuracy of single tree crown diameters extracted from P. crassifolia point clouds significantly surpassed those extracted from general point clouds and Crown Height Model (CHM), while the accuracy of the heights extracted from all three sources was similar; RepLKNet outperformed GoogLeNet and ResNet in identifying plantation forest; random forest slightly outperformed XGBoost in the capability of AGB prediction, while the accuracy of the AGB prediction models initially increasd and then decreasd with satellite image resolution, reaching the highest accuracy at a resolution of 50 m. This indicates that the optimal satellite image resolution for estimating the AGB in the study area was affected by scale effects of 50 m.

 In August 2023, a detailed investigation of formaldehyde (HCHO) chemical characteristics on ozone (O3) polluted days and non-O3 polluted days in Wuhan was undertaken. The mean value of HCHO on O3 polluted days (3.02 ± 1.15 ppbv) was 122% higher than that on non-O3 polluted days (1.35 ± 0.41 ppbv). Utilizing Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed secondary formation as the dominant HCHO source (58.3% on non-O3 polluted days and 66.2% on O3 polluted days). On O3 polluted days, the contribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)/solvent usage and industrial emissions to HCHO were 13.7% and 8.2%, respectively, whereas on non-O3 polluted days, LPG/solvent use and diesel exhaust contributed 15.4% and 14.7%, respectively. The top ten species, with the highest Relative Incremental Reactivity (RIR) to HCHO, were mainly alkenes and aromatics, which remained consistent on both O3 and non-O3 polluted days. It is noteworthy that the RIR of isobutane to HCHO is significant in this study. Further reapportionment of secondary HCHO by a photochemical box model indicated that LPG/solvent usage (33.2%) contributed the most to HCHO on O3 polluted days, while diesel exhaust (31.9%) dominated on non-O3 polluted days.

 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface ozone air pollution have severe health consequences. Since China implemented the nationwide Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) in 2013, annual average PM2.5 concentrations have decreased while O3 concentration have increased in Beijing. It is unclear, however, to the extent that short-term meteorological variability has influenced these trends. To separate the influence of meteorology from long-term emissions-induced changes, we quantify the portion of the long-term PM2.5 and O3 concentration signals associated with short-term meteorological variability. Building off recent literature highlighting the regional nature of pollutant variability, we incorporate both locally observed meteorology and average regional reanalysis. We isolated sub-seasonal variability using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. Next, we trained and compared the utility of three statistical models of varying complexity (a linear model, a general additive model with splines, and a random forest) in their ability to predict out-of-sample daily concentrations. The random forest model yields the best predictive capability in holdout tests and predicts changing meteorological contributions to PM2.5 and ozone concurrent with changing concentrations across the study period. Results show an overall decrease in meteorology induced PM2.5 concentration variability at daily scales since 2013, but variability from meteorology has increased relative to mean PM2.5 concentrations. In contrast, O3 shows the opposite trend, with increasing meteorology-induced variability (meteorology-induced variability normalized by mean observed O3 has decreased). Our results show the importance of including regional meteorology in explaining local PM2.5 and O3 variability and quantify links between long-term policy implementation and short-term meteorological contributions to pollutant concentrations."

 Benzothiazoles (BTHs), commonly used in various industrial applications, have emerged as significant contaminants due to their widespread usage and potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. The aim of this study is to quantify and, for the first time, to characterize the particle size distribution of eight BTHs across twelve fractions of atmospheric aerosol representative of the urban boundary layer. Samples were collected from August to October 2023 in the urban area of Venice, located in the Po Valley, known for its poor air quality. Instrumental analysis was achieved via an UHPLC system coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.All target compounds were present in the samples analyzed and most of them tended to distribute mainly in the fine fraction of aerosol (<1.8 μm). An exception is given by BTH-SO3H, which presents a bimodal distribution with maxima centered in the coarse fraction; this may imply a different source compared to other BTHs. BTH-SH is the most abundant benzothiazole derivative, suggesting tyre debris as the main source since it is the main compound used in vulcanizing accelerators in rubber manufacture. Given its mutagenic properties, its high relative abundance could be of concern for human health.Resultsof this work provide valuable insights into the distribution of BTHs in urban aerosols, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at better understanding their sources and environmental pathways, fate and impacts."

 In this study, we detected for the first time a series of γ-lactones (C7-C16) isolated from Canadian high arctic aerosols collected from late February to June as the sun rises from below the horizon to the maximum. γ-Lactones were identified and quantified by GC-MS utilizing the fragment ion (m/z 85) of [C4H5O2]+.

Unsaturated fatty acids, plausible sources of the γ-lactones, can originate from marine phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation via long-range atmospheric transport to the Arctic.

Chou;Chuan-Yao Lin;Ja-Huai Lee;Wei-Che Lin;Meng-Hsuan Li;Shyh-Wei Chen;Shu-Hao Chang,PM<sub>2.5</sub> episodes in northern Taiwan under southerly winds in late winter,"•The PM2.5episodes also occur at northern Taiwan under south wind. •Increase in PM2.5concentration are through HADV, AERO, EMIS, and CLDS. •NO3-is mainly from the reactions of OH and NO2during daytime and N2O5and H2O during nighttime. •SO42-is largely influenced by LRT from mainland China and LP from the reaction of SO2and H2O2. •OC is mainly caused by low-volatility/semivolatile oxidized combustion OC. 
 When northern Taiwan is influenced locally, PM2.5 events occur in specific conditions. If it is also affected by long-range transport from mainland China in the northwest, the probability of these PM2.5 events increases. The current study applies WRF/CMAQ to study such case but focus on the local. From April 7 to 9, 2019, the Pacific high pressure extended westward, causing the prevailing weak southerly wind near Taiwan. The intensity of the Pacific high pressure weakened, and the wind speed near Taiwan also weakened. Therefore, the PM2.5 concentration in Taiwan increased. In northern Taiwan, the hourly PM2.5 concentration will inevitably increase to approximately 70 μg m−3. The ISAM of the CMAQ model demonstrates that local contributions to daily PM2.5 concentrations at the four representative monitoring stations in northern Taiwan are 3.5 to 16.2 μg m−3, greater than those from central, southern, and eastern Taiwan, from 1.8 to 6.7 μg m−3. We use the integrated process rate (IPR) and integrated reaction rate (IRR) of CMAQ to explore the formation mechanisms of PM2.5. The main causes of the increase in PM2.5 concentration are horizontal advection (HADV), aerosol processes (AERO), emissions (EMIS), and a small amount of cloud processes and aqueous chemistry (CLDS). The main source of NO3− is the reaction between OH and NO2 during the day and the reaction between N2O5 and water vapor at night. The gaseous HNO3 concentration reaches a peak near noon or soon after. The aerosol ANO3 concentration is high in the early morning. We also use the Sulfur Tracking Method (STM) of CMAQ to explore the sources of SO42−. Mainly it is from the local reaction of SO2 and H2O2. Finally, we apply AERO7 in CMAQ to explore the main sources of carbon components. The organic carbon (OC) concentration is much greater than the element carbon (EC) concentration, which indicates a strong local photochemical effect in northern Taiwan. OC mainly comes from low-volatility/semivolatile oxidized combustion OC, followed by low-volatility/semivolatile POA. Similar weather conditions occur in autumn, winter, and spring. When the weak southerly wind was around Taiwan, PM2.5 in northern Taiwan was noticed."

 Quantitative seasonal Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall forecasting has been a challenge for the climate models as it is sensitive to cloud properties, which are modulated by large-scale dynamics. Proper understanding of the role of dynamics, aerosols, and cloud microphysical processes is important for the precipitation calculation in dynamical models. The all-India averaged seasonal ISM rainfall (ISMR) from June to September had been normal or above normal, however there were large spatial variations. Some meteorological subdivisions, the majority of which lie in the Gangetic Plains, received deficient seasonal rainfall during recent years 2022 and 2010. The quantitative seasonal prediction of the spatial distribution of ISMR from global coupled models (GCMs) has also shown a hard time for accurate spatial rainfall distribution. Four monsoon years (2022, 2021, 2011, and 2010) are considered, in which the country as a whole (all India land points) was ‘above normal’ or ‘normal’. However, in two specific years (2022 and 2010), some subdivisions received deficient rainfall (17% and 15% of the total area). We have used several datasets from the ground, and satellite observations, along with reanalysis products and computed climatology and anomalies for monsoon years of 2022 and 2010. The low-level wind and vertical velocity along with cloud microphysics played a pivotal role in the heterogeneous distribution of ISMR during 2022 and 2010 as compared to years 2021 and 2011. Here, we have demonstrated that the spatial heterogeneity of the positive and negative precipitation anomalies was consistent with cloud properties. Aerosols might have an impact on the cloud microphysical processes and modulate cloud properties and rainfall over different regions due to the availability of water vapor. Therefore, the inclusion of aerosol indirect effects in climate models is crucial for better interactions among dynamics, aerosol, and cloud microphysics. Proper representation of cloud droplet size distribution and microphysical conversion rates might be helpful for quantitative seasonal ISMR forecasting at a smaller spatial scale."

 Dust storms frequently occur in the spring over East Asia, affecting southern Mongolia and northeast China. An exceptionally powerful dust storm occurred in East Asia from March 14th to March 18th, 2021. To investigate the ability of climate models to simulate severe dust storms, we employed the Weather Research Forecast model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) with Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), SHAO and KOK dust emission schemes to simulate the evolution of this event and to characterize dust aerosols long-range transport. Results showed that this storm was caused by a Mongolian cyclone depicted at 850 hPa with a cold front, which swept dust aerosols southeastward across southern Mongolia to northeast China. Model evaluation with satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and observational PM10 concentrations revealed that the SHAO dust emission scheme performed better in simulating spatial and temporal distribution of AOD over the Gobi Desert (GD) but overestimated them over Taklimakan Desert (TD). In contrast, the GOCART dust emission scheme underestimated AOD over most areas except the Taklimakan Desert; the KOK dust emission scheme overestimated them over both TD and GD. Overall, the SHAO dust emission scheme had good performance in simulating the surface PM10 concentrations over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) and depicted an increase in PM10 concentrations, which denoted the transport of dust aerosols over YRB. As a better description of the physical process of dust emission flux over the eastern region of the Gobi Desert, the SHAO dust emission scheme depicted well the spatial and temporal evolution of dust plume episodes, especially over northeast China and YRB. The significant differences in dust emission fluxes between the three dust emission schemes were attributed to the sensitivity of threshold friction velocity and erodibility factor. Thereunto, the SHAO dust emission scheme incorporated well soil particle size distribution and threshold velocity to produce the dust emission flux, which allowed higher dust emission flux over the eastern GD and under strong southwesterly transported dust aerosols to East Central China's region of North China Plain (NCP) and YRB. This study will help further the simulation of extreme dust events more accurately and the exploration of climate change's effect on dust events over East Asia."

Yet direct observations from the 79 North Glacier (79NG) calving front reveal decreasing Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW) temperatures below the ice tongue from 2018 to 2021, leading to reduced ocean heat transport. This is linked to a concurrent decrease in basal melt and thinning rates at the grounding line. The origin of this AIW cooling is traced to a slowdown of the large-scale ocean circulation in the Nordic Seas, driven by European atmospheric blocking that strengthens cold air advection from the central Arctic through the Fram Strait. Blocking has driven major ocean cooling events over the last 50 years and will remain crucial in affecting Northeast Greenland’s glaciers."

However, the atmospheric transport in ATMs is usually simplified and spatiotemporally averaged, leading to systematic biases in simulating the atmospheric CO2 and estimating surface CO2 fluxes. We show that forward simulations of global CO2 using an ATM, GEOS-Chem, at a native resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° and a coarse resolution of 4° × 5° differ significantly near the surface in the Northern Hemisphere and the polar vortex, mainly because of advection in GEOS-Chem. Comparing observing system simulation experiments that assimilate synthetic observations sampled from the forward simulations, we separate the impact of coarse-resolution GEOS-Chem on regional flux estimates. The results suggest that a significant amount of annual carbon uptake from the ocean and tropics is improperly redistributed to the land and northern and southern extratropics, respectively. In addition, these errors lead to an underestimated seasonal amplitude in the northern extratropical land and a reversed sign of the seasonal cycle in the northern extratropical ocean. The reversed sign of the seasonal cycle has also been observed in a real data assimilation experiment and several state-of-the-art inversions, suggesting that reasonable ocean flux estimates depend strongly on the accuracy of the ATM."

However, the increased frequency and extent of wildfires, coupled with unprecedented hot weather, have introduced greater uncertainties in the post-fire permafrost dynamics. We need to address emerging questions, e.g. How will permafrost respond to the joint effect of hot anomalies and wildfires? To what extent will post-wildfire deformation evolve? How will permafrost resilience to wildfires vary? Utilizing interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series analysis, we investigated the post-wildfire ground deformation around a 2019 fire scar in the lower Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, where dramatic heat anomalies and severe wildfires have been recorded in recent years. The resilience of permafrost to wildfires appears to be weakened by the continuous and rapid warming after the fire, as evidenced by the year-on-year acceleration in subsidence rates. Such acceleration was never reported by previous findings that typically observed deceleration in subsidence rates four to five years after wildfires. The deformation along the line of sight (LOS) of the satellite demonstrates significant permafrost degradation induced by wildfires and exacerbated by climate warming, and the cumulative subsidence was detected up to 25 cm in the LOS direction in the upland areas and up to 10 cm in the lowland areas four years after the fire. The difference in deformation magnitude could be attributed to local factors, including ground ice, topography, and vegetation. Our study highlights the increasingly severe threat to circum-arctic permafrost due to the combined effects of wildfires and extreme heat anomalies."

Currently, modeling studies have large uncertainties in aerosol Fe solubility due to inadequate understanding of the sources of dissolved Fe.

Desert dust was found to be the main source of total Fe, contributing 65 and 81% annually to total Fe in coarse and fine particles, respectively; in contrast, dissolved aerosol Fe originated primarily from combustion, industrial, and secondary sources. The annual average contributions to dissolved Fe in coarse and fine particles were 68 and 47% for the secondary source and 32 and 33% for the combustion source, respectively. Aerosol Fe solubility was found to be highest in summer and lowest in spring, showing seasonal patterns similar to those of aerosol acidity.

Although the aging of BrC surrogates from biomass burning has been studied in many laboratory settings, BrC aging behavior in real-world urban environments is not well understood. In this study, through a combination of online dynamic monitoring and offline molecular characterization, the ambient optical aging of BrC was linked to its dynamic changes in molecular composition. Enhanced light absorption by BrC was consistently observed during the periods dominated by oxygenated biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), in contrast to periods dominated by primary emissions or secondary formation in aqueous-phase. This enhancement was linked to the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds during the ambient aging of BBOA. Detailed molecular characterization, alongside analysis of environmental parameters, revealed that an increased atmospheric oxidizing capacity, marked by elevated levels of ozone and nighttime NO3 radicals, facilitated the formation of nitrated aromatic BrC chromophores. These chromophores were primarily responsible for the enhanced light absorption during the ambient aging of BBOA. This study elucidates the nitration processes that enhance BrC light absorption for ambient BBOA, and highlights the crucial role of meteorological conditions.

Hourly MAEs, unattainable in previous studies, can now be calculated, enabling the first-time observation of the darkening-bleaching dynamics of BrC in response to photochemical transformation. We demonstrate the application of this BI model to analyze measurements collected over one year (2021–2022) in Hong Kong. Diel variations in MAE370 nm of BrC reveal a darkening-to-bleaching transition occurring between 8 and 10 O’clock when the solar irradiance ranges from 30 to 400 W m–2. Furthermore, we consistently observe an increase in MAE370 nm of BrC with nitrogen oxide concentrations, suggesting the enhanced formation of nitrogenous organics. This BI model-based data analysis would bring forth a breakthrough in amassing observation data of BrC and its MAEs in diverse ambient environments and with high time resolution."

Although there is only a weak slowdown for all intensifying WNP TCs, the average translation speed for RI TCs has significantly decelerated over the RI main development region (7.5°–25°N, 115°–160°E). This slowdown is primarily due to increasing RI probabilities for slower‐moving TCs. By contrast, the RI probability of faster‐moving TCs remains virtually unchanged. These differences in RI trend probabilities between slow‐moving and fast‐moving TCs are primarily linked to a deepening of the WNP mixed layer. TC‐induced sea surface temperature cooling tends to weaken when the mixed layer is deep. During the intensification stage, the deeper mixed layer is more critical for slower‐moving TCs than for faster‐moving TCs. Our findings suggest that RI probabilities for slow‐moving WNP TCs may continue to increase in a future warming climate."

Absorption properties were estimated from aerosol‐laden polytetrafluoroethylene filters using a well‐constrained technique incorporating filter‐to‐particle correction factors. The measurements revealed spatiotemporal heterogeneity in spectral intrinsic and extrinsic absorption properties. Absorption analysis at near‐UV wavelengths from carbonaceous aerosols at these regional sites revealed large near‐ultraviolet brown carbon absorption contributions from 21% to 68%—emphasizing the need to include these particles in climate models. Further, satellite‐retrieved column‐integrated absorption was dominated by surface absorption, which opens possibilities of using satellite measurements to model surface‐layer optical properties (limited to specific sites) at a higher spatial resolution. Both the satellite‐modeled and direct in‐situ absorption measurements can aid in validating and constraining climate modeling efforts that suffer from absorption underestimations and high uncertainties in radiative forcing estimates."

However, comprehensive studies focusing on size‐resolved particle number (PN) emissions from various sectors are scarce. This study aims to fill this research gap by developing sectoral size‐resolved PN emissions for major species including sulfate, organic mass (OM), and black carbon (BC). The size‐resolved emission profiles derived from various measurements in the literature were integrated with a particle mass emission inventory (EI) for 13 major sectors in the Yangtze River Delta region of China as a case study. The particle number size distribution (PNSD) of emitted particles exhibited two distinct peaks: one at approximately 10 nm and the other in the range of 40–60 nm. The primary contributors to PN emissions in the region in 2017 were power plants, gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, and cooking sources. In terms of species, OM dominated PN emissions, followed by primary sulfate and then BC. A regional size‐resolved aerosol model employing the size‐resolved PN EI developed here (referred to as the BIN‐SPE experiment) provided reasonably accurate temporal variations of the total PN concentration and captured the PNSD within the size range of 10–300 nm. Uncertainty analysis of sectoral PN emissions across size ranges was carried out and the performance of the BIN‐SPE experiment was compared with those of three commonly used PN emission parameterizations. Our model evaluations highlight future needs for in‐depth investigations into more advanced size‐resolved emissions and secondary OM formation mechanisms."

Water content of organic aerosol (OA) particles has been estimated by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we discovered that the hysteresis phenomenon occurred to water content of glassy ultrafine OA particles, demonstrating that thermodynamically non‐equilibrium states need to be considered. Hygroscopic growth for monodisperse ultrafine particles (sucrose and glucose) was investigated for the temperature range from 252 to 296 K. Hysteresis was not observable at 296 K, consistent with literature data. However, hysteresis in water content was observed at sub‐273 K. The lowest relative humidity (RH), at which hygroscopic growth of particles did not depend on exposure history to water vapor, was defined as threshold RH. Threshold RH for 100 nm particles was approximately the same as the glass transition points when hysteresis clearly happened, demonstrating that water diffusion in a highly viscous matrix of organic aerosols was the key to the phenomenon. Employment of a kinetic multi‐layer model quantitatively predicted threshold RH as a function of temperature, exposure time, and the particle size. Considering the temperature and RH range of Earth's atmosphere, we hypothesize that hysteresis in water content for organic aerosols ubiquitously occurs in the upper troposphere, impacting chemical aging and cloud formation processes."

 Climate assessments have largely overlooked the radiative effect of anthropogenic coarse particulate matter (PMcoarse, with an aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 µm) in China. Despite its similar mass concentration to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), anthropogenic sources of PMcoarse in China have been much less studied and typically underrepresented in models. Here, we present a new model simulation for PMcoarse in China that incorporates various anthropogenic sources. The model successfully captures the magnitude and distribution of observed PMcoarse and recently available aerosol optical depth measurements at near-infrared wavelengths, which are substantially underestimated if anthropogenic PMcoarse is not included. We find that anthropogenic PMcoarse exerts a cooling effect of -0.11 Wm−2 (-0.03 to -0.42 Wm−2) in China by aerosol–radiation interaction, capable of completely offsetting the warming effect from black carbon by 2060 under Dynamic Projection model for Emissions in China (DPEC) 1.1 scenario.

 The existence and causes of the recently observed rainfall heterogeneity over monsoonal east Asia in historical periods remain unclear. Here we show that such rainfall heterogeneity has been present at least in the last millennium, with decadal to centennial precipitation variations over southeast Asia and north China being broadly synchronous, while central to southwest China’s variations are generally out-of-phase with those in southeast Asia and north China. We propose that the western Pacific subtropical high, which reduces decadal to centennial precipitation over central to southwest China due to its anticyclonic feature, could be responsible for the observed rainfall heterogeneity over subtropical East Asia. Further analyses suggest that intensified decadal to centennial solar activity can lead to enhanced and northward and westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high, resulting in tripolar rainfall heterogenous patterns over monsoonal East Asia.

 The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensors on the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite-R series (GOES-R) broaden the application of global vegetation monitoring due to their higher temporal (5–15 min) and appropriate spatial (0.5–1 km) resolution compared to previous geostationary and current polar-orbiting sensing systems. Notably, ABI Land Surface Phenology (LSP) quantification may be improved due to the greater availability of cloud-free observations as compared to those from legacy GOES satellite generations and from polar-orbiting sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Geostationary satellites sense a location with a fixed view geometry but changing solar geometry and consequently capture pronounced temporal reflectance variations over anisotropic surfaces. These reflectance variations can be reduced by application of a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model to adjust or predict the reflectance for a new solar geometry and a fixed view geometry. Empirical and semi-empirical BRDF models perform less effectively when used to predict reflectance acquired at angles not found in the observations used to parameterize the model, or acquired under hot-spot sensing conditions when the solar and viewing directions coincide. Consequently, using a fixed solar geometry or even the geometry at local solar noon may introduce errors due to diurnal and seasonal variations in the position of the sun and the incidence of hot-spot sensing conditions. In this paper, a new solar geometry definition based on a Constant Scattering Angle (CSA) criterion is presented that, as we demonstrate, reduces the impacts of solar geometry changes on reflectance and derived vegetation indices used for LSP quantification. The CSA criterion is used with the Ross-Thick-Li-Sparse (RTLS) BRDF model applied to North America ABI surface reflectance data acquired by GOES-16 (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020) and GOES-17 (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020) to normalize solar geometry BRDF effects and generate 3-day two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series. Compared to the local solar noon geometry, the CSA criterion is shown to reduce solar geometry reflectance and EVI2 time series artifacts. Further, comparison with contemporaneous VIIRS NBAR (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance) EVI2 time series is also presented to illustrate the efficacy of the CSA criterion. Finally, the CSA-adjusted EVI2 time series are shown to produce LSP results that agree well with PhenoCam-based observations, with no obvious systematic bias in onsets of vegetation maturity, senescence, and dormancy dates compared to about 10-day bias found with local solar noon adjusted EVI2 time series."

 The European Space Agency (ESA) under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) has developed a multi-satellite global, daily Soil Moisture (SM) dataset that has paved the ways for agricultural drought studies. To evaluate the performance of this ESACCI SM, two SM-based indices i.e. parametric distribution-based Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI) and non-parametric distribution-based Empirical Standardized Soil Moisture Index (ESSMI) are computed to characterize agricultural drought in the Southern Plateau and Hills (SPH) in India from 1991 to 2020. SSMI and ESSMI are then compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The yearly temporal analysis revealed a consistent pattern among all the four indices with 2003 and 2020 marked as the driest and wettest years, respectively. On the other hand, monthly temporal analysis indicated SSMI and ESSMI lagged behind SPI and ESSMI suggesting a delayed response of SM to precipitation. Spatial distributions of indices showed that the SM-based indices effectively capture temporal variations of dryness or wetness across seasons. The near normal and mild to moderate droughts predominated (both spatially and temporally) the SPH and SSMI better captured the extreme drought areas compared to ESSMI. Further, Dynamic Threshold Run Theory (DTRT) is introduced to identify and characterize drought events based on their duration, frequency, intensity and peak. The findings revealed a resemblance in spatial distribution between the duration and frequency. The drought peak and intensity revealed a moderate nature of drought conditions.

 India is suffering from severe particulate matter (PM, including PM2.5 and PM10) pollution, while limited ground observations are insufficient to support a comprehensive understanding of its health risks. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to improve the estimation of PM distribution and exposure efficiently. Regional transport as well as accumulation and dispersion processes of PM and its components, which have significant impacts on PM concentrations, are crucial when building ML models, especially for sparsely observed regions like India. Here, geographic and temporal-rolling weighting methods were used to separately extract regional and temporal features for improving the performance of the ML model. The incorporation of temporal and regional features into the ML model significantly improved ML model performance, with root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by 21 % and 19% for PM2.5 and PM10 estimation, as well as an improvement in model underestimation for the heavy pollution scenarios. The spatial-temporal model shows out-of-sample test CV coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.87 and 0.88 for hourly PM2.5 and PM10. The ML model predicts an annual nationwide concentration of 68.3 μg/m3 for PM2.5 with a north (high, especially in Indo-Gangetic Plain) to south (low) distribution, which is consistent with high satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) values. Boundary layer height is identified as the main meteorological factor influencing PM2.5 concentrations in winter. Characterizing the regional transport and cumulative dispersion processes of pollutants by extracting features can help in machine learning training, and this method can be further improved and applied to other studies."

 The particle number size distribution (PNSD) is crucial for evaluating air quality and mitigating environmental pollution, as particles of different sizes have diverse effects on human health and climate. However, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of PNSD is challenging due to its inherent complexities and variability. Multi-lognormal distribution models are employed to fit PNSD, as seen in climate models, but discrepancies between model fits and observed PNSD persist. This study adopts hourly data from 2017 to 2020 across eight monitoring sites in diverse environments—rural, urban, mountainous, and polar, and compares the observed PNDS with those simulated by multi-lognormal distribution models. The results demonstrated that the model generally achieved a high correlation with observed PNSD data (r2 > 0.75), effectively capturing key characteristics of nucleation and Aitken mode particles. However, the model had a tendency to overestimate the total number concentration by approximately 1.09 times, particularly noticeable under conditions of high concentrations of smaller particles. The model successfully represented prevalent bimodal size distribution patterns in urban areas with high ultrafine particle concentrations, though its performance was slightly less accurate in scenarios involving trimodal distributions. Despite these strong correlations and the model's ability to reflect diurnal and seasonal variations, which suggests its broad applicability and utility, there were notable limitations on smaller time scales and in specific particle size ranges. These limitations were particularly evident in capturing detailed phenomena relevant to new particle formation events, indicating areas where model refinement is necessary. The results highlighted the importance of investigating discrepancies between model predictions and actual observations, which is crucial for refining climate models that utilize PNDS. The uniform comparison facilitated a detailed exploration of particle properties from model results, offering deeper insights into aerosol behavior and its environmental impacts."

 Intensity of different precipitation types (convective, stratiform and shallow) and associated cloud vertical microphysical and radiative heating features are analyzed considering typhoon development, maturity, and decaying stages over the western North Pacific using the CloudSat Tropical Cyclone and China Meteorological Administration tropical cyclone best-track datasets from 2 June 2006 to 31 December 2015. At all three stages, the convective precipitation intensity, approximately twice that of stratiform precipitation, is the highest and peaks at development stage. The strongest stratiform precipitation occurs at typhoon maturity stage. Shallow precipitation is the weakest throughout the typhoon lifespan. Although the cloud microphysical parameters (radar reflectivity, cloud ice particle number concentration and effective radius) of both convective and stratiform precipitation tend to increase with precipitation intensity, convective precipitation contains more ice water of larger sizes in upper layers than stratiform precipitation. Unlike convective and stratiform precipitation, dominated by cold clouds, shallow precipitation is dominated by warm clouds with weak vertical contrast in the radiative distribution but strong radiation nearby 5 km. Our results show that cloud ice particle number concentration is important not only in precipitation intensity enhancement but also in determining the shortwave radiative heating center vertical location. More and larger ice particles in convective precipitation profiles result in stronger or comparable shortwave radiative heating than those in stratiform precipitation profiles, while the longwave radiative cooling rates in convective and stratiform precipitation profiles exhibit very similar features, likely attributable to similar infrared radiation levels due to comparable temperatures in these profiles."

Thornton,Remote Sensing Estimates of Time-Resolved HONO and NO2 Emission Rates and Lifetimes in Wildfires,"We present an analysis of high-resolution remote sensing measurements of nitrogen-containing trace gases emitted by wildfires. The measurements were made using an instrument on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in the summer of 2019. We find that time-resolved fire intensity is critical to quantify trace gas emissions over a fire’s entire lifespan. These findings have implications for improving air pollution forecasts downwind of wildfires using computer models of atmospheric chemistry and meteorology. 
 Quantification of wildfire emissions is essential for comprehending and simulating the effects of wildfires on atmospheric chemical composition. Sub-orbital measurements of vertical column nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were made during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign using the GeoCAPE Airborne Simulator (GCAS) instrument aboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft. Emission rates and lifetimes of HONO and NO2 from the Sheridan Fire were estimated by fitting exponentially modified Gaussians (EMGs) to line densities, a technique previously used to estimate urban and point source NO2 emissions. As the EMG approach does not capture temporal changes in emissions and lifetimes due to time-varying fire behavior, we developed a Monte Carlo implementation of the Python Editable Chemical Atmospheric Numeric Solver (PECANS) model that includes diurnal fire radiative power (FRP) behavior. We assess the validity of a range of emission rate and lifetime combinations for both HONO and NO2 as the fire evolves by comparing the resulting line density predictions to the observations. We find that our method results in emissions that are lower than top-down biomass burning emissions inventories and higher than bottom-up inventories. Our approach is applicable to interpreting time-resolved remotely sensed measurements of atmospheric trace gases such as those now becoming available with instruments aboard geo-stationary satellites such as the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments."

 Monitoring global radiation resources relies on sunshine duration (SD) as a significant indication, but there is a scarcity of research that have examined high-resolution SD data. This study established a daily 5-km SD dataset in China from 2016 to 2023 using Himawari's Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) Level 3 shortwave radiation fitted with the Ångström-Prescott model based on time series. We used ground-measured SD at 2380 Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations to verify the accuracy of SD dataset.

We investigated the effects of wind speed, vapor pressure (VAP), precipitation and aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the estimated performance of SD, and the results showed that temperature had the greatest effect on SD estimation. We also found that both too low AOD and too high wind speed also affected the SD estimation. This high-resolution SD data can provide important support for accurate radiation resource assessment in China.

How upwind moisture variations affect interannual variations of downwind precipitation and vegetation in China's drylands remains unclear. We used high‐resolution moisture tracking data sets and found terrestrial moisture (93%) was the dominant moisture source for China's drylands, especially from drylands themselves (46%). In most dryland grids, we observed strong correlations between precipitation and upwind moisture sources from 2003 to 2022 (median r = 0.55), with a more significant effect in drier areas. These demonstrated the upwind moisture control on interannual variations of dryland precipitation, in which internal moisture from drylands exceeds the influence of external terrestrial sources. The upwind moisture variations, especially the recycled moisture of drylands, propagate to influence downwind vegetation greenness in precipitation‐sensitive dryland areas. Our findings revealed that upwind moisture variations induced by climate or land‐cover changes have important implications for water and food security in China's drylands."

These expansive systems also dominate core aspects of Earth's climate, storing and exchanging vast amounts of water, carbon, and energy with the atmosphere. Despite their indispensable ecosystem services and high vulnerability to change, drylands are one of the least understood ecosystem types, partly due to challenges studying their heterogeneous landscapes and misconceptions that drylands are unproductive “wastelands.” Consequently, inadequate understanding of dryland processes has resulted in poor model representation and forecasting capacity, hindering decision making for these at‐risk ecosystems. NASA satellite resources are increasingly available at the higher resolutions needed to enhance understanding of drylands' heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics. NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program solicited proposals for scoping a multi‐year field campaign, of which Adaptation and Response in Drylands (ARID) was one of two scoping studies selected.

 The number of in-situ stations measuring river discharge, one of the Essential Climate Variables (ECV), is declining steadily, and numerous basins have never been gauged. With the aim of improving data availability worldwide, we propose an easily applicable and transferable approach to estimate reach-scale discharge solely using remote sensing data that is suitable for filling gaps in the in-situ network. We combine 20 years of satellite altimetry observations with high-resolution satellite imagery via a hypsometric function to observe large portions of the reach-scale bathymetry. The high-resolution satellite images, which are classified using deep learning image segmentation, allow for detecting small rivers (narrower than 100 m) and can capture small width variations. The unobserved part of the bathymetry is estimated using an empirical width-to-depth function. Combined with precise satellite-derived slope measurements, river discharge is calculated at multiple consecutive cross-sections within the reach. The unknown roughness coefficient is optimized by minimizing the discharge differences between the cross-sections. The approach requires minimal input and approximate boundary conditions based on expert knowledge but is not dependent on calibration. We provide realistic uncertainties, which are crucial for data assimilation, by accounting for errors and uncertainties in the different input quantities. The approach is applied globally to 27 river sections with a median normalized root mean square error of 12% and a Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency of 0.560. On average, the 90% uncertainty range includes 91% of the in-situ measurements."

 To reduce economic and health impacts from poor air quality (AQ) in the U.S., the National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) produces forecasts of surface-level ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and other pollutants so that advance notice and warning can be issued to help individuals and communities limit their exposure. The NAQFC uses the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for operational forecasts. This study is a first step in proposing a potential upgrade to the current operational NAQFC bias-correction system, by examining potential candidates for a gridded analysis (“truth”) dataset.In this paper, we compare the performance of the “analysis” time series over the period of August 2020–December 2021 at EPA AirNow stations for both PM2.5 and O3 from raw Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalyses, raw CAMS near real-time forecasts, raw near real-time CMAQ forecasts, bias-corrected CAMS forecasts, and bias-corrected CMAQ forecasts (CMAQ FC BC). This 17-month period spans two wildfire seasons, to assess model “analysis” performance in high-end AQ events. In addition to determining the best-performing gridded product, this process allows us to benchmark the performance of CMAQ forecasts against other global datasets (CAMS reanalysis and forecasts). For both PM2.5 and O3, the bias correction algorithm employed here greatly improved upon the raw model time series, and CMAQ FC BC was the best-performing model “analysis” time series, having the lowest RMSE, smallest bias error, and largest critical success index at multiple thresholds."

 Ozone (O3) is produced by photochemical reactions of NOX and VOCs in the troposphere under sunlight. The column densities of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), derived from satellite data, serve as indicators of VOCs and NOX emissions in the troposphere. Through analyzing the unique characteristics of the threshold range for the HCHO/NO2 ratio (FNR), the mechanisms of O3 formation across different regions over a prolonged period can be identified. In this study, we utilized the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) technique to characterize O3 patterns during the warm season (April to October) spanning 2013–2019. This period is divided into three stages: 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2019. Using the third-order fitting model, we assessed the FNR values across different regions in China: BTH (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), YRD (Yangtze River Delta), GD (Guangdong), and CY (Chuan-Yu). The FNR value ranges for these regions are as follows: ([1.2,2.0], [1.3,2.1], [2.4,3.2], [1.4,2.2]) during 2013–2014, ([1.1,1.9], [1.2,2.0], [2.0,2.8], [1.2,2.0]) during 2015–2016, and ([1.0,1.8], [1.0,1.8], [1.7,2.5], [1.1,1.9]) during 2017–2019, respectively. Ultimately, our research indicates a shift in certain regions from a VOC-limited regime towards a transitional regime. This shift correlates with a significant decline in anthropogenic NOX emissions, attributed to the stringent emission control strategies extensively implemented between 2013 and 2019. The spatial expansion of the transitional regime aligns with increasing O3 concentrations, simultaneously offering guidance for the development of effective emission reduction strategies."

The CPC FARM is compared to traditionally used particle mobility sizers during a new particle formation campaign to study rapidly changing sub-3 nm in Pittsburgh, PA. 
 New particle formation (NPF) is the atmospheric process whereby gas molecules react and nucleate to form detectable particles. NPF has a strong impact on Earth’s radiative balance as it produces roughly half of global cloud condensation nuclei. However, time resolution and sensitivity of current instrumentation are inadequate in measuring the size distribution of sub‑3 nm particles, the particles critical for understanding NPF. Here we present the Condensation Particle Counters For Atmospheric Rapid Measurements (CPC FARM), a method to measure the concentrations of freshly nucleated particles. The CPC FARM consists of five CPCs operating in parallel, each configured to operate at different detectable particle sizes between 1–3 nm. This study explores two methods to calculate the size distribution from the differential measurements across the CPC channels. The performance of both inversion methods were tested against the size distribution measured by a pair of stepping particle mobility sizers (SMPS) during an ambient air sampling study in Pittsburgh, PA. Observational results indicate that the CPC FARM is more accurate with higher time resolution and sensitivity in the sub-3 nm range compared to the SMPS. "

This study unveils a previously overlooked midlatitude pathway. During the developing winter, El Niño events induce basin‐scale cold SSTAs in the central North Pacific, which can persist into the following summer. These anomalies significantly influence early‐summer atmospheric circulation by enhancing atmospheric baroclinicity and transient eddy activities. Primarily driven by transient eddy vorticity forcing, an equivalent barotropic geopotential low anomaly emerges over the North Pacific. Enhanced by the southwesterly winds of the atmospheric low, tropical moisture is transported farther northeastward in the early summer, resulting in increased rainfall in the Pacific Northwest region. By elucidating this meridional pathway, our study advances the understanding of ENSO's delayed impacts and associated dynamical processes, in which the midlatitude oceanic feedbacks are emphasized."

Reconnection of the interplanetary magnetic field lines draping around Mars and the crustal magnetic field can also lead to a presense of sunward fluxes of planetary ions that might affect the total ion loss. The LatHyS (LATMOS Hybrid Simulation) three‐dimensional multispecies hybrid model is used here to characterize sunward fluxes of O+ ions and the magnetic field topology at Mars. It is shown that although reconnection between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the crustal magnetic fields strongly modifies the field topology, then sunward ion fluxes are rather small and do not significantly change the total ion loss."
10.1029/2024JD041417,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了热带信风带浅层对流对气候敏感性的影响。它指出，传统的理论认为浅层云的形成受控于比对流深度更大的尺度上的垂直运动，但最新的观测和数值模拟结果挑战了这一假设。论文利用卫星数据和大型涡旋模拟，分析了浅层对流与中尺度垂直运动之间的相互作用，发现浅层对流在中尺度上控制着垂直运动，而不是仅仅适应于它。这表明在理解信风带云-环流耦合时，需要考虑从天气尺度到百米尺度的全尺度范围。,"['satellite observations', 'cloud', 'convection', 'tropical circulation', 'climate sensitivity']",M. Janssens;G. George;H. Schulz;Fleur Couvreux;Dominique Bouniol,Shallow Convective Heating in Weak Temperature Gradient Balance Explains Mesoscale Vertical Motions in the Trades,"Earth's climate sensitivity depends on how shallow clouds in the trades respond to changes in the large‐scale tropical circulation with warming. In canonical theory for this cloud‐circulation coupling, it is assumed that the clouds are controlled by the field of vertical motion on horizontal scales larger than the convection's depth (∼ ${\sim} $ 1 km). This assumption has been challenged both by recent in situ observations, and idealized large‐eddy simulations (LESs). Here, we therefore bring together the recent observations, new analysis from satellite data, and a 40‐day, large‐domain (1600×900 $1600\times 900$ km2) LES of the North Atlantic from the 2020 EUREC4A field campaign, to study the interaction between shallow convection and vertical motions on scales between 10 and 1,000 km (mesoscales), in settings that are as realistic as possible. Across all data sets, the shallow mesoscale vertical motions are consistently represented, ubiquitous, frequently organized into circulations, and formed without imprinting themselves on the mesoscale buoyancy field. Therefore, we use the weak‐temperature gradient approximation to show that between at least 12.5–400 km scales, the vertical motion balances heating fluctuations in groups of precipitating shallow cumuli. That is, across the mesoscales, shallow convection controls the vertical motion in the trades, and does not simply adjust to it. In turn, the mesoscale convective heating patterns appear to consistently grow through moisture‐convection feedback. Therefore, to represent and understand the cloud‐circulation coupling of trade cumuli, the full range of scales between the synoptics and the hectometer must be included in our conceptual and numerical models."

Well calibrated low‐cost sensors can provide reliable data especially where reference monitors are unavailable. We evaluate the performance of Clarity Node‐S PM monitors against a Tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) 1400a and develop a calibration model in Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city. As‐reported Clarity Node‐S data from January 2023 through April 2023 was moderately correlated with the TEOM‐1400a measurements (R2 = 0.61) and exhibited a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.03 μg m−3. Employing three calibration models, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), Gaussian mixture regression and random forest (RF) decreased the MAE to 4.28, 3.93, and 4.40 μg m−3 respectively. The R2 value improved to 0.63 for the MLR model but all other models registered a decrease (R2 = 0.44 and 0.60 respectively). Applying the correction factor to a five‐sensor network in Mombasa that was operated between July 2021 and July 2022 gave insights to the air quality in the city. The average daily concentrations of PM2.5 within the city ranged from 12 to 18 μg m−3. The concentrations exceeded the WHO daily PM2.5 limits more than 50% of the time, in particular at the sites nearby frequent industrial activity. Higher averages were observed during the dry and cold seasons and during early morning and evening periods of high activity. These results represent some of the first air quality monitoring measurements in Mombasa and highlight the need for more study."

 Accurate and continuous PM2.5 data is essential for effective prevention of PM2.5 pollution. Despite the achievements of deep learning methods in estimating PM2.5 concentrations, existing neural network models have relied too much on the self-learning capability and have ignored geographic patterns of PM2.5. Few have taken a geographic perspective when modeling PM2.5, resulting in lower model interpretability. In this paper, rather than inputting spatiotemporal information directly into the networks, we propose an improved geographic pattern based residual neural network (IGeop-ResNet) for estimating PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) of China considering spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation by introducing spatial eigenvector and attention mechanism, as well as the encoding and embedding methods for temporal categorical variables. A DEM-weighted loss function was introduced to enhance the spatial predictive ability, particularly in high-altitude regions. The results show that the IGeop-ResNet model achieves excellent spatial predictive abilities (R2 of 0.925 in terms of station-based cross-validation) and offers a certain level of interpretability compared to the Ori-STResNet (ordinary directly inputs temporal and spatial information in the ResNet model) and the Geop-ResNet model (without the DEM-weighted loss function). Continuous maps derived from the IGeop-ResNet model suggest the PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH region exhibited a downward trend from 2015 to 2018 and experienced a sharp drop in 2017. The results indicate that NO2 is the Granger cause of PM2.5, while the relationship between SO2 and PM2.5 is insignificant."

 Alkyl nitrates (RONO₂) are key reactive nitrogen compounds with significant impacts on local and regional air quality. The concentrations of alkyl nitrates can vary significantly across different regions, especially in areas with varying levels of human activity. Long-term observation of alkyl nitrates is necessary to assess the intensity of photochemical reactions and the contributions from different sources. In this study, we present the first continuous year-long monitoring results of eight alkyl nitrates via whole air sample collection and GC-MSD/ECD analysis at a coastal site in Hong Kong. Source apportionment analysis via positive matrix factorization (PMF) revealed distinctive seasonal variations in the source contributions for the eight alkyl nitrate species. Furthermore, increased contributions from biomass combustion were found in autumn and winter, while marine emissions primarily influenced methyl nitrate levels during summer. Our study highlights the significant impact of biomass burning from inland areas on photochemical pollutants in Hong Kong. Cross-regional cooperation in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is necessary for more comprehensive management of secondary photochemical pollution."

 Unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) has experienced substantial growth in recent years with currently unconstrained impacts on air quality. In this work, we describe ambient aerosol and gas-phase measurements during spring 2021 to examine air quality in the Eagle Ford Shale (EFS), a region in southeast Texas with thousands of UOGD wells. NOx, O3, H2S, PM1, and several VOCs were measured at concentrations above expected levels for non-urban regions. Hydrocarbon measurements from gas chromatography (GC) and proton transfer reaction (PTR) mass spectrometry show periodic high concentrations of variable compositions consisting of both saturated and unsaturated (polycyclic and/or aromatic) hydrocarbons, including larger (C > 10) unsaturated hydrocarbons that are often not quantified by GC measurements but are still present at substantial concentrations and relevant for air quality. Hydrocarbon VOCs are expected pollutants from anthropogenic activity and, based on ratios of i-pentane to n-pentane, xylene to benzene, and toluene to benzene, measured VOC ratios were characteristic of UOGD activity. Wind data and back-trajectory analyses show that air predominantly arrived from the S/SE, consistent with UOGD sources as well as shipping emissions from the Gulf of Mexico impacting air quality in the EFS. Analysis of diurnal trends at the site show hydrocarbon and NOx accumulation overnight and highlight diurnal differences in oxidative conditions, with important implications for both SOA and O3 formation. UOGD emissions impact the air quality in Karnes City and more broadly the EFS as well as the nearby urban area of San Antonio, which struggles to meet national air quality standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency."

 New particle formation (NPF) is a critical source of particles and cloud condensation nuclei, yet there are scarce vertically-resolved measurements addressing NPF across different seasons in marine regions. This study leverages a multi-season set of airborne data from the NASA ACTIVATE mission between 2020 and 2022 to examine NPF characteristics over the northwest Atlantic ranging from the polluted U.S. East Coast to as far downwind (>1000 km) as Bermuda. Using the number concentration ratio above 3 and 10 nm (N3:N10) as a NPF indicator, we observe the highest ratios in the coldest months and comparable ratios over Bermuda relative to the U.S. East Coast. Within seasons, the highest and lowest ratios are found immediately above cloud tops and at the lowest possible flight altitudes (∼150 m above sea level), respectively. The ratio of (N3-N10)/N3 ranges from 0.16 to 0.29 depending on altitude, proximity to clouds, and season. The N3:N10 and (N3-N10)/N3 ratios increase with altitude up to as high as 9 km, with a case study showing favorable conditions around relatively thicker and precipitating cloud systems presumably due to high actinic fluxes and reduced aerosol surface area. Regression modeling reveals that increased N3:N10 is influenced most by reductions in temperature, relative humidity, and aerosol surface area. This work emphasizes the importance of both NPF in remote marine regions like Bermuda and vertical heterogeneity that exists in its contribution to aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei number budgets."

 This study assessed the concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 (PM2.5) over South America (SA) based on climatological patterns and trend analysis. This study used monthly PM2.5 data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts from 2003 to 2022. The bilinear interpolation method was applied to the data resampling from 0.75° × 0.75°–0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution, and subsequently, the climatological analysis was performed on seasonal and annual scales of PM2.5 concentrations for the 20-year series. The assessment comprised three main stages: 1) descriptive statistics, 2) seasonal and annual climatology patterns, and 3) trend analysis (Mann-Kendall - MK and Pettitt tests). Results indicated that the largest annual PM2.5 concentrations were found in the Amazon region and northern Paraguay due the El-Niño South Oscillation events (2003–2005, 2007, 2010, 2020, and 2022). The annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the WHO recommended limit (5 μg m−3), ranging from 15.57 μg m−3 (1999) and 22.74 μg m−3 (2007 and 2010). The highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in the Amazon and Chile (Santiago), reaching 160.4 μg m−3 annually and 177.8 μg m−3 seasonally (spring). Elevated seasonal PM2.5 concentrations were attributed to increased deforestation and wildfires associated with meteorological systems such as the Bolivian high and subtropical jets during dry periods (winter and spring). The MK test revealed a significant reduction in PM2.5 concentrations between 2003 and 2022, observed in Argentina (north), Brazil (arc of reforestation), Bolivia (south), and Chile (north). Reduction values varied between 0.5 and 10 μg m−3.year−1 annually and during winter, attributed to no-tillage practices in regions cultivating commodities. The Pettitt test also identified significant structural changes occurring in 2006–2008 and 2010–2011, aligning with areas highlighted in the MK test.

 Atmospheric radiative changes induced by aerosol radiative forcing are the most uncertain factors in climate change, affecting a comprehensive understanding of aerosol's role in the climate system and ecosystem, with current research mainly focused on densely populated and heavily polluted regions. This study utilizes satellite and ground-based remote sensing data to establish a multi-source data processing and analysis workflow suitable for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, and based on atmospheric radiative transfer models, constructs methods for simulating and validating regional aerosol radiative forcing, optimizing the long-term observational, simulation, and variation studies of aerosol radiative forcing at regional scales. The results indicate: (1) Key input parameters for simulating aerosol radiative forcing regions were determined through sensitivity tests of radiative transfer model parameters to be AOD, surface albedo, atmospheric column water vapor content, and total atmospheric ozone. A method for simulating aerosol direct radiative forcing regions was constructed. Comparison and validation against aerosol radiative forcing site simulations based on ground-based remote sensing observations at the Yangbajing station in Tibet showed R2 values above 0.8 and NRMSE values between 0.25 and 0.39, indicating high accuracy of the method, suitable for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

What if such a low-emission, intense-LUC scenario actually materialized? This paper quantifies the biophysical effects of LUC under SSP1-2.6 using an ensemble of regional climate simulations over Europe. We find that LUC projected over the 21st century, primarily broadleaf-tree forestation at the expense of grasslands, reduce summertime heat extremes significantly over large swaths of continental Europe. In fact, cooling from LUC trumps warming by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in milder heat extremes by 2100 for about half of the European population. Forestation brings heat relief by shifting the partition of turbulent energy fluxes away from sensible and towards latent heat fluxes. Impacts on the water cycle are then assessed. Forestation enhances precipitation recycling over continental Europe, but not enough to match the boost of evapotranspiration (green water flux). Run-off (blue water flux) is reduced as a consequence. Some regions experience severe drying in response. In other words, forestation turns blue water green, bringing heat relief but compromising water availability in some already-dry regions."

The representation of emissions taking into account a proxy for vegetation surface and specific humidity enables us to reproduce very accurately the seasonal cycle of fungal spores. Furthermore, we estimate that fungal spores can account for 20 % of PM10 and 40 % of the organic fraction of PM10 over vegetated areas in summer. 
 Fungal spore organic aerosol emissions have been recognised as a significant source of particulate matter as PM10; however, they are not widely considered in current air quality models. In this work, we have implemented the parameterisation of fungal spore organic aerosol (OA) emissions introduced by Heald and Spracklen (2009) (H&S) and further modified by Hoose et al. (2010) in the CHIMERE regional chemistry-transport model. This simple parameterisation is based on two variables, leaf area index (LAI) and specific humidity. We have validated the geographical and temporal representativeness of this parameterisation on a large scale by using yearly polyol observations and primary biogenic organic aerosol factors from positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis at 11 French measurement sites. For a group of sites in northern and eastern France, the seasonal variation of fungal spore emissions, displaying large summer and small winter values, is correctly depicted. However, the H&S parameterisation fails to capture fungal spore concentrations for a smaller group of Mediterranean sites with less data availability in terms of both absolute values and seasonal variability, leading to strong negative biases, especially during the autumn and winter seasons. Two years of CHIMERE simulations with the H&S parameterisation have shown a significant contribution of fungal spore OA to PM10 mass, which is lower than 10 % during winter and reaches up to 20 % during summer in high-emission zones, especially over large forested areas. In terms of contributions to organic matter (OM) concentrations, the simulated fungal spore contribution in autumn is as high as 40 % and reaches at most 30 % of the OM for the other seasons. As a conclusion, the fungal spore OA contribution to the total OM concentrations is shown to be substantial enough to be considered a major PM10 fraction and should then be included in state-of-the-art chemistry-transport models."

 Over the past century, ammonia (NH3) emissions have increased with the growth of livestock and fertilizer usage. The abundant NH3 emissions lead to secondary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, climate change, and a reduction in biodiversity, and they affect human health. Up-to-date and spatially and temporally resolved information on NH3 emissions is essential to better quantify their impact. In this study we applied the existing Daily Emissions Constrained by Satellite Observations (DECSO) algorithm to NH3 observations from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) to estimate NH3 emissions. Because NH3 in the atmosphere is influenced by nitrogen oxides (NOx), we implemented DECSO to estimate NOx and NH3 emissions simultaneously. The emissions are derived over Europe for 2020 on a spatial resolution of 0.2°×0.2° using daily observations from both CrIS and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite). Due to the limited number of daily satellite observations of NH3, monthly emissions of NH3 are reported. The total NH3 emissions derived from observations are about 8 Tg yr−1, with a precision of about 5 %–17 % per grid cell per year over the European domain (35–55° N, 10° W–30° E). The comparison of the satellite-derived NH3 emissions from DECSO with independent bottom-up inventories and in situ observations indicates a consistency in terms of magnitude on the country totals, with the results also being comparable regarding the temporal and spatial distributions. The validation of DECSO over Europe implies that we can use DECSO to quickly derive fairly accurate monthly emissions of NH3 over regions with limited local information on NH3 emissions."

The overall results deepen the understanding of the spatiotemporal differences in aminium characteristics and formation in China. 
 Amines and aminiums play an important role in particle formation, liquid-phase reactions, and climate change and have attracted considerable attention over the years. Here, we investigated the concentrations and compositions of aminiums in PM2.5 in 11 Chinese cities during the winter, focusing on the characteristics of aminiums during the polluted days and the key factors influencing aminium outbreak. Monomethylaminium was the dominant aminium species in most cities, except Taiyuan and Guangzhou, followed by dimethylaminium. Diethylaminium dominated the total aminiums in Taiyuan and Guangzhou. Thus, the main amine sources in Taiyuan and Guangzhou were significantly different from those in other cities. The concentrations of the total aminiums (TAs) in most cities increased significantly during the polluted days, while relatively weak aminium outbreaks during the polluted days occurred in Xi'an and Beijing. Additionally, the concentrations of TAs in Xi'an and Beijing were insignificantly correlated with those of PM2.5 and the major acidic aerosol components, while the opposite pattern was observed in nine other cities. Thus, acid–base chemistry was significantly associated with the formation of aminiums in PM2.5 in all cities, except Xi'an and Beijing. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the aminiums : ammonium ratio to ammonium changes, as well as excluding the effects of relative humidity and atmospheric oxidation, we proposed the possibility of the competitive uptake of ammonia versus amines on acidic aerosols or the displacement of aminiums by ammonia in Xi'an and Beijing (constraining aminium outbreaks). Overall, this study deepens the understanding of the spatiotemporal differences in aminium characteristic and formation in China. However, the uptake of amines on particles to form aminiums and the relevant influencing factors require further mechanistic research."

Diner;Olga Kalashnikova;Oleg Dubovik;Jhoon Kim;Hans Moosmüller,Light-absorbing black carbon and brown carbon components of smoke aerosol from DSCOVR EPIC measurements over North America and central Africa,"This paper introduces a retrieval algorithm to estimate two key absorbing components in smoke (black carbon and brown carbon) using DSCOVR EPIC measurements. Our analysis reveals distinct smoke properties, including spectral absorption, layer height, and black carbon and brown carbon, over North America and central Africa. The retrieved smoke properties offer valuable observational constraints for modeling radiative forcing and informing health-related studies. 
 Wildfires and agricultural burning generate seemingly increasing smoke aerosol emissions, impacting societal and natural ecosystems. To understand smoke's effects on climate and public health, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of smoke aerosols, focusing on two major light-absorbing components, namely black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) aerosols. Using NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument aboard NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft, we inferred BC and BrC volume fractions and particle mass concentrations based on spectral absorption provided by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm with 1–2 h temporal resolution and ∼ 10 km spatial resolution over North America and central Africa. Our analyses of regional smoke properties reveal distinct characteristics for aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 443 nm, spectral single-scattering albedo (SSA), aerosol layer height (ALH), and BC and BrC amounts. Smoke aerosols in North America showed extremely high AOD up to 6, with elevated ALH (6–7 km) and significant BrC components up to 250 mg m−2 along the transport paths, whereas the smoke aerosols in central Africa exhibited stronger light absorption (i.e., lower SSA) and lower AOD, resulting in higher-BC mass concentrations and similar BrC mass concentrations than the cases in North America. Seasonal burning source locations in central Africa, following the seasonal shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and diurnal variations in smoke amounts, were also captured. A comparison of retrieved AOD443, SSA443, SSA680, and ALH with collocated AERONET and CALIOP measurements shows agreement with RMSE values of 0.2, 0.03–0.04, 0.02–0.04, and 0.8–1.3 km, respectively. An analysis of the spatiotemporal average reveals distinct geographical characteristics in smoke properties closely linked to burning types and meteorological conditions. Forest wildfires over western North America generated smoke with a small-BC volume fraction of 0.011 and a high ALH with large variability (2.2 ± 1.2 km), whereas smoke from wildfires and agricultural burning over Mexico region shows more absorption and low ALH. Smoke from savanna fires over central Africa had the most absorption, with a high-BC volume fraction (0.015) and low ALH with a small variation  (1.8 ± 0.6 km) among the analyzed regions. Tropical forest smoke was less absorbing and had a high variance in ALH. We also quantify the estimation uncertainties related to the assumptions of BC and BrC refractive indices. The MAIAC EPIC smoke properties with BC and BrC volume and mass fractions and assessment of the layer height provide observational constraints for radiative forcing modeling and air quality and health studies."

H. van Stratum;Chiel C. van Heerwaarden,The impact of coupled 3D shortwave radiative transfer on surface radiation and cumulus clouds over land,"Radiative transfer in the atmosphere is a 3D processes, which is often modelled in 1D for computational efficiency. We studied the differences between using 1D and 3D radiative transfer. With 3D radiation, larger clouds that contain more liquid water develop. However, they cover roughly the same part of the sky, and the average total radiation at the surface is nearly unchanged. The increase in cloud size might be important for weather models, as it can impact the formation of rain, for example. 
 Radiative transfer is a 3D process, but most atmospheric models consider radiation only in the vertical direction for computational efficiency. This results in inaccurate surface radiation fields, as the horizontal transport of radiation is neglected. Previous work on 3D radiative effects mainly used 3D radiative transfer uncoupled from the flow solver. In contrast, our current work uses 3D radiative transfer coupled to the flow solver to study its impact on the development of clouds and the resulting impact on the domain-averaged surface solar irradiance. To this end, we performed a series of realistic large-eddy simulations with MicroHH. To improve the level of realism of our radiation, we first included the direct effect of aerosols using aerosol data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global reanalysis. Next, we performed simulations with 1D radiative transfer and with a coupled ray tracer for 12 d on which shallow cumulus clouds formed over Cabauw, the Netherlands. In general, simulations with the coupled ray tracer have a higher domain-averaged liquid water path, larger clouds, and similar cloud cover compared to simulations with 1D radiative transfer. Furthermore, the domain-averaged direct radiation is decreased with 3D radiative transfer, and the diffuse radiation is increased. However, the average difference in global radiation is less than 1 W m−2, as the increase in global radiation from uncoupled 3D radiative transfer is counterbalanced by a decrease in global radiation caused by changes in cloud properties."

Stephens;Geoff Dutton;Xin Lan;Roisin Commane;Yenny Gonzalez;Eric Kort,Observational and model evidence for a prominent stratospheric influence on variability in tropospheric nitrous oxide,"This study examines the drivers of interannual variability in tropospheric N2O. New insights are obtained from aircraft data and a chemistry–climate model that explicitly simulates stratospheric N2O. The stratosphere is found to be the dominant driver of N2O variability in the Northern Hemisphere, while both the stratosphere and El Niño cycles are important in the Southern Hemisphere. These results are consistent with known atmospheric dynamics and differences between the hemispheres. 
 The literature presents different views on how the stratosphere influences variability in surface nitrous oxide (N2O) and on whether that influence is outweighed by surface emission changes driven by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These questions are investigated using a chemistry–climate model with a stratospheric N2O tracer; surface and aircraft-based N2O measurements; and indices for ENSO, polar lower stratospheric temperature (PLST), and the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The model simulates well-defined seasonal cycles in tropospheric N2O that are caused mainly by the seasonal descent of N2O-poor stratospheric air in polar regions with subsequent cross-tropopause transport and mixing. Similar seasonal cycles are identified in recently available N2O data from aircraft. A correlation analysis between the N2O atmospheric growth rate (AGR) anomaly in long-term surface monitoring data and the ENSO, PLST, and QBO indices reveals hemispheric differences. In the Northern Hemisphere, the surface N2O AGR is negatively correlated with winter (January–March) PLST. This correlation is consistent with an influence from the Brewer–Dobson circulation, which brings N2O-poor air from the middle and upper stratosphere into the lower stratosphere with associated warming due to diabatic descent. In the Southern Hemisphere, the N2O AGR is better correlated to QBO and ENSO indices. These different hemispheric influences on the N2O AGR are consistent with known atmospheric dynamics and the complex interaction of the QBO with the Brewer-Dobson circulation. More airborne surveys extending to the tropopause would help elucidate the stratospheric influence on tropospheric N2O, allowing for better understanding of surface sources."

Henkes;Philip F. Place;John E. Mak,"Large, Negative Atmospheric Carbon Monoxide Clumped Isotope Values Result From Kinetic Isotope Fractionation, Tracing OH• Reactivity","Because of its global abundance and reactivity with hydroxyl radicals (OH•), tropospheric carbon monoxide indirectly impacts the lifetimes of other OH•‐reactive gases, in particular methane and reactive hydrocarbons. The origin and chemistry of atmospheric CO have been studied using stable isotopes. Both 13CO and C18O undergo isotopic fractionation during its main chemical loss reaction, CO + OH•. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for 13CO is mass dependent, with a value of ∼5‰; 12CO reacts faster than 13CO with OH. Whereas C18O + OH• exhibits an inversely mass dependent KIE ∼−10‰. We hypothesize these KIEs result in a relative depletion of 13C18O, a CO clumped isotope. To test this, we collected CO from air samples on Long Island, NY, and discovered a −3 to −8‰ difference in the clumped isotope ratio, Δ31, relative to a random distribution of 13C and 18O in CO. A clear negative trend between [CO] and Δ31 is driven by two factors: (a) the atmospheric addition of CO from either a primary or secondary source with a Δ31 of ∼0‰ and (b) the continuing reaction of CO with OH•, leaving the remaining CO pool relatively depleted in 13C18O. This is analogous to the mechanism that determines CO Δ17O values. This study is among the first to show clumped isotope fractionation resulting from atmospheric chemistry and not thermal equilibration, which may inform the identification of clumped isotope KIEs in other atmospheric trace gases. These first Δ31 observations motivate future experimental and observational studies targeted at characterizing the clumped isotopes of CO sources, background CO, and experimentally fractionated CO."

Although alterations in precipitation intensity are well documented, past studies examining changes in spatio‐temporal distribution of storms (storm rainrates) were region‐specific and focused on isolated aspects of change in space or time, eluding a comprehensive understanding of the precise nature and extent of these changes. Bridging this gap, this study introduces a novel grid‐based measure of storm homogeneity, “spatio‐temporal homogeneity” metric and investigates the global patterns of change in combined spatio‐temporal characteristics of extreme storms. Analyzing the 30 min × 0.1° × 0.1° resolution Global Precipitation Measurements, the study finds that extreme storms are shrinking in both space and time due to rising surface air temperatures, predominantly in tropics. In contrast, temperate regions experience expanded extreme storms with increasing temperatures. The study also identifies a global trend toward more front‐loading in storms with rising temperatures, driven by a substantial increase in tropics and southern temperate regions. Conversely, storms in northern temperate regions become slightly more rear‐loaded as temperature increases. Furthermore, the study finds that characteristics of short–duration storms (6–12 hr) are more sensitive to temperature changes. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into the global spatio‐temporal changes of extreme storms, highlighting regions most susceptible to alterations in storm patterns due to climate change. These findings are essential for developing effective adaptation strategies and flood management practices to cope with the changing nature of extreme storms in a warming climate."

 Organic peroxy radicals (RO2) and Criegee intermediates (CI, carbonyl oxides) are key reactive species in atmospheric chemistry, and can proceed various reactions influencing the recycling of radicals and the formation of aerosol particles. Carbonyl oxides have recently detected in the OH-initiated autoxidation reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, their formation mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, the β-hydroxyperoxy radicals (HO-RO2) are selected as the model compounds to study the mechanism of their transformation to carbonyl oxides. Potential formation pathways of carbonyl oxides, including unimolecular decomposition, bimolecular reactions with OH radicals, HO-RO and HO-RO2 radicals, are studied by using quantum chemical methods. The results show that the unimolecular decomposition of HO-RO2 radicals undergoes through the direct cleavage of C-C bond to produce carbonyl oxides, but they are strongly endothermic. For the reactions of HO-RO2 with OH radicals, the preferable pathway is the barrierless formation of ROOOH on the single PES, and their stability increases with increasing the number of methyl substituents. On the triplet PES, the formation of carbonyl oxides from H-abstraction reaction in the –CHx group is favorable for the unsubstituted and a methyl substituted HO-RO2 radicals. For the reactions of HO-RO2 with HO-RO radicals, the dominant pathway is the barrierless formation of ROOOR on the singlet PES, with dissociation back to the separate reactants being the lowest-energy pathway. The formation of carbonyl oxides is preferable on the triplet PES, and the methyl substitution is beneficial for decreasing the reaction barriers. The barrier for the formation of carbonyl oxides from the self-reaction of HO-RO2 radicals significantly decrease with increasing the number of methyl substituents. The self-reaction of dimethyl substituted HO-RO2 radicals forming (CH3)2COO is able to compete effectively with the bimolecular reactions with HO2 radicals. These findings enhance our understanding of the formation of carbonyl oxides from the photochemical oxidation of alkenes."

The results also underscore the importance of local environments when assessing the impact of NPF on climate in models. 
 As an important source of sub-micrometer particles, atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) has been observed in various environments. However, most studies provide little more than snapshots of the NPF process due to their underlying observations being limited in space and time. To obtain statistically relevant evidence on NPF across various environments, we investigated the characteristics of NPF based on a 5-year dataset of the German Ultrafine Aerosol Network (GUAN). The results were also compared with observations in previous studies, with the aim to depict a relatively complete picture of NPF in central Europe. The highest NPF occurrence frequency was observed in regional background sites, with an average of about 19 %, followed by urban background (15 %), low-mountain-range (7 %), and high Alpine (3 %) sites. The annual mean growth rate between 10 and 25 nm varied from 3.7–4.7 nm h−1, while the formation rate with same size range 10–25 nm from 0.4 to 2.9 cm−3 s−1. The contribution of NPF to ultrafine particles (UFPs) was about 13 %, 21 %, and 7 % for the urban background, regional background, and low mountain range, respectively. The influence of NPF on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentration and the aerosol extinction coefficient for NPF days was the highest in mountainous areas. These findings underscore the importance of local environments when assessing the potential impact of NPF on regional climate in models, and they also emphasize the usefulness of a long-term aerosol measurement network for understanding the variation in NPF features and their influencing factors over a regional scale."

 The advancement of analytical techniques, such as comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC×GC–MS), enables the efficient separation of complex organics. Developing innovative methods for data processing and analysis is crucial to unlock the full potential of GC×GC–MS in understanding intricate chemical mixtures. In this study, we proposed an innovative method for the semi-automated identification and quantification of complex organic mixtures using GC×GC–MS. The method was formulated based on self-constructed mass spectrum patterns and the traversal algorithms and was applied to organic vapor and aerosol samples collected from the tailpipe emissions of heavy-duty diesel vehicles and the ambient atmosphere. Thousands of compounds were filtered, speciated, and clustered into 26 categories, including aliphatic and cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic oxygenated species, phenols and alkylphenols, and heteroatom-containing species. The identified species accounted for over 80 % of all the eluted chromatographic peaks at the molecular level. A comprehensive analysis of quantification uncertainty was undertaken. Using representative compounds, quantification uncertainties were found to be less than 37.67 %, 22.54 %, and 12.74 % for alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and alkyl-substituted benzenes, respectively, across the GC×GC space, excluding the first and the last time intervals. From a source apportionment perspective, adamantane was clearly isolated as a potential tracer for heavy-duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) emissions. The systematic distribution of nitrogen-containing compounds in oxidized and reduced valences was discussed, and many of them served as critical tracers for secondary nitrate formation processes.

 Volcanic degassing and explosive eruptions inject significant amounts of gas and ash into the atmosphere, impacting the local environment and atmospheric dynamics from local to global scales. While ground- and satellite-based remote sensing systems are key to describing explosive volcanism and assessing associated hazards, direct in situ measurements inside volcanic clouds are not possible with these methods. This study presents an innovative approach using an Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) for (i) airborne ash sampling and (ii) measurements of aerosol and gas concentrations (AeroVolc system). Commercial instruments (DJITM Matrice 30 Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV), AlphasenseTM N3 Optical Particle Counter OPC, SoarabilityTM Sniffer4D Mini2 multigas hardware) were combined with custom-built ash collectors and particle counters to enable a more detailed analysis of volcanic clouds. Here we showcase the deployment of our UAS on Sakurajima (Japan) and Etna (Italy), two volcanoes known for their frequent explosive eruptions and persistent degassing activity, to demonstrate how this approach enables in situ, high-resolution sample and data collection within challenging environments. Results provide grain size distributions (GSDs), information on the occurrence of particle aggregation, as well as solid aerosol (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and gas (SO2 and CO2) concentrations.

It is used worldwide to help assess the trace gas exchange, critical to understanding climate change. However, their physical framework interferes with the flow they measure. We present a new way to correct measurements from sonic anemometers of several types. The method uses measurements of vertical wind velocity and other turbulent velocities, compares their ratios, and from this yields correction factors for sonic anemometers. 
 Non-orthogonal sonic anemometers are used extensively in flux networks and biomicrometeorological research. Previous studies have hypothesized potential underestimation of the vertical velocity turbulent perturbations, necessitating correction to increase flux measurements by approximately 10 %, while some studies have refuted that any correction is needed. Those studies have used cross comparisons between sonic anemometers and numerical simulations. Here we propose a method that yields a correction factor for vertical velocity that requires only a single sonic anemometer in situ but requires some assumptions and adequate fetch at a sufficient distance above roughness elements where surface similarity is valid. Correction factors could be important in adjusting flux network and other flux data, as well as assessing the energy budget closure that is used as one of the flux data quality measures. The correction factor is confirmed in one field experiment and comparison between a CSAT3 and RMY 81000VRE, but it does not work well for the more complex form factors shown in a field comparison of an IRGAson and a CSAT3a."

 Ozone profile measurements at high temporal and vertical resolution are needed to better understand physical processes driving tropospheric ozone variability and to validate the tropospheric ozone measurements from spaceborne missions such as TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution). As part of the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) efforts allocated to provide such measurements, and leveraging on the experience of more than 20 years of ozone lidar measurements at Table Mountain Facility, the JPL lidar group developed the SMOL (Small Mobile Ozone Lidar), an affordable differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system covering all altitudes from 200 m to 10 km. a.g.l.

In order to understand the impacts and consequences of climate interventions such as stratospheric aerosol injection, complex models are often necessary. We use a case study to illustrate how we can understand the inner workings of a complex model. We present this technique as an exploratory tool that can be used to quickly discover and assess relationships in complex climate data. 
 Machine learning (ML) models are commonly used to generate predictions, but these models can also support the discovery of new science. Generating accurate predictions necessitates that a model captures the structure of the underlying data. If the structure is properly extracted, ML could be a useful exploratory and evidential tool. In this paper, we present a case study that demonstrates the use of ML for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the climate space. We apply the ML explainability method of spatio-temporal zeroed feature importance (stZFI) to understand how climate variable associations evolve over space and time. Our analyses focus on data from ensembles of earth systems models (ESMs), which provide data on different climate states and conditions. We elect to work with ESM ensembles since they allow us to compare feature importance across alternative scenarios not available with observed data. The ensembles also account for natural variability, so we can distinguish between signal and noise due to natural climate variability when computing feature importance. For our analyses, we consider the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo: a large stratospheric aerosol injection. We explore the climate pathway associated with the eruption from aerosols to radiation to temperature at both the near-surface and stratospheric levels. In addition to applying the method to data generated from two different ESMs, we apply stZFI to reanalysis data to compare the associations identified by stZFI. We show how stZFI tracks the importance of aerosol optical depth over time on forecasting temperatures. This case study illustrates usefulness of an ML tool (stZFI) for EDA on a well studied climate exemplar."

We conducted field measurements in a residential building to investigate new particle formation (NPF) from sVCP emissions. State-of-the-art instrumentation was used for real-time monitoring of indoor atmospheric nanocluster aerosol (NCA; 1–3 nm particles) size distributions and terpene mixing ratios. We integrated our NCA measurements with a comprehensive material balance model to analyze sVCP-nucleated indoor  NCA dynamics. Our results reveal that sVCPs significantly increase indoor terpene mixing ratios (10–1,000 ppb), exceeding those in outdoor forested environments. The emitted terpenes react with indoor atmospheric O3 and initiate indoor NPF, resulting in nucleation rates as high as ∼105 cm–3 s–1 and condensational growth rates up to 300 nm h–1; these are orders of magnitude higher than those reported during outdoor NPF events. Notably, high particle nucleation rates significantly increase indoor atmospheric NCA concentrations (105–108 cm–3), and high growth rates drive their survival and growth to sizes that efficiently reach the deepest regions of the human respiratory system. We found sVCP-nucleated NCA to cause respiratory exposures and dose rates comparable to or exceeding those from primary aerosol sources such as gas stoves and diesel engines, highlighting their significant impact on indoor atmospheric environments."

This study quantifies the progressive upwind shift of the wavenumber‐1 maximum rain position with radius relative to the vertical wind shear direction. This shift is visualized as a distinctive upwind spiral of the maximum. It is shown that this spiral pattern is generally observed across various storm intensities, shear strength, and ocean basins. Detailed examination revealed that the maximum downwind deflection angle of the wavenumber‐1 rain maximum relative to the shear direction is smaller for tropical storms than hurricanes, but insensitive to hurricane intensity. It is proposed that the spirality is produced by a continuous decline in angular advection of air parcels with radius. The stability of the deflection angle in hurricanes may be accounted for by a corresponding increase in vertical ascent under strengthening angular flow."

People who are incarcerated are especially vulnerable to heat exposure due to demographic characteristics and their conditions of confinement. Evaluating heat exposure in prisons, and the characteristics of exposed populations and prisons, can elucidate prison‐level risk to heat exposure.

We found that the most heat‐exposed facilities and states were mostly in the Southwestern United States, while the prisons with the highest temperature anomalies from the historical record were in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, Texas, and parts of the Midwest. Prisons in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, and upper Midwest had the highest occurrences of days associated with an increased risk of heat‐related mortality. We also estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and individual‐level characteristics. We found higher proportions of non‐white and Hispanic populations in the prisons with higher heat exposure. Lastly, we found that heat exposure was higher in prisons with any of nine facility‐level characteristics that may modify risk to heat. This study brings together distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, which would each inform unique strategies for heat‐interventions.

 An industrial-era decline in Greenland ice-core methanesulfonic acid is thought to herald a collapse in North Atlantic marine phytoplankton stocks related to a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. By contrast, stable levels of total marine biogenic sulfur contradict this interpretation and point to changes in atmospheric oxidation as a potential cause of the methanesulfonic acid decline. However, the impact of oxidation on methanesulfonic acid production has not been quantified, nor has this hypothesis been rigorously tested. Here we present a multi-century methanesulfonic acid record from the Denali, Alaska, ice core, which shows a methanesulfonic acid decline similar in magnitude but delayed by 93 years relative to the Greenland record. Box-model results using updated dimethyl sulfide oxidation pathways indicate that oxidation by pollution-driven nitrate radicals has suppressed atmospheric methanesulfonic acid production, explaining most, if not all, of Denali’s and Greenland’s methanesulfonic acid declines without requiring a change in phytoplankton production. The delayed timing of the North Pacific methanesulfonic acid decline, relative to the North Atlantic, reflects the distinct history of industrialization in upwind regions and is consistent with the Denali and Greenland ice-core nitrate records. These results demonstrate that multidecadal trends in industrial-era Arctic ice-core methanesulfonic acid reflect rising anthropogenic pollution rather than declining marine primary production.

 Unabated 21st-century climate change will accelerate Arctic-Subarctic permafrost thaw which can intensify microbial degradation of carbon-rich soils, methane emissions, and global warming.

Analyzing 50 greenhouse warming simulations, which capture the coupling between permafrost, hydrology, and atmosphere, we find that projected rapid permafrost thaw leads to massive soil drying, surface warming, and reduction of relative humidity over the Arctic-Subarctic region. These combined processes lead to nonlinear late-21st-century regime shifts in the coupled soil-hydrology system and rapid intensification of wildfires in western Siberia and Canada.

 Landsat imagery offers remarkable potential for various applications, including land monitoring and environmental assessment, thanks to its high spatial resolution and over 50 years of data records. However, the presence of atmospheric aerosols greatly hinders the precision of land classification and the quantitative retrieval of surface parameters. There is a pressing need for reliable and accurate global aerosol optical depth (AOD) data derived from Landsat imagery, particularly for atmospheric correction purposes and various other applications. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative framework for retrieving AOD from Landsat imagery over land, which leverages the deep-learning Transformer model (named AeroTrans-Landsat) and operates on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. We gather Landsat 8 and 9 images starting from their launch dates (February 2013 and September 2021, respectively) until the end of 2022, which are used to construct a robust aerosol retrieval model. The global AOD retrievals are then rigorously validated across ∼560 monitoring stations on land using diverse spatiotemporally independent methods. Leveraging information from multiple spectral channels, which contributes to 80 % according to the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method, our retrieved AODs from 2013 to 2022 generally agree well with surface observations, with a sample-based cross-validation correlation coefficient of 0.905 and a root-mean-square error of 0.083. Around 86 % and 55 % of our AOD retrievals meet the criteria of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue expected errors [±(0.05 + 20 %)] and the Global Climate Observation System {[max(0.03, 10 %)]}, respectively. Additionally, our model is not as sensitive to fluctuations in both surface and atmospheric conditions, enabling the generation of spatially continuous AOD distributions with exceptionally fine-scale information over dark to bright surfaces. This capability extends to areas characterized by high pollution levels originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources."

 The harmful consequences of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have become a serious public health matter of universal concern, particularly for youngsters. Exposure to PM2.5 may interfere with vitamin D metabolism in humans. However, the influences of airborne acute PM2.5 exposure on the blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25-OH vitamin D] of young children remains unclear. In the current research, we investigated the links between PM2.5 acute exposure and plasma 25-OH vitamin D of youngsters who lived in Beijing, China, between April 2020 and September 2022. A total of 1916 children aged from 0.13 to 3.00 years old were enrolled. We collected daily airborne PM2.5 data and determined the plasma 25-OH vitamin D of children using LC-MS/MS assay. The association between acute PM2.5 exposure and plasma 25-OH vitamin D was investigated with the generalized linear mixed model and generalized additive model. Our results demonstrated that the acute exposure to airborne PM2.5 was a linear negative correlation with the plasma 25-OH vitamin D3 in infants, each 10 μg/m3 elevate in airborne PM2.5 on current (lag0), lag1, and lag01 (the moving average concentration) days were related to a 0.139 (95% CI: 0.274–0.004), 0.158 (95% CI: 0.305–0.011) and 0.178 (95% CI: 0.333–0.023) ng/mL decrease in plasma 25-OH vitamin D3, respectively. The declining tendency of plasma 25-OH vitamin D3 remained robust after adjusting the airborne PM10 and O3 in the sensitivity analyses.

 High-quality precipitation data are essential for research in hydrology, meteorology and ecology. Nevertheless, in mountainous regions with intricate terrain, the reliability of gridded precipitation data derived from station data interpolation is low due to the limited number of stations caused by the difficulty of station setup. Current satellite precipitation products suffer from low spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for hydrological and meteorological research at small and medium scales. Their application in mountainous regions with significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity is even more challenging. To this end, downscaling satellite precipitation products has become an effective method for obtaining accurate spatial distribution information of precipitation in these regions. This study employs a method of first calibration followed by downscaling analysis of GPM daily precipitation product in the Chongqing area using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Ultimately, the spatial resolution of GPM product is improved from 0.1° to 0.01° (∼1 km). The findings demonstrate that: (1) the station-calibrated GPM precipitation product performed better than the original GPM product, and it is closer to the station measurements; (2) in practical applications, the LSTM downscaling algorithm can effectively enhance spatial resolution without compromising accuracy, whereas RF and XGBoost incur considerable accuracy loss when enhancing spatial resolution; (3) the downscaled results from all three algorithms were consistent with the calibrated GPM precipitation maps and significantly improved the spatial details of precipitation. Among them, the results of the LSTM method exhibited greater continuity in the spatial distribution of precipitation, aligning more closely with the characteristics of precipitation distribution. In summary, the LSTM algorithm demonstrates greater potential for the downscaling of GPM precipitation product in the study area. This research provides a promising high-quality precipitation data generation scheme for mountainous regions with sparse station coverage and complex terrain and landforms."

In this study, we compare the most widely used Eulerian and Lagrangian moisture tracking models over the TP, i.e., WAM2layers (the Water Accounting Model – 2 layers) and FLEXPART-WaterSip (the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model coupled with the “WaterSip” moisture source diagnostic method), specifically focusing on a basin governed by the Indian summer monsoon (Yarlung Zangbo River basin, YB) and a westerly-dominated basin (upper Tarim River basin, UTB). Compared to the bias-corrected FLEXPART-WaterSip, WAM2layers generally estimates higher moisture contributions from westerly-dominated and distant sources but lower contributions from local recycling and nearby sources downwind of the westerlies. These differences become smaller with higher spatial and temporal resolutions of forcing data in WAM2layers. A notable advantage of WAM2layers over FLEXPART-WaterSip is its closer alignment of estimated moisture sources with actual evaporation, particularly in source regions with complex land–sea distributions. However, the evaporation biases in FLEXPART-WaterSip can be partly corrected through calibration with actual surface fluxes. For moisture tracking over the TP, we recommend using high-resolution forcing datasets, prioritizing temporal resolution over spatial resolution for WAM2layers, while for FLEXPART-WaterSip, we suggest applying bias corrections to optimize the filtering of precipitation particles and adjust evaporation estimates."
10.5194/acp-24-10707-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了人类活动产生的气溶胶对全球气候的影响。气溶胶可以通过直接反射阳光和间接改变云的性质来影响气候。研究发现，尽管全球气溶胶排放量在下降，但气溶胶的直接效应却在增强，而间接效应却在减弱。这与气溶胶排放源的转移有关，即从北美和欧洲转移到东南亚。论文使用了全球气候模型 MPI-ESM1.2 进行模拟，并分析了气溶胶的辐射强迫效能。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到气溶胶的观测、分析和建模，以及卫星观测和空气质量监测等方面的应用。,"['aerosol', 'direct effect', 'indirect effect', 'emissions', 'global climate model', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Antoine Hermant;Linnea Huusko;Thorsten Mauritsen,Increasing aerosol direct effect despite declining global emissions in MPI-ESM1.2,"Aerosol particles, from natural and human sources, have a cooling effect on the climate, partially offsetting global warming. They do this through direct (sunlight reflection) and indirect (cloud property alteration) mechanisms. Using a global climate model, we found that, despite declining emissions, the direct effect of human aerosols has increased while the indirect effect has decreased, which is attributed to the shift in emissions from North America and Europe to Southeast Asia. 
 Anthropogenic aerosol particles partially mask global warming driven by greenhouse gases, both directly by reflecting sunlight back to space and indirectly by increasing cloud reflectivity. In recent decades, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols have declined globally and at the same time shifted from the North American and European regions, foremost to Southeast Asia. Using simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2), we find that the direct effect of aerosols has continued to increase despite declining emissions. Concurrently, the indirect effect has diminished in approximate proportion to the emissions. In this model, which employs parameterized aerosol effects with constant regional direct effect efficiency, the enhanced efficiency of aerosol radiative forcing in emissions is associated with less cloud masking, longer atmospheric residence times, and differences in aerosol optical properties."

McQuaid,The co-benefits of a low-carbon future for PM2.5 and O3 air pollution in Europe,"We demonstrate that strong climate mitigation could improve air quality in Europe; however, less ambitious mitigation does not result in these co-benefits. We use a high-resolution atmospheric chemistry model. This allows us to demonstrate how this varies across European countries and analyse the underlying chemistry. This may help policy-facing researchers understand which sectors and regions need to be prioritised to achieve strong air quality co-benefits of climate mitigation. 
 There is considerable academic interest in the potential for air quality improvement as a co-benefit of climate change mitigation. Few studies use regional air quality models for simulating future co-benefits, but many use global chemistry–climate model output. Using regional atmospheric chemistry could provide a better representation of air quality changes than global chemistry–climate models, especially by improving the representation of elevated urban concentrations. We use a detailed regional atmospheric-chemistry model (WRF-Chem v4.2) to model European air quality in 2050 compared to 2014 following three climate change mitigation scenarios. We represent different climate futures by using air pollutant emissions and chemical boundary conditions (from CESM2-WACCM output) for three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0: high-, medium- and low-mitigation pathways respectively).We find that in 2050, following SSP1-2.6, mean population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations across European countries are reduced by 52 % compared to 2014. Under SSP2-4.5, this average reduction is 34%. The smallest average reduction is 18 %, achieved following SSP3-7.0. Maximum 6-monthly-mean daily-maximum 8 h (6mDM8h) ozone (O3) is reduced across Europe by 15 % following SSP1-2.6 and by 3 % following SSP2-4.5, but it increases by 13 % following SSP3-7.0. This demonstrates clear co-benefits of climate mitigation. The additional resolution allows us to analyse regional differences and identify key sectors. We find that the mitigation of agricultural emissions will be key for attaining meaningful co-benefits of mitigation policies, as evidenced by the importance of changes in NO3 aerosol mass to future PM2.5 air quality and changes in CH4 emissions to future O3 air quality."

The results show that the NAO and ENSO, particularly in their negative phases, greatly influence dust activities. When both are negative, their combined effect on dust activities is even greater. This research highlights the importance of these climate patterns in predicting spring dust activities in North China. 
 Dust significantly influences global weather and climate by impacting the Earth's radiative balance. Based on reanalysis datasets, this study explores how the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during winter impact dust activities in North China in the following spring. It is found that both the NAO and the ENSO significantly affect dust activities in North China, especially during their negative phases. When both are in their negative phases, their combined impact on dust activities exceeds that of each factor individually. The previous winter's NAO notably affects sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the North Atlantic, associated with an anomalous tripole SST pattern. These SST anomalies persist into the following spring due to their inherent persistence, inducing an anomalous atmospheric teleconnection wave train that influences dust activities in North China. The ENSO, on the one hand, directly impacts dust activities in North China by modulating circulation over the western North Pacific. Moreover, the ENSO enhances the NAO's effect on North Atlantic SST, which explains the synergistic effects of the ENSO and NAO on dust activities in North China. This study elucidates the combined role of the NAO and ENSO in influencing dust activities in North China, providing one-season-ahead signals for predicting spring dust activities in North China."

Chou,"Assessing the effectiveness of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emission reductions in mitigating winter PM2.5 in Taiwan using CMAQ","Models were used to study ways to reduce particulate matter (PM) pollution in Taiwan during winter. After considering various factors, such as physical processes and chemical reactions, we found that reducing NOx or NH3 emissions is more effective at mitigating PM2.5 than reducing SO2 emissions. When considering both efficiency and cost, reducing NH3 emissions seems to be a more suitable policy for the studied environment in Taiwan. 
 Taiwan experiences higher air pollution in winter when fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels frequently surpass national standards. This study employs the Community Multiscale Air Quality model to assess the effectiveness of reducing SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions on PM2.5 secondary inorganic species (i.e., SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+). For sulfate, ∼ 43.7 % is derived from the chemical reactions of local SO2 emission, emphasizing the substantial contribution of regionally transported sulfate. In contrast, nitrate and ammonium are predominantly influenced by local NOx and NH3 emissions. Reducing SO2 emissions decreases sulfate levels, which in turn leads to more NH3 remaining in the gas phase, resulting in lower ammonium concentrations. Similarly, reducing NOx emissions lowers HNO3 formation, impacting nitrate and ammonium concentrations by  decreasing the available HNO3 and leaving more NH3 in the gas phase. A significant finding is that reducing NH3 emissions decreases not only ammonium and nitrate but also sulfate by altering cloud droplet pH and SO2 oxidation processes. While the impact of SO2 reduction on PM2.5 is less than that of NOx and NH3, it emphasizes the complexity of regional sensitivities. Most of western Taiwan is NOx-sensitive, so reducing NOx emissions has a more substantial impact on lowering PM2.5 levels. However, given the higher mass emissions of NOx than NH3 in Taiwan, NH3 has a more significant consequence in mitigating PM2.5 per unit mass emission reduction (i.e., 2.43 × 10−5 and 0.85 × 10−5 µg m−3 (t yr−1)−1 for NH3 and NOx, respectively, under current emission reduction). The cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that NH3 reduction outperforms SO2 and NOx reduction (i.e., USD 0.06 billion yr−1 µg−1 m3, USD 0.1 billion yr−1 µg−1 m3, and USD 1 billion yr−1 µg−1 m3 for NH3, SO2, and NOx, respectively, under the current emission reduction). Nevertheless, the costs of emission reduction vary due to differences in methodology and regional emission sources. Overall, this study considers both the efficiency and costs, highlighting NH3 emissions reduction as a promising strategy for PM2.5 mitigation in the studied environment in Taiwan."

Remedios,Quantifying large methane emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline gas leak of September 2022 using IASI satellite observations and inverse modelling,"The leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 released a large amount of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. We provide observational data from a satellite instrument that shows a large CH4 plume over the North Sea off the coast of Scandinavia. We use this together with atmospheric models to quantify the CH4 leaked into the atmosphere from the pipelines. We find that 219–427 Gg CH4 was emitted, making this the largest individual fossil-fuel-related CH4 leak on record. 
 The sudden leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which began on 26 September 2022, released a substantial amount of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. From the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument onboard EUMETSAT's MetOp-B, we document the first satellite-based retrievals of column-average CH4 (XCH4) that clearly show the large CH4 plume emitted from the pipelines. The data display elevations greater than 200 ppb (parts per billion, ∼ 11 %) above observed background values (1882 ± 21 ppb). Based on the IASI data, together with an integrated mass enhancement technique and formal model-based inversions applied for the first time to thermal infrared satellite methane plume data, we quantify the total mass of CH4 emitted into the atmosphere during the first 2 d of the leaks to be 219–427 Gg CH4. Substantial temporal heterogeneity is displayed in our model-derived flux rate, with three or four distinct peaks in emission rate over the first 2 d. Our range overlaps with other previous estimates, which were 75–230 Gg CH4 and were mostly based on inversions that assimilated in situ observations from nearby tower sites. However, our derived values are generally larger than those previous results, with the differences likely due to the fact that our results are the first to use satellite-based observations of XCH4 from the days following the leaks. We incorporate multiple satellite overpasses that monitored the CH4 plume as it was transported across Scandinavia and the North Sea up to the evening of 28 September 2022. We produced model simulations of the atmospheric transport of the plume using the Eulerian atmospheric transport model, TOMCAT, which show good representation of the plume location in the days following the leaks. The performance of simulated CH4 mixing ratios at four nearby in situ measurement sites compared to the observed in situ values is mixed, which highlights the challenges inherent in representing short-term plume movement over a specific location using a model such as TOMCAT with a relatively coarse Eulerian grid. Our results confirm the leak of the Nord Stream pipes to clearly be the largest individual fossil-fuel-related leak of CH4 on record, greatly surpassing the previous largest leak (95 Gg CH4) at the Aliso Canyon gas facility in California in 2015–2016."

Gust-biased Fs measurements complicate NEE estimation in forests with complex terrain. We analyzed gust-induced CO2 fluctuations and their impact on Fs. Fs and its contribution to NEE can be explained by terrain complexity and turbulent mixing. This work highlights how gusts over complex terrain affect the Fs and NEE measurements. 
 CO2 storage (Fs) is the cumulation or depletion in CO2 amount over a period in an ecosystem. Along with the eddy covariance flux and wind-stream advection of CO2, it is a major term in the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) equation. The CO2 storage dominates the NEE equation under a stable atmospheric stratification when the equation is used for forest ecosystems over complex terrains. However, estimating Fs remains challenging due to the frequent gusts and random fluctuations in boundary-layer flows that lead to tremendous difficulties in capturing the true trend of CO2 changes for use in storage estimation from eddy covariance along with atmospheric profile techniques. Using measurements from Qingyuan Ker Towers equipped with NEE instrument systems separately covering mixed broad-leaved, oak, and larch forest towers in a mountain watershed, this study investigates gust periods and CO2 fluctuation magnitudes and examines their impact on Fs estimation in relation to the terrain complexity index (TCI). The gusts induce CO2 fluctuations for numerous periods of 1 to 10 min over 2 h. Diurnal, seasonal, and spatial differences (P < 0.01) in the maximum amplitude of CO2 fluctuations (Am) range from 1.6 to 136.7 ppm, and these differences range from 140 to 170 s in a period (Pm) at the same significance level. Am and Pm are significantly correlated to the magnitude of and random error in Fs with diurnal and seasonal differences. These correlations decrease as CO2 averaging time windows become longer. To minimize the uncertainties in Fs, a constant [CO2] averaging time window for the Fs estimates is not ideal. Dynamic averaging time windows and a decision-level fusion model can reduce the potential underestimation of Fs by 29 %–33 % for temperate forests in complex terrain. In our study, the relative contribution of Fs to the 30 min NEE observations ranged from 17 % to 82 % depending on turbulent mixing and the TCI. The study's approach is notable as it incorporates the TCI and utilizes three flux towers for replication, making the findings relevant to similar regions with a single tower."

It systematically compares them and provides recommendations for robust comparisons, aiming to steadily engage more parties in using observational methods to complement their UNFCCC submissions. Anticipating improvements in atmospheric modelling and observations, future developments need to resolve knowledge gaps in both approaches and to better quantify remaining uncertainty. 
 Monitoring the spatial distribution and trends in surface greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, as well as flux attribution to natural and anthropogenic processes, is essential to track progress under the Paris Agreement and to inform its global stocktake. This study updates earlier syntheses (Petrescu et al., 2020, 2021, 2023), provides a consolidated synthesis of CH4 emissions using bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) approaches for the European Union (EU), and is expanded to include seven additional countries with large anthropogenic and/or natural emissions (the USA, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo)). Our aim is to demonstrate the use of different emission estimates to help improve national GHG emission inventories for a diverse geographical range of stakeholders.We use updated national GHG inventories (NGHGIs) reported by Annex I parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2023 and the latest available biennial update reports (BURs) reported by non-Annex I parties. Comparing NGHGIs with other approaches highlights that different system boundaries are a key source of divergence. A key system boundary difference is whether anthropogenic and natural fluxes are included and, if they are, how fluxes belonging to these two sources are partitioned.Over the studied period, the total CH4 emission estimates in the EU, the USA, and Russia show a steady decreasing trend since 1990, while for the non-Annex I emitters analyzed in this study, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and DR Congo, CH4 emissions have generally increased. Quantitatively, in the EU the mean of 2015–2020 anthropogenic UNFCCC NGHGIs (15±1.8 Tg CH4 yr−1) and the mean of the BU CH4 emissions (17.8 (16–19) Tg CH4 yr−1) generally agree on the magnitude, while inversions show higher emission estimates (medians of 21 (19–22) Tg CH4 yr−1 and 24 (22–25) Tg CH4 yr−1 for the three regional and six global inversions, respectively), as they include natural emissions, which for the EU were quantified at 6.6 Tg CH4 yr−1 (Petrescu et al., 2023). Similarly, for the other Annex I parties in this study (the USA and Russia), the gap between the BU anthropogenic and total TD emissions is partly explained by the natural emissions.For the non-Annex I parties, anthropogenic CH4 estimates from UNFCCC BURs show large differences compared to the other global-inventory-based estimates and even more compared to atmospheric ones. This poses an important potential challenge to monitoring the progress of the global CH4 pledge and the global stocktake. Our analysis provides a useful baseline to prepare for the influx of inventories from non-Annex I parties as regular reporting starts under the enhanced transparency framework of the Paris Agreement.By systematically comparing the BU and TD methods, this study provides recommendations for more robust comparisons of available data sources and hopes to steadily engage more parties in using observational methods to complement their UNFCCC inventories, as well as considering their natural emissions. With anticipated improvements in atmospheric modeling and observations, as well as modeling of natural fluxes, future development needs to resolve knowledge gaps in the BU and TD approaches and to better quantify the remaining uncertainty. TD methods may emerge as a powerful tool to help improve NGHGIs of CH4 emissions, but further confidence is needed in the comparability and robustness of the estimates.The referenced datasets related to figures are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12818506 (Petrescu et al., 2024)."

As lightning is an important cause of global wildfires, this new model development allows for more realistic projections of how wildfires may change in the future, responding to a changing climate. 
 Lightning is an important atmospheric process for generating reactive nitrogen, resulting in the production of tropospheric ozone, as well as igniting wildland fires, which result in potentially large emissions of many pollutants and short-lived climate forcers. Lightning is also expected to change in frequency and location with the changing climate. As such, lightning is an important component of Earth system models. Until now, the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM) did not contain an interactive-lightning parameterization. The fire parameterization in CanESM5.1 was designed to use prescribed monthly climatological lightning. In this study, we have added a logistical regression lightning model that predicts lightning occurrence interactively based on three environmental variables and their interactions in CanESM5.1's atmospheric model, CanAM5.1 (Canadian Atmospheric Model), creating the capacity to interactively model lightning, allowing for future projections under different climate scenarios. The modelled lightning and resulting burned area were evaluated against satellite measurements over the historical period, and model biases were found to be acceptable. Modelled lightning had a small negative bias and excellent land–ocean ratio compared to satellite measurements.The modified version of CanESM5.1 was used to simulate two future climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5; Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) to assess how lightning and burned area change in the future. Under the higher-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), CanESM5.1 predicts almost no change to the global mean lightning flash rate by the end of the century (2081–2100 vs. 2015–2035 average). However, there are substantial regional changes to lightning – particularly over land – such as a mean increase of 6 % in the northern mid-latitudes and decrease of −8 % in the tropics. By the century's end, the change in global total burned area with prescribed climatological lightning was about 2 times greater than that with interactive lightning (42 % vs. 26 % increase, respectively). Conversely, in the northern mid-latitudes the use of interactive lightning resulted in 3 times more burned area compared to that with unchanging lightning  (48 % vs. 16 % increase, respectively). These results show that the future changes to burned area are greatly dependent on a model's lightning scheme, both spatially and overall."

E3SMv2 atmosphere model (EAMv2) is run at the uniform 0.25° horizontal resolution. We track MCSs consistently in the model and observations using PyFLEXTRKR algorithm, which defines MCSs based on both cloud top brightness temperature (Tb) and surface precipitation. Results from using only Tb to define MCSs are also discussed to understand the impact of different MCS tracking algorithms on MCS evaluation and provide additional insights into model errors in simulating MCSs. Our results show that EAMv2 simulated MCS precipitation is largely underestimated in tropical and extratropical regions. This is mainly attributed to the underestimated MCS genesis and underestimated precipitation intensity in EAMv2. Comparing the two MCS tracking methods, simulated MCS precipitation is increased if MCSs are defined with only cloud top Tb. The Tb‐based MCS tracking method, however, includes cloud systems with very weak precipitation. This illustrates the model issues in simulating heavy precipitation even though the convective cloud shield is overall well simulated from the moist convective processes. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments are performed to examine the impact of new cloud and convection parameterizations developed for EAMv3 on simulated MCSs.

 Climate warming has caused a widespread increase in extreme fire weather, making forest fires longer-lived and larger1–3. The average forest fire size in Canada, the USA and Australia has doubled or even tripled in recent decades4,5. In return, forest fires feed back to climate by modulating land–atmospheric carbon, nitrogen, aerosol, energy and water fluxes6–8. However, the surface climate impacts of increasingly large fires and their implications for land management remain to be established. Here we use satellite observations to show that in temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere, fire size persistently amplified decade-long postfire land surface warming in summer per unit burnt area. Both warming and its amplification with fire size were found to diminish with an increasing abundance of broadleaf trees, consistent with their lower fire vulnerability compared with coniferous species9,10. Fire-size-enhanced warming may affect the success and composition of postfire stand regeneration11,12 as well as permafrost degradation13, presenting previously overlooked, additional feedback effects to future climate and fire dynamics. Given the projected increase in fire size in northern forests14,15, climate-smart forestry should aim to mitigate the climate risks of large fires, possibly by increasing the share of broadleaf trees, where appropriate, and avoiding active pyrophytes. Climate warming has increased forest fire sizes, amplifying postfire summer warming, with broadleaf trees mitigating this effect; climate-smart forestry should increase broadleaf tree cover to manage future fire risks."

 Earth system models have been continously improved over the past decades, but systematic errors compared with observations and uncertainties in climate projections remain. This is due mainly to the imperfect representation of subgrid-scale or unknown processes. Here we propose a next-generation Earth system modelling approach with artificial intelligence that calls for accelerated models, machine-learning integration, systematic use of Earth observations and modernized infrastructures. The synergistic approach will allow faster and more accurate policy-relevant climate information delivery. We argue a multiscale approach is needed, making use of kilometre-scale climate models and improved coarser-resolution hybrid Earth system models that include essential Earth system processes and feedbacks yet are still fast enough to deliver large ensembles for better quantification of internal variability and extremes. Together, these can form a step change in the accuracy and utility of climate projections, meeting urgent mitigation and adaptation needs of society and ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.

 Marine phytoplankton are essential to ocean biogeochemical cycles. However, our understanding of changes in phytoplankton rely largely on satellite data, which can only assess changes in surface phytoplankton. How climate variability is impacting their vertical structure remains unclear. Here we use 33 years’ worth of data from the Sargasso Sea to show distinct seasonal and long-term phytoplankton climate responses in the surface mixed layer compared with the subsurface. Seasonally, the surface community alters their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio without changing their carbon biomass, whereas the chlorophyll a and carbon of the subsurface community covaries with no change in their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio. Over the last decade, the subsurface phytoplankton biomass has increased in response to warming, whereas the surface phytoplankton have altered their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio with minimal change in their carbon biomass. Given that satellites can only view the surface ocean, sustained subsurface monitoring is required to provide a full understanding of how phytoplankton are responding to climate change.

 As fine particulate matter (PM2.5) poses significant environmental and human health risks, there is an urgent need for accurate forecasting systems. In Taiwan, the current air quality forecasting (AQF) system based on the Weather Research and Forecasting meteorological model and Community Multiscale Air Quality model provides essential predictions but is limited by biases and computational complexities. This study introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based PM2.5 forecasting model to enhance prediction accuracy. The CNN model incorporates hourly PM2.5 concentrations from surface observations and the AQF system, along with synoptic weather patterns (SWPs), to predict PM2.5 levels up to 72 h in advance. Three CNN models were developed: CNN-BASE (without SWPs), CNN-SWP (with SWPs), and CNN-SWPW (with SWPs and a weighted loss function). Performance assessment reveals a significant reduction in the mean RMSE of 72-h PM2.5 prediction, from 10.48 μg/m3 with the AQF system to 6.88 μg/m3 with the CNN-BASE model. However, CNN-BASE showed the lowest prediction accuracy for high PM2.5 concentrations (only 26.2%) due to a small subset of samples. Including SWPs improves the model's ability to capture meteorological influences, enhancing predictions of high PM2.5 concentrations. Furthermore, CNN-SWPW incorporates a weighted loss function to address imbalanced sample size distributions, further enhancing the accuracy of high PM2.5 predictions. This study demonstrates the potential of CNNs in operational air quality forecasting."

 The changes in air quality brought about by the COVID-19 lockdowns can provide valuable insight into how longer-term reductions in emissions might affect atmospheric composition. In urban Leicester UK, the 2020 COVID “lockdown” brought about several notable changes in atmospheric composition, including a considerable decrease (20–60%) in concentrations of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Given their varied emission sources and lifetimes, NMVOC data can give valuable insights into how behavioural change impact atmospheric composition. The total concentration of 48 NMVOCs at roadside (RS) sites decreased from a pre-lockdown (sampled 16th-24th March 2020) concentration of 181.3 ± 41.4 μg/m3 to 82.0 ± 12.8 μg/m3 during lockdown (LD, sampled 18th-21st May 2020), before rebounding to a concentration of 236.3 ± 23.9 μg/m3 post lockdown (post-LD, sampled 14th-17th Sept 2020). A similar pattern was observed at urban background (UB) sites with concentrations reducing during lockdown to 96.8 ± 39.5 μg/m3 from a pre-lockdown (pre-LD) concentration of 123.2 ± 24.6 μg/m3 and then increasing to 168.6 ± 29.1 μg/m3 post-LD.Generally, despite the decrease in NMVOC concentrations during the LD, an increase in O3 level was observed. This was attributed to decreased emissions of NOx and the subsequent repartioning of Ox. This research assessed the quantitative effect of changes in vehicular and related anthropogenic emissions on air quality, providing valuable insights for the formulation of future air pollution controls."

 In recent years, Chinese cities have faced persistent O3 pollution challenges. O3 concentrations at urban mountain sites, serving as proxies for urban background O3 levels, can help address data gaps in O3 research in China. This study, for the first time, analyzed O3 data from ten urban mountain sites during 2015–2022 using statistical methods like the Mann-Kendall test, Theil-Sen slope estimation, and Pearson correlation analysis to reveal characteristics and trends in urban background O3 and proposed a metric for assessing mountain sites as urban background stations. Results indicate that O3 at mountain sites were generally higher than at plain sites, regardless of mean, 10th percentile, or 90th percentile the average maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3. Although mountain sites exhibited similar annual and diurnal variations as plain sites, their amplitudes were significantly lower. Significant upward trends (P < 0.05) in MDA8 O3 were observed mainly at plain sites, whereas trends at mountain sites were insignificant (P > 0.05) during 2015–2022. The increase in urban ground-level O3 was largely due to changes in VOCs and NOx emission structures, which reduce nighttime titration effects while enhancing daytime O3 production. The insignificant trends observed at mountain sites suggest that these mountain sites may be in NOx-limited or transitional regimes rather than VOCs-limited regimes, which is also associated with their lower NOx concentrations compared to plain sites. These findings suggest that if China continues to prioritize the reduction of NOx emissions, urban ground-level O3 could further increase and approach the O3 at mountain sites. Finally, this study proposes that the correlation in nighttime O3 concentrations between mountain and plain stations can serve as a valuable indicator for evaluating the suitability of mountain stations as regional background stations in urban areas. It recommends mountain sites in cities such as Changji, Nanping for urban background O3 monitoring stations."

However, γThas declined since then. Understanding whether these variations in γTreflect forced changes or internal climate variability in the carbon cycle is crucial for future climate projections. We show that doubling sensitivity events can arise in simulations by Earth system models with perturbed initial conditions but are likely explained by internal climate variability. We show that the doubling sensitivity event is associated with the occurrence of a few, but very strong, El Niño events, such as 1982/83 and 1997/98. Such extreme events result in concurrent carbon release by tropical and extratropical ecosystems, increasing the variance of the global land carbon sink and its apparent sensitivity to tropical temperature. Our results imply that the doubling sensitivity does not necessarily indicate a change in carbon cycle response to climate change."

Meteorological conditions and emission inventories contributed 46 % (65 %) and 54 % (35 %) to the variations in PM2.5 concentrations (oxidative potential – OP), respectively, highlighting secondary aerosol formation and biomass burning as the primary contributors to PM2.5 and OP levels. 
 China has long-term high PM2.5 levels, and its oxidative potential (OP) is worth studying as it may unravel the impacts of aerosol pollution on public health better than PM2.5 alone. OP refers to the ability of PM2.5 to induce oxidative stress (OS). OP and PM2.5 are influenced by meteorological factors, anthropogenic emission sources, and atmospheric aging. Although their impact on PM2.5 has been studied, OP measurements only recently became available and on a limited scale, as they require considerable technical expertise and resources. For this, the joint relationship between PM2.5 and OP for a wide range of meteorological conditions and emission profiles remain elusive. Towards this, we estimated PM2.5 and OP over China using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) system with meteorological input from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. It was found that higher values of PM2.5 and OP were primarily concentrated in urban agglomerations in the central and eastern regions of China, while lower values were found in the western and northeastern regions. Furthermore, the probability density function revealed that about 40 % of areas in China had annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the Chinese concentration limit. For OP, 36 % of the regions have OP below 1 nmolmin-1m-3, 41 % have OP between 1 and 2 nmolmin-1m-3, and 23 % have OP above 2 nmolmin-1m-3, which are in line with previous measurement studies. Analysis of the simulations indicates that meteorological conditions contributed 46 % and 65 % to PM2.5 concentrations and OP variability, respectively, while anthropogenic emissions contributed 54 % and 35 % to PM2.5 concentrations and OP variability, respectively. The emission sensitivity analysis also highlighted the fact that PM2.5 and OP levels are mostly determined by secondary aerosol formation and biomass burning."

Our research showed that cumulus bubbles played a key role in creating these intense storms. This study can improve the representation of the effect of continental and ocean environments on tropical regions' rainfall patterns in simulations. 
 Large-eddy simulations (LESs) are conducted for each day of the intensive observation periods (IOPs) of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) field campaign to characterize the updrafts and microphysics within deep convective cores while contrasting those properties between Amazon wet and dry seasons. Mean Doppler velocity (Vdop) values simulated using LESs are compared with 2-year measurements from a radar wind profiler (RWP) as viewed by statistical composites separated according to wet- and dry-season conditions. In the observed RWP and simulated LES Vdop composites, we find more intense low-level updraft velocity, vigorous graupel generation, and intense surface rain during the dry periods compared with the wet periods. To investigate coupled updraft–microphysical processes further, single-day golden cases are selected from the wet and dry periods to conduct detailed cumulus thermal tracking analysis. Tracking analysis reveals that simulated dry-season environments generate more droplet-loaded low-level thermals than wet-season environments. This tendency correlates with seasonal contrasts in buoyancy and vertical moisture advection profiles in large-scale forcing. Employing a normalized time series of mean thermal microphysics, the simulated cumulus thermals appear to be the primary generator of cloud droplets. When subsequent thermals penetrate the ice crystal layer, droplets within the thermals interact with entrained ice crystals, which enhances riming in the thermals. This appears to be a production pathway of graupel/hail particles within simulated deep convective cores. In addition, less-diluted dry-case thermals tend to be elevated higher, and graupel grows further during sedimentation after spilling out from thermals. Therefore, greater concentrations of low-level moist thermals likely result in more graupel/hail production and associated dry-season convective vigor."

This study describes a method to determine self-consistent estimates for combustion emissions and natural fluxes of CO2 from atmospheric data. We report consistent estimates inferred using this approach from satellite data and ground-based data over Europe, suggesting that satellite data can be used to determine national anthropogenic CO2 emissions for countries where ground-based CO2 data are absent. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, countries report their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in national inventories, which are used to track progress towards mitigation goals, but they must be independently verified. Atmospheric observations of CO2, interpreted using inverse methods, can potentially provide that verification. Conventional CO2 inverse methods infer natural CO2 fluxes by subtracting a priori estimates of fuel combustion from the a posteriori net CO2 fluxes, assuming that a priori knowledge for combustion emissions is better than for natural fluxes. We describe an inverse method that uses measurements of CO2 and carbon monoxide (CO), a trace gas that is co-emitted with CO2 during combustion, to report self-consistent combustion emissions and natural fluxes of CO2. We use an ensemble Kalman filter and the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model to explore how satellite observations of CO and CO2 collected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), respectively, can improve understanding of combustion emissions and natural CO2 fluxes across the UK and mainland Europe in 2018–2021. We assess the value of using satellite observations of CO2,  with and without CO, above what is already available from the in situ network. Using CO2 satellite observations leads to small corrections to a priori emissions that are inconsistent with in situ observations, due partly to the insensitivity of the atmospheric CO2 column to CO2 emission changes. When we introduce satellite CO observations, we find better agreement with our in situ inversion and a better model fit to atmospheric CO2 observations. Our regional mean a posteriori combustion CO2 emission ranges from 4.6–5.0 Gt a−1 (1.5 %–2.4 % relative standard deviation), with all inversions reporting an overestimate for Germany's wintertime emissions. Our national a posteriori CO2 combustion emissions are highly dependent on the assumed relationship between CO2 and CO uncertainties, as expected. Generally, we find better results when we use grid-scale-based a priori CO2:CO uncertainty estimates rather than a fixed relationship between the two species."

All differentiated secondary organic aerosol, soot, and soil dust but had difficulties differentiating among minerals and dusts. 
 Knowledge of the chemical composition and mixing state of aerosols at a single-particle level is critical for gaining insights into atmospheric processes. One common tool to make these measurements is single-particle mass spectrometry. There remains a need to compare the performance of different single-particle mass spectrometers (SPMSs). An intercomparison of SPMSs was conducted at the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere (AIDA) chamber at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in November 2014, as part of the first phase of the Fifth International Workshop on Ice Nucleation (FIN-01). In this paper we compare size distributions and mass spectra of atmospherically relevant particle types measured by five SPMSs. These include different minerals, desert and soil dusts, soot, bioaerosol (Snomax; protein granule), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and SOA-coated mineral particles. Most SPMSs reported similar vacuum aerodynamic diameter (dva) within typical instrumental ranges from ∼100–200 nm (lower limit) to ∼2–3 µm (upper limit). In general, all SPMSs exhibited a wide dynamic range (up to ∼103) and high signal-to-noise ratio (up to ∼104) in mass spectra. Common spectral features with small diversities in mass spectra were found with high average Pearson's correlation coefficients, i.e., for average positive spectra ravg-pos=0.74 ± 0.12 and average negative spectra ravg-neg=0.67 ± 0.22. We found that instrument-specific detection efficiency (DE) was more dependent on particle size than particle type, and particle identification favored the use of bipolar, rather than monopolar, instruments. Particle classification from “blind experiments” showed that all instruments differentiated SOA, soot, and soil dust and detected subtle changes in the particle internal mixing but had difficulties differentiating among specific mineral types and dusts. This study helps to further understand the capabilities and limitations of the single-particle mass spectrometry technique in general and the specific performance of the instrument in characterizing atmospheric aerosol particles."

Ice nucleation rates can be studied in laboratory assays that gradually lower the temperature of pure water droplets.  These experiments can be performed with different cooling rates, with different droplet sizes, and often with a distribution of droplet sizes.  We combine nucleation theory, survival probability analysis, and published data on the fraction of frozen droplets as a function of temperature to understand how the cooling rate, droplet size, and size dispersity influence the nucleation rates.  The framework, implemented in the Python code AINTBAD (Analysis of Ice nucleation Temperature for B and A Determination), provides a temperature-dependent nucleation rate on a per volume basis, in terms of approximately temperature-independent prefactor (A) and barrier (B) parameters.  We find that dispersion in droplet diameters of less than an order of magnitude, if not properly included in the analysis, can cause apparent nucleation barriers to be underestimated by 50 %.  This result highlights the importance of droplet size dispersion in efforts to model  glaciation in the polydisperse droplets of clouds.  We also developed a theoretical framework, implemented in the Python code IPA (Inhomogeneous Poisson Analysis), to predict the fraction of frozen droplets at each temperature for arbitrary droplet size dispersions and cooling rates.  Finally, we present a sensitivity analysis for the effect of temperature uncertainty on the nucleation spectrum.  Our framework can improve models for ice nucleation in clouds by explicitly accounting for droplet polydispersity and cooling rates."

To overcome the limitation, extra infrared signals from GOES-R ABI are combined with TEMPEST microwave measurements. Compared with ground observations, improved humidity information is extracted from the merged TEMPEST and ABI signals. 
 The Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) demonstrated the capability of CubeSat satellites to provide high-quality, stable microwave signals for estimating water vapor, clouds, and precipitation from space. Unlike the operational NOAA and MetOp series satellites, which combine microwave and hyperspectral infrared sensors on the same platforms to optimize retrievals, CubeSat radiometers such as TEMPEST do not carry additional sensors. In such cases, the high-temporal- and spatial-resolution and multi-channel measurements from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the next-generation series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-R) are ideal for assisting these smaller, stand-alone radiometers. Based on sensitivity tests, the water vapor retrievals from TEMPEST are improved by adding water-vapor-sounding, window, and CO2 channels at 6.2, 6.9, 7.3, 8.4, 10.3, 11.2, 12.3, and 13.3 µm from ABI, which help to increase the vertical resolution of soundings and reduce retrieval errors. Adding three ABI water-vapor-sounding channels, under clear-sky conditions, retrieval biases and root mean square errors improve by approximately 10 %, while under cloudy skies, biases remain unchanged, but root mean square errors still decrease by 5 %; meanwhile, retrieval biases and root mean square errors are substantially reduced by adding more information from eight ABI bands in both clear and cloudy skies. Humidity soundings are also validated using coastal radiosonde data from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) from 2019 to 2020. When ABI indicates clear skies, water vapor retrievals improve somewhat by decreasing the overall bias in the microwave-only estimate by roughly 10 %, although layer root mean square errors remain roughly unchanged at 1 g kg−1 when three or eight ABI channels are added. When ABI indicates cloudy conditions, there is little change in the results. The small number of matched radiosondes may limit the observed improvement."

Aspects like the height of their base are of essential interest to quantify their radiative effects but remain difficult to derive from satellite data. In this study, we combine observations from the surface and satellite retrievals of cloud properties to build a robust and accurate method to retrieve the cloud base height, based on a computer vision model and ordinal regression. 
 Clouds are a crucial regulator in the Earth's energy budget through their radiative properties, both at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface; hence, determining key factors like their vertical extent is of essential interest. While the cloud top height is commonly retrieved by satellites, the cloud base height is difficult to estimate from satellite remote sensing data. Here, we present a novel method called ORABase (Ordinal Regression Auto-encoding of cloud Base), leveraging spatially resolved cloud properties from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument to retrieve the cloud base height over marine areas. A machine learning model is built with two components to facilitate the cloud base height retrieval: the first component is an auto-encoder designed to learn a representation of the data cubes of cloud properties and to reduce their dimensionality. The second component is developed for predicting the cloud base using ground-based ceilometer observations from the lower-dimensional encodings generated by the aforementioned auto-encoder. The method is then evaluated based on a collection of collocated surface ceilometer observations and retrievals from the CALIOP satellite lidar. The statistical model performs similarly on both datasets and performs notably well on the test set of ceilometer cloud bases, where it exhibits accurate predictions, particularly for lower cloud bases, and a narrow distribution of the absolute error, namely 379 and 328 m for the mean absolute error and the standard deviation of the absolute error, respectively. Furthermore, cloud base height predictions are generated for an entire year over the ocean, and global mean aggregates are also presented, providing insights into global cloud base height distributions and offering a valuable dataset for extensive studies requiring global cloud base height retrievals. The global cloud base height dataset and the presented models constituting ORABase are available from Zenodo (Lenhardt et al., 2024)."

Analysis shows that BSR provides improved accuracy and stability compared to Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER). These results indicate that BSR can significantly enhance climate analysis and air quality monitoring, making it a promising tool for accurate environmental satellite applications. 
 In satellite remote sensing applications, enhancing the precision of level 2 (L2) algorithms relies heavily on the accurate estimation of the surface reflectance across the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (VIS) spectrum. However, the mutual dependence between the L2 algorithms and the surface reflectance retrieval poses challenges, necessitating an alternative approach. To address this issue, many satellite algorithms generate Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (LER) products as a priori surface reflectance data; however, this often results in an underestimation of these data. This study is the first to assess the applicability of background surface reflectance (BSR), derived using a semi-empirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, in an operational environmental satellite algorithm. This study pioneered the application of the BRDF model to hyperspectral satellite data at 440 nm, aiming to provide more realistic preliminary surface reflectance data. In this study, the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) data were used, and a comparative analysis of the GEMS BSR and GEMS LER retrieved in this study revealed an improvement in the relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) accuracy of 3 %. Additionally, a time series analysis across diverse land types indicated a greater stability exhibited by the BSR than by the LER. For further validation, the BSR was compared with other LER databases using ground-truth data, yielding superior simulation performance. These findings present a promising avenue for enhancing the accuracy of surface reflectance retrieval from hyperspectral satellite data, thereby advancing the practical applications of satellite remote sensing algorithms."

Understanding GHG flux processes and controls across various ecosystems is essential for estimating the current and future state of climate change. It was shown that using the UAV platform for such measurements is beneficial for improving our understanding of GHG processes over complex landscapes. 
 This study presents an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) platform used to resolve horizontal and vertical patterns of CO2 and CH4 mole fractions within the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer. The obtained data contribute important information for upscaling fluxes from natural ecosystems over heterogeneous terrain and for constraining hot spots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This observational tool, therefore, has the potential to complement existing stationary carbon monitoring networks for GHGs, such as eddy covariance towers and manual flux chambers. The UAV platform is equipped with two gas analyzers for CO2 and CH4 that are connected sequentially. In addition, a 2D anemometer is deployed above the rotor plane to measure environmental parameters including 2D wind speed, air temperature, humidity, and pressure. Laboratory and field tests demonstrate that the platform is capable of providing data with reliable accuracy, with good agreement between the UAV data and tower-based measurements of CO2, H2O, and wind speed. Using interpolated maps of GHG mole fractions, with this tool we assessed the signal variability over a target area and identified potential hot spots. Our study shows that the UAV platform provides information about the spatial variability of the lowest part of the boundary layer, which to date remains poorly observed, especially in remote areas such as the Arctic. Furthermore, using the profile method, it is demonstrated that the GHG fluxes from a local sources can be calculated. Although subject to large uncertainties over the area of interest, the comparison between the eddy covariance method and UAV-based calculations showed acceptable qualitative agreement."

Anderson,Revisiting Contrail Ice Formation: Impact of Primary Soot Particle Sizes and Contribution of Volatile Particles,"Aircraft contrails, formed largely on soot particles in current flights, are important for aviation’s non-CO2 climate impact. Here we show that the activation of nonvolatile soot particles during contrail formation is likely determined by the sizes of primary soot particles rather than the effective sizes of soot aggregates as assumed in previous studies, which can explain less-than-unity fractions of soot particles forming contrail ice particles as recently observed during ECLIF (Emission and CLimate Impact of alternative Fuels) campaigns. The smaller soot primary sizes compared to aggregate sizes delay the onset of contrail ice formation, increase the maximum plume supersaturation reached in the contrail plume, and thus increase the probability of small volatile particles contributing to the total contrail ice particle number. This study suggests that the range of conditions for volatile plume particles to contribute significantly to the contrail ice number budget is wider than previously thought. As the aviation industry is moving toward sustainable aviation fuel and/or lean-burning engine technology, which is expected to reduce not only the emission index of nonvolatile soot particles but also the sizes of primary soot particles, this study highlights the need to better understand how the combined changes may affect contrail formation, contribution of volatile particles, and climate impacts."

However, the mechanism of its influence remains unverified. This study aimed to assess the impact of O3 on metabolomic-based biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Accurate biomarkers for AMI were identified by combining serum biomarkers with metabolomics. A total of 137 volunteers were recruited, including 79 AMI patients and 58 healthy participants, from March to April 2023 in Taiyuan, China. Linear regression models were applied to analyze the associations of serum biomarkers and metabolites with O3. Mediation analyses were also conducted to assess the impact of metabolites, acting as mediators, on the associations between O3 and biomarkers. We found that O3 at lag2 captured the most remarkable effects. Metabolomic analysis revealed a substantial association between O3 (lag2) and 43 metabolites. Pathway analysis revealed that these metabolites primarily participate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, arginine biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. These findings suggest that O3 is an important factor in examining the metabolic mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, highlighting the importance of mitigating O3 to further protect AMI patients."

Given that post‐drought precipitation is a key cause of RDWA, this study focuses on changes in post‐drought precipitation. Climate model projections indicate that the mean post‐drought precipitation will increase by 15.3% during 2071–2100 under the Shared Socio‐economic Pathway (SSP) 585 scenario. The scenario‐averaged response rate of post‐drought precipitation (4.6%/K) to global warming is significantly greater than that of general precipitation (2.7%/K). Furthermore, there will be an increase in the proportion of land area experiencing maximum post‐drought precipitation in autumn. The mean post‐drought extreme precipitation will increase by 20.5% under SSP585, exacerbating the severity of RDWA in a warmer world. The post‐drought thermodynamic (precipitable water) and dynamic (atmospheric vertical velocity) components are both conducive to the future increase in post‐drought precipitation."

Here, we investigate the sensitivity of relative precipitation (P*, precipitation divided by the basin average precipitation) to local sea surface temperature (SST) change by dissecting it into three components, namely the sensitivity of P* to relative SST (SSTrel, SST minus the tropical mean SST) changes, the sensitivity of P* to surface convergence changes, and the sensitivity of surface convergence to SST gradient changes. We show that the relationships between P* and SSTrel, and between P*, surface convergence, and SST gradients are largely constant during climate change. This allows us to constrain regional hydrological sensitivity based on present‐day SST‐precipitation relationships. The sensitivity of surface convergence to SST gradient changes is a main source of uncertainty in regional hydrological sensitivity and is likely underestimated in GCMs."

Despite similar atmospheric forcing, prominent SST anomalies are observed in the NTA during the re‐occurring La Niña winters but not in the first‐year La Niña winters, mainly due to different initial states associated with previous tropical Pacific forcing.

Such multi‐layer (ML) clouds constitute major challenges in cloud observations and weather and climate modeling. This study improved a threshold algorithm for detecting ice‐over‐water ML clouds using geostationary satellites. Optimal thresholds were established for the spectral characteristics of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), accounting for differences between land and ocean surfaces. Validation with collocated space radar and lidar measurements indicated the identification accuracies of approximately 82% over the land and 76% over the ocean. Annual distributions of ML clouds inferred by AHI and AGRI exhibited strong similarity. Furthermore, 6 years of hourly observations revealed distinct monthly and daily variations in ice‐over‐water clouds over the Asia–Pacific region. The ML cloud monthly variations were similar to those of the seasonal convection cycle, with occurrence frequencies over the typical regions higher in summer (maximum ∼27%) and lower (minimum 6%–10%) in winter. Regarding daily variations, ice‐over‐water clouds occurred more frequently around local noon over most of the six time zones (from UTC + 06 to UTC + 11) throughout all seasons. The refined spatiotemporal distribution of ML clouds, particularly the daily variations, is possible to improve our understanding of cloud vertical distributions and radiative effects, and has the potential to promote subsequent validation and parameterization of cloud overlapping in global climate modeling."

The peak frequencies of SR are known to vary with source‐observer distance (SOD), while the daily frequency range (DFR: fmax − fmin) is also indicative of the average size of thunderstorm regions. This paper provides observational evidence for these relationships based on SR frequency observations of the vertical electric (EZ) field component at Nagycenk (NCK), Hungary in Central Europe from the period 1994–2015. Variations of the peak frequencies are considered on the annual, seasonal and diurnal time scales as well as during a specific event when squall‐line formation of lightning activity in South America moves toward NCK. DFR is studied in relation to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Increasing area of lightning activity in mid‐high Northern hemisphere latitudes has been identified by DFR variations during the transition from warm to cold episodes of the ENSO in 1998 and 2010. The extension of the lightning area is considered as a consequence of energy released in the tropics and exported to higher latitudes with some months of delay from the end of the El Niño episodes. The frequency variations are interpreted via model calculations and supported with satellite‐based optical lightning observations (Optical Transient Detector, Geostationary Lightning Mapper). The described variations of SR peak frequencies and DFR yield information on the global/regional lightning dynamics and on this basis they have important application to climate issues as well."

 South America is experiencing severe impacts from climate change. Although the warming of the subcontinent closely follows the global path, the rise of temperatures has been more pronounced in some regions, which have also seen a parallel increment in the occurrence of droughts and weather conditions associated with enhanced fire risk. Here, we use reanalysis datasets to analyze the progression of the concurring warm, dry, and high fire risk conditions (i.e., dry compounds) since 1971. We show that the frequency of these compound extremes has surged in key South American regions including the northern Amazon, which have seen a 3-fold increase in the number of days per year with extreme fire weather conditions (including high temperatures, dryness, and low humidity). Our results also suggest that the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean modulates the interannual variability of dry compounds in South America. While El Niño enhances the fire risk in the northern Amazon, dry extremes in the Gran Chaco region appear to be more responsive to La Niña.

Surface solar energy predictions are essential for the establishment of solar farms and the enhancement of energy grid management. This paper presents a novel approach to forecast surface solar irradiance up to 24 h in advance, utilizing various machine and deep learning architectures. Our proposed Machine Learning (ML) models include both point-based (1D) and grid-based (3D) solutions, offering a comprehensive exploration of different methodologies. Our forecasts leverage two days of input data to predict the next day of solar exposure at country scale. To assess the models’ performance, extensive testing is conducted across three distinct geographical areas of interest: Austria (where models were trained and validated), Switzerland and Italy (where we tested our models under a transfer learning regime), and sensitivity to the season is also discussed. The study incorporates comparisons with established benchmarks, including state-of-the-art numerical weather predictions, as well as fundamental predictors such as climatology and persistence. Our findings reveal that the ML-based methods clearly outperform traditional forecasting techniques, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability in predicting surface solar irradiance. This research not only contributes to the advancement of solar energy forecasting but also highlights the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in being competitive to conventional methods for short-term solar irradiance predictions."

 In South Korea, particulate matter (PM) is generated from various emission sources, including domestic air pollutants and long-range transport. Effective air quality policies require an understanding of the chemical characteristics of PM and differences between urban and non-urban areas (suburban and background areas). We analyzed the chemical characteristics of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) in Yongin City, a suburban area southeast of Seoul, using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) in spring/summer. In spring/summer, photochemical reactions resulted in the highest proportion of Organic Aerosol (OA) among NR-PM1. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) revealed four OA sources: Primary OA and Secondary OA (Oxidized Primary OA (OPOA), Less Oxidized Oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and More Oxidized Oxygenated OA (MO-OOA)). OPOA was formed from the oxidation of emissions from biomass burning and coal combustion; LO-OOA and MO-OOA were correlated with inorganic compounds and influenced by long-range transport. The majority of OA was SOA (82%). High temperatures and humidity accelerated the conversion of SO2 to SO42−, resulting in the proportion of SO42−, second only to OA. Despite favorable conditions for nitrate formation in ammonium-rich conditions, the proportion of NO3− was relatively low due to the decomposition of NH4NO3 into gaseous NH3 and HNO3 at high temperatures. This indicated that while ammonium-rich conditions are conducive to NH4NO3 production, elevated temperatures lead to its decomposition, resulting in lower NO3− concentrations in spring/summer. In the case study, for the case associated with long-range transport, the PM concentration increased due to inorganic compounds such as NO3− and SO42−. Conversely, in cases of domestic air stagnation, the concentration of PM increased primarily due to the presence of OA. These findings provide crucial insights for air quality management in suburban areas and can guide policies to reduce PM levels in spring and summer."

 Moon-photometric measurements were made at two locations in the Arctic during winter nights using two different modified Sun photometers; a Carter Scott SP02 and a Precision Filter Radiometer (PFR) developed at PMOD/WRC. Values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were derived from spectral irradiance measurements made at four wavelengths for each of the devices. The SP02 was located near Barrow, Alaska and recorded data from November 2012 to March 2013, spanning five lunar cycles, while the PFR was deployed to Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard each winter from February 2014 to February 2019 for a total of 56 measurement periods. A methodology was developed to process the raw data, involving calibration of the instruments and normalizing measured spectral irradiance values in accordance with site-specific determinations of the extraterrestrial atmospheric irradiance (ETI) as Moon phase cycled. Uncertainties of the derived AOD values were also evaluated and found to be in the range, 0.006–0.030, depending on wavelength and which device was evaluated.The magnitudes of AOD determined for the two sites were in general agreement with those reported in the literature for sunlit periods just before and after the dark periods of Arctic night. Those for the PFR were also compared with data obtained using star photometers and a Cimel CE318-T, recently deployed to Ny-Ålesund, showing that Moon photometry is viable as a means to monitor AOD during the Arctic night. Such data are valuable for more complete assessments of the role aerosols play in modulating climate, the validation of AOD derived using various remote sensing techniques, and applications related to climate modeling."

Feigin,Technical note: Nighttime OH and HO2 chemical equilibria in the mesosphere–lower thermosphere,"The assumption of chemical equilibrium is widely used to derive information about poorly measured characteristics of the mesosphere–lower thermosphere from rocket and satellite data and to study the physicochemical processes at these altitudes. In this work, we analyze the fundamental aspects of chemical equilibria of two important trace gases and discuss their possible applications. 
 At the altitudes of the mesosphere–lower thermosphere, OH and HO2 play a significant role in many physicochemical processes. Thus, monitoring their spatiotemporal evolution, together with other chemically active trace gases, is one of the most important problems for this atmosphere region, in which direct measurements are difficult. This paper studies the nighttime OH and HO2 chemical equilibria using the 3D chemical transport modeling within the general approach, which includes the identification of the main sources and sinks in the equilibrium space–time areas and the derivation of analytical criteria for equilibrium validity. The presented analysis shows that there are extended areas where nighttime HO2 and OH are close to their local equilibrium concentrations, determined mainly by the reaction between HOx and Ox components among themselves and with H2O2, N, NO, NO2, and CO. In the upper mesosphere–lower thermosphere, the equilibrium expressions can be shortened so that they include the HOx–Ox chemistry only. These expressions describe the HO2 and OH equilibria from the top down to some boundaries, the altitude positions of which vary in the interval between 72–73 and 85 km and depend essentially on season and latitude. The developed analytical criteria reproduce the main features of these boundaries well almost everywhere. Due to weak sensitivity to uncertainties of reaction rates and other parameters, the criteria can be regarded as a robust instrument for HO2 and OH equilibrium validation. The obtained results allow us to extend previously proposed methods for the retrieval of poorly measured components from measurement data and to develop new approaches."

We find that variability in biomass burning emissions contributes to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in tropical tropospheric ozone, though the dominant driver is convection. 
 The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of interannual variability in both tropical latitudes and midlatitudes and has been found to have a strong impact on the distribution of tropospheric ozone in the tropical Pacific in satellite observational datasets, chemical transport models, and chemistry–climate simulations. Here we analyze interannual variability in tropical tropospheric ozone by applying composite analysis, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, and multiple linear regression to the Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) Aura (RAQMS-Aura) chemical reanalysis. As shown in similar studies, the dominant mode of interannual variability in tropical tropospheric ozone is driven by ENSO. ENSO composites show that the ENSO signature in tropospheric ozone is strongest near the tropopause. We also show an enhancement in tropical ozone over the maritime continent below 700 hPa during El Niño that is dependent on the magnitude of the biomass burning emissions in the region. We reconstruct the ENSO variability in tropical tropospheric ozone through a multiple linear regression of principal components for precipitation and CO. The multiple linear regression quantifies that variability in biomass burning contributes to ENSO variability in tropical tropospheric ozone, though the dominant driver is convective precipitation."

The low-level jet causes dust aerosols to accumulate near the ground. The material conditions for the development of the desert atmospheric boundary layer can be quickly transformed into thermal conditions. 
 A vigorous development process of the deep convective boundary layer (CBL) was observed at the southern edge of the Taklimakan Desert on 6 June 2022. Based on coherent Doppler wind lidar and ERA5 data, the formation mechanism of the deep CBL exceeding 5 km was analyzed, which was mainly driven by the low-level jet (LLJ) and thermal effects. During the stage of the LLJ preceding the formation of the deep CBL, the LLJ had adequately prepared the conditions for the development of the deep CBL in terms of momentum, energy, and material. Firstly, the cold downhill airflow from the Tibetan Plateau, which leads to the formation of the LLJ, weakens the height and intensity of the temperature inversion layer, thereby reducing the energy demand for the breakdown of this layer. Secondly, the LLJ not only supplements the material and energy in the residual layer but also suppresses the exchange with the lower atmosphere. In addition, the LLJ provides a driving force for the development of the deep CBL. During the stage of thermal effects, the sensible-heat-driven air pump from the Tibetan Plateau and the passage of a cold front provide additional impetus for the development of the deep CBL. Finally, the formation of the deep CBL was catalyzed by extreme thermal effects of the underlying surface, such as the furnace effect and the atmospheric superadiabatic expansion process. The study of the development of the deep CBL is important for revealing the land–air exchange process of momentum, energy, and material between the Taklimakan Desert and the Tibetan Plateau."

Since above instruments are widely deployed in China, we believe this method has broad application prospects on the improvement of the boundary layer parameterization scheme in numerical forecast models. 
 The accurate wind field observation of tropical cyclone (TC) boundary layer is of great significance to improve the TC track and intensity forecasting. To investigate the vertical structure of TC boundary layer during the landfall process of Super Typhoon Doksuri, three kinds of instruments including the coherent Doppler lidar (CDL), radar wind profiler (RWP) and automatic weather station (AWS) are deployed at two sites in Xiamen, Fujian province. A data fusion method is developed to obtain the complete wind speed profiles covering the whole Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) based on the above instruments. The wind speeds in the near field blind zones of CDL observation are interpolated by combining the AWS measurements at 10 m. The CDL provides high temporal-spatial resolution wind speed profiles from tens of meters to its highest detection height. The wind speeds above the highest detection height of the CDL would be supplemented with the RWP measurements. The hourly mean wind speed profiles are compared with traditional models. Generally, the wind speed profiles fit well with the power law in the lower part of the ABL, before wind speed changes rapidly. However, it would cause a large error (up to 73 %) to describe the exact wind speed profiles with traditional models during and after the typhoon’s passage, especially when the wind speed is almost constant with height or when wind shear exists. Then fine structures and evolutionary processes of the wind field in the ABL during the typhoon landfall are investigated. In addition, the wind field distribution and wind speed variation with distance from the typhoon center are statistical analyzed. The joint wind field measurements of CDL, RWP and AWS have the broad application prospects on the dynamics study of the TC boundary layer and the improvement of the boundary layer parameterization scheme in numerical forecast models."

Our observation strategy focused on measuring evaporation, deposition, and precipitation, all of which are commonly sub-grid scale processes in numerical weather and climate models. Uncertain parameterizations for these processes can lead to compensating errors, which can go unnoticed; however, evaporation and precipitation can also be investigated with SWIs, as they are an integrated tracer for processes that atmospheric moisture has undergone.

Carmichael,Changes in air pollutant emissions in China during two clean-air action periods derived from the newly developed Inversed Emission Inventory for Chinese Air Quality (CAQIEI),"A new long-term inversed emission inventory for Chinese air quality (CAQIEI) is developed in this study, which contains constrained monthly emissions of NOx, SO2, CO, PM2.5, PM10, and NMVOCs in China from 2013 to 2020 with a horizontal resolution of 15 km. Emissions of different air pollutants and their changes during 2013–2020 were investigated and compared with previous emission inventories, which sheds new light on the complex variations of air pollutant emissions in China. 
 A new long-term emission inventory called the Inversed Emission Inventory for Chinese Air Quality (CAQIEI) was developed in this study by assimilating surface observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC) using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System. This inventory contains the constrained monthly emissions of NOx, SO2, CO, primary PM2.5, primary PM10, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) in China from 2013 to 2020, with a horizontal resolution of 15 km × 15 km. This paper documents detailed descriptions of the assimilation system and the evaluation results for the emission inventory. The results suggest that CAQIEI can effectively reduce the biases in the a priori emission inventory, with the normalized mean biases ranging from −9.1 % to 9.5 % in the a posteriori simulation, which are significantly reduced from the biases in the a priori simulations (−45.6 % to 93.8 %). The calculated root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) (0.3 mg m−3 for CO and 9.4–21.1 µg m3 for other species, on the monthly scale) and correlation coefficients (0.76–0.94) were also improved from the a priori simulations, demonstrating good performance of the data assimilation system. Based on CAQIEI, we estimated China's total emissions (including both natural and anthropogenic emissions) of the six species in 2015 to be as follows: 25.2 Tg of NOx, 17.8 Tg of SO2, 465.4 Tg of CO, 15.0 Tg of PM2.5, 40.1 Tg of PM10, and 46.0 Tg of NMVOCs. From 2015 to 2020, the total emissions decreased by 54.1 % for SO2, 44.4 % for PM2.5, 33.6 % for PM10, 35.7 % for CO, and 15.1 % for NOx but increased by 21.0 % for NMVOCs. It is also estimated that the emission reductions were larger during 2018–2020 (from −26.6 % to −4.5 %) than during 2015–2017 (from −23.8 % to 27.6 %) for most of the species. In particular, the total Chinese NOx and NMVOC emissions were shown to increase during 2015–2017, especially over the Fenwei Plain area (FW), where the emissions of particulate matter (PM) also increased. The situation changed during 2018–2020, when the upward trends were contained and reversed to downward trends for the total emissions of both NOx and NMVOCs and the PM emissions over FW. This suggests that the emission control policies may be improved in the 2018–2020 action plan. We also compared CAQIEI with other air pollutant emission inventories in China, which verified our inversion results in terms of the total emissions of NOx, SO2, and NMVOCs and more importantly identified the potential uncertainties in current emission inventories. Firstly, CAQIEI suggested higher CO emissions in China, with CO emissions estimated by CAQIEI (426.8 Tg) being more than twice the amounts in previous inventories (120.7–237.7 Tg). Significantly higher emissions were also suggested over western and northeastern China for the other air pollutants. Secondly, CAQIEI suggested higher NMVOC emissions than previous emission inventories by about 30.4 %–81.4 % over the North China Plain (NCP) but suggested lower NMVOC emissions by about 27.6 %–0.0 % over southeastern China (SE). Thirdly, CAQIEI suggested lower emission reduction rates during 2015–2018 than previous emission inventories for most species, except for CO. In particular, China's NMVOC emissions were shown to have increased by 26.6 % from 2015 to 2018, especially over NCP (by 38.0 %), northeastern China (by 38.3 %), and central China (60.0 %). These results provide us with new insights into the complex variations in air pollutant emissions in China during two recent clean-air actions, which has the potential to improve our understanding of air pollutant emissions in China and their impacts on air quality.

We developed a new model that provides near-real-time estimates of wildfire emissions in China. Our model improves the accuracy of burned area measurements and incorporates advanced data in fuel loads and emission factors. We found that most emissions come from agricultural fires, while emissions from forests and grasslands are decreasing. This model will help reduce the environmental impacts of wildfires. 
 During the past decades, wildfires have undergone rapid changes while both the extent of fire activities and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wildfires in China remain inadequately quantified. To explore national wildfire-induced emissions, we employed satellite-based data on burned vegetation to generate the China Wildfire Emission Dataset (ChinaWED). This dataset is constructed at monthly and kilometer scale under a consistent and quantifiable calculation framework, providing an average annual estimates of wildfire-induced GHG emissions of 78.13 ± 22.46 Tg CO2, 279.47 ± 82.01 Gg CH4, and 6.26 ± 1.67 Gg N2O for the past decade. We observed significant decreases in both wildfire occurrences and emissions within forests and grasslands. This trend, however, is counteracted by increasing agricultural fires, which constitute the primary type accounting for at least half of the national total fire emissions. The seasonal cycle of wildfire GHG emissions show an evident apex occurring during the transition from mid-spring to early-summer.

OOMs in urban atmospheres have complex compositions, posing challenges to understanding their formation, evolution, and influences. In this study, we identify 2403 atmospheric gaseous OOMs in urban Beijing using online nitrate-based chemical ionization Orbitrap mass spectrometry based on one-year atmospheric measurements. We find that OOMs in urban atmospheres can be identified with higher accuracy and wider coverage, compared to previously used online mass spectrometry. With optimized OOM resolving capabilities, previous knowledge of OOMs in urban atmospheres can be expanded. First, clear homologous and oxygen-addition characteristics of the OOMs are revealed. Second, OOMs with lower concentrations or higher masses are identified and characterized with high confidence, e.g., OOMs with masses above 350 Da. In particular, dimers of OOMs (e.g., C20H32O8–15N2), crucial species for organic nucleation, are identified. During four seasons, nitrogen-containing OOMs dominate the total concentration of OOMs, and OOMs are mainly from aromatic and aliphatic oxidation. Additionally, radicals with similar composition as OOMs, intermediates for OOM formation, are identified with clear diurnal variation, e.g., CnH2n–5O6 radicals (n = 8–10) and CmH2m–4NO9 radicals (m = 9–10), peak during the daytime and nighttime, respectively, previously having scarce measurement evidence in urban atmospheres."

Although new particle formation (NPF) is frequently observed at such high altitudes, its precursors and their underlying chemistry remain poorly understood. This study presents direct observational evidence of anthropogenic influences on biogenic NPF on the southeastern QTP, near the Himalayas. The mean particle nucleation rate (J1.7) is 2.6 cm–3 s–1, exceeding the kinetic limit of sulfuric acid (SA) nucleation (mean SA: 2.4 × 105 cm–3). NPF is predominantly driven by highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), possibly facilitated by low SA levels. We identified 1538 ultralow-volatility HOMs driving particle nucleation and 764 extremely low-volatility HOMs powering initial particle growth, with mean total concentrations of 1.5 × 106 and 3.7 × 106 cm–3, respectively. These HOMs are formed by atmospheric oxidation of biogenic precursors, unexpectedly including sesquiterpenes and diterpenes alongside the commonly recognized monoterpenes. Counterintuitively, over half of HOMs are organic nitrates, mainly produced by interacting with anthropogenic NOx via RO2+NO terminations or NO3-initiated oxidations. These findings advance our understanding of NPF mechanisms in this climate-sensitive region and underscore the importance of heavy terpene and NOx-influenced chemistry in assessing anthropogenic-biogenic interactions with climate feedbacks."

Although almost all experiments at different resolutions reproduce the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation, the simulated precipitation intensity from high to low is 16, 8, 50, and 4 km, with the 16 km simulation being closest to the observations. Precipitation magnitude is prominently influenced by the difference in simulated large‐scale circulation across a range of grid spacings. Further analysis revealed that the differences in latent heating across scales affect the geopotential height and wind field by altering temperature. The latent heating in 4 km simulation is the minimum while the 16 km simulation is maximum. More latent heating release leads to the low‐level pressure depression, amplifies the water vapor flux convergence, produces stronger upward motion and more clouds, and ultimately results in stronger precipitation. The sensitivity experiments for turning off latent heating tendencies during the event showed that the latent heat release has positive feedback on the “21.7” heavy rainfall event. This study highlights the importance of scale‐awareness of latent heat at different resolutions and suggests that the difference in simulated latent heat release during the event is the main reason for simulated different atmospheric circulation and precipitation across scales."

This study delves into the spatiotemporal connection between Arctic Oscillation (AO) and SSTAs in the NEP. First, we conduct the lead‐lag correlation and maximum covariance analyses to disentangle the closest temporal relationship between October AO and wintertime SSTAs in the NEP. Then, we categorize the years in positive AO (pAO) phase into two groups: positive AO with warm anomaly (pAO&Blob) group and positive AO without warm anomaly (pAO&noBlob) group based on the October AO index and wintertime blob index. Results show that the positive phase of AO in October strongly influences the wintertime warm SSTAs in the NEP through local and remote pathways. The local pathway is contingent upon the longitudinal positioning of AO‐related high‐pressure anomaly (i.e., anomalous ridge) in the North Pacific. When easterly anomalies prevail at the southern flank of the anomalous ridge over the NEP, they foster warm SSTAs in the NEP. However, different locations of the high‐pressure anomalies may impede the NEP warming. Remote pathways indicate the teleconnections triggered by AO‐related precipitation increase in Greenland and decrease in East Asia, sustaining the high‐pressure anomaly and promoting the anomalous NEP warming. Hence, this study presents new evidence on polar and mid‐latitude climate connections, which may provide potential predictability for the warm SSTAs in the NEP."

Our results show that the bare fractal BC model is not able to explain MAC, LDR, and scattering matrix simultaneously and that the modeling values do not cover the measurement range. This study shows that the modeled LDR and scattering matrix can cover the measurement range if we constrain the MAC of the BC in the measurement range by the intrinsic OC coating when we consider the effects of monomer radius, monomer number, and monomer overlap simultaneously. Therefore, intrinsic OC coating can be a significant source of uncertainty in the optical properties of fresh soot."

 Glacial responses to climate change exhibit considerable heterogeneity. Although global glaciers are generally thinning and retreat, glaciers in the Karakoram region are distinct in their surging or advancing, exhibiting nearly zero or positive mass balance—a phenomenon known as the Karakoram Anomaly. This anomaly has sparked significant scientific interest, prompting extensive research into glacier anomalies. However, the dynamics of the Karakoram anomaly, particularly its evolution and persistence, remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we employed Landsat reflectance data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A3 albedo products to developed high-resolution albedo retrieval models using two machine learning (ML) regressions––random forest regression (RFR) and back-propagation neural network regression (BPNNR). The optimal BPNNR model (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.77–0.97, unbiased root mean squared error [ubRMSE] = 0.056–0.077, RMSE = 0.055–0.168, Bias = −0.149 ∼ −0.001) was implemented on the Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform to estimate summer albedo at a 30-m resolution for the Karakoram region from 1990 to 2021. Validation against in-situ albedo measurements on three glaciers (Batura, Mulungutti and Yala Glacier) demonstrated that the model achieved an average ubRMSE of 0.069 (p < 0.001), with RMSE and ubRMSE improvements of 0.027 compared to MODIS albedo products. The high-resolution data was then used to identify firn/snow extents using a 0.37 threshold, facilitating the extraction of long-term firn-line altitudes (FLA) to indicate the glacier dynamics. Our findings revealed that a consistent decline in summer albedo across the Karakoram over the past three decades, signifying a darkening of glacier surfaces that increased solar radiation absorption and intensified melting. The reduction in albedo showed spatial heterogeneity, with slower reductions in the western and central Karakoram (−0.0005–0.0005 yr−1) compared to the eastern Karakoram (−0.006 ∼ −0.01 yr−1). Notably, surge- or advance-type glaciers, avalanche-fed glaciers and debris-covered glaciers exhibited slower albedo reduction rates, which decreased further with increasing glacier size. Additionally, albedo reduction accelerated with altitude, peaking near the equilibrium-line altitude. Fluctuations in the albedo-derived FLAs suggest a transition in the dynamics of Karakoram glaciers from anomalous behavior to retreat. Most glaciers exhibited anomalous behavior from 1995 to 2010, peaking in 2003, but they have shown signs of retreat since the 2010s, marking the end of the Karakoram anomaly. These insights deepen our understanding of the Karakoram anomaly and provide a theoretical basis for assessing the effect of glacier anomaly to retreat dynamics on the water resources and adaptation strategies for the Indus and Tarim Rivers."

 This study investigates the morphology and elemental composition of individual solid dust particles from various sources (e.g., thermal power plant, domestic coal combustion, building construction dust, wind-blown dust, Asian dust storm, and road related dust) to the atmosphere under high and low relative humidity (RH) conditions in a coastal city of north China by using high-resolution electron microscopes. The results showed that distinct variations between dust particles from thermal power plant and domestic coal combustion, despite both using coal as fuel. Specifically, 88.6% (by number) of thermal power plant particles were spherical, whereas only 2 out of 347 particles from domestic coal combustion exhibited a spherical shape. Furthermore, domestic coal combustion particles showed a higher proportion of Ca-rich particles compared to those from thermal power plant. The wind-blown dust and Asian dust storm particles were mainly “Si + Al” subtype (52.0% v.s. 75.3%) and Si-dominant subtype (16.4% v.s. 11.7%) particles, which were mainly from crustal sources. However, wind-blown dust contained a higher fraction of Ca-rich (11.6%) and Fe-rich (5.3%) particles than Asian dust. The building construction dust particles primarily consisted of irregular Ca-dominant (39.4%) and “Ca + Si” subtype (29.8%) particles. Road related dust were also mainly Si-rich particles (52.9%), likely from re-suspended soil, along with a notable presence of spherical (8.0%) and Fe-rich particles (19.3%), possibly linked to vehicle emissions and brake wear. Additionally, relative number percentage of Na-rich particles and the average weigh ratios of Na in the atmospheric particles were higher than those from all above-mentioned source samples, suggesting that sea-salt related particles might be an important source of the atmospheric dust at the coastal city.

 Urban air quality is influenced by vegetation through alterations in airflow and pollutant deposition processes. We investigated these interactions by integrating the Vegetation Impact Dynamic Assessment model (VIDA) with the Large-Eddy Simulation model PALM. Our analysis focus on nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and particulate matter (PM) concentrations at the local scale, considering three tree genera. Our findings reveal the necessity of accounting for both gaseous pollutants and particles separately due to their differing mechanisms of deposition onto leaves. The coupled PALM-VIDA model demonstrates a significant reduction in PM levels across the modelling domain and within street canyons when deposition to vegetation is incorporated. Reduction in NO₂ through deposition to vegetation is lower but human NO2 exposure can still be decreased if tree species selection and placement leads to desirable effects on air flow. Sparse tree arrangements or species with sparse crowns facilitate ventilation and are often better at reducing NO₂ concentrations in street canyons compared to denser vegetation with higher deposition but negative effects on ventilation. Our study informs urban planning and green infrastructure design, underscoring the multifaceted role of urban greenery in air pollution mitigation strategies. Its main conclusion is that both deposition processes and the influence of air mixing and ventilation need to be considered to accurately assess the effects of urban trees on local air quality. Ill-considered placement and species selection may cause a net increase in pollutants underneath the trees. However, careful planning can address this risk and instead improve overall air quality."
