10.1088/1748-9326/adb506,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注干旱地区森林的高度差异（高森林与矮森林）及其对干旱的抵抗力和恢复力。研究侧重于气候和土壤因素如何影响不同高度森林在干旱条件下的表现。虽然森林与气候变化有关，但该研究并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较低。,[],Xiao He;Xiaoxue Dong;Xuan Li;Ning Chen;Changming Zhao,Divergent patterns and determinants of resistance and resilience in short and tall forests across global drylands,"Forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, and global afforestation initiatives are in full swing, with drylands having great potential for afforestation. However, many dryland afforestation projects lead to short forests with significantly lower canopy height than their typical height. Meanwhile, the potentially increasing probability of drought threatens short forests and their tall counterparts. Yet, it remains largely unclear whether these short forests respond differently to drought compared to tall forests. Here, we used the K-means clustering method to classify global dryland forests into short and tall forests. We found significant differences in drought resistance and resilience between short and tall forests, with tall forests demonstrating higher resistance and short forests having higher resilience. Furthermore, our study indicated that in severe and extreme drought conditions, resistance and resilience of short forests were more likely influenced by climatic factors than tall forests, which were more likely affected by soil factors. These findings suggest that climatic monitoring should be intensified for short forests, and post-drought management should be strengthened for tall forests to enhance their persistence under climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/adb509,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注社会不平等与热应激暴露及适应能力之间的关系，而非大气环境遥感技术。论文探讨了不同社会群体在面临极端高温时的暴露程度和适应能力差异，重点在于社会经济地位、年龄、种族/民族、性别等社会因素的影响。虽然极端高温与气候变化有关，但论文本身并未涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等遥感技术应用。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],S Claire Slesinski;Franziska Matthies-Wiesler;Susanne Breitner-Busch;Geronimo Gussmann;Alexandra Schneider,Social inequalities in exposure to heat stress and related adaptive capacity: a systematic review,"Extreme heat is an important public health concern, and heat stress exposure and related adaptive capacity are not equally distributed across social groups. We conducted a systematic review to answer the question: What is the effect of social disadvantage on exposure to subjective and objective heat stress and related adaptive capacity to prevent or reduce exposure to heat stress in the general population? We systematically searched for peer-reviewed journal articles that assessed differences in heat stress exposure and related adaptive capacity by social factors that were published between 2005 and 2024. One author screened all records and extracted data; a second author screened and extracted 10% for validation. Synthesis included the identification and description of specific social groups unequally exposed to heat stress and with lower adaptive capacity. We assessed European studies for the potential risk of bias in their assessment. We identified 123 relevant publications. Subjective heat stress appeared in 18.7% of articles, objective heat stress in 54.5%, and adaptive capacity in 54.5%. Nearly half came from North America (47.2%), 22.8% from Asia, and 17.1% from Europe. Publishing increased from zero articles in 2005 to 21 in 2023. Most studies considered socioeconomic status (SES) (78.8%), and many considered age (50.4%), race/ethnicity (42.3%), and sex/gender (30.1%). The identified studies show that lower-SES populations, young people, immigrants, unemployed people, those working in outdoor and manual occupations, and racial/ethnic minorities are generally more exposed to heat stress and have lower adaptive capacity. Most studies of objective heat stress use inadequate measures which are not representative of experienced temperatures. European studies generally have a low or moderate risk of bias in their assessments. Social inequalities in heat stress exposure and related adaptive capacity have been documented globally. In general, socially disadvantaged populations are more exposed to heat stress and have lower adaptive capacity. These social inequalities are context-dependent, dynamic, multi-dimensional, and intersectional. It is essential to consider social inequalities during heat-health action planning and when developing and implementing climate change adaptation policies and interventions."

Evaluating predictability and ability to estimate impacts across Europe,"Identifying drought indices that effectively predict future drought impacts remains a critical challenge in seasonal forecasting, as these indices provide the necessary actionable information that enables stakeholders to better anticipate and respond to drought-related challenges. This study evaluates how drought indices balance forecast skill and relevance for estimating impacts across Europe. Using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts SEAS5 seasonal predictions and ERA5 reanalysis as benchmarks, we assessed the predictability skill of drought indices over various accumulation periods and their relevance in estimating drought impacts across Europe, with the aim of enhancing impact-based forecasting. To evaluate these relationships, we built upon the findings from a study that utilized drought impact data from the European Drought Impact Report Inventory and employed random forest models to evaluate the significance of various drought indices in predicting sector-specific impacts. Our findings reveal higher predictability in Northern and Southern Europe, particularly during winter and summer, with some regions showing extended predictability up to six months, depending on the season. Focusing on case studies in the UK and Germany, our results highlight regions and seasons where accurate impact predictions are possible. In both countries, high impact predictability was found up to six months ahead, with sectors such as Agriculture, Water Supply, and Tourism in the UK, and Agriculture and Water Transportation in Germany, depending on the region and season. This analysis represents a significant step forward in identifying the most suitable drought indices for predicting impacts across Europe. Our approach not only introduces a new method for evaluating the relationship between drought indices and impacts, but also addresses the challenge of selecting indices for estimating impacts. This framework advances the development of operational impact-based drought forecasting systems for Europe."
10.1088/1748-9326/adb9fd,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文通过在中国南极和北极考察期间对海洋边界层中铵盐（NH4+）的测量，分析了全球海洋边界层中铵盐的空间分布。研究发现铵盐浓度存在显著的纬度梯度，并且主要以细颗粒物的形式存在。近大陆地区（如东亚和东南亚沿海）的铵盐浓度较高，而开放海洋区域（如北冰洋、南大洋和西太平洋）的铵盐浓度较低。研究结果表明，在开放海洋区域，海洋生物源排放可能是铵盐的重要来源，而在近大陆地区，人类活动是铵盐的主要来源。此外，研究还探讨了铵盐对酸性硫酸盐和硝酸盐的 нейтрализации 作用，以及铵盐与非海盐硫酸盐之间的关系。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究结果对于理解全球大气成分、评估空气质量以及验证相关模型具有重要意义，因此与大气环境遥感技术存在间接关联。,"['ammonium', 'marine boundary layer', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'sulfate', 'nitrate', 'neutralization ratio', 'marine emissions', 'continental air masses']",Ningning Sun;Guitao Shi;Ye Hu;Yilan Li;Guangmei Wu;Zhenlou Chen,Spatial distribution of ammonium in the global marine boundary layer from Arctic to Antarctic,"Ammonium (NH4+) in the marine boundary layer (MBL) was measured during the Chinese Antarctic (2015–2016) and Arctic (2021) Research Expedition. A significant latitudinal gradient in NH4+ concentration was observed, and NH4+ was mainly in the fine-mode (<2.1 μm) in the MBL. NH4+ showed the highest concentration in the coastal East Asia (CEA), followed by the coastal Southeast Asia and Australia (CSAA). Low NH4+ levels were detected in the open oceans, i.e. the Arctic Ocean (AO), the Southern Ocean (SO), and the Western Pacific Ocean (WPO). In the AO, WPO, and SO regions, the air masses arriving at the sampling sites mainly originated from the open oceans, and the significant correlation between methanesulfonate (MSA), which is considered a marker of marine biogenic sources, and NH4+ suggests that marine emissions associated with marine primary productivity are likely an important source of NH4+. However, in the two near-continental regions of CEA and CSAA, elevated NH4+ concentrations are mainly dominated by dense human activities associated with continental air masses. The Neutralization Ratio, defined as the extent to which acidic sulfate and nitrate compounds are neutralized by NH4+, was much smaller than 1.0 (mean = 0.07) in all samples, indicating that the transformation and generation of NH4+ are mainly controlled by the source (i.e. NH3 levels). In addition, there was a significant correlation between non-sea-salt sulfate (nssSO42−) and NH4+, suggesting that NH3 preferentially reacted with H2SO4 over HNO3 in the MBL, especially in areas with excessive acidity."

10.1088/1748-9326/adba78,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注美国本土河流的水温变化，特别是快速的水温升高（surges）和降低（plummets）现象。研究分析了2008年至2023年间美国102个监测站的高分辨率水温数据，旨在了解这些快速水温变化的普遍性、特征以及与气候区域和水文条件的关系。虽然水温受到气候变化的影响，但该研究并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],James C White;Darren Ficklin;Seth Adelsperger;David M Hannah,Flows hot and cold: long-term evidence of rapid river water temperature fluctuations across the conterminous United States,"River water temperature (Tw) regimes are fundamental to freshwater ecosystem health and socioeconomic activities. Most Tw research has focussed on magnitudes and averages, but rates of thermal change have been drastically understudied. Rapid Tw increases (‘surges’) or decreases (‘plummets’) have been observed across individual catchments and short-term periods, but remain poorly characterized across broader space-time domains. To address this, we collated high-resolution Tw data spanning the conterminous United States (US) between 2008–2023. We demonstrated the national-scale prevalence of surges (n = 6507) and plummets (n = 4787) that were recorded at 88 of the 102 monitoring stations. Both event types spanned freezing (snowmelt-fed systems) to extremely hot (>40 °C—geothermal influences) conditions. Most surges and plummets exhibited constrained durations (<1 h), amplitudes (≈1 °C) and rates of change (≈Δ1 °C/15 min), but some reached 24 h, 18.8 °C, and Δ11.3 °C/15 min, respectively. Successive transitions between rapid Tw warming and cooling occurred predominantly in regulated systems, indicating dam-induced Tw volatility. Surge and plummet characteristics differed between US climate regions. Such events were less widespread and frequent in the Northwest and West, with surges here most often occurring during regional droughts and heatwaves. Plummets recurred most consistently in the Southwest during summer months, and were also most common during notable hot and dry periods. Surges were most prevalent in space and time across the Southeast, and again were most common in summer. Surge and plummet counts were less variable year-to-year in the Northeast US, but significantly decreased across the study period. This research provides a critical step in characterizing rapid Tw changes across broad spatial and temporal scales, thus opening prospects for future research exploring how varying catchment properties and hydroclimatic gradients govern surge and plummet dynamics. Such insights are critical for informing evidence-based management solutions targeting extreme Tw variations and volatility."

However, there is currently a lack of quantitative assessments of the potential consequences of afforestation and deforestation on GPP at a global scale. In this study, we used a 30 m high-resolution forest raster map and a satellite-driven GPP product to assess GPP differences under various afforestation/deforestation scenarios, using spatial rather than temporal comparisons. Our results showed that (1) the simultaneous occurrence of high-intensity afforestation and deforestation was extremely low globally (4.64%). Under this hypothetical scenario, the potential GPP of afforestation could reach 734.13 g C m−2 yr−1, significantly higher than that in the other scenarios. While the percentage of concurrent medium- to low-intensity afforestation and deforestation was up to 41.37%, the potential value of afforestation to promote GPP increase was only 219.56 g C m−2 yr−1. (2) The potential of afforestation to boost GPP varied significantly across space and time. Proximity to equatorial forests, such as evergreen broad-leaved forests, generally facilitate GPP accumulation. However, as latitudinal zonality increased, the fixed GPP potential of high-latitude coniferous forests decreased significantly. Summer (particularly June) showed the highest potential for afforestation to enhance GPP, more than twice as much as in the other seasons, and this pattern was consistent globally. (3) Afforestation costs vary substantially depending on forest type and cover. Afforestation in rainforest areas with a better water-heat balance often requires a higher GPP to achieve the desired effect. Low-density forests dominated by temperate or cold zones yield significantly lower GPP benefits than afforestation in tropical rainforests. This study quantifies the potential impact of afforestation on GPP for the first time and provides guidelines for future afforestation planning across various regions."
10.1088/1748-9326/adbb05,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注太阳能光伏系统的倾斜角度优化问题，旨在减少因倾斜角度不佳导致的太阳能发电损失。它利用ERA5再分析数据，结合经验和计算方法，确定最佳的年度和月度倾斜角度。研究评估了全球光伏装置的性能，并强调了精确的倾斜角度优化对于最大化能量产出的重要性。虽然该研究使用了ERA5再分析数据，但其重点在于太阳能发电效率的提升，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Solar photovoltaic systems', 'PV panel tilt angle optimization', 'ERA5 reanalysis data', 'Solar power loss', 'Global PV inventory']",Ning Lu;Jun Qin,Global optimization of photovoltaic tilt angles: reducing solar power losses using reanalysis data,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems play a crucial role in addressing the growing demand for clean energy and mitigating climate change impacts. However, PV system performance is heavily influenced by the incident solar radiation on panel surfaces, with suboptimal tilt angles leading to significant power losses. Despite the critical importance of tilt angle optimization, many existing PV installations worldwide operate suboptimally due to simplified estimation methods or lack of site-specific optimization. This study presents a novel hybrid approach combining empirical and computational methods to determine optimal annual and monthly PV panel tilt angles using long-term hourly ERA5 reanalysis radiation data. Our results validate the effectiveness of ERA5 data for global tilt angle optimization, demonstrating a strong correlation with established cubic relations. Analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of optimized tilt angles reveals the influence of latitude, local atmospheric conditions, and seasonal variations on optimal PV panel inclination. A comprehensive assessment of the global PV inventory in 2018 shows that 44.6% of installed capacity is located in regions with solar power losses exceeding 1%, resulting in a total loss of 6154 GWh yr−1—equivalent to Luxembourg’s annual electricity consumption. Comparison between optimized tilt angles and those estimated using empirical cubic schemes reveals significant discrepancies in some regions, with annual power losses surpassing 3% when using empirical methods. These findings underscore the importance of accurate, location-specific tilt angle optimization to minimize solar power losses and maximize global PV inventory performance. Our research highlights the potential for substantial energy yield improvements through widespread adoption of optimized tilt angles in PV system design and retrofitting, contributing to enhanced renewable energy production and accelerated progress towards global sustainability goals."
10.1088/1748-9326/adbb06,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注自然陆地生态系统中不同形态气态氮（包括一氧化二氮、一氧化氮和二氮气）的排放估算。通过使用新的土壤δ15N图，数据约束的气体分配模型，并考虑了之前缺失的岩石风化氮输入通量，研究估算了这些气体的排放量。研究结果表明，CMIP6模型倾向于高估总的气态氮排放量，从而高估了一氧化二氮的排放量。通过校正总的气态氮排放量以匹配土壤δ15N图，并应用气体分配模型，CMIP6模型的一氧化二氮排放量估计值有所下降，与本研究和其他模型的结果更为一致。该研究强调需要改进CMIP6模型中气态氮排放和分配的建模，以更好地理解陆地生态系统对气候变化的响应和反馈。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对大气成分（特别是氮氧化物）的分析与空气质量监测相关，因此与大气环境遥感技术存在间接关联。,"['nitrous oxide emissions', 'nitric oxide emissions', 'dinitrogen emissions', 'nitrogen cycle', 'CMIP6 models', 'gas partitioning models', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Maoyuan Feng;Gang Liu;Yilong Wang;Jinfeng Chang;Shushi Peng,Isotopic partitioning of gaseous nitrogen emissions of natural terrestrial ecosystems,"We estimated the emissions of different forms of gaseous nitrogen (N) from natural terrestrial ecosystems using newly upscaled soil δ15N maps, data-constrained gas partitioning models, and incorporating the previously missing N input flux from rock weathering. The emissions for nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N2) are estimated at 12 ± 3, 19 ± 4, and 12 ± 3 Tg N yr−1, respectively. The Sixth Phase of Coupled Intercomparison Model Project (CMIP6) models tend to overestimate total gaseous N emissions and thus N2O emissions. Correcting these total gaseous N emissions to match soil δ15N maps and applying gas partitioning models, the CMIP6 models’ N2O emission estimates drop to 7 ± 2 Tg N yr−1, consistent with this study and N2O Model Intercomparison Project 2. Differences in gas partitioning models also contribute significantly to uncertainties in N2O emission estimates. This study underscores the need for improved modeling of gaseous N emissions and partitioning in CMIP6 models to better understand the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change."

The improved skills of the weather model will advance cirrus research, weather forecasts, and measures for contrail reduction. 
 Knowledge of humidity in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is of special interest due to its importance for cirrus cloud formation and its climate impact. However, the UTLS water vapor distribution in current weather models is subject to large uncertainties. Here, we develop a dynamic-based humidity correction method using an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the relative humidity over ice (RHi) in ECMWF numerical weather predictions. The model is trained with time-dependent thermodynamic and dynamical variables from ECMWF ERA5 and humidity measurements from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS). Previous and current atmospheric variables within ±2 ERA5 pressure layers around the IAGOS flight altitude are used for ANN training. RHi, temperature, and geopotential exhibit the highest impact on ANN results, while other dynamical variables are of low to moderate or high importance. The ANN shows excellent performance, and the predicted RHi in the UT has a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.7 % and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, which is significantly improved compared to ERA5 RHi (MAE of 15.8 %; R2 of 0.66). The ANN model also improves the prediction skill for all-sky UT/LS and cloudy UTLS and removes the peak at RHi = 100 %. The contrail predictions are in better agreement with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) observations of ice optical thickness than the results without humidity correction for a contrail cirrus scene over the Atlantic. The ANN method can be applied to other weather models to improve humidity predictions and to support aviation and climate research applications."

Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code kinetic simulations disclosed that sulfamic acid markedly enhances the assembly of a methanesulfonic acid–methylamine-based cluster. At the air–water interface, the NH2SO3− and H3O+ ion formation mechanism and the proton exchange mechanism were observed. 
 Sulfamic acid (SFA) significantly impacts atmospheric pollution and poses potential risks to human health. Although traditional sources of SFA and their role in sulfuric acid–dimethylamine new particle formation (NPF) have received increasing attention, the formation mechanism of SFA from HNSO2 hydrolysis with methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and its enhancing effect on MSA-methylamine (MA) NPF have not been studied, which will limit understanding on the source and loss of SFA in agriculture-developed and coastal industrial areas. Here, the gaseous and interfacial formation of SFA from HNSO2 hydrolysis with MSA was investigated using quantum chemical calculations and Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations. Furthermore, the role of SFA in the MSA-MA system was assessed using the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code (ACDC) kinetic model. Our simulation results indicate that the gaseous SFA formation from the hydrolysis of HNSO2 with MSA can be competitive with that catalyzed by H2O within an altitude of 5–15 km. At the air–water interface, two types of reactions, the ion-forming mechanism and the proton exchange mechanism to form the SFA− … H3O+ ion pair, were observed on the timescale of picoseconds. Considering the overall environment of sulfuric acid emission reduction, the present findings suggest that SFA may play a significant role in NPF and the growth of aerosol particles, as (i) SFA can directly participate in the formation of MSA-MA-based clusters and enhance the rate of NPF from these clusters by approximately 103 times at 278.15 K and (ii) the SFA− species at the air–water interface can attract gaseous molecules to the aqueous surface and thus promote particle growth."

We developed a new method to correct these errors, improving the accuracy of the radar's data. Our method was tested during an intense cyclone on Réunion Island, demonstrating significant improvements in data accuracy. This research is crucial for enhancing weather predictions and understanding, particularly in challenging terrains. 
 In recent years, the application of compact and cost-effective deployable X-band polarimetric radars has gained in popularity, particularly in regions with complex terrain. The deployable radars generally use a radome constructed by joining multiple panels using metallic threads to facilitate easy transportation. As a part of the ESPOIRS project, Laboratoire de l'Atmosphère et des Cyclones has acquired an X-band meteorological radar with a four-panel radome configuration. In this study, we investigated the effect of the radome on the measured polarimetric variables, particularly differential reflectivity and differential phase. Our observations reveal that the metallic threads connecting the radome panels introduce power loss at vertical polarization, leading to a positive bias in the differential reflectivity values. To address the spatial variability bias observed in differential reflectivity and differential phase, we have developed a novel algorithm based on the discrete Fourier transform. The algorithm's performance was tested during an intense heavy-rainfall event caused by Cyclone Batsirai on Réunion Island. The comparative and joint histogram analysis demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in correcting the spatial bias in the polarimetric variables."

Simpson,"Surface distributions and vertical profiles of trace gases (CO, O3, NO, NO2) in the Arctic wintertime boundary layer using low-cost sensors during ALPACA-2022","The Fairbanks area experiences severe pollution episodes in winter because of enhanced emissions of pollutants trapped near the surface by strong temperature inversions. Low-cost sensors were deployed on board a car and a tethered balloon to measure the concentrations of gaseous pollutants (CO, O3, and NOx) in Fairbanks during winter 2022. Data calibration with reference measurements and machine learning methods enabled us to document pollution at the surface and power plant plumes aloft. 
 Electrochemical gas sensors (EGSs) have been used to measure the surface distributions and vertical profiles of trace gases in the wintertime Arctic boundary layer during the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field experiment in Fairbanks, Alaska, in January–February 2022. The MICRO sensors for MEasurements of GASes (MICROMEGAS) instrument set up with CO, NO, NO2, and O3 EGSs was operated on the ground at an outdoor reference site in downtown Fairbanks for calibration, while on board a vehicle moving through the city and its surroundings and on board a tethered balloon, the helikite, at a site at the edge of the city. To calibrate the measurements, a set of machine learning (ML) calibration methods were tested. For each method, learning and prediction were performed with coincident MICROMEGAS and reference analyser measurements at the downtown site. For CO, the calibration parameters provided by the manufacturer led to the best agreement between the EGS and the reference analyser, and no ML method was needed for calibration. The Pearson correlation coefficient R is 0.82, and the slope of the linear regression between MICROMEGAS and reference data is 1.12. The mean bias is not significant, but the root mean square error (290 ppbv, parts per billion by volume) is rather large because of CO concentrations reaching several ppmv (parts per million by volume) in downtown Fairbanks. For NO, NO2, and O3, the best agreements for the prediction datasets were obtained with an artificial neural network, the multi-layer perceptron. For these three gases, the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.95, and the slopes of linear regressions with the reference data are in the range 0.93–1.04. The mean biases, which are 1 ± 3, 0 ± 4, and 3 ± 12 ppbv for NO2, O3, and NO, respectively, are not significant. Measurements from the car round of 21 January are presented to highlight the ability of MICROMEGAS to quantify the surface variability in the target trace gases in Fairbanks and the surrounding hills. MICROMEGAS flew 11 times from the ground up to a maximum of 350 m above ground level (a.g.l.) on board the helikite at the site at the edge of the city. The statistics performed over the helikite MICROMEGAS dataset show that the median vertical gas profiles are characterized by almost constant mixing ratios. The median values over the vertical are 140, 8, 4, and 32 ppbv for CO, NO, NO2, and O3. Extreme values are detected with low-O3 and high-NO2 and NO concentrations between 100 and 150 m a.g.l. O3 minimum levels (5th percentile) of 5 ppbv are coincident with NO2 maximum levels (95th percentile) of 40 ppbv, which occur around 200 m a.g.l. The peaks aloft are linked to pollution plumes originating from Fairbanks power plants such as those documented during the flight on 20 February."

 The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) offers precise, continuous monitoring of atmospheric water vapor, essential for weather forecasting and climate research. This study presents a high-accuracy precipitable water vapor (PWV) dataset from 55 GNSS stations along China’s coast (2009–2019). PWV retrievals utilized weighted mean temperature (Tm) and zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) derived from fifth-generation European ReAnalysis (ERA5) products. After rigorous quality control, the dataset achieved an average completeness rate of 70 %. Validation against ERA5 PWV products showed strong agreement (mean bias: 0.80 mm; RMS error: 2.52 mm), while comparisons with radiosonde profiles yielded a mean bias of 0.90 mm and an RMS error of 3.01 mm, confirming its accuracy and reliability. Spatial analysis revealed PWV values ranging from 0 to 88.57 mm, with minima decreasing with increasing latitude and concentrated around the Yangtze River estuary. Temporal patterns exhibited prominent annual and semi-annual cycles, particularly in higher latitudes. PWV showed a strong positive correlation with sea surface temperature (SST; r = 0.76), with a 1 K SST increase leading to a 2.4 mm (7 %) PWV rise. This dataset supports high-precision applications, including PWV validation, extreme weather prediction, and climate trend analysis.

The LILAC–ESMF framework maintains the integrity of the ELM's source code structure and facilitates the transfer of future ELM model developments to WRF-ELM. 
 The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) is a state-of-the-art land surface model that simulates the intricate interactions between the terrestrial land surface and other components of the Earth system. Originating from the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5, ELM has been under active development, with added new features and functionality, including plant hydraulics, radiation–topography interaction, subsurface multiphase flow, and more explicit land use and management practices. This study integrates ELM v2.1 with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; WRF-ELM) model through a modified Lightweight Infrastructure for Land Atmosphere Coupling (LILAC) framework, enabling affordable high-resolution regional modeling by leveraging ELM's innovative features alongside WRF's diverse atmospheric parameterization options. This framework includes a top-level driver for variable communication between WRF and ELM and Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) caps for the WRF atmospheric component and ELM workflow control, encompassing initialization, execution, and finalization. Importantly, this LILAC–ESMF framework demonstrates a more modular approach compared to previous coupling efforts between WRF and land surface models. It maintains the integrity of ELM's source code structure and facilitates the transfer of future developments in ELM to WRF-ELM.To test the ability of the coupled model to capture land–atmosphere interactions over regions with a variety of land uses and land covers, we conducted high-resolution (4 km) WRF-ELM ensemble simulations over the Great Lakes region (GLR) in the summer of 2018 and systematically compared the results against observations, reanalysis data, and WRF-CTSM (WRF coupled with the Community Terrestrial Systems Model). In general, the coupled WRF-ELM model has reasonably captured the spatial distribution of surface state variables and fluxes across the GLR, particularly over the natural vegetation areas. The evaluation results provide a baseline reference for further improvements in ELM in the regional application of high-resolution weather and climate predictions. Our work serves as an example to the model development community for expanding an advanced land surface model's capability to represent fully-coupled land–atmosphere interactions at fine spatial scales. The development and release of WRF-ELM marks a significant advancement for the ELM user community, providing opportunities for fine-scale regional representation, parameter calibration in coupled mode, and examination of new schemes with atmospheric feedback."

One of the main challenges in NTS is the prioritization of relevant LC-HRMS features. A novel prioritization strategy based on structural alerts to select NTS features that correspond to potentially hazardous chemicals is presented here. This strategy leverages raw tandem mass spectra (MS2) and machine learning models to predict the probability that NTS features correspond to chemicals with structural alerts. The models were trained on fragments and neutral losses from the experimental MS2 data. The feasibility of this approach is evaluated for two groups: aromatic amines and organophosphorus structural alerts. The neural network classification model for organophosphorus structural alerts achieved an Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC-ROC) of 0.97 and a true positive rate of 0.65 on the test set. The random forest model for the classification of aromatic amines achieved an AUC-ROC value of 0.82 and a true positive rate of 0.58 on the test set.

Acid uptake during the transport of Fe-containing particles has been shown to cause Fe dissolution. However, carbonate in dust particles affects the Fe acidification process, influencing Fe dissolution. Here, we carried out atmospheric observations and modeling to show that Fe solubility substantially increased from locations near dust sources to downwind regions in aged dust particles with pH > 3, driven by proton-promoted dissolution. We found that Fe solubility remained low when Ca solubility was under 45 ± 5%, but increased with Ca solubility when it was above 45 ± 5%. Moreover, we found that Fe dissolved in aqueous Ca-nitrate coatings on Fe-containing dust particles. Our results suggest that the mixing state and buffering capacity of carbonate and Fe minerals should be represented in atmospheric biogeochemical models to more accurately simulate acid Fe dissolution processes."

Herein, we fabricated a sulfonated RO membrane (SLRO) using sodium lignosulfonate as a comonomer, achieving an enhanced charge density and reduced coordination capacity. SLRO exhibited superior antisilica scaling performance, reducing scaling rates by ∼145, ∼166, and ∼157% under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions compared to the control. Reduced density gradient analysis confirmed that sulfonic acid groups (−SO3H) on the SLRO surface increased the repulsion of silicic acid. Moreover, the SLRO demonstrated reductions of ∼112, ∼137, and ∼133% in cation-mediated silica scaling rates under the same conditions, attributed to the weaker coordination between −SO3H and cations, which diminished the cation-bridging effect. Furthermore, SLRO membranes exhibited high pure water permeance (3.3 L m–2 h–1 bar–1) and NaCl rejection (99.2%), with a water/NaCl selectivity (7.8 bar–1) three times greater than that of the control (2.6 bar–1), primarily attributed to increased surface roughness and reduced apparent thickness of the PA layer.

In situ characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the SO42– groups not only inhibit the adsorption of SO2 molecules through steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion but also act as the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) to promote C–Cl cleavage of chlorobenzene (CB) and accelerate the desorption of Cl radicals as inorganic chlorine (HCl and Cl2). Additionally, the Ce–O–Mn structure accelerates electron transfer between active sites, enhances the strength of Lewis acid sites (LAS), and weakens the lattice oxygen stability to generate oxygen vacancies (Ov). These features collectively result in the excellent chlorine and sulfur resistance of the Ce–Mn@ZrO2–SO42– catalyst. Compared to CeO2 and Ce–Mn@ZrO2, chlorinated and sulfated byproducts respectively decrease by 7.9 and 2.7 times in the presence of 100 ppm SO2.

In this work, we conducted field observations in various polluted environments across China for process-level understanding of FBC-containing. We find that the variability in FBC-containing, ranging from 10 to 90%, can be elucidated by the concept of atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). The contrast between observations of FBC-containing during haze events is determined by whether the initial aging of freshly emitted BC is limited by daytime AOC levels. We quantify and parametrize FBC-containing by resolving BC aging under different AOC conditions, indicating efficient formation of secondary aerosol on BC-containing particles when daytime-average concentrations of Ox (i.e., O3 + NO2) exceed 80 μg m–3.

This study evaluated Se(VI) removal using iron electrocoagulation (EC) in a flow-through reactor under various water chemistry and operating conditions. Effective Se(VI) removal (>98% from 1000 μg/L Se) was achieved under anoxic conditions with an iron dose as low as 30 mg/L and an EC reactor residence time as short as 11 s that was followed by a 1-h settling period. The removal remained stable over an extended operating time (24 h) and involved the generation of reactive Fe(II)/Fe(III) solids (green rust and magnetite). Oxic conditions were less effective for Se removal because of limited Se adsorption at the elevated pH of the effluent. The immobilized Se in the solids was in a reduced form (-II or 0), but about 70% of Se was oxidized after air exposure. Despite the reduced forms of Se being oxidized, very little Se was released from the solids and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure indicated that EC-generated solids can be classified as nonhazardous. This study highlights the potential of flow-through iron EC to produce iron-containing adsorbents and reductants that can be tailored for Se(VI) and other oxyanion removal.

Hydrogen peroxide enhanced disinfection, with 1.6 ppm reducing viral genome copies by 78%, and higher concentrations (up to 16 ppm) achieving over 99% reduction in the dark condition. The combination of UVA/UVC with H2O2 further enhanced disinfection, eliminating detectable virus genome copies entirely. These findings underscore the potential for using combined UV light and chemical treatments to effectively mitigate airborne viral transmission in enclosed spaces."

We use InSAR and seismicity during the 2024 Fentale intrusion in the Main Ethiopian rift (MER) to understand magma‐assisted rifting at slow extension rates (5 mm/yr). From 2021 to mid‐2024, the Fentale Volcanic Complex (FVC) uplifted up to 6 cm. From mid‐September 2024, upper crustal diking started northwards along the rift, initially with subdued seismicity. From late‐September to early November, dike opening increased to ∼2 m and propagated a total of ∼14 km north, causing increased seismicity from normal faulting. The dike made ∼90% of the total geodetic moment, with the rest from faulting. The character of the event is similar to rifting episodes at mid‐ocean ridges and demonstrates that episodic diking can occur in young, slow extending continent rifts but must be more infrequent."

This study proposes a novel approach to explicitly extract the upwelling atmospheric radiance (Ra ${R}_{\mathrm{a}}$) from the total radiance (Rt ${R}_{\mathrm{t}}$) observed by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), using a Residual Multi‐Layer Perceptron model. A modified one‐dimensional variational algorithm for surface‐free radiances is also developed. The radiance extraction model, trained on simulated IASI radiances, is applied to IASI observations over mainland Australia in January and February of 2022. Validated against ERA5 and radiosonde observations, compared with the traditional Rt ${R}_{\mathrm{t}}$‐based method, the Ra ${R}_{\mathrm{a}}$‐based atmospheric profile retrievals show distinct improvements in boundary‐layer humidity retrieval with at least 20% error reduction. This approach provides a new thought to enhance humidity retrievals from hyperspectral sounders and benefits other quantitative applications such as data assimilation."

In this study, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting model at a convection‐permitting (CP, 4 km grid spacing) scale to comprehensively understand the warm season (May–October) precipitation system changes over eastern China. The CP simulations include a historical run (HIST, 1998–2007) forced by ERA‐interim and the three pseudo‐global warming (PGW) simulations for climate change projection forced by ERA‐interim added on monthly mean and ensemble mean climate perturbations from CMIP5 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. In a warmer climate, the frequency of weak precipitation systems decreases, whereas the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation systems increase. This shift is primarily due to the higher wet bulb temperature in the warm sector. Additionally, the lower low‐level relative humidity, fewer low‐level liquid hydrometeors, and increased maximum convective inhibition (MCIN) in a warmer environment suppress the occurrence of weak precipitation systems. Meanwhile, more frequent large values of maximum convective available potential energy and MCIN contribute to more upper‐level solid hydrometeors and deeper warm cloud layer, leading to the increased frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation systems in the future warmer climate."

Statistical significance testing based on Monte Carlo simulations suggests a minimum of four statistically distinguished LSMP clusters. The four LSMP clusters are characterized as Northwest continental negative height anomaly, Eastward positive “Pacific‐North American Pattern (PNA),” Westward negative “PNA,” and Prominent Alaskan ridge. These four clusters, shown in multiple variables, evolve very differently and have differing links to the Arctic and tropical Pacific regions. Using binary forecast skill measures and a new copula‐based framework for predicting PEx events, we find LSMP indices that are useful predictors of NorCal PEx events, with moisture‐based variables being the best predictors of PEx events at least 6 days before the onset, and the lower atmospheric variables being better than their upper atmospheric counterparts any day in advance tested. To ensure statistical rigor, the LSMPs analyzed here (with the modified acronym) include local tests of both significance and consistency, which are not always featured in the literature on large‐scale meteorological patterns."

Hall,"Nutrient Loading From a Sustainably Certified Aquaculture Operation Dwarfs Annual Nutrient Inputs From a Large Multi‐Use Watershed, Lake Yojoa, Honduras","Net‐pen aquaculture is a popular and increasingly prevalent method for producing large quantities of low‐fat protein in freshwater ecosystems across the tropics. While there are numerable social and economic advantages associated with aquaculture, there are also challenges related to the environmental sustainability of aquaculture operations which supply pens with externally produced feed. For example, excessive nutrient loading, which can drive rapid eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems, is a major risk. In this study, we compare the estimated annual nutrient loads from the six principal tributaries that contribute to Lake Yojoa to the estimated nutrient load of a large net‐pen Tilapia operation located in the central region of the lake. The Tilapia farm was responsible for ∼86% of the nitrogen (N) and ∼95% of the phosphorus (P) contributions to Lake Yojoa for the year of our study. This excessive nutrient loading of both N and P suggests that this single aquaculture operation, more so than changes in nutrient inputs from the watershed, was responsible for the previously documented deterioration of Lake Yojoa. This study shows the potential for net‐pen aquaculture to have significant negative impacts on freshwater ecosystems, even when operations meet the current sustainability certifications standards. We suggest shifts in metrics that could improve the impact of the certification process so that best practices can reduce the impact of net‐pen aquaculture on freshwater ecosystems and arrive at the intended goal of long‐term environmental sustainability.

In the case of place‐based research, studies can avoid misalignment when grounded in the realities of specific locations and conducted in collaboration with knowledgeable local partners. But literature on best practices for such research is underdeveloped on how to identify appropriate locations and partners. In practice, these research‐design choices are sometimes made based on convenience or prior experience—a strategy labeled opportunism. Here we examine a deliberative and exploratory approach in contrast to default opportunism. We introduce a general framework for scoping place‐based opportunities for research and engagement. We apply the framework to identify climate‐adaptation planning decisions, rooted in specific communities, around which to organize research and engagement in a large project addressing coastal climate risks in the Northeast US. The framework asks project personnel to negotiate explicit project goals, identify corresponding evaluation criteria, and assess opportunities against criteria within an iterative cycle of listening to needs, assessing options, prioritizing actions, and refining goals. In the application, we elicit a broad range of objectives from project personnel. We find that a structured process offers opportunities to collaboratively operationalize notions of equity and justice. We find some objectives in tension—including equity objectives—indicating trade‐offs that other projects may also need to navigate.

However, limited research has focused on its plant‐level CCUS investment decisions, especially considering geographic heterogeneity based on the national source‐sink matching optimization. This study develops an integrated framework that combines source‐sink matching with a real option model to investigate CCUS investment decisions under various incentive policies. The findings show that the critical carbon price varies significantly across regions in China, ranging from 55 to 950 CNY/t, with 297 (46% of retrofittable cement plants) falling between 600 and 800 CNY/t. Northeast China, benefiting from favorable storage conditions and enhanced oil recovery, exhibits a lower average critical carbon price of 104 CNY/t. In contrast, Central China, despite its substantial CO2 storage amount (18% of the national total), encounters a higher average critical carbon price of 564 CNY/t CO2 due to significant source‐sink matching distances. Notably, the offshore saline aquifer storage in the Southeastern coast could account for 17% of the national total, corresponding to an average critical carbon price of 660 CNY/t.

 Sharing concepts and knowledge between medical and agricultural fields can promote the development of improved nano-enabled technologies. A central idea behind drug delivery systems is that the active substances are encapsulated in nanoparticles (nano-medicines) to protect the drugs from premature degradation and allow them to be transported to the target site within the body. After three decades of development, nano-medicines are now used in many practical applications, including clinical oncology, infectious disease, cosmetics, and vaccines. Nano-agrochemicals are increasingly considered to tackle challenges associated with food production, sustainability and food security.

 Rooftop photovoltaic (RPV) is often understood as a niche contribution to climate change mitigation. However, the global potential of RPVs to mitigate global warming is unknown. Here we map the global rooftop area at 1-km resolution, quantifying 286,393 km2 of rooftops worldwide through geospatial data mining and artificial intelligence techniques. Using nine advanced Earth system models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6, we reveal that RPVs could substantially contribute to reducing global temperatures by 0.05–0.13 °C before 2050. Region-specific analysis underscores the variability in RPV potential and the necessity of tailored approaches to optimize RPV deployment, considering local solar resources, existing infrastructure and grid carbon intensity. Our findings reveal that leveraging RPV systems offers a viable and impactful strategy for reducing carbon footprints and combating climate change globally, while advocating targeted interventions to enhance the benefits of RPVs, particularly in areas with high solar radiation or rapid urbanization.

 El Niño is responsible for the largest part of the seasonal-to-interannual climate variability, so forecasting El Niño events correctly is important. However, forecasting El Niño events during boreal spring remains challenging. The dynamical seasonal forecast models of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble are over-confident for high confidence (>75% ensemble member agreement) El Niño forecasts. In general, confident El Niño forecasts have a warming tendency in equatorial SSTs in the month prior to the forecast initialization and positive equatorial heat content anomalies during the first month of the forecast. However, confident forecasts often fail when negative SST anomalies were present in the subtropical north eastern Pacific. We find that the models’ equatorial SST anomalies persist too long and that the precipitation response along the warm pool edge to these anomalies is too deterministic. Therefore, the forecast models are too reliant on coupled equatorial processes resulting in excessively deterministic forecasts."

However, agricultural nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are often overlooked. Here we estimate agricultural NOx emissions and design a set of atmospheric chemistry model experiments to assess their role in present and future PM2.5 pollution mitigation in eastern China. The results show that when fossil fuel emissions decrease to 2060 levels, the contribution of agricultural NOx emissions to secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) concentrations during the crop-growing season will reach 40% over intensive agricultural areas such as North China Plain, and the efficiency of reducing agricultural NOx emissions in mitigating SIAs will become comparable to reducing NH3 emissions. By estimating the optimal reactive nitrogen (Nr) emission control pathway, we find that when including agricultural NOx emissions, the strategies will shift in favor of controlling agricultural Nr emissions to achieve more efficient PM2.5 mitigation.

 With several cities worldwide pursuing carbon neutrality in the upcoming decades, there is an increasing interest in quantifying cities’ anthropogenic carbon emissions using atmospheric observations. The challenge with both in-situ and remote sensing methods is, however, that the observations include both anthropogenic and biogenic signals. To reduce uncertainties in anthropogenic emission estimations, it is critical to partition biogenic fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the observed data. In this study, we, for the first time, examine the suitability of carbonyl sulfide (COS), a proxy for photosynthesis, on partitioning biogenic CO2 uptake from the ecosystem exchange measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique over an urban area in Helsinki, Finland. The urban vegetation acts as a clear sink for COS whereas anthropogenic processes show minimal COS emissions within the source area of the measured net carbon flux. We show that two different COS flux-based methods are able to produce the dynamics of photosynthesis by an independent light-response curve-based estimation. Together with commonly used soil and vegetation respiration proxy, we removed biogenic signals from the urban net CO2 exchange and demonstrated that together with CO2 fluxes, COS flux can successfully be used to get realistic estimations of anthropogenic carbon emissions using the EC method."

We asynchronously couple an ice sheet model with a fjord model, and simulate glacier evolution with varying climate scenarios from the year 2020 to 2100. The tallest barrier cools the fjord water and reduces melt at the ice front. But this has minor impacts on glacier retreat under SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5. Cooling the atmospheric forcing to 1990s levels reduces glacier retreat, but even reducing water temperatures with a barrier cannot stabilize the glacier.

 A massive inversion of the Hapke model is carried out over the Asal-Ghoubbet rift (Republic of Djibouti) using high-resolution multiangular Pleiades images. This is the first time that such an inversion is performed on Earth over an entire image, previous studies having focused on planetary surfaces. This work addresses challenges such as atmospheric and geometrical corrections of these images to produce parameter maps. The use of fast Bayesian inversion significantly reduces computation times thanks to efficient exploration of the parameter space and leads to improved prediction. The parameters of the Hapke model are also interpreted in terms of surface physical properties, thanks to field measurements. Single scattering albedo is the parameter extracted with the greatest reliability, although its validation is still difficult due to the absence of a simple formula linking it to surface reflectance. Our study reveals a close relationship between photometric roughness and single scattering albedo, indicating that accurate extraction of the former is highly dependent on values of the latter, which must be below 0.8 for reliable estimation.

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a crucial biochemical parameter for monitoring the plant's nutritional status and photosynthetic capacity. However, retrieving LCC from canopy reflectance is challenging due to the coupling influence of LCC and canopy structure, particularly leaf area index (LAI). The isolation of leaf-scale information from canopy signals is therefore essential to improve the LCC estimation. This study proposed an approach for deriving the leaf-scale chlorophyll index (CIleaf) from the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) based on the spectral invariant theory (p-theory). Six widely used canopy-scale chlorophyll indices (CIcanopy) were selected to derive the corresponding CIleaf. The CIleaf is expressed as the product of its original CIcanopy and a scale conversion factor (SCF) (CIleaf = CIcanopy × SCF). The SCF is determined by two spectral invariants of p-theory (recollision probability p and directional area scattering factor DASF), as well as canopy BRFs at specific wavelengths, and it corrects for the contribution of canopy multiple scattering to CIcanopy. The analysis through radiative transfer model simulations showed that CIleaf exhibited more unified relationships with LCC across LAI conditions than the original CIcanopy and substantially eliminated the influence of LAI on the CI-based model. Validation results demonstrated that CIleaf improved the accuracy of LCC estimation compared to CIcanopy. The leaf-scale MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCIleaf) exhibited the most prominent improvements, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 6.68 μg/cm2 for ground spectra and 2.33–4.21 μg/cm2 for Sentinel-2 images with multi-ecosystem datasets. Additionally, the influence of vegetation types on the CI-based model was mitigated by CIleaf. MTCIleaf reduced the RMSE values by 3.8 %–34.0 % for different plant functional types, giving more consistent accuracies across species than MTCIcanopy. Our results show that the proposed CIleaf combines the robustness of the physically-based method with the simplicity of the CI-based method, thus providing a practical approach for large-scale high-resolution LCC mapping. Moreover, the method holds promise for designing leaf-scale vegetation indices sensitive to various leaf biochemical parameters beyond LCC, extending its utility to broader leaf-scale remote sensing retrieval (e.g., leaf carotenoid content and leaf dry mass)."

 Existing scene classification methods allocate the same computational resources, i.e., all model parameters in the neural network, to each remote sensing image whenever from any geographic scene. However, this might be redundant for images of certain scenes that are easy to discriminate, e.g., homogeneous scenes. This observation motivates us to propose an efficient method for on-orbit scene classification, namely, the Scale Boosting Model (SBM). Specifically, during the training process, the SBM is built as a set of different scale learners in a scale-increasing manner, each of which is used to learn and classify image features at a specific scale. During inference, the scale learners in the SBM will be selectively run in a scale-increasing manner and automatically decide when to exit early or expand the computation according to the scene complexity. In addition, by replacing the backbone of the scale learner, the SBM could provide a deployment possibility for computationally limited models for on-orbit processing, thereby reducing their computational requirements. Extensive experiments on UC Merced Land Use, NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets show that the SBM achieved a more effective classification performance more efficiently."

 With the persistent rise in intensity and magnitude of hydrological extremes globally, timely information from operational early flood warning systems provide lead times that translate into actionable strategies to monitor and mitigate flood risk. However, the situation is often different for flood-prone regions of the global south with sparse to no ground flood monitoring systems, where flood management practices are inadequate or lacking, and floods are further exacerbated due to cross-border water infrastructure management practices. With the unprecedented volume of data from Earth Observation Satellites (EOS), such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and passive microwave radiometry (PMR) river discharges, insights are being provided into different catchment hydrologic variables required for early flood detection and risk management. This work presents a geospatial and satellite-based heuristic that will be of use for operational flood risk management, which ties together PMR river discharges, the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET), and MODIS-based inundation detection. Case studies of the 2012, 2018, 2020, and 2022 floods in the Lower Niger River Basin in Nigeria are presented, with emphasis placed on the devastating 2012 and 2022 floods. Furthermore, using the time-series from the PMR river discharges, a flood frequency analysis was performed. The analysis was found to capture peak discharges corresponding to the flood events. The result of the flood frequency analysis shows that the return periods of all the flood events combined are approximately equal to or below 30-year, with the 2012 and 2022 catastrophic floods approximately 14- and 20-year floods at satellite gauging reach (SGR) 1438, while 14- and 30-year floods at SGR 1441. From the perspective of a 100-year flood regulatory magnitude, these return periods are an indication of possible river flooding in its natural floodplain. The predicted flow magnitude of a 100-year flood at SGR 1438 was 44% and 38% greater than the 2012 and 2022 flood magnitudes, respectively; 18% and 12% greater at SGR 1441. The results show that operational flood monitoring and risk management or assessment are possible in sparse to ungauged river basins using these products, especially with appropriate predictive algorithms to enable incorporation in an early flood warning system. Since satellite-based measurements have no regard for political boundaries, possible effects of cross-border water infrastructure management practices within the basin could also be assessed."

 At present, there are more than 30 satellite remote sensing Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from kilometers to hectometers resolutions. The accuracy of these products is the key issue for further application. The validation of LST products is mainly achieved through ground observations on homogeneous surfaces, but the accuracy of satellite products on heterogeneous surfaces is also an important factor in the performance of satellite products. We proposed an integrated airborne-ground observation scheme to validate the accuracy of hectometers Landsat LST product. Firstly, in this scheme, the optimal deployment of ground observations is constructed by the prior knowledge, which is the brightness temperature from an unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV). Secondly, UAV flight which synchronization with satellite transit to obtain brightness temperature. Thirdly, the atmospheric effect between the UAV and the ground observations is corrected by the radiative transfer equation. Finally, the LST over the heterogenous land surface is validated by upscaled UAV LST. The results showed that the error between the UAV LST and the ground observations could be reduced from 3.2 K to about 0.5 K by calibrating the near-surface atmospheric effect. Besides, the validation of the LST satellite product by upscaling the UAV LST as “true values”, the results showed that the accuracy was about 1.17 K of Landsat product in heterogeneous surface, the bias was more observably with more big heterogeneity of surface which might cause by adjacent effect in Landsat products.

 Accurate building height information is essential for urban management and planning. However, most existing methods rely on general segmentation networks for building height estimation, often ignoring the structural characteristics of buildings. This paper proposes a novel structure-aware building height estimation (SBHE) model to address this limitation. The model is designed as a dual-branch architecture: one branch extracts building footprints from Sentinel-2 imagery, while the other estimates building heights from Sentinel-1 imagery. A structure-aware decoder and a gating mechanism are developed to integrate into SBHE to capture and account for the structural characteristics of buildings. Validation conducted in the Yangtze River Delta region of China demonstrates that SBHE achieved a more accurate building height map (RMSE = 4.62 m) than four existing methods (RMSE = 5.071 m, 7.148 m, RMSE = 10.16 m, and 13.41 m). Meanwhile, SBHE generated clearer building contours and better structural completeness. Thus, the proposed SBHE offers a robust tool for building height mapping.

 Nitrated aromatic compounds (NACs) are toxic, light-absorbing components of particulate matter, impacting both human health and climate. This study conducted a 14-day field campaign at an urban site in Guangzhou, southern China, collecting size-segregated aerosol samples at cutting points of 0.49, 0.95, 1.5, 3.0, 7.2, and 10 μm, to analyze NAC size distribution, light absorption, and toxicity. Nearly 90% of NACs were concentrated in particulate matters with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 1.5 μm (PM1.5). Their concentrations on polluted days strongly correlated with molecular markers from primary emissions, especially from coal combustion. Backward trajectory analysis indicated that northern coal-fired sources significantly contributed to pollution levels. Filter-based light absorption measurements showed that over 90% of brown carbon (BrC) were concentrated in PM0.95. Despite lower mass concentrations of the 9 toxic NACs compared to the 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), their Benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalency quotients (TEQBaP) were substantially higher, with 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, and 6-nitroperylene accounting for 95% of the TEQBaP. 1,6-dinitropyrene was the dominant contributor to NACs’ TEQBaP on both clean and polluted days. The TEQBaP of NACs exceeded 1.0 ng m−3, indicating substantial health risks associated with exposure. These findings highlight the urgent need for emission control to mitigate the health impact of NACs."

 In 2020, the Fine Particle Research Initiative in East Asia considering National Differences (FRIEND) project was launched to understand air quality issues over Northeast Asia better. In the FRIEND project, high-temporal-resolution measurements of gas and aerosol concentrations were taken simultaneously at five key sites in Northeast Asia. In this study, we used the dataset at Beijing in China, Seoul in Republic of Korea, and Noto in Japan. The second FRIEND campaign was conducted in early summer from June 1 to 30, 2021. Compared with the results of the first FRIEND campaign conducted in winter, it was revealed that the fraction of sulfate aerosol (SO42−) had dramatically increased in the upwind region of Northeast Asia (Beijing and Seoul). This period corresponds to the early rainy season in Northeast Asia; therefore, the role of the aqueous-phase oxidation process could be increased in SO42− production. However, accurate modeling of precipitation is still challenging because of the parameterization in the meteorological model. Thus, we investigated the microphysics and cumulus schemes in the meteorological model and conducted 10 simulations. All schemes underestimated the precipitation amount and the cloud fraction. Hence, SO42− concentration was underestimated with a lower conversion ratio from sulfur dioxide (SO2) to SO42− (FS) at Beijing, Seoul, and Noto. At Seoul, the SO42− concentration was underestimated with the aerosol ion monitor (AIM) measurements, corresponding to PM2.5, but had an acceptable performance level. The SO42− concentration at Seoul was sensitive to microphysics and cumulus schemes. However, the SO42− concentration was compared with aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs), corresponding to PM1.0, in Beijing and Noto, and showed greater underestimation. The sensitivities of SO42− concentration to the precipitation schemes were small at Beijing and Noto. The simulated aerosol diameter shifted to a coarser range (1–2.5 μm) in the second campaign compared with the first campaign dataset with increasing temperature and relative humidity. The international measurement network in the FRIEND project demonstrates that the modeled aerosol diameter treatment must be revised carefully."

 Vehicle evaporative emission is an essential source of air pollution in urban areas, and semi- and intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/IVOC) in the emission are important precursors of SOA. Incorporating S/IVOC inventories can significantly enhance the accuracy of SOA simulations in air quality models. In this paper, we established an inventory of evaporative S/IVOC emissions from light-duty vehicles covering mainland China with a resolution of 50 km × 50 km, based on the emission factors and distribution patterns of each evaporative emission process. We further updated the weights of bins in the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) following the measured proportion of the evaporative S/IVOC component, and simulated its contribution to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generation using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System (CMAQ). Results indicate that the total evaporative VOC and S/IVOC emissions from light-duty vehicles in China in 2022 were 269.71 Gg/yr and 70.73 Gg/yr, respectively. Higher emissions were found in the North China Plain, with particularly elevated emissions in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where the maximum S/IVOC emission intensity reached 336.5 kg/km2/yr. We also found that the unit S/IVOC emissions contributed 11.9 times more to SOA formation than unit VOC. The evaporative S/IVOC emission resulted in a maximum increase in SOA concentrations of 0.178 μg/m3, which occurred in summer in western Liaoning province. Spring exhibited the highest SOA formation, with an average rise in national concentration of 0.013 μg/m3. The meteorological conditions in winter were more conducive to S/IVOC-contributed SOA formation, showing a relatively high concentration increase (0.011 μg/m3 on average) and the largest radiant range (reaching Hexi Corridor and Xinjiang Province) with the least emission of four seasons. The average contribution of the evaporative S/IVOC emission to total anthropogenic SOA was 0.5%, with up to 0.8% contribution in the North China Plain and Eastern China, including Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces. The affected areas overlap with populated areas, thus the health impacts of SOA formation in these regions need to be taken seriously. This research fills the gap in light-duty vehicle evaporative S/IVOC emissions inventory and emphasizes its importance for SOA formation."

 This study evaluates the effectiveness of silver iodide (AgI) cloud seeding in Romania by comparing radar-derived parameters of 20 seeded and 20 unseeded severe hailstorms observed between 2017 and 2022. Radar data from S and C-band systems were analyzed using six key parameters, including maximum reflectivity (Zmax), vertically integrated liquid (VIL), Volume of the cloud with reflectivity more than 35 dBZ (dV35) and height of the 45dBZ echo above the environmental melting level (dH45). Statistical comparisons were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test to identify significant differences between the two storm groups. The results reveal statistically significant differences in radar metrics between seeded and unseeded storms, with seeded storms generally exhibiting lower parameter values. For instance, median Zmax was 58 dBZ for seeded storms compared to 60 dBZ for unseeded storms, while VIL medians were 19 kg/m2 and 27 kg/m2, respectively. Similarly, dV35 was reduced by approximately 22 % in seeded storms. These differences indicate that seeding modifies storm microphysical processes and dynamics, potentially suppressing hail formation. However, variability across storm environments and radar categories highlights some uncertainties. Natural fluctuations in convective processes and challenges in tracking seeding agent dispersion complicate the interpretation of results. Nonetheless, the statistical significance of observed differences supports the hypothesis that AgI seeding influences storm characteristics. This study provides quantitative and statistical evidence of seeding effect and underscores the need for further research using advanced radar technologies and larger datasets to refine hail suppression methodologies."

 Global warming and subsequent climate change are currently a major issue both in the scientific community and the society. Therefore it is highly important to consistently monitor the concentrations of greenhouse gases that affect the incoming-outgoing energy balance. To that end, a portable Bruker EM27/SUN FTIR spectrometer is operated in Thessaloniki, Greece since January 2019, performing measurements of total column-averaged dry air mole fractions of trace gases, denoted as X-gases. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of available measurements of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to identify the origin of enhanced concentrations. Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis data are used synergetically with FTIR measurements. XCO2 shows an obvious annual increase (over 2.2 ppm per year) and a clear seasonal variation with high increased concentrations during cold season and decreased concentration during summer period due to photosynthesis activity. XCH4 shows an annual increase and a positive trend. The continuous fire episodes in Athens and North Evia during July and August 2021 led to an unprecedented increase in the concentrations of CO of over 130 %, compared to the typical averaged mean values during August in Thessaloniki. In this paper we investigate the seasonal dependency between CO-CO2 and CO-CH4 enhancements with respect to the prevailing wind direction and we examine if meteorological parameters, such as wind direction and speed, could reveal the origin of enhanced X-gas variations. We applied two different approaching methods to detect long-term and short-term signals of the trace gases. In general, concerning the FTIR measurements, during summer and autumn XCO2, XCO and XCH4 enhancements are observed for low and medium speed winds. Winds mainly originating from SW directions have transported large amounts of CO2, CO and CH4 from the big fires near Athens and N. Evia in summer 2021 to Thessaloniki. The fire emissions generate higher variability of the columns of target gases (over 0.022 ppm in the S and SW wind direction)."

However, the role of isocyanic acid in inflammatory response remains elusive. Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis byLACC1/Lacc1knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore,Lacc1−/−mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo. Hence, our findings identify isocyanic acid as an endogenous immunoregulatory metabolite that limits NLRP3-driven inflammation and provide valuable insights into the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, governed by metabolites."

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetically encoded biosensors, and in toto live imaging, we observe intrinsic variations inerbb2expression and its association with trabecular fate. Specifically,erbb2promotes PI3K activity and recruits the Arp2/3 complex, inducing a polarized accumulation of the actomyosin network to drive cell delamination. Subsequently, the lineage-committed nascent trabeculae trigger Notch activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes to suppresserbb2expression and reduce cell tension, thereby confining them to the compact layer. Overall, this genetic and cellular interplay governs compact and trabecular cell fate determination to orchestrate myocardial pattern formation."

Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient. Here, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of aging mice, revealing citrulline as a consistently down-regulated metabolite associated with aging. Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes.

We used multiplexed glycan immunofluorescence to distinguish between PDAC and noncancer cell subpopulations within tumor tissue, and we developed hybrid glycan sandwich assays to determine whether the aberrant glycan signatures could be detected in blood samples. We found that PDAC cells were identified by signatures of glycans detected by four glycan-binding proteins (VVL, CA19-9, sTRA, and GM2) and that there are three types of glycan-defined PDAC tumors: sTRA type, CA19-9 type, and intermixed. In patient-matched tumor and blood samples, the PDAC tumor type could be determined by the aberrant glycans in the blood. As a result, the combined assays of aberrant glycan signatures were more sensitive and specific than any individual assay. Our results demonstrate a methodology to detect and stratify PDAC."

We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers. Property enhancements attributed to the progression of anisotropic extension are verified by mechanical tests of drawn silk fibers and justified by theory. These findings elucidate how drawing enhances properties of protein-based fibers and shed light on how to incorporate this effect into predictive models."
