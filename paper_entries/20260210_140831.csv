Mamouri;Silke Groß;Victoria E. Cachorro;Ángel M. de Frutos;Bernadett Weinzierl,Saharan and Arabian dust optical properties registered by sun photometry during A-LIFE field experiment in Cyprus,"A field experiment deployed in Cyprus included two sun photometers of Aerosol Robotic Network in two different sites. Mineral dust was predominant during the experiment, with Saharan and Arabian dust showing distinct optical properties, in particular, the Angstrom Exponent in the near-infrarred range and Volume Efficiency factor. Both magnitudes can served as a reliable proxy for mineral dust typing. No significant black carbon presence was detected. 
 The A-LIFE (Absorbing aerosol layers in a changing climate: aging, lifetime, and dynamics) field experiment, conducted in Cyprus in April 2017, employed a wide range of ground-based and airborne instruments, including passive/active remote sensing and in-situ techniques. This study presents the columnar records obtained by sun photometry. Two sun/sky/lunar photometers, belonging to AERONET network, were strategically placed at two sites: Pafos and Limassol, 40 km apart. Aerosol optical and microphysical properties derived from direct sun and sky radiance measurements are analysed to determine an inventory of aerosol event days during the experiment, with mineral dust being present in nearly 75 % of days. Ångström exponent values obtained from 1020 and 1640 nm channels (0.5 for Saharan dust and 0.34 for Arabian dust) can be served as a classification criterion. Dust sources are key point for a well understanding of the size distribution and absorption power. According to columnar records, Saharan dust exhibited less absorbing particles. The columnar volume efficiency factor (linear fit between aerosol optical depth and total volume concentration) was proved as a reliable proxy for the identification of dust origin since Arabian and Saharan dusts exhibit different slopes: 1.28 and 1.68 µm2 µm−3, respectively. Analysing all the inversion products mixtures of mineral dust were mainly dominated by Arabian dust, while mixtures of fine and coarse aerosols showed no clear prevalence of dust origin. No significant presence of black carbon-rich aerosols was detected in the atmospheric column, as absorption Ångström exponent values ranged from 1.6 to 3 across aerosol types identified."

Bollasina;Ioana Colfescu;Guoxiong Wu;Yimin Liu,European sulphate aerosols were a key driver  of the early twentieth-century intensification  of the Asian summer monsoon,"Observational records show that the Asian monsoon underwent substantial changes during the early 20th century, including a wetting trend over South Asia and a southward shift in rainfall over East Asia. We show that increasing European sulphate aerosol emissions played a crucial role in shaping the monsoon rainfall trends. This has important implications for reducing uncertainties in monsoon projections, particularly in light of the diverse future aerosol emission scenarios for the region. 
 Observations show that the Asian summer monsoon experienced substantial multi-decadal changes during the early 20th century, including a wetting trend over South Asia and a southward rainfall shift over East Asia. Despite their significance, these variations have received limited attention, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of increased European sulphate aerosol emissions in shaping these monsoon changes using ensemble experiments with the Community Earth System Model. The aerosol-driven rainfall patterns over South and East Asia resemble observations, suggesting that European aerosols played an important role in modulating the monsoon. These changes are linked to large-scale anomalies in surface climate and three-dimensional atmospheric circulation across the Indo-Pacific, which alter moisture transport to the continent, the main driver of the rainfall anomalies. Regional circulation anomalies form part of a hemispheric upper-tropospheric wave train originating over central Europe and extending through the Middle East to the Pacific. The wave train arises as a thermodynamic adjustment to the aerosol-induced surface cooling and related anticyclone over Europe, extends to the upper troposphere, and, while propagating eastward, induces three-dimensional circulation anomalies across Asia that affect the monsoon. These findings provide compelling evidence for the influence of European sulphate aerosols on the early 20th-century monsoon variability, which is relevant for improving current understanding of the regional-scale impacts of anthropogenic aerosols. As European SO2 emissions continue to decline, this study sheds light upon a possible ongoing and future pathway which may significantly modulate the monsoon response to Asian aerosol changes."

Using computer simulations, we compared flat terrain with realistic terrain and with added winds. We found that even modest hills make the air mix more quickly and rise higher, and winds further strengthen this effect. Our results show that overlooking small terrain features can lead to underestimating how strongly the atmosphere mixes over high plateaus. 
 We investigate how small-scale orography influences the evolution and structure of the exceptionally deep convective boundary layer (CBL) over the Tibetan Plateau (TiP).  Using large-eddy simulations (LES) at 50 m resolution under semi-idealized dry conditions, we compare four experiments over an elevated plateau (4.2 km above mean sea level (a.m.s.l.)): FLAT (no local orography), REAL (realistic terrain), and FLATu10/REALu10 (including a 10 m s−1 upper-level wind).  ABL height is diagnosed using a passive tracer method and cross-validated against turbulence and thermodynamic fields.  All simulations produce a very deep CBL, reaching ∼9 km a.m.s.l. by late afternoon, consistent with the record-high values observed over the TiP.Small-scale orography accelerates early CBL growth and anchors persistent thermals. REAL shows only a modest (∼1 %–2 %) increase in domain-mean ABL height relative to FLAT, yet locally the ABL is up to 20 % higher over the ridge, revealing strong spatial heterogeneity.  Imposed upper-level shear (FLATu10, REALu10) produces deeper and more laterally uniform CBLs, with shear-driven rolls increasing the mean ABL height by roughly 10 %–15 % and homogenizing the tracer field.  Orography primarily affects the upper tail of the distribution, with ridge-top 99th-percentile ABL heights exceeding flat-terrain values by 10 %–20 %, while shear is the dominant control on domain-mean deepening.These results show that unresolved fine-scale orography and shear strongly modulate both the depth and spatial variability of the TiP CBL, and can substantially influence entrainment under weak stability.  Their omission may lead weather and climate models to underestimate CBL growth and vertical exchange over high-altitude regions."

Lindfors;Angela Meyer;Antti Lipponen;Antti Arola,A new method for estimating cloud optical depth from  photovoltaic power measurements,"This paper proposes a new, fast and accurate method for estimating the cloud optical depth (τc) from photovoltaic (PV) power measurements under overcast sky conditions. The method performs very well with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) products as inputs describing the state of the atmosphere. The method exhibits a better performance than published state-of-the-art methods when compared to ground and satellite-based τc retrievals serving as reference. 
 A new method was developed to estimate the cloud optical depth (τc) from photovoltaic (PV) power measurements under overcast sky conditions. It is a fully physical method utilizing directly PV power measurements. It exploits the recent advances and real-time availability at global scale of aerosol properties, downwelling shortwave irradiance and its direct and diffuse components received at ground level under clear-sky conditions and ground albedo, altogether provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) radiation service. In addition to CAMS data, wind speed and air temperature from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts twentieth century reanalysis ERA5 products are also used as inputs. The τc estimates have been compared to different data sources of τc retrievals at four experimental PV sites located in various climates. When compared to τc retrieved from ground-based pyranometer measurements serving as reference, the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.97. The bias ranges between −3 and 4, i.e., −8 % and 14 % in relative value. The root mean square error (RMSE) lies in the interval [3,8] ([9,21] % in relative value). When compared to satellite-based retrievals from Meteosat Second Generation and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, both relative errors become comprehensively greater. Nevertheless, our method remarkably reduces the relative bias and RMSE, by up to 10 % and 20 % respectively, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach. This work demonstrates the accuracy of the method and clearly shows its great potential use whenever PV power measurements are available."

We present a global dataset of plant functional types and corresponding leaf area index for 1985–2020, derived from multiple satellite observations. The dataset reduces uncertainties in vegetation representation and improves the description of phenological dynamics, supporting more realistic land surface and climate modeling. 
 Land surface data describe the heterogeneity of the terrestrial surface and serve as fundamental input for earth system models. Under ongoing climate change and increasing intensity of human activities, land surface data are required to quantify the impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and their contribution to regional and global climate. Plant functional type (PFT) and PFT-specific leaf area index (PFT LAI) characterize land surface and vegetation canopy attributes and are essential model inputs. However, uncertainties associated with current derivation methods may limit their application in earth system models. Moreover, long-term, high-resolution datasets of PFT distributions and PFT LAI remain scarce for fine-scale simulations. To address these gaps, we derived a global 30 m PFT map (PFT30) spanning 1985–2020, updated at five-year intervals prior to 2000 and annually thereafter. By integrating multiple high-resolution remote sensing products, we minimized the assumptions typically required for PFT fraction determination. Building on PFT30, we generated a monthly 500 m PFT LAI dataset for 1985–2020 by fusing PFT30 with the reprocessed MODIS C6.1 LAI and GIMMS LAI4g products, using a remote-sensing-derived phenology scheme instead of the empirical approaches commonly adopted in land surface models. Comparisons with three other hundred-meter global PFT products show that all datasets produce broadly consistent tree fractions, while short-vegetation fractions differ substantially; PFT30 shows better agreement with site observations. Compared with empirical schemes, the new PFT LAI dataset can better distinguish short vegetation types such as grasses, shrubs and crops, because it captures realistic phenological variations directly from remote sensing. This long-term, high-resolution PFT map and the associated PFT LAI data provide a finer representation of land surface characteristics and can be applied in land surface and earth system modeling from regional to global scales."

Bennett,Runoff evaluation in an Earth System Land Model for permafrost regions in Alaska,"Predicting hydrological runoff in Arctic permafrost regions is difficult due to limited observations and complex terrain. We used a detailed physics-based model simulations to improve runoff estimates in a Earth system land model. Our method improved runoff accuracy and worked well across two different Arctic regions. This helps make runoff parameterization schemes more reliable for understanding water flow in permafrost areas under a changing climate. 
 Modeling of hydrological runoff is essential for accurately capturing spatiotemporal feedbacks within the land–atmosphere system, particularly in sensitive regions such as permafrost landscapes. However, substantial uncertainties persist in the terrestrial runoff parameterization schemes used in Earth system and land surface models. This is particularly true in permafrost regions, where landscape heterogeneity is high and reliable observational data are scarce. In this study, we evaluate the performance of runoff parameterization schemes in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM). Our proposed framework leverages simulation results from the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), which is a physics-based integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model that has been successfully evaluated previously in Arctic tundra regions. We used ATS to simulate runoff from 22 representative hillslopes in the Sagavanirktok River basin, located on the North Slope of Alaska, then compared the output with ELM's parameterized representation of total runoff. Results show that (1) ELM's total runoff was the same order of magnitude as the ATS simulations, and both models were similarly variable over time; (2) minor adjustments to coefficients in ELM's runoff parameterization improved the match between the ATS simulation and ELM's parameterized representation of annual and seasonal total runoff; (3) overall, runoff responses in ATS and ELM are more similar in flat hillslope environments compared to steep hillslopes; and (4) shallower active layer thicknesses and higher precipitation simulations resulted in lower correlations between the two models due to greater total runoff. By incorporating the optimized runoff coefficients from the Sagavanirktok River basin into ELM, the simulated total runoff better matched the streamflow observations at a small watershed located on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Our findings revealed important insights into the effectiveness of runoff parameterizations in land surface models and pathways for improving runoff coefficients in typical Arctic regions."

Roorda;Marianne Hatzopoulou,Implications of Off-Peak Commercial Deliveries for Air Quality and Environmental Justice,"Urban trucking poses significant health and environmental risks, particularly  diesel-fueled trucks. Off-peak delivery (OPD), which refers to the delivery of goods during evening and overnight hours, provides an opportunity to mitigate traffic congestion and improve delivery efficiency. However, the impacts of this delivery schedule on population exposure to air pollution are not clear. This study investigates the spatial distribution of traffic-related air pollutants under two OPD scenarios and assesses their environmental justice implications, in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). Using truck movement information from a regional travel demand model and a chemical transport model, we estimated the diurnal changes in air pollutants. The OPD scenarios entail shifting the shares of delivery trips to the evening and overnight periods and account for induced passenger trips during the daytime, resulting from a reduction in truck traffic. One scenario was designed to reflect the industry sectors that would most likely participate in such a scheme and a realistic participation rate, while the other reflects an aggressive shift to overnight periods. While ambient air quality improves during the daytime, despite increased commuter traffic replacing truck movements, air pollutant concentrations worsen at night due to increased emissions under more stable atmospheric conditions. Under both scenarios, the most disadvantaged communities experience the highest variations in air pollution, as they often live close to highways and major truck routes."

Despite their impact on water quality, infrastructure maintenance, and biosafety, biofilms are not routinely controlled. In this study, we investigated the bacterial community dynamics and functionality in an urban chlorinated DWDS, dominated by Mycobacterium, through a multiphasic approach which included 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, metagenomics and microscopy. Our results showed that biofilm communities were more functionally diverse compared to those from water and that the biofilm maturity was positively correlated with the prevalence of potential Mycobacterium emerging pathogens and a broader distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the microbial community. The reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and the corresponding genomospecies allowed the identification of key microbial taxa involved in the biofilm matrix remodeling, with 22% of them strongly responsible for biofilm formation. A diverse and novel viral community was detected across the system, including new putative Mycobacterium phages that might act against mycolic acids and thus contribute to biofilm destabilization. Our findings enhance our understanding of DWDS microbial composition and biofilm formation dynamics, focusing on “who does what” and then providing a foundation for developing effective biofilm control strategies in water distribution systems."

Results vary across vehicle classes but point to common trends: today, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offer significant (10–60%) GHG emissions reduction compared to diesel internal combustion engine vehicles and are the lowest emissions option per ton-mile of cargo movement, followed by hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) (5–50% emissions reduction). Emissions savings depend largely on the duty cycle and fuel economy of the vehicle type. Future vehicle technology advancements result in comparable emission reductions associated with BEVs and hydrogen FCEVs. Weight-limited BEV trucks see less per-ton-mile emissions reduction due to the impact of battery weight on increased vehicle weight and reduced payload capacity. By 2035, improvements in vehicle efficiency can reduce emissions across all powertrains. However, very low levels of emissions require switching vehicles’ use-phase fuel/energy to low-carbon fuels and electricity. Renewable diesel, e-fuels, hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage or renewables, and use of low-carbon electricity can all achieve over 70% reduction in GHG emissions from the current day diesel-based internal combustion engine vehicle."

However, conventional nanofiltration membranes are generally constrained by the trade-off between permeability and selectivity, which limits their practical application. In this study, we designed a reactive interlayer based on piperazine-grafted carboxylated cellulose nanofibers, which participates in the interfacial polymerization process to form a mixed nascent layer (MNL) with smaller pore sizes. This intermediate structure further regulated the formation of an ultrathin polyamide layer featuring uniform pore size distribution and a crumpled morphology. Combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we systematically elucidated the influence of different nascent interlayer structures on the final morphology and chemical composition of the polyamide layer. The resulting membrane exhibits exceptional ion sieving performance, with a Cl–/SO42– selectivity of up to 155.4, and maintains a high water permeance of 43.9 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 while demonstrating effective removal of various micropollutants. This work not only deepens the understanding of the structural evolution mechanism during interfacial polymerization but also provides a new strategy for developing high-performance nanofiltration membranes toward efficient water treatment."

In this study, optical microscopy, poke-and-flow experiments, and thermodynamic modeling were combined to examine the phase behavior of wintertime urban PM2.5 collected in Ansan, South Korea. Morphological analyses revealed humidity- and composition-dependent transitions, with liquid–liquid and liquid–liquid–solid states frequently observed in individual particles. Polluted, nitrate-rich aerosols predominantly exhibited liquid-like morphology and followed near-equilibrium partitioning of nitrate and ammonium. In contrast, cleaner, organic-rich particles likely exhibited higher viscosity and nonliquid characteristics, which may have led to partial deviation from equilibrium predictions. These results provide direct experimental evidence of phase complexity in ambient PM2.5 and demonstrate that the particle phase state, modulated by relative humidity and composition, plays a critical role in determining thermodynamic behavior and atmospheric reactivity of urban aerosols."

However, their biological half-lives in humans remain poorly characterized. This study employed a controlled mouse pharmacokinetic experiment with human biomonitoring data to elucidate key parameters for selected NEOs. Human biomonitoring provided renal clearance (CLrenal), while controlled mice experiment provided the volume of distribution (Vd); these were combined to estimate the biological half-life. Analysis of 172 paired human urine and blood samples revealed that CLrenal varied substantially among parent NEOs (median: 9.04 to 158 mL/day/kg) and exhibited a distinct structure-dependency. The CLrenal of fused, bicyclic NEOs (i.e., imidacloprid (IMI), thiacloprid (THD), and thiamethoxam (THM)) was governed by water solubility, while that of their nonfused, monocyclic systems (i.e., acetamiprid (ACE), clothianidin (CLO), and dinotefuran (DIN)) was determined by lipophilicity. A one-compartment log–linear regression analysis of intravenous mice data provided robust estimates of Vd, which ranged from 306 to 700 mL/kg body weight for ACE, IMI, and DIN. By combining Vd with human CLrenal, the extrapolated median biological half-life for ACE, IMI, and DIN were 15.5, 24.8, and 53.7 days, respectively, indicating significant potential for bioaccumulation in humans. Uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these prolonged estimates, yielding 95% confidence intervals of 5.53 (ACE) to 157 (DIN) days, with even the most conservative scenario giving a range of 5.17 (ACE) to 17.9 (DIN) days. The prolonged half-life of NEOs indicates a significant potential for bioaccumulation in humans upon continuous exposure, which warrants further investigation regarding its implications for human health risk assessment."

EGCS effluents are acidic and contain metals, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and other contaminants that are known to affect marine organisms. Whole effluent toxicity tests were conducted on fertilization and larval development of the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensisusing a 0–10% dilution series of open-loop EGCS effluent. Fertilization success was significantly reduced at the lowest concentration tested (0.0001%). Larval abnormalities increased with effluent concentration, reaching  100% at 10% effluent, where larvae failed to develop skeletons and reach the pluteus stage. Larval growth rates declined with increasing exposure and ceased at a 10% effluent. Exposure to the lowest test concentration caused an estimated additional mortality of 4.6% day–1, indicating a high risk of population-level impacts. As carbonate chemistry remained unchanged below 0.1% effluent, the toxicity was attributed primarily to contaminants. These findings indicate that EGCS effluents pose a significant threat to marine life."

Long treated as a cellular biochemical curiosity, it remains systematically overlooked in global P budgets and Earth system models. In this review, we compile the first global-scale synthesis of environmental occurrence, biological regulation, and ecosystem functions of polyP across terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and engineered systems. Integrating 568 environmental observations and over 3000 microbial genomes, we unveil that polyP is a quantitatively significant and phylogenetically widespread component of global P cycling, often comprising 5–40% of total phosphorus in major ecosystems. We synthesize current understanding of how microbial taxa, including bacterial or archaeal polyP-accumulating organisms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, mediate polyP turnover and interact with carbon/nitrogen cocycling under fluctuating redox, nutrient, and climatic conditions. Our quantitative assessment reveals that global polyP stocks in soils, sediments, and wastewater systems form a substantial, yet previously unaccounted, reservoir of recoverable and climate-sensitive P. The omission of polyP from existing models creates systematic blind spots in understanding P bioavailability, retention, cycling, and sustainability. Integrating polyP into the global P narrative is essential for advancing new frontiers in climate-smart biogeochemical forecasts, circular nutrient management, and long-term water-energy-food ecosystem security under global climate change."

Most radionuclides, such as radiocesium (137Cs), remain in the charred residues and burned soil even after wildfires. This study investigated the impact of wildfires on 137Cs speciation in forest litter and soils following the Fukushima nuclear accident. Extraction tests of 137Cs from unburned litter and soil artificially combusted at 250, 375, and 500 °C were conducted. 137Cs leaching from charred residues and burned soil collected from the field after the wildfires was tested. Sequential extraction was performed on soil obtained after the fire. The results indicated that water-soluble 137Cs from burned litter increased with combustion temperature. However, in artificially combusted soil, the release of water-soluble 137Cs was significantly reduced. In the field, 137Cs leaching from charred residues was lower than that from unburned litter. The fraction of water-soluble 137C in burned soil did not differ significantly from that in unburned soil.

Furthermore, the combustion of soil organic matter may have altered the exchangeable form of 137Cs.

However, due to limited large-scale sampling and long-term wetland distribution records, their impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) remain poorly known. Here, we integrated a nationwide wetland SOC density database, multitemporal wetland maps, and related geospatial environmental data sets and applied a random forest model to map China’s wetland carbon pool and quantified SOC losses and gains associated with conversion and restoration between 1980 and 2020. The results showed that the mean SOC density of top 1 m in China’s wetlands was 23.10 kg C m–2 over the study period, with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. We found that SOC density declined markedly within the first decade after conversion of wetlands to agriculture, with an average reduction of ∼19%. The rate of decline then slowed and gradually stabilized. Over the four decades, conversion to agriculture led to a cumulative loss of ∼574.66 Tg C, equivalent to ∼10.6% of the national wetland carbon pool. By contrast, wetland restoration promoted SOC recovery, although levels remained below preconversion baselines. Conservation and restoration can offset over half of the carbon emissions from wetland conversion. Among them, restoration contributed 186.36 Tg C (∼3.43% of the wetland carbon pool), offsetting ∼32.4% of conversion-induced losses. Overall, from 1980 to 2020, SOC losses from conversion gradually decreased, while restoration-driven gains gradually increased. These results highlight the critical role of wetland conservation and restoration in reversing carbon losses and advancing climate change mitigation toward carbon neutrality."

There is still a lack of understanding of the individual exposure to airborne pollutants under different weathers. This study applied portable exposure samplers to collect PM2.5 samples under hazy, precipitation, dusty, and calm weather scenarios. Non-targeted screening (NTS) based on gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF MS) was conducted for comprehensive identification of organic contaminants in the samples. Over 500 organic compounds were annotated and semi-quantitatively analyzed. The assessment model combining persistence–bioaccumulation–toxicity (PBT) characteristics with exposure levels was established to identify high-priority pollutants. The results indicate that the occurrence and risk characteristics of organic contaminants vary significantly under different weather scenarios with the compounds’ average risk index for being highest during sandstorm weather. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating weather exposure scenarios into the complex atmospheric environment monitoring to achieve comprehensive risk assessment and provide evidence for targeted air pollution control strategies."

Dynamic triggering effects, fault geometry complexity, and stress localization may explain rupture within these shadow zones. Further southward rupture propagation of the 2025 rupture into the Bago segment is likely inhibited by a combination of geometric and pre‐stress barriers, preventing a larger rupture."

Focusing only on oceanic ETCs over a 4‐year period, composite transects of the observations reveal that most hemispheric differences in warm frontal IWP, LWP, and precipitation align with variations in precipitable water, cyclone strength, and storm maturity. However, for similar cyclone strength and environmental moisture, NH warm fronts during early development contain more ice but are less efficient at precipitating than those in the SH. Higher dust concentrations in NH might explain the greater ice amounts, while higher sea‐salt concentrations in SH might explain the greater precipitation efficiency in their respective warm frontal regions."

Here, we use a laboratory fault that allows direct observation of slip to determine which fault conditions promote linked ruptures, and how to observationally evaluate their likelihood. Higher concentrations of normal stress due to increased normal force, applied stress asperities, or larger heterogeneity between the samples, all lead to significant increases in linked rupture likelihood. The mean radiated energy enhancement factor (REEF) of large events is an excellent proxy for linked event likelihood, and a combination of REEF and duration can identify the rupture style of some but not all events.

In the Southwestern Atlantic, the western boundary current known as the Malvinas Current (MC) fertilizes the outer shelf through recurrent slope‐water intrusions. Here we analyze the 2003–2024 interannual variability of satellite chlorophyll‐a around 41°S, where the inflection of the 100‐m isobath promotes these incursions. The first Empirical Orthogonal Function mode explains 43% of the variance and exhibits a spatial pattern consistent with the MC intrusion zone. Backward Lagrangian simulations reveal that low‐chlorophyll periods correspond to waters advected by the onshore MC jet, whereas high‐chlorophyll years are linked to offshore‐origin parcels likely richer in nutrients. Sea‐level anomaly composites indicate that mesoscale eddies near 40°S can block or deflect the MC, favoring intrusions onto the shelf. These results provide new quantitative evidence that variability in boundary‐current pathways strongly modulates interannual changes in chlorophyll‐a over continental shelves."

Spatially averaged mean heatwave temperatures are reduced by 1.5°C (4.8°C) in +30 days (+60 days), and the spatial area over which records were broken is reduced by 25% (81%).

However, sulfur biogeochemistry and its coupling with carbon and iron cycling remain poorly constrained in hydrothermal sediments. We investigated the effect of temperature on carbon‐sulfur‐iron diagenesis in subsurface sediments (≤370 m depth) of the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California. Sediments have a low average carbon‐to‐sulfur ratio (∼1.6), especially at hydrothermal active sites (1.3–0.67). These values are well below the typical value of 2.8 for marine sediment and could reflect carbon release and relative sulfur enrichment. Elevated temperatures accelerate the thermal breakdown of sedimentary organic matter, leading to hydrocarbon expulsion, increased dissolved organic carbon release, and ultimately carbon loss. Elemental sulfur content correlates positively with reactive iron, indicating iron oxides facilitate elemental sulfur accumulation. These results highlight the temperature effect on carbon storage and iron redox chemistry control on sulfur dynamics in hydrothermal systems."

In July–August 2022 we used an aircraft to sample aerosol near developing deep convective clouds over Magdalena Mountain, New Mexico, USA. We observed INP concentrations consistently at the upper end of those typically observed in continental air with ∼0.01–0.5 L−1 at −8°C. Vertically resolved sampling revealed a deep aerosol layer extending 3–4 km above ground level, in which INP concentrations only varied within an order of magnitude. Above this layer, low temperature INP (<−15°C) decreased, but high temperature INP (>−15°C) remained abundant, despite having been collected in air with a lower aerosol concentration. Compositional analysis of filter aerosol showed mineral dusts dominated the surface area of aerosol larger than ∼800 nm, but the activity of the mineral alone cannot account for the observed INP concentrations. We suggest that these mineral dust particles are internally mixed with ice‐nucleating biogenic components, as they would be in organic containing fertile soils, or there is an additional biogenic/biological ice‐nucleating component(s) strongly enhancing the INP population over what would be expected for mineral dust alone. Finally, ice particle measurements in rising cloud turrets at progressively colder temperatures reveal that the temperature at which we first observed ice was consistent with the measured INP spectra."

With increasing horizontal resolution, we expect improvements in the surface radiation budget because (a) synoptic variability may be better represented, (b) convective systems are better resolved, and (c) landscape heterogeneity is represented in more detail. Here, we study the performance of two km‐scale global climate models within the next generation Earth Modeling Systems (nextGEMS) project, the Integrating Forecasting System (IFS) and the ICOsahedral Non‐hydrostatic model, in producing accurate downwelling surface solar and thermal irradiances. Furthermore, we study how horizontal resolution affects mean surface irradiances as well as irradiance variability on hourly time scales. Most simulations have global annual mean biases within 4.5 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ and 7.6 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ for solar and thermal irradiance, respectively. Locally, irradiance biases with respect to station observations are up to an order of magnitude higher, with no consistent improvement as we move to higher resolution. Comparing three IFS simulations ranging from 4.4 to 28 km resolution, we indeed find that differences in mean surface irradiance are most pronounced in areas with high orographic variability, suggesting that the better resolved orography is the main pathway of resolution‐driven changes in the surface irradiance climatology. Furthermore, we find that the temporal irradiance variability improves with horizontal resolution among these three simulations, but only at sub‐daily time scales. Our findings suggest that for an accurate representation of surface irradiance climatologies, moving towards km‐scale resolution may not improve much beyond the current generation of climate models."

Recently, there have been significant concerns of human infection risks during marine beach recreations due to the elevation of seawater temperature in the United States Eastern Seaboard. This study carried out a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to estimate health risks associated with V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus infections from water ingestion during recreational activities under varying climate scenarios that predict sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the next 75 years. Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate Vibrio concentrations at specific SSTs, ingestion dose during recreational activities, and dose‐response relationships were applied to predict the probability of infection under varying exposure scenarios. The risk of Vibrio infections along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard was first estimate for the year 2020 based on measured SSTs. The same approach was applied to predict the risk in the year 2100 based on projected SSTs using two IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The results indicate that the median risks of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus from recreational activities along the Eastern Seaboard increase significantly from 2020 to 2100, with rises of up to 1,000‐fold under RCP 8.5 and up to 100‐fold under RCP 2.6. Furthermore, the estimated risks represent a conservative lower‐bound of vibrio‐related health impacts because wound infection from water contact was not included.

 Flow of Earth’s upper mantle has long been considered to occur by slow, near-continuous creep. This behaviour is observed in classical high-temperature deformation experiments and is a fundamental component of geodynamic models. The latest generation of high-resolution experiments, however, have revealed that materials ranging from metals to ice exhibit a spectrum of behaviours, termed mild-to-wild plasticity, that range from this mild continuous flow to intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate. Here we show, using nanoindentation experiments, that olivine exhibits measurable wildness, even under conditions at which its behaviour is expected to be relatively mild. Specifically, during experiments on olivine single crystals at room temperature, continuous plastic flow is punctuated by intermittent bursts of displacement with log-normally distributed magnitudes, indicating avalanches of correlated dislocation motion that account for ~8 ± 6% of the plastic strain. The framework of mild-to-wild plasticity predicts that wildness should increase with depth in Earth, with flow of the asthenosphere occurring almost entirely by wild fluctuations of deformation at the grain scale. The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides additional constraints on models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mechanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events. Flow of Earth’s upper mantle may include intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate of increasing frequency with depth, according to results of nanoindentation experiments on olivine crystals."

 Soft and conducting organic materials are ideal candidates for stretchable bioelectronics and wearable devices. Despite recent advances, our understanding of conducting polymer nanostructures and how they arise remains incomplete, given the limited high-resolution studies and molecular-level descriptions of these systems. Here, we employ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate the evolution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) morphology in solution and the resulting solid state structure in the presence of ionic and molecular additives. Our results reveal the formation of heterostructural elongated fibers consisting of PEDOT:PSS micelles in solution. Cryo-EM further reveals that additives increase the number of fibrils, in addition to inducing the formation of crystalline domains. We observe that fibril and crystalline phases in solutions act as a template for the growth of these nanostructures in the solid state. Furthermore, exploiting cryo-EM reveals the role of solid-liquid interactions in PEDOT:PSS through the imaging of PEDOT:PSS nanostructures after the hydration of thin films. Hydration leads to the swelling of heterostructural fibers while reducing the crystalline domain size. Such behavior explains the mechanical robustness of PEDOT:PSS thin films processed with various additives as well as the high electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS in applications such as organic electorchemical transistors.

 Excitons are primary elementary excitations in solids that present both fundamental interest and technological importance, showing great potential for photospintronic and quantum transduction applications. The emerging coherent collective excitations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors raise prospects for spin-exciton interactions and multifield control schemes. However, realizing the arbitrary manipulation of excitonic quantum states, while preserving the inherent dynamic and response advantages of antiferromagnetic nature remains challenging. Here we achieve bidirectional modulation of the CrSBr exciton energy via interfacial interaction-modified spin-exciton coupling in a CrSBr/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Compared with pristine CrSBr, the photoluminescence peaks in the heterostructure can exhibit blueshift and redshift corresponding to 6.1% and 8.6% of the total bandwidth, respectively. We reveal that the interfacial charge-transfer-driven magnetic coupling in the heterostructure effectively enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the exchange interaction of CrSBr, thereby stabilizing its antiferromagnetic spin configuration, suppressing interlayer electron-hole recombination, and ultimately leading to an anomalous blueshift of the exciton emission. Our findings demonstrate an approach for bidirectionally modulating exciton energy in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, which provides substantial flexibility in device design and offers an avenue for potential wavelength control in quantum information and optoelectronic technologies.

Here, the authors report that molecular interface engineering on silver electrodes enables precise regulation of key reaction intermediates for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis. 
 Manipulating the selectivity-determining step in the hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing intermediates is critical to achieving high ammonia selectivity in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Here, we propose a molecular interface engineering strategy that functionalized with thiol-anchored aromatic ligands to regulate the interfacial binding affinity and activation of key nitrogen-containing intermediates on silver nanocube surfaces. By systematically varying the electronic properties of the substituents, we identify 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde as the most effective ligand, increasing the ammonia Faradaic efficiency from 50.8% to 98.9% and achieving a yield rate of 14,366.1 μg h–1 cmgeo–2 at –0.63 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical simulations further reveal that 4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde modification promotes the activation of weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules and accelerates the hydrogenation of *HNO intermediates. This targeted modulation of interfacial binding affinity offers an effective strategy for selectivity control in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. The enhanced performance is further validated in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyser, underscoring the practical viability of this molecular design strategy for selective nitrate conversion. Controlling reaction selectivity in complex multistep electrochemical transformations remains a major challenge.

Here, the authors use a denoising diffusion model to predict high-fidelity impedance spectrum from short signals, beating existing methods and releasing large open datasets. 
 Online acquisition of polarization kinetics data from impedance spectrum is critical for fault diagnosis and health assessment of fuel cells to overcome lifetime bottleneck, but it is technically challenging due to stringent measurement requirements and complex evolution under different operating conditions. To address this, we propose an impedance spectrum prediction method based on the denoising diffusion implicit model, which requires only collectable short time-domain profiles and can generate high-fidelity impedance spectrum through a stepwise denoising process. To validate our method, we performed extensive comparative impedance tests under various operating conditions for fuel cells with different power levels, constructing four datasets comprising over 5700 samples in total. Through performance evaluation experiments, robustness tests, and transfer learning experiments, our proposed method has demonstrated satisfactory performance and outperforms existing methods by down to 37.3% on median mean absolute percentage error. As a useful resource, we have released the trained model and the largest datasets of impedance spectrum for fuel cells to date. Reliable fuel cell monitoring needs rapid access to impedance.

 Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) technology plays an important role in protein structure and protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies. However, there are serious shortcomings in the data processing and analysis methods of XL-MS that limit its ability to perform in-depth analysis. Here, we built a deep learning-based XL-MS versatile platform, XL-MSDigger, to address the bottlenecks of XL-MS technology. The foundation of this platform is a deep learning-based multidimensional information prediction tool, Deep4D-XL, for cross-linked peptides. This tool is capable of accurately predicting retention time, collisional cross-section, and fragment ion intensity information of cross-linked peptides. Through the multidimensional information prediction, we develop rescoring algorithms and workflows for DDA and DIA analysis data, which improve the coverage of DDA-based XL-MS identification, and realize the evaluation of false discovery rate and high-reliability identification of DIA-based XL-MS analysis. In addition, XL-MSDigger enables DIA-based XL-MS analysis using predicted spectral libraries, allowing improved detection of protein–protein interactions in targeted or moderate-scale interaction analyses. We believe that the XL-MSDigger platform can be widely used as a general solution to enhance the performance of XL-MS analysis.

A study now provides an intelligent strategy to enable early warning of fouling events. 
 Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are widely implemented in many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), contributing to a sustainable urban water cycle. However, they are often challenged by the problem of membrane fouling. Developing tools capable of monitoring and providing early warning of fouling events is therefore essential to maintain the operational stability of MBRs. Here we propose a spectral sensing empowered machine learning strategy for prediction and providing early warning of fouling events and validate it in a full-scale MBR during long-term operation. Specifically, integrated with ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectral fingerprints that can sensibly profile the key molecular structures responsible for fouling, a data–knowledge codriven machine learning model was established. The model can accurately (R2 > 0.80) predict fouling tendency within the next 5‒7 days, which is superior to purely data-driven learning. Spectral fingerprints contributed 17‒30% of interpretability across models, and process conditions and other membrane/foulant material descriptors explained the rest. By exploring the spectral fingerprints of specific processes, our strategy could also be generalized to various WWTPs, offering an intelligent solution (for example, with the aid of spectral early warning) to achieve stable operation of WWTPs and ultimately contribute to a cleaner environment.

 Clean cooking fuel interventions can substantially advance Sustainable Development Goals related to health, poverty, gender equality and (possibly) climate change. Here we systematically review gender roles within cookstove randomized control trials (RCTs) with respect to (1) health and exposure; (2) time, labour, finance and behaviour; (3) climate; and (4) the research activities. We focus on RCTs because public health scholarship considers RCTs, despite limitations, to provide the highest-quality evidence to guide policy and widescale programming. Across our 123 included studies, women are frequently targeted but then not acknowledged in time, labour, finances and even health outcomes. Acknowledgement of gender norms is scarce. Using WHO gender-responsiveness categories, we find that 37% of studies were gender-unequal or gender-unaware. Women are often monitored only as proxies for their unborn children, our category of gender-unaware but sex-aware (26%). Twenty-nine percent are gender-sensitive, with only 6% gender-specific and two gender-transformative studies. We present recommendations for the field to shift to more gender-sensitive research designs, without which the field risks leaning into existing inequalities and basing future interventions on spuriously gender-neutral premises.

Barrett,Mechanisms driving altitude- and latitude-dependent air quality variations from high-altitude NO<sub>x</sub> emissions,"Mechanisms driving altitude- and latitude-dependent air quality variations from high-altitude NO<sub>x</sub> emissions 
 The environmental impact of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions varies with emission altitude and latitude. NOx emissions from subsonic aviation (9-12 km) contribute to net global ozone formation, whereas those from supersonic aircraft (above 14 km) lead to net global ozone depletion. However, the effects of NOx emission altitude on surface air quality remain understudied. We evaluate how NOx emissions at different altitudes (8–22 km) and latitudes influence near-surface concentrations of two known air pollutants: ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Using the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, we find that NOx emissions of 1 Tg N yr−1 at 8–10 km (30–60°N) increase surface ozone (population-weighted) by 0.52 ppb and surface PM2.5 by 35 ng m−3, whereas emissions at 20–22 km reduce surface ozone by 1.73 ppb and increase surface PM2.5 by 310 ng m−3; this is nine times the PM2.5 increase per unit NOx from lower-altitude emissions. These effects stem from altitude-dependent mechanisms: at lower altitudes typical of subsonic aviation, NOx emissions increase upper tropospheric ozone which leads to enhanced surface ozone and nitrate aerosol. However, when emitted at higher altitudes NOx instead depletes ozone, permitting more ultraviolet light to reach the troposphere which boosts OH production and accelerates production of sulfate aerosol while destroying near-surface ozone. Our findings suggest that NOx emissions from high-altitude sources, including supersonic aircraft may not only contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion but also cause larger changes (albeit of mixed sign) in surface air quality than subsonic aviation per unit of NOx emitted."

 Hydropower expansion creates tension between renewable energy goals and freshwater ecosystem health. However, the global impacts of dams across the full spectrum of freshwater biodiversity remain poorly quantified. Here, we combine remote sensing and global threatened species datasets to assess dam-related risk patterns for fish, mollusks, mammals, odonates, and amphibians. We show that threatened freshwater species are consistently more common near dams than elsewhere, with mammals showing the highest exposure. Most species whose risk status changed between 1996 and 2022 shifted toward higher threat levels in dam-influenced areas affected by habitat loss and reduced river connectivity. Planned future dams, concentrated in Global South countries, may further elevate extinction risk, particularly for critically endangered fish. These findings support sustainable planning that balances energy development with freshwater conservation.

 With increasing frequency and intensity under global climate change, storms, particularly typhoons, have become critical drivers reshaping coastal morphology. However, researches capturing the full morphodynamic sequence, especially the pre-landfall phase, remain scarce due to the challenges of field observations under extreme conditions. To address this, continuous observations were conducted throughout the Typhoon Fung-wong on the Yangtze Estuary intertidal flat. Here we found that, the loose and easily erodible surface layer of the intertidal mudflat was primarily eroded prior to typhoon landfall, exposing stiff, well-consolidated subsurface sediments. Subsequently, bed-level change remained minimal during peak hydrodynamics at typhoon landfall, showing that vertical sediment properties modulate morphodynamic responses. The decade-long continuous observations at the Sheshan Station in the Yangtze Estuary confirmed this severe pre-landfall erosion which also appears common across both China and the United States. This highlights the importance of pre-landfall erosion and sediment stratification in storm-driven coastal change prediction and management.

 Climate change intensifies urban heat stress, creating urgent challenges for sustainable mobility. Here we analyzed 4068 individuals’ heat adaptation behaviors across different transportation modes in Beijing. Our findings, derived from a causal mediation framework, suggest that e-bikes offer superior climate resilience compared to traditional cycling and walking. E-bike users demonstrated strong overall adaptation and adopted significant protective measures, contrasting with pedestrians and cyclists who both showed significant reductions in mobility. Demographic analysis revealed female users exhibited particularly strong adaptation responses, while the elderly showed concerning gaps in adaptation capacity across all transportation modes. Urban design features further influenced adaptation, with green spaces helping to sustain mobility.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are persistent coastal pollutants, yet the ecological and genomic strategies governing the persistence and function of degraders under in-situ stress remain elusive. Here we decode these adaptive mechanisms using metagenomics and cultivation in the Pearl River Estuary, integrated with global comparative analyses. We reveal a multi-level adaptive strategy where high PAH stress drives ecological network densification and selectively enriches the thermodynamically favorable catechol ortho-cleavage pathway. Crucially, we elucidate a conserved genomic “division of labor”, where chromosomes encode stable upstream activation steps, while plasmids serve as specialized, mobile reservoirs for downstream central aromatic processing. This plasmid-mediated functional partitioning is globally conserved across diverse coastal ecosystems, although the reliance on mobile vectors is dynamically tuned by environmental stability. Collectively, these findings unveil a holistic adaptive framework that integrates ecological cooperation with genomic partitioning, highlighting a plasmid-mediated “plug-and-play” mechanism that underpins microbial resilience and guides precision bioremediation.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their halogenated derivatives (XPAHs) are emerging persistent organic pollutants with potential carcinogenicity. Their occurrence in indoor environments remains largely unexplored. We measured 26 PAHs and 40 XPAHs in indoor air and house dust from 45 residences in Toyama, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa, Japan (2022–2024). At least one XPAH was detected at all sites, with concentrations 103–104 times lower than PAHs but with similar size distributions and compositions, suggesting analogous atmospheric behavior. Homes using unventilated wood stoves exhibited indoor/outdoor ratios >10 for high-molecular-weight PAHs, notably benzo[a]pyrene, indicating strong indoor sources. Cancer risk assessment showed inhalation as the dominant exposure pathway, with 95th percentile incremental lifetime cancer risk exceeding 1 × 10−6 in the investigated residences in Toyama, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa, Japan, surpassing safety thresholds. These results demonstrate that indoor exposure to PAHs and XPAHs may pose non-negligible health risks and underscore the need for mitigation strategies, such as PM2.5 reduction, to protect public health."

 The ability of an active living wall (ALW) to capture indoor air pollutants was studied. Five different species (Spathiphyllum wallisii, Tradescantia zebrina, Philodendron scandens, Ficus pumila and Chlorophytum comosum) were assessed. The experiments were performed inside a closed glass chamber for each species separately. Gas pollutants (NO2 and SO2) and volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde, acetone, n-hexane and n-heptane) were introduced into the chamber monitoring concentration changes. High values of the Pollutant Reduction (PR%) indicator were recorded after releasing pollutants in the chamber, especially for CH2O and SO2. After 24 h, PR% in the chamber ranged 96-98% for all the plant species studied. The ALW was more efficient in removing CH2O and NO2 than other air contaminants. In addition, differences in Differential Reduction Efficiency (DRE%) indicator were observed among plant species depending on the pollutant considered. After 15 min from the injection of TVOCs, a reduction of 24-40% was achieved with all plant species but S. wallisii showed greater DRE for NO2, with 60% reduction in the first hour of exposure. The presented data demonstrates the effectiveness of active living wall systems for improving indoor air quality."
