Fire represents a mainstay for rural communities managing tropical landscapes, but these can lead to uncontrolled ‘wild’ fires that pose a major threat to people and the ecosystem, leading to a cycle of increased susceptibility to fire and increased vulnerability of people and peat ecosystem to future fires. Using an exposure-sensitivity-adaptive capacity framework, we constructed indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of peatlands and communities to fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) and used these indicators to calculate the social and ecological vulnerability of peatlands and communities to fires. We operationalized this framework and defined spatial indicators which we used to construct three indices of vulnerability (ecological vulnerability, social vulnerability of villages to burning, and social vulnerability of villages to smoke-haze). Our assessment found peatlands with high ecological vulnerability on eastern Sumatra (Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra), southern Kalimantan (Central and South Kalimantan), and East Kalimantan. Majority of these provinces overlapped with sites of high social vulnerability for burning (North Sumatra, Riau, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan) and high social vulnerability for smoke-haze (Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan). As districts play an important role in land use decisions and fire mitigation efforts, we identified the top six districts that had high numbers of villages with high ecological and social vulnerability scores. Hotspot analyses showed that ecological vulnerability hotspots were co-located with social vulnerability hotspots but clusters of social vulnerability hotspots for burning did not necessarily overlap with social vulnerability hotspots for smoke-haze. Our vulnerability assessment of peatlands and villages is the foundation for an important tool for policymakers at multiple governance levels to identify high ecological and social vulnerability to peatland fires and channel aid and mitigation efforts where they are most needed."

Arctic winter climate and cryosphere conditions are changing towards more frequent mild spells. Precipitation is often falling as rain, followed by the formation of basal ice on frozen ground, particularly in Gulf Stream-influenced climates as in Svalbard. Such conditions encapsulate tundra plants in ice for several months, which is assumed to reduce land surface greenness due to plant damage. We investigated whether extensive basal ice (presence and thickness) and increased summer temperatures (growing degree days (GDD)) from in-situ time series impact satellite-derived land surface greenness. We measured greenness as the magnitude and timing of growing season maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our study covers Svalbard from 2013 to 2023, a decade with record breaking summer temperatures and many icy winters. We found lower maximum NDVI values when basal ice was present only at higher elevations (Estimated effect size: −0.0119, 95% CI: −0.0207 to −0.0031). We further found an eight-day advance in the timing of maximum NDVI (Estimated effect size: −7.56, 95% CI: −14.81 to −0.31) with basal ice presence in the region that was characterized by spatially and temporally extensive basal ice. Ice thickness, in contrast to presence, or GDD did not influence the magnitude or timing of maximum NDVI. Taken together, our findings indicate that basal ice presence could become a driver of vegetation change in the High Arctic as climatic extremes intensify, which could alter tundra greenness over larger landscapes and ultimately influence Arctic food webs."

A fairness framework for data-driven weather forecasting,"As data-driven weather forecasting models increasingly come in operational use, questions of fairness and equitable access to forecast improvements are gaining urgency. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for evaluating outcome-based fairness in global data-driven forecasts, drawing on principles from the algorithmic fairness literature. Specifically, we focus on two criteria: statistical parity (i.e. comparable improvements across protected groups) and conditional independence (i.e. no dependence of improvements on protected variables). Using ECMWF’s AIFS model as a case study and IFS HRES as a baseline, we assess whether forecast improvements are equitably distributed across different income groups and population densities. We find that although AIFS provides substantial overall improvements in forecast skill, these gains are unevenly distributed: on average, wealthier and more densely populated areas are more likely to experience forecast improvements, violating group fairness and conditional independence criteria. We conclude by discussing how fairness-aware loss functions could be incorporated into data-driven weather forecasting systems and argue for a broader integration of fairness considerations into model development and evaluation."

In particular, our understanding of how these conditions are related to reservoir function, size, location, climate, and socio-economic context remains limited. Here, we assess the storage conditions of 6634 global reservoirs during major river basin-scale droughts using normalized storage (NS; storage-to-capacity ratio). River basin-scale drought spells were identified using a 6 month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during 1999–2018. Our results showed that reservoirs in Asia had the lowest NS levels during droughts compared to other continents. Reservoirs in Africa and Asia exhibited the largest fluctuations, with median NS fluctuations of 34% and 37%, respectively. Large capacity reservoirs demonstrated greater resilience, whereas smaller reservoirs fluctuated more. Irrigation reservoirs had the lowest NS levels (49%) and the greatest NS fluctuations (33%). Reservoirs in dry climate remained the least filled, with irrigation reservoirs consistently showing the largest fluctuations across all climate zones. We found that reservoirs located in economically stronger countries tend to maintain higher storage levels (61% vs. 46%) and lower fluctuations (23% vs. 33%) during droughts. Furthermore, almost 40% of all reservoirs exhibited a significant (p-value < 0.05) correlation between NS and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), highlighting the association between large-scale climate variability and reservoir storage dynamics. Overall, our study provides valuable observational insights that can guide targeted management strategies and contribute to sustainable, long-term water governance."

However, due to methodological challenges, field measurements of N2 emissions remain rare, leaving denitrification losses poorly characterised across most cropping systems and comprehensive N budgets lacking. This constrains parameterization and validation of biogeochemical models, impeding efforts to forecast denitrification losses under changing conditions and design effective mitigation strategies. This study (i) reviewed the current literature on field-based N2 measurements, (ii) tested the ability of five different models to accurately simulate denitrification losses, and (iii) simulated denitrification losses from agricultural soils in Germany using gridded and point-based modelling frameworks. Results show that field studies suitable for model calibration remain scarce and mostly limited to temperate systems. Simulated cumulative N2 emissions varied widely between models, ranging from 0.89 to 6.07 kg N ha−1, far below the observed N2 emissions of 21 ± 3 kg N ha−1. The ratio of N2O to (N2O + N2) emitted ( ), a key determinant of the climate impact of denitrification, was not only strongly overestimated by all models but also exhibited considerable variations, ranging from 0.056 to 0.707, compared to the measured ratio of 0.006. Models also failed to capture expected responses of to environmental drivers. For Germany, simulated average N2 emissions from agricultural soils ranged from 1.7 to 14.5 kg N ha−1yr−1, with corresponding ratios ranging from 0.18 to 0.59. Spatial patterns of emissions also differed significantly across modelling frameworks, reflecting large structural uncertainties. These findings highlight that both N2 emissions and ratios remain poorly represented in current models, severely limiting our ability to establish reliable N budgets and develop targeted N management strategies. Coordinated advancements in field-based measurements and modelling are urgently needed to improve the representation of denitrification in biogeochemical models."

Previous studies have highlighted its potential and the role of improve management practice, but many relied on static land-use assumptions or limited spatial data, overlooking socio-economic and climate-driven changes that affect land availability. This study assessed the global SOC sequestration potential of cropland and bioenergy land under three land-use pathways: business as-usual (BAU), a sustainable food system (FOOD), and a 2 °C climate target (2°). Our results show that both climate and food policies may influence SOC sequestration through land-use changes. Under the 2 °C scenario, large-scale expansion of bioenergy crops could increase SOC stocks by about 7% (∼9 Gt CO2). In contrast, the FOOD scenario achieves only modest SOC gains, slightly lower than BAU (−1.59 Gt CO₂). This because dietary shifts reduce pasture demand but do not significantly change cropland area, and bioenergy deployment is limited. While plant-based diets improve food system efficiency and reduce emissions, their SOC benefits are indirect and depend on how freed-up land is used for mitigation, such as afforestation or bioenergy production. Regions with significant bioenergy expansion—such as Latin America, reforming economies, and OECD/EU countries—show the highest SOC gains. Regions with large cropland areas, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, contribute 70% of the global potential. Moreover substantial SOC potential can be realized at a cost below $100 per ton of CO₂, highlighting SOC sequestration as a feasible and economically viable climate mitigation strategy. Our study findings underscore the trade-offs between food system transformation, land-use efficiency, and carbon storage, and emphasize that climate policies promoting bioenergy expansion can achieve substantial SOC gains, while dietary policies alone have limited impact if without strategic land management."

This study introduces the concept of an airshed, as a reduced-complexity, data-driven approach, to quantify transboundary influences and attribute responsibility for premature deaths across jurisdictional boundaries. Applied to PM2.5 concentrations in the contiguous U.S., the airshed approach reveals that over half the states are net exporters of annual premature deaths, while roughly one third have zero net cross-state contribution. Although premature mortality has declined by ∼35% from 1998 to 2022, the cross-state contribution to premature mortality has remained steady at 40% nationally. This approach highlights the unequal distribution of both health risk and responsibility across state lines. The findings underscore the need for further regulatory strategies and cooperative mechanisms to address interstate air pollution."

Moose have two main strategies for thermal regulation: shifting activity patterns and selecting habitat that provides thermal refuge. In this study, we compared how moose use these two strategies in response to winter temperature across their latitudinal range. First, we used hidden Markov models to delineate encamped and traveling movement states for five populations of global positioning system-collared moose in relation to time of day, temperature, and snow depth. Next, we used step-selection functions to determine influential covariates of encamped locations. As air temperatures and snow depths increased, moose from all populations were more likely to remain in an encamped, relatively stationary state. All moose became less diurnal and more nocturnal at high temperatures, although the magnitude of changes in activity varied by population. Encamped northern moose selected shrubby habitat that presents foraging opportunities, whereas encamped southern moose selected for coniferous forest that provides poor forage but offers shade in southern regions. The only moose population to select for lower temperatures also experienced the warmest winter on record during our study period, which may explain this population’s low overall activity rates. Our results indicate that moose along their southern range extent are responding to elevated mid-winter temperatures by initially altering activity patterns and subsequently selecting for potential thermal refugia at the expense of foraging habitat, while northern moose were unlikely to shift habitat selection based on temperature unless faced with an anomalously warm winter. As climate change is implicated in range contraction and population declines, our findings suggest that high winter temperatures may be causing moose to not only reduce overall activity but also to forgo preferred foraging habitat in favor of prioritizing thermal refuge, thus forcing a trade-off between nutrition and thermoregulation."

Influenced by global change factors like climate change and intensified land use, especially urbanization and agriculture, these blooms are expected to become more common worldwide. Despite extensive research on bloom dynamics, mechanisms, and toxicity (notably of cyanobacteria), there is no comprehensive synthesis of their effects on ecosystem services. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of 48 studies globally documenting the impacts of phytoplankton blooms on key ecosystem services: fisheries, drinking water supply, and recreation. In fisheries, blooms cause significant losses primarily through fish mortality and habitat degradation, with toxins also reducing fish activity. Drinking water services experience serious disruptions, sometimes requiring costly treatment upgrades, while consumer complaints about taste and odor are common. Recreational activities suffer from swimming bans, decreased site attractiveness, and health risks. Toxic cyanobacterial blooms were the most frequently reported and damaging, though non-toxic algal blooms also cause notable problems. While some studies mention potential benefits of non-toxic blooms, these are limited and highly context-dependent. Our review also underscores the value of including grey literature alongside peer-reviewed studies to capture a fuller range of bloom impacts. Finally, we compiled cost estimates from various contexts, providing a benchmark for assessing the economic burden of phytoplankton blooms. The diversity and severity of impacts call for proactive, adaptive management strategies to mitigate disruptions and safeguard ecosystem services in lakes and reservoirs facing growing bloom pressures."

Despite significant growth in total production, it fails to ensure food security for all, drives biodiversity decline, and majorly contributes to climate change. Research on agrifood-system burdens often focusses on the national level and isolated burdens, ignoring their systemic complexity. We address this knowledge gap by combining global subnational datasets proxying four key dimensions of agrifood-system burdens: environmental footprint, climate change, income poverty, and malnutrition. We map global hotspots of co-occurring agrifood-system burdens for 2017. We overlay these with data on ambient population counts, agricultural areas, farm size distributions, and lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples to identify spatial correspondence between people in vulnerable contexts and food production regions facing these burdens. We further assess countries’ relative burden against their inequality and governance indicators. Burden hotspots occupy many regions worldwide, especially in low-income, (sub)tropical regions. Single burdens occupy regions harbouring about 5 billion people (∼66% of the global population) and 1.8 billion ha of agricultural lands (∼40%), while multiple burdens occupy regions with about 1.9 billion people and 470 million ha agricultural lands. Environmental footprint is the strongest contributor to these burden profiles. Regions with traditionally marginalised communities (i.e. small-scale farmers and Indigenous peoples) disproportionally face multiple burdens. Agrifood-system burdens are more prevalent in countries with higher economic inequality and poorer governance. Burden profiles vary substantially within and between countries, necessitating regionalised and context-specific policies for effective, bundled, and targeted solutions. Addressing agrifood-system burdens can also synergise with tackling other current global challenges, like biodiversity loss and environmental justice."

Kanji,Aviation soot interactions with natural cirrus clouds are unlikely to have a significant impact on global climate,"The effective radiative forcing due to the effect of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds is likely very small, thus confirming most previous studies, but for the first time with the support of laboratory measurements specifically targeting aviation soot and its ice nucleation ability. 
 The impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds is considered the most uncertain among the climate impacts of the aviation sector. In this study, a global aerosol-climate model equipped with a cirrus parametrisation is applied to quantify the impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds and its resulting climate effect. For the first time, the cirrus parametrisation in the model is driven by novel laboratory measurements specifically targeting the ice nucleation ability of aviation soot, thus enabling an experimentally-constrained estimate of the aviation-soot cirrus effect. The results indicate no statistically significant impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds, with an effective radiative forcing of −6.9 ± 29.8 mW m−2 (95 % confidence interval). Sensitivity simulations conducted to investigate the role of other ice nucleating particles (INPs) competing with aviation soot for ice supersaturation in the cirrus regime (soot from sources other than aviation, mineral dust and ammonium sulphate) further show that the impact of aviation soot remains statistically insignificant also when the impact of these other INPs on cirrus is reduced in the model. Acknowledging that the complexity of the soot cirrus interaction is associated with uncertainties, the model results supported by dedicated laboratory measurements suggest that the climate impact due to the aviation soot cirrus effect is likely negligible with no statistical significance."

Based on detailed air measurements and modeling, the research shows these gases strongly influence radicals and ozone formation. Overlooking them may lead to ineffective policies. The findings highlight the need for better measurement of these gases to improve pollution forecasts and support smarter air quality strategies. 
 Photochemical ozone (O3) pollution remains a persistent environmental challenge, and growing evidence highlights the critical role of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) in photochemical processes. However, comprehensive and quantitative measurements of OVOCs remain limited. This study investigates the impact of OVOCs on O3 formation mechanisms and radical budgets by intergrating high-resolution field measurements from a subtropical coastal region in South China with observation-based photochemical modeling. 63 OVOC species were measured by a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), and accounted for 72 %–77 % of total VOC concentrations. The O3-precusor relationship analysis revealed a transition regime for O3 formation and high sensitivity to OVOCs. OVOC-related reactions, including OVOC photolysis, OVOC oxidation by OH and NO3 radicals, contributed approximately 36 %–73 % to daytime production rates of HO2 and RO2 radicals. Model simulations without comprehensive consideration of OVOCs would significantly underestimate daytime production rates of O3 and ROx radicals by 41 %–48 %, and shift the diagnosis of O3 formation from a transition regime to a VOC-limited regime, leading to biased policy recommendations and potentially ineffective control strategies. These findings underscore the critical role of OVOCs in atmospheric photochemistry and highlight the urgent need for comprehensive OVOC quantification to improve OVOC-inclusive model frameworks. Such improvements are essential for accurately characterizing O3-precursor relationships and for developing effective and sustainable strategies to mitigate regional O3 pollution."

Our shipboard measurements highlight the preferential formation of N-containing secondary water-soluble OAs associated with the predominant diatoms including ice algae during the bloom after sea ice melting/retreat in the subarctic ocean. 
 The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the most biologically productive regions, where primary production during spring phytoplankton blooms after sea ice melting/retreat has the potential to contribute to the sea-to-air emission flux of atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs). To elucidate the effect of oceanic biological activity during blooms on the formation process of OAs, aerosol samples and surface seawater were collected during the bloom period of April 2021. Organic matter (OM) was the dominant component of submicrometer aerosols during both the bloom (53 ± 16 %) and bloom-decay periods (44 ± 12 %), with OM being highly water-soluble during the bloom. Stable carbon isotope ratios of aerosol organic carbon (OC) showed that 73 %–82 % of the observed aerosols were of marine origin. Relations between water-soluble OC (WSOC) and molecular tracers suggested that aerosol WSOC of marine origin was likely affected by secondary formation from precursors such as α-pinene and DMS-relevant compounds rather than primary emissions of sea spray aerosols. The amounts of water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) in aerosol and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in seawater during the bloom were larger than those during bloom-decay period, suggesting the preferential formation of N-containing water-soluble OAs of marine origin during the bloom. The increase in the amount of DON during the bloom was likely associated with the predominant diatoms, Thalassiosira spp. and Fragilariopsis spp. This study highlights the significant contribution of the secondary formation of marine biogenic OAs with increased N-containing components during the bloom after sea ice melting/retreat in the subarctic ocean."

Advanced techniques revealed key intermediates (hydroxyl peroxyamines, amino hydroperoxides) and novel pathways, establishing a quantitative framework linking molecular processes to aerosol aging for atmospheric chemistry models. 
 Atmospheric amines critically contribute to secondary aerosols formation via heterogeneous reactions, yet the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneous amination chemistry of aerosols remain unclear. Here, we utilize an integrated tandem flow-tube system coupled with online ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to elucidate the amination chemistry of ethylamine (EA) with representative organic aerosol components, including C20–C54 secondary ozonides (SOZs), C17–C27 carboxylic acids, and aldehydes. Our experiments provide evidence for the formation of four key intermediates: hydroxyl peroxyamines, amino hydroperoxides, peroxyamines, and amino ethers, which mediate SOZs conversion to hydroxyimines, amides, and imines. Furthermore, dihydroxylamines and hydroxylamines are identified as characteristic intermediates in carboxylic acids and aldehydes amination. Quantitative heterogeneous reactivity measurements (Δγeff) reveal that SOZs exhibit a pronounced inverse dependence on carbon chain length, e.g., C21 SOZ (Δγeff = 1.0 × 10−4) > C49 SOZ (Δγeff = 5.7 × 10−6), with consistently lower reactivity than acids and aldehydes, e.g., C17 acid (Δγeff = 2.3 × 10−4). The amination mechanism of SOZs is initiated by EA addition, followed by either hydroxyl peroxyamines-mediated dehydration yielding hydroxyimines and amides, or amino hydroperoxides-driven H2O2 elimination forming imines. For carboxylic acids and aldehydes, EA addition leads to dihydroxylamines and hydroxylamines formation, which subsequently dehydrate to produce amides and imines. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding amine-driven aerosol aging processes that affects atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate systems."

Ice crystals were grown under conditions that mimic cirrus clouds in the presence of carbonyl vapors. Ice and gas samples were collected and analyzed to calculate ice uptake coefficients for 14 carbonyls at different temperatures. This revealed an inverse relationship between uptake and temperature. Vapor pressure and molar mass were found to be the most significant factors in uptake. 
 Carbonyls are highly relevant atmospheric constituents that influence tropospheric photochemistry and oxidative capacity. They can be removed from the upper troposphere via ice phase deposition scavenging. The gas-volume uptake coefficients for 14 different carbonyl compounds were determined using a flowtube apparatus. Ice crystals were grown from vapor deposition in the presence of gas phase carbonyls at −20, −30, and −40 °C. Using van't Hoff analysis, the entropy and enthalpy of uptake were determined. An inverse relationship between uptake coefficients and temperature was observed for all species except methyl vinyl ketone. A linear correlation between ΔS and ΔH arose which was statistically validated and determined with 99 % confidence to not be a statistical artifact. This compensation behavior could be an indication of a surface liquid layer or quasi-liquid layer behavior involved in the uptake process and could also indicate a single dominant influence on a compound's uptake. The most significant physicochemical properties correlated with uptake were identified to be vapor pressure and molar mass, which indicate that smaller compounds with higher vapor pressures are more readily taken into the ice phase. The volume uptake coefficients observed here are below the 10 mol m−3 Pa−1 threshold given by Crutzen and Lawrence (2000) to be considered a substantial atmospheric removal process."

We show that they drive changes to one-way flight times of over an hour and to round-trip flight times by several minutes per flight. They thus cause variability in total CO2 emissions of 10s of kT/month and financial cost of millions of US dollars/month over the full transatlantic fleet. 
 Transatlantic aviation is a major industry and even small flight time changes have major economic and environmental implications. While our ability to optimise these flights for background wind variations at day-to-day scales is excellent, at the longer timescales needed for sustainability planning and fuel cost hedging these capabilities are more limited. Here, we quantify the association between four climate indices (the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and solar irradiance) and transatlantic flight times using thirty years of commercial flight data. This allows us to identify whether these indices can be used to identify systematic flight time shifts. We find that ENSO and the NAO are associated with statistically-significant changes in one-way flight times of up to 82.2 ± 3.5 min, and changes in round-trip times of 4.8 ± 0.5 and 4.0 ± 0.8 min respectively, while the QBO and TSI have weaker but significant effects. Together, these indices plus a linear trend explain up to 27 % of variation depending on season and direction, and are associated with month-to-month fuel cost & CO2 emission variations of up to 27MUSD & 120 kT for one-way trips and USD 5 million  & 23 kT for round trips. We also show that westward, round-trip and non-winter-eastward flight times have increased by several minutes per decade since the 1990s. Our results provide the first observational quantitative basis for aviation fuel and carbon cost management at monthly and longer timescales."

Overall, wind speeds and sea surface temperature indeed play critical roles in the regulation of aerosol production and diffusion processes, while the sea–air temperature difference is found to be the most vital factor related to the variations of marine aerosol distributions. 
 Marine aerosols critically influence Earth's radiation budget and climate dynamics through their spatial distributions and composition due to their production and transport processes. However, in situ observational datasets remain limited, particularly in the South China Sea (SCS). Based on our comprehensive shipborne measurements, this study presents a quantitative analysis of marine aerosol distributions and compositional variations between the offshore and pelagic regions over the SCS. Our data demonstrate a 120 % increase in offshore aerosol number concentrations (NCs, Dp < 10.37 µm) relative to pelagic baselines, featuring 120 % higher accumulation-mode particles (Dp ≤ 1.981 µm) and 70 % higher coarse-mode particles (1.981 µm < Dp < 10.37 µm), quantitatively confirming continental transport affects spatial distribution of marine aerosols. In contrast, in the pelagic regions, marine aerosols are virtually unaffected by continental source and distinctly represent characteristics of the local production. Meteorological analyses identified wind speed (WS) and sea surface temperature (SST) as primary regulators of NC. However, observed NC variations at fixed WS and SST values suggest additional controlling factors. We demonstrate that sea-air temperature differentials (SST-T2 m) exhibit a stronger correlation (r=-0.82, p < 0.01) with NC than the other meteorological parameters, where increased SST-T2 m led to decreased marine aerosol production. This temperature gradient effect drives pronounced diurnal NC variations, with maximum differences of 35 % observed between daytime, nighttime, and transition periods. These findings provide concrete evidence for the spatial and diurnal variability in marine aerosol distributions over the SCS, thereby further improving understanding of marine aerosol transport and production."

Measurements were taken during two periods in the dry season with different environmental conditions. This data improves our understanding of how ammonia behaves in forests under tropical climates and helps refine models that estimate nitrogen deposition and assess its impact across East Asia. 
 Ammonia (NH3) is a significant contributor to total nitrogen deposition in East Asia. However, process-based observations that specifically focus on the air–surface exchange of NH3 remain limited in this region, especially in Southeast Asia. To clarify the bi-directional exchange process of NH3 under tropical climatic conditions, we present the first observations of NH3 exchange flux over a tropical dry deciduous forest in Thailand during two periods with different canopy and meteorological conditions in the dry season using the aerodynamic gradient method. NH3 concentrations exhibited strong positive correlations with air temperature and negative correlations with wind speed during the leafy period. However, there was no clear correlation between concentrations and meteorological elements during the leafless period. Measured NH3 fluxes fell within the ranges presented in recent studies, with a weighted mean and standard deviation of 0.148 ± 0.240 µg m−2 s−1, and consistently larger during daytime. During the dry season, the tropical dry deciduous forest acted as an emission source of NH3. Across both observation periods, NH3 emissions were governed by air temperature, relative humidity, friction velocity, and solar radiation. While no clear difference in fluxes magnitude was observed between the leafy (0.140 ± 0.240 µg m−2 s−1) and the leafless (0.158 ± 0.239 µg m−2 s−1) periods, the main source of NH3 emission in the tropical dry deciduous forest probably shifted dynamically from stomata to leaf litter due to the changes in meteorological, canopy, and forest floor conditions."

Sea breezes largely confine pollutants below 300 m, while typhoons elevate pollution levels at mid-upper altitudes. These findings highlight that tropical coastal sea breezes and typhoons threaten air quality, necessitating targeted pollution mitigation policies. 
 Atmospheric pollutants in island and coastal environments are profoundly modulated by sea breezes (SB) and typhoons. Understanding the characteristics of pollutants and their photochemical indicators under different airflow regimes is crucial for effective pollution control. Utilizing Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and a sea-land breeze objective identification algorithm, we reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns in NO2, HCHO, CHOCHO, and associated photochemistry under varying airflow patterns in a rural coastal area of Hainan, China during the summer of 2024. Non-sea breeze days (NSBDs) showed higher pollutant levels with broader vertical distribution range under conducive meteorological conditions. Conversely, on sea breeze days (SBDs), SB limits pollutant dispersion and its cooling effect suppresses ozone formation. Furthermore, SB also enhances transport of NO2 and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) below 300 m, influencing ozone formation sensitivity (OFS) throughout SB phases. Typhoons effectively scavenge pollutants via strong winds and precipitation but also facilitate mid-to-high altitude BVOC transport and vertical dispersion of surface pollutants. Photochemical indicator analysis (HCHO/NO2 [FNR] and CHOCHO/NO2 [GNR]) indicates that the VOC-limited regimes persist even at high altitudes during typhoons. Elevated FNR and GNR thresholds suggest that existing OFS classification thresholds are inadequate for low-NO2 tropical coastal rural areas, underscoring the need for region-specific assessments. Given the BVOC-dominated environment and additional inputs from SB and typhoons, GNR proves more reliable than FNR for OFS determination. This study emphasizes the necessity of integrating local meteorology and environment conditions in O3 control strategies, providing a scientific basis for pollution mitigation in tropical coastal regions prone to SB and typhoons."

This tropical air can get trapped in high-pressure areas at high latitudes after the polar vortex breaks down. In this study, remote sensing instruments are used to observe the course of such streamers by measuring the scattered solar radiation. Aerosols get transported to high latitudes at an altitude of about 25–35 km, increasing the aerosol mass there significantly. 
 When the polar vortex meanders and shifts towards the equator, air masses from the tropics and subtropics can be transported towards the pole in so-called tropical-subtropical streamers. These large-scale structures are areas of low potential vorticity and high pressure, containing dry air with high ozone mixing ratios. The presence of these streamers can also be seen in changes in stratospheric optical properties. Satellite instruments such as OMPS-LP measuring the limb scattering of these aerosols are capable of observing an increase in the aerosol extinction coefficient in the mid-stratosphere at the edge of the vortex. The high spatial sampling of the limb instrument ensures that the trajectory of the streamer can be accurately monitored. Following a displacement and deformation of the vortex, aerosol transport to high latitudes occurred in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2017. The additional stratospheric aerosol mass of around 1000 t at an altitude of 24–38 km remained at middle and high latitudes for just under a month in that year. This aerosol mass increase resulted in an estimated 70 % rise in the total mass within this altitude range at high latitudes. Frozen-in anticyclones, in which low latitude air is trapped in the circulation at high latitudes after the end of the polar vortex, can also be observed in the aerosol extinction coefficient. The observation of a particularly long-lived anticyclone in 2005, which is visible in the extinction coefficient, is presented. This is the first study documenting streamer events and frozen-in anticyclones in stratospheric aerosols."

In this work, we present a modification to the Météo-France weather model ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) to improve the forecasting of areas favourable to the persistence of contrails. The spatial correspondence between observations and the modified model is demonstrated and evaluated by appropriate metrics. The modified model can therefore be used for further contrail climate impact applications. 
 Contrails formed by aircraft in ice supersaturated regions (ISSR) can persist and spread for several hours, evolving into cirrus which have a net positive effect on global warming. Reducing this contribution could be achieved through on-purpose flight planning, in particular by avoiding ice supersaturated regions. In this context, a modification to the cloud scheme of the ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is proposed to enable the representation of ISSRs at cruise altitude. This modification does not require any major algorithmic changes or additional computational effort, and the methodology is transferable to similar parameterizations, commonly used in global circulation models.Humidity forecasts are evaluated using in situ aircraft humidity observations and compared with operational forecasts from ARPEGE and the Integrated Forecast System (IFS). A sensitivity study on neighborhood tolerance and humidity thresholding is carried out, enabling a comprehensive comparison between NWP forecasts. It is shown that the modified cloud scheme allows for supersaturation, significantly improving the representation of humidity with respect to ice, with ISSR discrimination skills close to IFS (hit rate ∼ 80 % and false alarm ratio ∼ 30 % when a neighborhood tolerance of 150 km, i.e. 10 min of flight, is applied). The spatial correspondence between observations and the modified ARPEGE model is illustrated by a commercial flight case study. The modelization of ice supersaturation in ARPEGE can therefore be used for further contrail climate impact applications, together with the associated evaluation methodology, which contributes to the definition of a shared framework for ISSR verification."

This approach allows for a qualitative analysis of sulfate (SO42-) formation processes and comparison with corresponding measurements. 
 Atmospheric sulfate formation influences climate and air quality, yet its chemical pathways remain difficult to constrain. This study utilizes the oxygen isotope anomaly (Δ17O) of sulfate aerosol (ASO4) as a tracer to distinguish formation processes. This work presents a simulation of Δ17O(ASO4) within the contiguous United States, conducted over full annual cycles, which enables the quantification of seasonal and spatial patterns of sulfate oxidation pathways and their response to major emission reductions, for the first time at this scale and temporal coverage. In 2019, Δ17O(ASO4) values were predicted to be below 1 ‰ in the Gulf Coast, indicating acidic, ASO4-rich conditions dominated by S(IV) + H2O2 oxidation, while values above 2 ‰ in the West suggested less acidic conditions, leading to enhanced ASO4 production via S(IV) + O3 oxidation. Peak Δ17O(ASO4) values of ∼4.5 ‰ in April across the Western US reflected O3-driven ASO4 formation during high ammonia (NH3) emissions from fertilization. Between 2006 and 2019, mean Δ17O(ASO4) was predicted to increase by up to 2 ‰, driven by declining sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from regulatory measures. Model comparisons with historical measurements show reasonable agreement in the acidic southeastern US (RMSE = 0.20 ‰, Baton Rouge, LA). However, the model overpredicts Δ17O(ASO4) in the Western US with RMSE values of 0.36 ‰ (La Jolla, CA) and 1.9 ‰ (White Mountain Research Center, CA). This overestimation suggests an excessive model response to aqueous S(IV) + O3 reactions. These findings underscore the diagnostic potential of Δ17O(ASO4) for assessing sulfate formation mechanisms and pinpointing shortcomings in chemical transport models. However, Δ17O(ASO4) observations across the United States remain exceedingly limited, with most available data dating back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, highlighting the need for renewed measurement efforts."

Both emission and deposition occurred, with larger particles settling faster. Weather influenced dispersion and deposition, while wind-driven turbulence enhanced deposition despite stable conditions. Results show aerosol accumulation in snow impacts pollution and snowmelt. Findings help improve aerosol models and pollution studies in cold cities. 
 A comprehensive study of aerosol exchange surface fluxes was conducted at a suburban site in Fairbanks (Alaska) during the Arctic winter as part of the ALPACA experiment. Aerosol fluxes were measured by an eddy covariance system on a snow-covered field located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Farm site from 26 January to 17 February 2022. Overall, the flux measurements indicate that the site acted mainly as an emission source for ultrafine particles, while the fluxes for larger particle sizes were substantially bidirectional. Median deposition velocities were 0.61, 0.04, and 8.73 mm s−1 for ultrafine (< 50 nm), accumulation (0.25–0.8 µm), and quasi-coarse (0.8–3 µm) particles, respectively. Anticyclonic synoptic meteorological conditions enhanced atmospheric stagnation and favoured pollutant accumulation near the surface, whereas cyclonic conditions increased aerosol dispersion, thus reducing deposition rates. Despite the frequent conditions of atmospheric stability and pronounced temperature inversions resulting from the strong surface radiative cooling, turbulence was generated mechanically by wind friction, leading to particle deposition. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that wintertime aerosol dry deposition in Arctic urban areas contributes significantly to pollutant accumulation in the snowpack, potentially enhancing contaminant remobilization during snowmelt. Finally, this study provides data for improving aerosol transport models and understanding pollutant-snow interactions in cold urban regions."

The dominant role ​of aerosol-cloud microphysical processes is further quantified, with PM2.5 changes explaining 59-63 % of the decadal trends of light rain. This offers critical insights for aligning air pollution mitigation with climate adaptation strategies. 
 Precipitation dynamics critically regulate Earth's hydrological cycle and climate system, yet the mechanisms driving decadal-scale variations in light rain remain poorly quantified. Our analysis of a 23-year (2000–2022) national-scale dataset reveals contrasting trends in light precipitation occurrence: a significant decline (1.0 d yr−1, p < 0.05) during 2000–2013 followed by a pronounced increase (1.9 d yr−1, p < 0.01) in 2013–2022. Cross-temporal analysis demonstrates a national wide inverse correlation (r=-0.55, p < 0.01) between aerosol concentrations and light rain frequency in the China's Emission Control Era, when the PM2.5 shows an upward trajectory before 2013 followed by a markedly downward decline thereafter, providing a natural experiment to quantify aerosol effects in precipitation. Through multi-algorithm machine learning and causal inference modeling, we further identify aerosol-cloud microphysical processes as the dominant driver, with PM2.5 concentration changes explaining 59 %–63 % of the decadal trends of light rain. As a result, the PM2.5 reduction (increase) enhances (reduces) light rain frequency by +1.97 (−2.08) d yr−1. Meteorological factors showed negligible temporal variability and thus insignificant explanatory power (mostly < 5 % for each individual factor) over a decadal scale. Our findings establish, for the first time, the quantifiable aerosol microphysical effect on light precipitation trends, highlighting dual benefits for China's emission control policies that PM2.5 reduction in 2013–2022 simultaneously enhanced light rain frequency while improving air quality.

National emissions show a clear three‑phase pattern, with uncertainties below 5 % (1σ) at the national scale but much higher at the provincial level (10–50 %, 1σ). High-emission regions often have the largest uncertainties. Our findings support more accurate emission estimates and the verification emission reduction policies. 
 Accurate quantification of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change and verifying emission reduction policies. This study conducts a comparative analysis of China's anthropogenic CO2 emissions for the period between 2000 and 2023 based on six widely used bottom-up inventories at their latest version (ODIAC2023, EDGAR2024, MEIC-global-CO2 v1.0, CAMS-GLOB-ANT v6.2, GEMS v1.0, and CEADs). The national total CO2 emissions increase from 3.43 (3.21–3.63) Gt yr−1 in 2000 to 12.03 (11.35–12.98) Gt yr−1 in 2023, with three growth periods: rapid growth (2000–2013, 0.56 ± 0.013 Gt yr−1), near-stagnation (2013–2016, −0.07 ± 0.022 Gt yr−1), and renewed growth (2016–2023, 0.30 ± 0.016 Gt yr−1). Emissions are dominated by the electricity and heat production, and the industry and construction (78 % of total emissions), with the former replacing the latter as the largest source after 2017. EDGAR consistently reports the highest national CO2 emissions, while MEIC provides the lowest, contributing to the large deviations after 2012. EDGAR and MEIC report different spatial distributions of the transport sector. EDGAR concentrates emissions along major roads and MEIC distributes them more diffusely. Extreme outliers (> 105 t CO2 km−2 yr−1, against an average of 102 t CO2 km−2 yr−1) in these inventories arise from discrepancies in point source data in the Carbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) versus the China Power Emissions Database (CPED). Overall, the uncertainty of total national anthropogenic CO2 emissions is within 5 % (1σ), and the uncertainties are about 10 %–50 % (1σ) at the provincial level. Our study underscores that the improved spatial proxies, consistent regional inventories, and continued methodological updates are essential for improving the robustness of China's CO2 emission assessments and supporting mitigation planning."

By refining grid resolution and improving convection representation, the model more accurately simulates carbon monoxide transport. Comparisons with satellite and in situ observations highlight its ability to capture seasonal variations and improve our understanding of atmospheric transport. 
 Lagrangian modeling of transport, as implemented in the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS), connects the advective (reversible) component of transport along 3D trajectories with mixing, the irreversible component. Here, we investigate the interplay between strongly localized convective uplifts and large-scale flow dynamics in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). We revisit the Lagrangian formulation of convection in CLaMS-3.0/MESSy, driven by ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis, and further develop the model. These developments include refining spatial resolution in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and decoupling the frequency of the adaptive grid procedure – which captures isentropic mixing and redefines Lagrangian air parcels – from the parameterization of convection.To improve the model's UTLS transport representation, particularly from the PBL over days to weeks, we derive zonally and seasonally resolved climatologies of CO partial columns (XCO, spanning 147–68 hPa) and compare them with Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observations, as well as in situ data. Incorporating a parameterization for unresolved convection significantly improves CO anomaly representation in the UTLS, particularly in capturing seasonal and spatial patterns. While the simulated absolute XCO values align better with ACE-FTS, the model reproduces MLS anomalies more accurately, suggesting MLS better represents CO variability. In situ observations in the boreal polar region generally support lower ACE-FTS CO values, while MLS better represents CO enhancements in air affected by the Asian summer monsoon above 10 km."

We observed unusually high water vapor and ice levels up to 1.5 kilometers above the tropopause. Although the extra water vapor lasted only a few days to weeks, it shows how such storms can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere’s composition. 
 This study examines the cloud microphysical properties and trace gas signatures associated with a convective overshooting event observed during the TPEx (TropoPause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) campaign in June 2024 over Sweden. While recent studies have predominantly focused on convective overshootings in sub(tropical) air masses, this particular event took place during a cold air outbreak characterized by low tropopause altitudes of 9 km. The measurements by the  microphysical cloud spectrometer reveal that ice particles were transported into the lower stratosphere, with detections extending up to 1.5 km above the tropopause. At this altitude, a pronounced stratospheric ozone concentration of approximately 600 ppbv and a notable tropospheric water vapor concentration of up to 60 ppmv (+30 ppmv) were recorded, the latter being twice as high as background levels at the same height. This substantial injection of tropospheric air and ice particles was linked to gravity wave breaking, and subsequently irreversible mixing near the overshooting top. Forward trajectories indicate that the impact of the overshoot on the lower stratosphere, especially regarding the observed hydration, is relatively short-lived with a life time of several days (at 330 K) to weeks (at 345 K)."

We investigated ice formation in the presence of pure and binary mixtures of common minerals using a microfluidic device. The mineral with the best ability to initiate ice formation alone (that is, at the highest temperature) typically determined when ice formed in the binary mixture. 
 Mineral dusts are among the most active ice-nucleating particles present in cloud droplets, with their properties influencing radiative properties and precipitation formation. To improve weather predictions and climate projections, it is important to understand under which conditions ice will form on mineral dusts. Laboratory experiments have primarily focused on single minerals, and field samples are complex mixtures that cannot be controlled in their composition or particle size. To fill this gap, a bottom-up investigation of suspensions containing pure or binary mixtures of microcline, montmorillonite, or quartz at concentrations between 0.0001 and 0.1 wt % is presented. Arrays of monodisperse aqueous droplets (diameters of 75 µm) are generated using a microfluidic device and subsequently cooled at a rate of 1 K min−1. The probability of freezing in the presence of binary mixtures generally follows that of the most ice-active mineral. Each pure mineral's nucleation site density is fit as a function of temperature and used to predict the frozen fraction curves for each binary mixture assuming additivity of mineral surface area. Predictions are also made for Arizona Test Dust from the obtained pure mineral fits, and general agreement with experiments is observed. This work presents a systematic study of ice formation in the presence of pure and binary mixtures of common mineral dusts, providing information for the future design of composition-aware parameterizations for ice nucleation in the atmosphere."

During winter the fine aerosols were acidic to moderately acidic throughout Greece with an overall mean aerosol pH of 3.57±0.44 in urban areas and 3.05±0.50 in remote locations. The highest aerosol pH (4.08±0.42) in January 2020 was found in Ioannina due to, among others, high K+ levels from biomass burning emissions. Aerosols in Xanthi were the most acidic due to high sulfate levels. Similar seasonal profiles of aerosol pH were observed at all sites studied with different factors contributing to this seasonality. During the summer PM2.5 at Thissio, Ioannina and Finokalia was acidic with a mean aerosol pH across all three sites of 1.76±0.40. During this season, sulfates were the driver of the higher acidity conditions at Thissio and Finokalia, with other factors such as the semivolatiles and temperature contributing to a lesser extent. At Ioannina, temperature along with the total ammonia and nitrate were the main contributors to the seasonal difference of the aerosol pH, while some of the nonvolatile species also contributed. In most cases, the importance of organics for aerosol pH was small."

We conducted atmospheric methane and ethane measurements using a vehicle in the world’s largest megacity, Tokyo, to identify locations and types of emissions and to examine preliminary estimates of their magnitudes. Waste sectors and fugitive natural gas emissions were found to be the major urban sources, and our data suggested need of improved accounting of natural gas related emissions. 
 To investigate distributions and magnitudes of methane (CH4) emissions in Tokyo, the world's largest megacity, a vehicle-based mobile measurement was set up and 3-week measurement campaign was conducted in September to October 2023. As part of the campaign, we conducted a control release experiment to link downwind excess CH4 values to CH4 emission rate at the source. The empirical equation derived from the experiment was significantly different from those reported by previous studies, suggesting the limitation of such enhancement-to-emission rate conversion, which is a source of large uncertainty in estimating urban CH4 emissions based on street-level measurements. The uncertainty stems from different experiment settings and underlying assumptions (e.g., source distance and height) which do not always represent actual urban measurement environments. The mobile measurement campaign covered a large extent of the Greater Tokyo Area with total driving distance of over 2000 km. Locations of CH4 enhancement were identified and C2H6-to-CH4 enhancement ratios were determined for individual locations to categorize them into biogenic, fossil fuel and combustion CH4 sources. Among a total of 565 locations inferred as CH4 sources, 53 % and 42 % were considered as biogenic and fossil fuel origins, respectively, with the rest being minor contributions from combustion. Based on the statistics of measured CH4 excesses, CH4 emissions were estimated for the specific areas where relatively high measurement coverage was achieved. In the areas with biogenic facilities (landfill and wastewater treatment plants), our emission estimates are well correlated with local government reporting, indicating actual key contributions of the waste-sector facilities. On the other hand, in the residential areas, CH4 emissions were predominantly of fossil-fuel origin, with a magnitude comparable to the area with waste facilities. However, such fossil-fuel emissions are not accounted for in local government reporting. This result highlights the need for improved accounting of urban fossil fuel-related emissions."

The Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties algorithm can retrieve aerosol size distribution parameters using only aerosol optical depth (AOD) as input that is continuously observed by sun photometers worldwide. In this study, we apply the algorithm to AOD measured by sun photometers and spectroradiometers to assess the performance and limitations of such retrievals and investigate the effect of the spectral range. 
 Several sun photometer networks worldwide include instruments for aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations, such as Global Atmospheric Atmosphere Watch-Precision Filter Radiometer (GAW-PFR) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). AERONET provides additional aerosol properties such as the detailed volume size distribution and the single scattering albedo through inversion modelling of sky radiance measurements. However, the data availability for such properties is limited due to the limited number of daily almucantar sky radiance scans and cloudiness. AOD is measured significantly more frequently as there can be one measurement even every minute. Also, the AOD measurements are affected only by clouds being too close or covering the solar disk. The Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) is a flexible inversion model to retrieve aerosol properties from various observations. One of its capabilities is the retrieval of the volume concentration, the volume median radius and geometric standard deviation for each aerosol size distribution mode and the separation of AOD to each mode using only spectral AOD as an input parameter (known as the GRASP-AOD application). Such properties are important for various applications, as the size of aerosols affects their interaction with solar radiation, clouds and radiative forcing modelling. Particle size also shows significant differences depending on the aerosol type such as dust or biomass burning. In this study, we selected four common stations of GAW-PFR and AERONET, used GRASP to retrieve the bimodal size distribution parameters from AOD measured by GAW-PFR instruments (PFRs) and validated the results for different conditions using AERONET data as reference. One of those sites includes a multi-year parallel timeseries from two different BTS spectroradiometers that combined can provide direct spectral irradiance (and as a result AOD) in the 300–2150 nm range. Using this dataset, we were able to investigate the effect and potential benefits of the increased spectral range on GRASP-AOD retrievals. This is mostly focused on the retrieval of the coarse mode volume median radius, which is particularly challenging with the filter radiometers measuring up to 862 or 1020 nm. We also assessed the performance for certain dust and biomass burning cases. Our results showed good agreement between PFR AOD-based and AERONET sky radiance inversions for AOD modal separation and volume concentrations. Significant improvement of the PFR-AERONET intercomparison was also possible for the fine mode volume and effective radius when restricting the datasets to AOD at 500 nm > 0.1 and Ångström Exponent (AE) > 1. Also, the results showed consistency with previous study regarding the validation of such retrievals using AERONET AOD. Focusing on conditions with high proportion of dust particles, we found consistent results with the general casesUsing AOD with a larger spectral range (from BTS spectroradiometer), we found that the wavelength selection may affect the results and that using longer wavelengths can increase the sensitivity of coarse mode volume median radius to AOD and improve the correlation of the GRASP BTS AOD-based and AERONET datasets. However, the available data were limited, so it is not clear under what conditions the inclusion of such wavelengths will result in more accurate retrievals or to what extent.Finally, we were able to reproduce with GRASP the aerosol size characteristics of unusual biomass burning cases from the Canadian wildfires during 2023, but the results showed systematically increased fine mode radius and concentration compared to the AERONET output."

This study presents a simple approach to describing this organisation. First, the convective field is decomposed into elementary structures. Then, four scores are computed to describe the size, density, spacing scale and departure from randomness of the cores. This method robustly characterises the organisation of convection. 
 Deep convective systems (DCSs) play a fundamental role in atmospheric dynamics, precipitation, cloud radiative effects, and large-scale circulations. Their associated deep convection exhibits complex spatial arrangements, commonly referred to as convective organization, which exerts an influence on the systems' morphology that needs to be assessed. However, quantifying this organization remains challenging due to the lack of a general, robust, and consensual metric, in both observations and models. This study introduces a new method for characterizing the spatial arrangement of deep convective cores within the cloud shield of individual DCSs. The first step of this technique consists in decomposing the convective mask into elementary structures. Four key parameters are then extracted to fully capture the organization of a scene. Two of these parameters characterize the overall properties of the convective field, such as the size and convective fraction of convective cores. The remaining two parameters are specifically designed to describe the spatial arrangement of deep convective cores: a characteristic convective scale using two-dimensional (2D) autocorrelation and an evaluation of the deviation from randomness by comparing it to a stochastic ensemble of synthetic convective fields. Two independent datasets, derived from satellite observations and idealized kilometer-scale numerical simulations, each employing distinct convective core identification techniques are used to assess the generalization of the method. Finally, an unsupervised clustering algorithm identifies four distinct classes, revealing consistent and physically sound patterns of convective organization across both datasets. This demonstrates the method's robustness and suitability to characterize the spatial organization of convective cores in convective systems' cloud shield."

It examines the influence of aerosol chemical compounds linked to air mass origins, as well as their relationship with the efficiency of aerosol growth. Such a study provides a better understanding of the interactions between aerosols and water vapour, which is important for reducing the uncertainties surrounding the Earth's radiative balance. 
 From May to August 2020 and during summer 2024, aerosol backscatter and relative humidity profiles were measured near Paris region using the Water Vapour and Aerosol Lidar (WALI). The campaigns included observations on the Saclay plateau (48°42′42′′ N, 02°08′52′′ E) and in Paris (48°50′12′′ N, 02°20′10′′ E) during the 2024 Olympic Games. The high vertical (15 m) and temporal (15 min) resolution of WALI allow to study aerosol optical properties and water vapour profiles under stable atmospheric conditions. This study focuses on characterizing aerosol hygroscopic growth using lidar-derived aerosol backscatter coefficients as a function of relative humidity. Eight case studies were selected where the potential temperature gradient was neutral and the water vapor mixing ratio was constant with height. These include long range air pollution transport from the Benelux region, low hygroscopic aerosol events, and a sea salt-pollution mixture episode. Hygroscopicity was assessed using CAMS model analyses and reanalyses, allowing attribution of chemical composition to observed optical changes. Good agreement was found between lidar-derived hygroscopic properties and CAMS-inferred aerosol types. Lidar growth factors ranged from 0.3 to 1.5, with higher values linked to sea salt presence, consistent with literature values. Aerosols hygroscopicity is also studied using Mie's theory, as aerosols can be considered nearly spherical. Differences between extinction and backscatter-based growth retrievals are interpreted through Hänel's formalism. The results illustrate the potential of Raman lidar observations to provide valuable constraints on aerosol hygroscopicity, offering complementary information for chemistry-transport models and contributing to reduce uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interaction estimates."

Tests with different aerosol types show that the method can provide reliable results and improve the description of larger particles. This work demonstrates the potential of future satellite observations to deliver a clearer picture of global air pollution and its role in climate. 
 Using an improved regularization method, we attempt to derive microphysical parameters (effective radius reff, surface area concentration St, volume concentration Vt) of aerosol particle size distribution directly from the detection results of Aerosol and Carbon dioxide Detection Lidar (ACDL), which is the first spaceborne high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) based iodine filter. The backscatter and extinction coefficients at 532, 1064, and 1572 nm are adopted for regularization algorithm. Preliminary simulations for different aerosol types with monomodal and bimodal lognormal size distributions demonstrate the algorithm performance of the 3α + 3β optical data combination. For monomodal aerosols, the retrieval errors are constrained within 15 % for reff, 30 % for St, and 35 % for Vt. In bimodal cases, errors increase to 18 %–35 % for reff, 35 % for St, and up to 60 % for Vt. Sensitivity analysis confirms that systematic errors of ±20 % in input optical data induce parameter uncertainties below 60 %. Case studies reveal four typical aerosols profiles: urban (reff ∼ 0.47 µm), smoke (reff ∼ 0.57 µm), dust (reff ∼ 0.61 µm), and marine (reff ∼ 0.83 µm). The inversion reff is compared with CALIPSO and LIVAS, which confirms high consistency for marine and dust, while urban and smoke retrievals show slightly larger. The inclusion of 1572 nm significantly enhances coarse-mode retrieval accuracy. The error statistics of the simulations and the actual comparison results show that the proposed inversion algorithm can reliably derive the particle size distribution parameters from the spaceborne multi-wavelength lidar ACDL. This work provides preliminary validation of ACDL's capability to retrieve vertically resolved global aerosol microphysical characterization."

The retrieval is validated using synthetic data for idealized and realistic cloud cases and applied to measurements of the airborne specMACS instrument during the HALO-(AC)3 campaign. It provides high spatial resolution information about phase partitioning at cloud top and allows for example to study phase transitions in Arctic mixed-phase clouds. 
 Mixed-phase clouds are frequently observed in the Arctic and still not well represented in climate and general circulation models. The spatial distribution of cloud thermodynamic phase and its partitioning are important quantities since they affect the radiative effect of clouds as well as cloud life time. In this work, a new quantitative retrieval method of cloud thermodynamic phase partitioning based on multi-angle polarimetry is presented. The polarization signal is sensitive to cloud thermodynamic phase since liquid water and ice particles have different shapes and different optical properties. The basic idea of the retrieval is to fit simulations obtained from a forward operator to measurements in the cloudbow range between 135 and 165° scattering angle and the slope range between 60 and 110° to determine a quantitative ice fraction. Either plane-parallel clouds or three-dimensional (half-spherical) clouds are assumed in the simulations. The retrieval was validated using synthetic data. 3D radiative transfer simulations were performed for different idealized cloud cases as well as for a realistic field of low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds. As the retrieval is based on polarization, it is sensitive to cloud top. The retrieved ice fraction is here defined as the ratio of the ice optical thickness to the liquid plus ice optical thickness and corresponds to the mean ice fraction of the uppermost cloud layer from cloud top to an optical thickness of about 1 to 2, depending on the solar zenith angle. In addition, the retrieval was applied to measurements of the polarization-resolving cameras of the specMACS instrument during the HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 campaign, providing two-dimensional fields of cloud thermodynamic phase partitioning with a high spatial resolution of about 100 m."

By simulating its performance, we show that GEMINI-UK will significantly reduce uncertainties in these flux estimates, complementing data from existing tall towers and future satellite missions. The network will strengthen the UK's ability to track greenhouse gases, evaluate climate policies, and meet net-zero goals. 
 The Greenhouse gas Emissions Monitoring network to Inform Net-zero Initiatives for the UK (GEMINI-UK) includes ten Bruker EM27/SUN instruments located across the UK that collect dry average volume mixing ratios of CO2 and methane (XCO2 and XCH4). The primary objective of GEMINI-UK is to infer regional net flux estimates of CO2 and methane across the UK that can be used to provide actionable information to the UK Government. The instruments are housed in bespoke autonomous weatherproof enclosures that help maximize cloud-free data collection throughout the calendar year. The network will become fully operational in late 2025. As part of our commissioning phase, we designed the network so it would deliver the biggest uncertainty reduction in net CO2 fluxes, based on prior emission inventories.  The ten sites are located at UK education institutions and a national scientific research laboratory, underlining our commitment to make these data openly available to all. In this study, we use a series of closed-loop numerical experiments for the nominal calendar year of 2019 to quantify the theoretical benefit of using this new ground-based remote sensing network, accounting for cloudy scenes, to estimate spatially resolved net fluxes of CO2 and methane across the UK. Based on our results, we expect that GEMINI-UK will deliver significant error reductions in CO2 flux estimates,  up to 51 % in January and up to 59 % in July (GEMINI-UK only), and up to 8 % in January and up to 24 % in July when combined with existing tall tower measurements collected across England and Ireland.  Despite the network being optimally designed to enhance our understanding of UK CO2 fluxes, we expect, based on our calculations, that GEMINI-UK will also substantially reduce uncertaintes of methane emissions, achieving a priori error reductions up to 55 % in January and up to 75 % in July (GEMINI-UK only), and up to 10 % in January and up to 29 % in July when combined with the existing tall tower sites. In the context of augmenting the information collected by the established tall tower network, we find that GEMINI-UK data have the greatest potential over high flux regions in the central and southern parts of the UK during winter months, and over broader southern to northern regions during the summer months. More broadly, the data collected by GEMINI-UK will also provide the basis to evaluate satellite observations of these trace gases, thereby providing confidence in their ability to supplement data collected by GEMINI-UK and the tall tower network."

 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the key pollutants with profound implications for air quality, and human health, and is needed to establish the air quality health index (AQHI).  Currently, over 600 surface air monitoring stations are distributed across Canada and the United States measuring NO2, but many areas remain unmonitored leading to incomplete information for health risk assessments. This study leverages Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite observations and machine learning models to derive high-resolution surface NO2 concentrations, provides enhanced spatial coverage and accuracy, revealing urban-rural NO2 gradients across North America. Existing traditional methods rely on scaling with modeled profiles to obtain NO2 surface concentrations from satellite observations.  Here, we compare this traditional method to a machine learning approach that utilizes NO2 observations from TROPOMI, together with meteorological parameters, land cover type, topography, and emission inventories. Our results show that the machine learning (using random forest) yields less bias between the surface monitoring measurements and the “satellite-derived” surface concentrations, significantly improved the correlation coefficient (R2∼ 0.77–0.91) compared to the traditional method (R2∼ 0.39–0.57) and yields to significantly less bias."

Compared to the conventional time-domain approach, the proposed method offers a substantial improvement. Despite some limitations, this study marks a significant advancement in turbulence estimation using pulsed Doppler lidars, which presents promising potential for wind turbine load assessments. 
 Accurate estimation of second-order turbulence statistics using pulsed Doppler lidar has been a challenge for a long time, mainly due to the negative influence of probe volume averaging. The present study aims to investigate a novel approach to extracting first- and second-order turbulence statistics directly from the average Doppler spectra in the frequency domain. The main hypothesis is that averaging Doppler spectra over 10 min intervals can mitigate the influence of probe volume averaging and random noise in velocity retrievals, thereby improving estimates of velocity variance. To achieve this, we develop a new analytical model for the time-averaged Doppler spectrum, beginning with a theoretical formulation based on the beat signal within the range gate. The model is applied to 10 min averaged Doppler spectra collected by a pulsed lidar system pointing toward a sonic anemometer mounted on a meteorological mast in front of a Vestas V52 wind turbine at the DTU Risø campus in Denmark. Validation results demonstrate that the Doppler spectra model, when fitted to 400 ns nominal pulse durations, closely matches sonic anemometer measurements in both mean radial velocities and standard deviations. This agreement is quantified by the orthogonal least squares fit slopes of 0.976 for the mean velocities and 0.983 for the standard deviations. In comparison to the conventional time-domain approach, which accounts for only 72.1 % of the standard deviation, the proposed spectral method captures 98.3 % of the standard deviation observed in the sonic anemometer. However, this model does not accurately estimate variances using the short pulse (200 ns) of the instrument. Despite this limitation for the short pulse, the proposed method is an important step towards better turbulence estimation from pulsed Doppler lidars."

This vortex created a transient ozone mini-hole. Using satellite and ground-based observations, we tracked a 30–40 % initial ozone depletion, which decayed to ~7 % within a month. These findings highlight the impact of extreme wildfires on stratospheric dynamics and ozone composition. 
 The intense wildfires in Australia, during the 2019–2020 fire season, generated massive pyro-cumulonimbus (pyro-Cb) clouds, and injected an unprecedented amount of smoke aerosols into the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS). The smoke aerosols produced a self-sustaining confined anticyclonic vortex, that ascended up to 35 km altitude by March 2020 by diabatic heating of radiation absorbing aerosols. This vortex transported ozone-poor tropospheric air into the ozone-rich stratosphere, thus forming a transient ozone mini-hole. This study investigates the early evolution of the dynamically-generated ozone mini-hole, using satellite and ground-based observations, supported by modelling information. Ozone anomalies within the vortex are tracked and quantified by satellite observation. In particular, ad-hoc in-vortex observations are derived by coupling the IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite observations and meteorological reanalysis information of the vortex. With these observations, a 30 %–40 % ozone reduction is observed immediately after the event in a 6 km partial stratospheric column, which exponentially decreased to ∼ 7 % by the end of January with an e-folding time of about one week, as the vortex ascended in the stratosphere. A total ozone column reduction of ∼ 7 %, immediately after the pyro-Cb injection, was observed with IASI and the TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) satellite instrument. Consistently, ground-based measurement at Lauder, New Zealand showed a localised ozone reduction reaching ∼ 10 % (total column) and ∼ 20 % (in-vortex stratospheric partial column) associated with two vortex overpasses. These results provide insights into the impacts of extreme wildfires and pyro-Cbs on the dynamics and composition of the stratosphere."

The framework enables evaluation of the performance of CMLs as rainfall sensors in a probabilistic manner and assessment of information content of an arbitrary variable for the rainfall retrieval, e.g. synoptic type. The study shows that using the information theory concept can also directly improve data processing of attenuation data, in this case dry-wet classification. 
 Commercial microwave links (CMLs) are opportunistic rainfall sensors that provide indirect rainfall estimates from attenuation data. This is achieved by separating raindrop path attenuation from observed total loss and converting it to rainfall intensity using the k−R formula. Various methods have been proposed for CML rainfall retrieval using either attenuation data alone or additional environmental variables. However, most studies evaluate CML rainfall estimates deterministically and do not reveal how individual processing steps and variables affect rainfall estimation uncertainty. This study proposes to evaluate CML processing using an information-theoretic framework and demonstrates this probabilistic concept on two particular problems. The first analysis reveals the reduction of uncertainty in CML rainfall estimates by measuring the information content of individual variables and their combinations. Both quantitative and qualitative predictors are used, including sensor variables such as CML signal attenuation, and environmental variables such as temperature, or synoptic types. The rainfall intensity derived from the k−R formula and combined with synoptic type forms an informative combination of sensor and environmental variables for reducing uncertainty regarding reference rainfall intensity. The second analysis demonstrates the application of information theory for classifying wet and dry periods using signal attenuation data and other environmental variables. In a limited single-link evaluation, a non-parametric model indicated better performance than the reference approaches suggesting the potential of information theory in CML processing. The proposed framework enables the identification of informative sensor and environmental variables, the evaluation of the effects of different processing steps on the estimated rainfall intensity, or the development of a wet-dry classification model calibrated in a probabilistic manner ultimately facilitating the improvement of CML rainfall estimates."

 In this study we examine the performance of the 354.8 nm Rayleigh temperature channel of the Raman lidar at the Schneefernerhaus high-altitude research station (UFS) in the Bavarian Alps (at 2675 m a.s.l.). The temperature reference value of the retrieval is adjusted to match the temperature determined from the OH* airglow around 86 km by the GRIPS instruments at UFS. In this way the quality of the 1 h measurements of the lidar is improved above 70 km. Comparisons were made between the UFS lidar, the MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) satellite-borne instrument and the 354.8 nm temperature channel of Hohenpeißenberg (MOHp) differential-absorption ozone lidar. Between 35 and 70 km we see a positive offset of the UFS temperatures with respect to the MLS values of up to about 9 K. This behaviour just slightly exceeds the expectations from earlier work. Despite a horizontal distance of just 40 km between UFS and MOHp acceptable agreement below 70 km was found in several cases. However, in general, the MOHp temperatures were slightly lower than those above UFS. We discuss potential technical issues and suggest solutions for upgrading the UFS lidar system.

In this paper, we examined how to improve the accuracy of a laser-based method for measuring oxygen isotopes in CO2, focusing on the rare mass-17 isotope. By testing instruments in two labs, we identified ways to make the results more reliable. Our findings provide practical guidance and support wider use of this method in environmental studies. 
 Triple oxygen isotope (Δ′17O) measurements of CO2 are increasingly used in atmospheric and paleoenvironmental research, supported by the rise of tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS) as a cost- and time-effective method for quantifying rare isotopologues in CO2. In this study we use data from two TILDAS instruments (University of Göttingen and University of Cape Town) to evaluate how the stability of analytical conditions, such as temperature, optical cell pressure, and the analyte's CO2 concentration influences measurement repeatability. We identify the mismatch in CO2 concentration between sample and working gas as the most significant factor affecting the repeatability of Δ′17O measurements. The resulting scale-offset effect can amount to several ppm per µmol mol−1 mismatch, depending on instrumental configuration.  Applying empirical corrections for such offsets significantly improves repeatability. We show that maintaining electronics temperature, cell temperature, and cell pressure stability within ±0.1 K, ±1 mK, and ±10 Pa, respectively, across the cycles of a replicate measurement is sufficient to avoid any resolvable impact on the internal error. Over multi-week timescales, drift in measured isotope ratios is primarily driven by variations in the temperature of electronic components, while fluctuations in cell temperature, pressure, and analyte concentration exert smaller but detectable influences. We conclude with practical recommendations for achieving high precision triple oxygen isotope measurements with TILDAS, emphasizing that continuous monitoring and reporting of analytical conditions is essential."

We analyzed more than 460 000 ocean measurements and found major gaps, especially in deep waters and coastal areas. Most data come from ship routes, leaving many regions unobserved. These gaps limit our ability to understand currents and climate patterns. We propose expanding modern ocean monitoring tools to improve future predictions. 
 The Indonesian Seas and Surroundings (ISS) play an important role in global ocean circulation by connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans via the global thermohaline circulation. This region regulates the exchange of water mass, heat, salinity, and biogeochemical elements, further influencing the global climate and carbon cycle. Consequently, in this region, extensive observations and surveys, particularly the in-situ measurements, have been conducted in this region over the past two centuries. This study analyzed over 461 865 oceanographic casts from multiple international repositories, with 360 409 casts, or 21.97 % rejection, after rigorous quality control. The results show that data collection was sparse and temporally limited before the early 19th century, with a marked increase beginning in the mid-20th century. Spatially, observations are heavily concentrated along major international shipping routes, including the Makassar Strait, Malacca Strait, and South China Seas, while vast areas, such as the Halmahera Sea, Timor Sea, Java Sea, and Sulawesi Sea, remain poorly detected. Temperature and salinity are the most collected data, whereas deep-sea observations, particularly below 800 m, are critically lacking, with limited measurements of essential ocean variables such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and currents. Additionally, coastal regions exhibit substantial data deficiencies. Given the region's complex ocean-atmosphere interactions and unique topographic features, the current observational coverage remains insufficient to resolve the uncertainties in Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) variability, ocean heat transport, and monsoon forecasting. This study proposes to address the gaps by deploying autonomous monitoring technologies (Argo floats, gliders, moored buoys) in deep-sea and coastal regions, expanding regional observational networks, and enhancing executable data-sharing mechanisms.

This is achieved using marine air temperature observations with newly available estimates of diurnal-heating biases together with an updated land station database that includes bias adjustments for early thermometer enclosures. These developments allow the data set to extend further into the past than current data sets that use sea surface temperature rather than marine air temperature data. 
 We present a new gridded data set of air temperature change across global land and ocean extending back to the 1780s. This data set, called the GloSAT reference analysis, has two novel features: it uses marine air temperature observations rather than the sea surface temperature measurements typically used by pre-existing data sets, and it extends further into the past than existing merged land and ocean instrumental temperature records which typically estimate temperature changes from the middle to late 19th century onwards. New estimates of diurnal-heating biases in marine air temperatures have enabled the use of daytime observations, extending the data set further into the past compared to nighttime-only marine air temperature data. The data set uses an extended version of the CRUTEM5 station database over land areas, incorporating newly available bias adjustments for non-standard thermometer enclosures used prior to the adoption of Stevenson screens and new climatological normal estimates for stations with limited data in the 1961–1990 baseline period. Land and marine temperature anomalies are combined to produce a gridded data set following the methods developed for HadCRUT5. The GloSAT global and hemispheric temperature anomaly series show close agreement with those based on sea surface temperature for much of the overlapping period of their records but with slightly less warming overall.

Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning models to integrate observations, and support in-depth analyses of carbon transport and storage mechanisms. This can foster broader utilization of Argo floats data in ocean carbon research. 
 The Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and modulating the global oceanic carbon cycle, thereby substantially mitigating the effects of anthropogenic climate change. However, due to the region's challenging environment and sparse observational coverage, large uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude and mechanisms of carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean. In recent decades, the deployment of Argo float arrays has facilitated autonomous and continuous profiling of hydrographic and biogeochemical properties from the surface to depths of up to 6000 m, complementing traditional ship-based observations. Nevertheless, high-resolution, integrated datasets that combine ship-based and Argo-derived observations remain rare, partly due to the challenges of data harmonization, quality control, and uncertainty estimation, as well as the indirect nature of carbonate system parameter retrievals from Argo measurements. Here, we present a comprehensive, quality-controlled reconstruction of key carbonate system parameters in the Southern Ocean interior – including total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH (total scale), nitrate (NO3), phosphate (PO4), silicate (SiO4), anthropogenic carbon (Cant), and aragonite saturation (Ωar) – by leveraging machine learning techniques and integrating all available Argo float profiles with ship-based survey data. The resulting datasets are gridded at 1°×1° horizontal resolution and 84 vertical pressure levels (0–5600 m), and are provided as distinct climatological products: the Float Grid (using all Argo float profiles) and the All-Data Grid (integrating all available Argo and ship-based observations). The Float Grid is further separated into the Non-O2-Float Grid (limited to Core Argo floats) and O2-Float Grid (limited to oxygen-measured Biogeochemical Argo floats). Each gridded product is accompanied by uncertainty estimates. The climatological products cover nearly the whole Sothern Ocean based on direct measurements instead of applying interpolating mapping methods, thereby providing a more robust result. Model performance is assessed through cross-comparison of Argo and shipboard measurements. The gridded products, collectively termed SOCOML (Southern Ocean CO2 Machine Learning products, https://doi.org/10.17632/xzr59ngmpz.2, Zhong et al., 2025a; https://doi.org/10.25921/8c29-rv75, Zhong et al., 2025b), are freely available for downloaded and are expected to support future studies of Southern Ocean carbon cycle."

A total of 3447 sandy beaches were identified with high accuracy by integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery, terrain, and nighttime light data. Since 1990, the area at risk from human infrastructure squeeze has significantly increased. This study provides an updated dataset to support sustainable coastal management. 
 Sandy beaches provide essential ecological and economic services, but their functions are increasingly threatened by human activities. Analyzing the spatial distribution of China's sandy beaches and the impacts of human activities offers valuable insights for coastal resource management and ecological protection. However, remote sensing technologies face challenges such as limited data sources and tidal influences, which affect recognition accuracy. Therefore, integrating multi-source remote sensing data and reducing the impact of tidal fluctuations to improve recognition accuracy remains a key challenge. This study proposes an innovative approach utilizing multi-source data and an ensemble learning model to identify sandy beaches in China (2016–2024). By integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite data, terrain data, and nighttime light data, along with spectral, index, terrain, texture, and polarization features, sandy beaches were identified across multiple years, and the results were consolidated into a unique dataset to analyze spatial patterns and risks from human infrastructure squeeze. (1) High-precision classification identified 3347 sandy beaches in China, covering a total area of 320.50 km2. Guangdong had the largest number, area, and perimeter, while Hebei had the widest sandy beaches.

Guangdong and Fujian showed growth rates of 0.38 and 0.32 km2 yr−1, respectively. This study provides an up-to-date dataset on China's sandy beaches.

This study introduces an efficient method to identify BHE, 13 times quicker, firstly enables the creation of BHE dataset in the North Pacific from 1993 to 2023. We verified BHE maintains strong coherence and contributes to westward transport about 1.5 Sv. We found some previously unidentified coherent eddies and analyzed their coherence. This represents first comprehensive analysis of BHE. 
 The methodologies employed for the identification of coherent ocean eddies can be categorized as either Eulerian and Lagrangian. Among Lagrangian structures, Black Hole Eddies (BHEs) exhibit the highest degree of material coherence and conservation, making them particularly suitable for studying the transport and retention of oceanic materials. This study presents an efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based BHE identification algorithm for the North Pacific (0–50° N, 130–270° E), enhancing computational efficiency by approximately 13 times compared to the existing methods. Using this algorithm, a Black Hole Eddy dataset (BHE v1.0) is constructed for the first time in the North Pacific Ocean, based on satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocity data from  1 January 1993 to  5 May 2023. BHE v1.0 contains 18 387 eddies with radius larger than 20 km and lifetimes longer than 4 weeks and captures both the spatial-temporal characteristics and the trajectories of coherent eddies throughout lifetimes. Through the advection of Lagrangian particles in Eulerian eddy, rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices (RCLVs) and BHEs, it is confirmed that BHEs retain material coherence throughout their lifecycle without significant mixing. Additionally, approximately 6 % of BHEs, which do not overlap with any RCLVs or Eulerian eddies, are identified and referred to as the Naked Black Hole Eddy and further analyze its coherence through advection. Transport analysis shows that BHEs induce westward transport of about 1.5 Sv, three times weaker than the transport attributed to the broader RCLVs, suggesting it likely represents a more accurate estimate of the coherent, non-leaky component of oceanic transport, as BHEs isolate the materially coherent core of the eddies. These findings address the existing gap in Black Hole Eddy datasets within the field of oceanography and provides a novel perspective for studying the interactions between coherent eddies and oceanic physical phenomena.

By combining deep learning and attention mechanisms, the approach captures complex vertical structures and temporal changes. The results provide more accurate and consistent subsurface information, helping improve ocean monitoring and climate research. 
 Real-time and accurate three-dimensional ocean temperature-salinity (T-S) field are of great significance for a deeper understanding of ocean dynamics and prediction skill improvement of numerical models. However, current ocean observations, especially those below the sea surface, still suffer from significant limitations in temporal and spatial resolution. Several neural network methods using multi-source satellite data for underwater temperature and salinity reconstruction have been proposed, achieving real-time temperature and salinity reconstruction, but their biases relative to in-situ observations are still significant. This study focuses on the northwestern Pacific region (0–40° N, 120–160° E) and proposes an attention-enhanced three dimensional U-Net++ model, which reconstructs daily T–S fields (26 layers, 1/4° resolution, 5–2000 m depth) using real-time available sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) data. The model introduces cross-scale feature aggregation and selective information gating, allowing it to emphasize temporally coherent surface features most relevant to subsurface variability, while suppressing noise propagation and over-smoothing. By integrating 26 consecutive days of SST and SSH as inputs, the model effectively alleviates the underdetermined problem of mapping limited surface observations to full-depth structures. In addition, a two-stage transfer learning strategy is employed: the model is first pretrained using monthly SST/SSH data and the gridded Argo data to learn observation-dominated low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns, and then fine-tuned using daily SST/SSH data and the high-resolution reanalysis to capture the meso-scale dynamic processes. Evaluation results demonstrate that the reconstructed T-S fields exhibit better agreement with in-situ T-S profiles from World Ocean Database than previous studies, both during the validation period and in long-term statistical analyses, indicating the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach for subsurface ocean field reconstruction.

 Land surface energy, water and carbon fluxes are key for understanding Earth's climate system, yet global continuous high resolution fluxes datasets remain scarce. In this study, we present a global long-term (2000–2020) hourly 9 km dataset of terrestrial water-energy-carbon fluxes, generated by integrating model simulations, in-situ measurements, and machine learning with remote sensing and meteorological data. First, the integrated STEMMUS-SCOPE model was deployed to simulate land surface fluxes over 170 sites with in-situ measurements. The selected model-output variables include net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), soil heat flux (G), gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence at 685 and 740 nm (SIF685, SIF740). Next, optimal interpolation was applied to merge Rn, LE, and H from STEMMUS-SCOPE simulations with eddy covariance observations. The optimal estimate of Rn, LE, H alongside STEMMUS-SCOPE simulated G, GPP, SIF685, SIF740 were then used as training data-pairs to develop the emulator using a multivariate Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm, referred to as Random Forest with Optimal Interpolation (RF_OI) to predict terrestrial water-energy-carbon fluxes. The results demonstrate that RF_OI can estimate land surface fluxes with Pearson Correlation Coefficient score (r-score) values higher than 0.88 except for GPP (Rn 0.99, LE 0.88, H 0.92, G 0.92, GPP 0.8, SIF685 0.99, SIF740 0.99). The testing results on independent stations (which were not included for developing the emulator) show r-score values higher than 0.8. The feature importance indicates that incoming shortwave radiation, surface soil moisture, and leaf area index are top predictor variables that determine the prediction performance.

We combined long-term tide gauge records and satellite data to create a new global sea level record from 1950 to 2022. Our results reveal how natural climate patterns, including El Niño, La Niña, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, influence rapid present-day sea level change. The data product enhances understanding of climate–sea level interactions. 
 Rapidly rising sea level is one of the major adverse consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Sea level rise poses an existential threat to coastal populations, particularly for urban settlements with accelerating growth rates. Contemporary empirical sea level reconstructions have been used to conflate short-term (∼ 3 decades) satellite altimetry geocentric sea level data and long-term (50 years or longer) tide gauge records to better estimate reliable sea level rise towards multi-decadal to centennial time scales. However, adequate separations and quantifications of low-frequency climate patterns and sea level trends globally at regional scales remain elusive. Here, we propose a new sea level reconstruction framework that incorporates Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) into the contemporary Cyclostationary EOF with Reduced Space Optimal Interpolation (CSEOF-OI) algorithm to better reconstruct sea level fields. Using 225 selected long-term gap-filled tide gauge records with vertical land motion adjusted and satellite altimetry, our global reconstructed monthly sea level time series, January 1950–January 2022, exhibits distinct delineations between modeled climate patterns and sea level trends at 1°×1° regional scales. The separated sea level patterns include trends, modulated annual cycles, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The third principal component of the reconstructed sea level exhibits a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 with the Niño 3.4 ENSO index, and the fourth principal component correlates at 0.75 with the PDO index, indicating good agreement. The global mean sea level trend, accounting for the predominant climate periodicities, is 1.9 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 (95 % confidence), and the estimate during the satellite altimetry era (January 1993–December 2021) is 3.2 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 (95 % confidence). Compared with previous studies, we conclude that our 72-year sea-level reconstruction allows us to better separate the ENSO and PDO climate patterns, as well as the sea level they induced. Finally, we show that the short-term (5-year) rates of ENSO and PDO patterns significantly affect sea level both on a global and regional scale, altering global mean sea level trends by up to 1.1 ± 0.5 mm yr−1 (January 2011–January 2016). Over the past seven decades, the climate patterns exerted a minor impact on sea level trends, but substantially modulated apparent regional sea level accelerations, particularly in the western Pacific (e.g., 0.09 ± 0.05 mm yr−2 at the Kuroshio Current), and in the east and central equatorial Pacific Ocean (e.g., −0.04 ± 0.03 mm yr−2 near Costa Rica).

The goal of updating GFEI is to provide a more accurate spatial representation of the country-reported national inventories, allowing comparison with methane monitoring data. 
 The Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) is a global 0.1° × 0.1° resolution gridded inventory of methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation. Here, we present GFEI v3 with updated national emissions to 2020 using reports submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), leading to new global emissions of 23, 20, and 31 Tg a−1 for oil, gas, and coal, respectively. We also use new geospatial information from the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping database (OGIM v1) for spatial distribution of global oil-gas methane emissions. We use coal mine locations from the Global Energy Monitor's Global Coal Mine Tracker (GCMT), combined with our own estimates for mine-level methane emissions, to distribute national emissions between coal mine locations. Our mine-level methane emission estimates use country specific emission factors for top producing countries supplemented with modeled emission factors based on coal mine depth and grade. We see the greatest change in the spatial distribution of emissions in GFEI v3 compared to v2 in China due to the use of GCMT for coal mine locations. Large point source plumes (super-emitters) observed by the NASA EMIT instrument are co-located with infrastructure identified in GFEI v3, but the magnitude of the measured emissions is poorly correlated with the gridded emissions in GFEI. This may reflect missing or misrepresented sources in GFEI v3 but also the sporadic nature of the super-emitter measurements used here. By aligning GFEI v3 with national UNFCCC reports and using state-of-the-science geospatial information, the inventory can be confronted with satellite observations of atmospheric methane through inverse modeling to evaluate and improve the UNFCCC reports.

We developed a 30 m annual forest aboveground biomass dataset from 1985 to 2023 using satellite data and deep learning. Our results reveal significant biomass gains, regional variations, and the impact of forest policies. This dataset provides valuable insights for climate research, conservation planning, and sustainable forest management. 
 Accurate estimation and monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for understanding carbon dynamics, managing forest resources, and guiding environmental policies. However, the spatial and temporal patterns, dynamics, and driving factors of forest AGB in China over recent decades remain insufficiently understood, hindering ecosystem analysis and forest management strategies. This study combines multi-source remote sensing data with residual neural networks (ResNets) to develop the first 30 m resolution annual China Forest AGB dataset (1985–2023) with uncertainty quantification. Validation results confirm the robustness of the ResNets model, achieving an R2 of 0.91, RMSE of 16.49 Mg ha−1, and Bias of 0.50 Mg ha−1 against GEDI footprint AGBD, and an R2 of 0.63, RMSE of 68.26 Mg ha−1, and Bias of −19.87 Mg ha−1 against independent multi-year ground survey data. The dataset reveals a notable increase in China's average forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) from 95.74 ± 11.30 Mg ha−1 in 1985 to 122.69 ± 13.94 Mg ha−1 in 2023. During this period, total forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stock rose from 5.50 ± 0.23 PgC to 13.97 ± 0.87 PgC, establishing China's forests as a significant carbon sink over the past four decades, with a net carbon sink of 0.22 ± 0.01 PgC yr−1, offsetting 11.5 %–14.9 % of China's annual fossil fuel and industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Forest growth contributed 65.1 % (5.75 PgC) of the total AGC increase, while forest expansion accounted for 34.9 % (3.09 PgC).

Wells;Jinghui Lian;Bo Zheng,Global biogenic isoprene emissions 2013–2020  inferred from satellite isoprene observations,"We present the first global, multi-year maps of monthly isoprene emissions (2013–2020) derived from satellite isoprene observations, averaging 456 TgC yr-1. The dataset reveals two emission peaks linked to 2015–2016 El Niño and 2019–2020 extreme heat events, driven mainly by tropical regions such as the Amazon. It highlights the region-specific sensitivity of biogenic isoprene emissions to temperature anomalies, providing new insights into their roles in air quality and climate feedbacks. 
 Isoprene, the most emitted biogenic volatile organic compound, exerts a remarkable influence on atmospheric oxidation capacity, air quality, and climate. Most existing top-down atmospheric estimates of isoprene emissions rely on observational formaldehyde (HCHO) as an indirect proxy, even though HCHO is produced from multiple precursors. Recent advances in satellite retrievals of isoprene concentrations from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) enable a direct constraint on isoprene emission inversions. Yet global, multi-year isoprene-based atmospheric inversions are still lacking. Here, we present global, monthly biogenic isoprene emission maps spanning 2013–2020, derived from a mass-balance inversion framework that assimilates CrIS-retrieved isoprene columns into the LMDZ-INCA chemistry–transport model. The global biogenic isoprene emissions average is of 456±238 Tg C yr−1 over 2013–2020, which is broadly consistent with existing inventories and HCHO-based inversion estimates. The LMDZ-INCA simulations using this estimate of the emissions exhibit improved spatial agreement and reduced biases relative to two independent satellite HCHO retrieval products and to ground-based optical measurements, confirming the robustness of this inversion framework. The seasonal cycle of emissions is dominated by the Northern Hemisphere, driven by the strong seasonality in temperature and vegetation biomes. Interannually, emissions vary by on average 14 Tg C yr−1 (1-sigma standard deviation). Two major emission peaks are found in 2015–2016 (456 Tg C yr−1) and 2019–2020 (478 Tg C yr−1), coinciding with El Niño and widespread extreme heat-wave events, underscoring the dominant influence of temperature anomalies that increase biogenic emissions. Regional analyses identify the Amazon as the largest contributor to the interannual variability, accounting for 22.3 % of the global interannual variance in isoprene emissions. Temperature emerges as the primary driver of regional interannual emissions, with its influence modulated by leaf area index and radiation to varying degrees across regions. As one of the earliest attempts at a global, multi-year inversion based on isoprene observations, this dataset provides input for air quality and climate-chemistry models.

This product maps a total of 11.97 million fire patches burning 7.3 Mha yr−1 on average. This dataset provides a valuable resource for characterizing the long-term impacts and evolving regimes of global forest fires, which is essential for effective forest management and climate policy. 
 Forest fires exert profound ecological impacts globally. Characterizing their long-term effects and evolving regimes requires consistent, high-resolution fire records over extended periods. The Landsat archive provides a unique foundation for such efforts, offering fine spatial detail with globally coherent, multi-decadal observations. Yet, it remains challenging to generate a globally consistent, Landsat-based fire product with event-level characterization. Here we present a 30 m global forest fire patch dataset spanning 1984–2022, developed from the full Landsat archive to ensure comprehensive fire characterization. We first condensed multi-temporal burned signals from Landsat archive on Google Earth Engine (GEE) using a pixel-based image compositing approach. This approach also reduces noise from clouds and shadows while ensuring high computational efficiency using GEE. We then mapped burned area using artificial neural network modeling across global forests. Finally, we delineated individual fire patches through spatial–temporal clustering and extracted their key attributes. Across global forests, we identified a total of 11.97 million individual fire patches burning 7.3 Mha yr−1over 1984–2022. Validation indicated omission errors ranging from 12.2 % to 36.8 % and commission errors ranging from 6.4 % to 23.2 % across diverse forest types. Intercomparison with existing Landsat products revealed strong agreement in annual burned area estimates and fire patch detection, with discrepancies mainly arising from within-fire delineation and small fire detection. This dataset offers a valuable resource for quantifying fire impacts and advancing the understanding of contemporary and future fire regimes in global forests.

Carrera-Hernández,Mexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB): a new daily high-resolution gridded climate dataset for Mexico covering 1951–2020,"Mexico's High Resolution Database (MexHiResClimDB) provides gridded, high-resolution data (600 m) of daily, monthly and yearly precipitation and Tmin, Tmax, Tavg for the 1951–2020 period. With this new database it was possible to summarize extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico and to show that there is an undeniable warming trend in Mexico; however, further studies are needed in order to pinpoint the areas where climate change is having a profound impact. 
 This work presents Mexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB), which is a newly developed gridded, high-resolution climate dataset comprised of daily, monthly and yearly precipitation and temperature (Tmin, Tmax, Tavg). This new database provides the largest temporal coverage of the aforementioned climate variables at the highest spatial resolution (20 arcsec, or 560 m on Mexico's CCL projection) when compared to the other currently available gridded datasets for Mexico and its development has allowed for the analysis of the country's climate extremes for the 1951–2020 period. By comparing the spatial distribution of precipitation from the MexHiResClimDB with other gridded data (Daymet, L15, CHIRPS and PERSIANN CDR), it was found that the precipitation provided by this new dataset adequately represents the spatial variation of extreme precipitation events, in particular for the precipitation that occurred during 15–16 September  2013, caused by the presence of Tropical storm Manuel in the Pacific Ocean and Hurricane Ingrid (Cat 1) in the Gulf of Mexico. Using data from 61 days retrieved from Automated Weather Stations located throughout Mexico – and correspoding to the two months with the largest precipitation in Mexico – it was found that precipitation data from MexHiResClimDB has the lowest MAE (8.7 mm), compared to those of L15 (9.5 mm), Daymet (10.1 mm) and CHIRPS (11.7 mm). For Tmin and Tmax, the lowest MAE was obtained with MexHiResClimDB (1.7 and 1.8 °C, respectively), followed by Daymet (2.0 °C for both temperatures) and L15 (2.4 and 2.5 °C). With this new database an analysis of the extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico for the 1951–2020 period was undertaken: the wettest year was 1958, the wettest day 26 September 1970, and September of 2013 the wettest month. It was also found that eight out of the ten days with the highest Tmin occurred in 2020, the two months with the highest Tmin were July and August of 2020 and that the six years with the highest Tmin were 2015–2020. When Tmax was analysed, it was found that the hottest day was 15 June 1998, while June of 1998 was the hottest month and 2020 the hottest year, and that the four hottest years occurred between 2011–2020. Nationwide (and considering 1961–1990 as the baseline period), Tmin, Tavg and Tmax have increased, with their anomalies drastically increasing in recent years and reaching values above 1.0 °C in 2020. At the same time, precipitation has also decreased in recent years – which combined with the increase in temperature will have severe impacts on water availability. This new database provides a tool to quantify – in detail – the spatio-temporal variability of climate throughout Mexico.The MexHiResClimDB entire dataset is available on Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7689428.v2, Carrera-Hernández, 2025a)."

This data paper provides 16 years of hourly concentrations and fluxes of 11 solutes and runoff rates (2010–2024) from two runoff gauging stations, one affected by deforestation and one not, illustrating forest-management effects on solute transport processes at the catchment scale. 
 A substantial body of knowledge concerning the functioning of catchments has been derived from the observation and quantification of solute and suspended matter fluxes in rivers. The Wüstebach catchment is a hydrological observatory that is part of the German TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories) network. In 2013, the Eifel National Park undertook a partial deforestation of the spruce forest with the objective of facilitating the regrowth of a natural forest. This data paper presents 16 years of estimated hourly stream-water flux data of nine continuously monitored macro- and micronutrients, as well as dissolved ionic aluminum and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), along with the measured solute concentrations and discharge rates observed in the Wüstebach catchment (from 2010 to 2024).To estimate hourly stream-water fluxes from weekly manual grab samples and event autosampler data, we employed the R software package LOADFLEX, which implements a number of solute prediction methods, including regressions, interpolations, the period-weighted approach, and the more recently developed composite method. A comparison of the predicted nitrate concentrations with hourly nitrate reference data was conducted to assess the optimal prediction approach for the Wüstebach catchment. The analysis showed that the composite model is best suited to calculate the nitrate fluxes. Accordingly, this model was selected to calculate the fluxes of all considered macro- and micronutrients, dissolved aluminum and DOC. Flux data were compiled in the same way for a neighboring reference catchment with similar characteristics but without clear-cutting, in order to identify the effects of deforestation and afforestation on the cycling and transport of nutrients. We anticipate that this comprehensive data set will facilitate new insights into the influence of deforestation and afforestation on solute fluxes at the catchment scale.

Samples are collected via fixed and mobile platforms and processed using a standardized pipeline. The dataset supports observational and modelling analyses of seasonal, spatial, and compositional variability in INPs. 
 Ice nucleating particles (INPs) play a critical role in cloud microphysics and precipitation formation, yet long-term, spatially extensive observational datasets remain limited. Here, we present one of the most comprehensive publicly available datasets of immersion-mode INP concentrations using a single analytical method, generated through the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. INP filter samples have been collected across a broad range of environments – including agricultural plains, Arctic coastlines, high-elevation mountain sites, marine regions, and urban areas – via fixed observatories, mobile facility deployments, and vertically-resolved tethered balloon system operations. We describe the standardized processing and quality assurance pipeline, from filter collection and processing using the Ice Nucleation Spectrometer to final data products archived on the ARM Data Discovery portal. The dataset includes both total INP concentrations and selectively treated samples, allowing for classification of biological, organic, and inorganic INP types. It features a continuous 5-year record of INP measurements from a central U.S. site, with data collection still ongoing. Seasonal and site-specific differences in INP concentrations are illustrated through intercomparisons at −10 and −20 °C, revealing distinct regional sources and atmospheric drivers. We also outline mechanisms for researchers to access existing data, request additional sample analyses, and propose future field campaigns involving ARM INP measurements. This dataset supports a wide range of scientific applications, from observational and mechanistic studies to model development, and provides critical constraints on aerosol-cloud interactions across diverse atmospheric regimes (Creamean et al., 2024, 2020b; https://doi.org/10.5439/1770816)."

The open dataset offers new insights into how Chinese cities expand and renew, supporting research and planning for urban development. 
 Long-term building height data are critical for analyzing urban morphological evolution and renewal processes, yet such datasets at fine spatial resolutions remain scarce for large geographical regions. This study proposes a framework to generate continuous annual building height maps for China at 30 m spatial resolution from 1990 to 2019, integrating multi-source remote sensing data (Landsat, Sentinel-1/2, et al.) through the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. The framework reconstructs Vertical-Vertical (VV) band, incorporates reference data derived from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm, and utilizes Total Variation (TV) denoising to achieve temporal consistency, while retaining inter-annual building height variations. Validation results demonstrate stable performance of the building height estimates over the past three decades, with nationwide RMSE values ranging between 5.96 and 6.69 m. Comparisons with existing datasets confirm consistency with reference building heights and their temporal evolution driven by urban development and renewal. Furthermore, our dataset shows pronounced horizontal and vertical expansion of Chinese cities between 1990 and 2019, as the total impervious surface area increases from 56,413.68 to 174,320.66 km² and overall building volume rises from 471.24 to 884.69 km³. Provincial contributions to national building volume change substantially over time, with Hebei (12.9 %), Shandong (11.4 %), and Henan (10.3 %) leading in 1990, while Shandong (10.0 %), Guangdong (8.0 %) and Jiangsu (8.0 %) are in the leading positions in 2019. The resulting annual 30 m resolution building height datasets, made openly accessible, provide a valuable foundation for cross-city comparisons, long-term three-dimensional (3D) urban morphology studies, and policy-relevant planning in fast-growing Chinese cities."

 Measurements of methane (CH4) molecules containing two rare isotopes (13CH3D and 12CH2D2), also termed doubly substituted or “clumped” isotopologues, have the potential to provide two additional isotopic dimensions to help investigate the mechanisms underlying global atmospheric trends in CH4. In this work, we summarise the current state of research on doubly substituted CH4 isotopologues, with an emphasis on compiling results of all relevant work. The database comprises 1475 records compiled from the literature published until April 2025 (https://doi.org/10.5285/51ae627da5fb41b8a767ee6c653f83e6, Defratyka et al., 2025). For field samples, 40 % of records were sourced from natural gas reservoirs, while microbial terrestrial (e.g., agriculture, lake, wetland) samples account only for 12.5 %. Lakes samples contribute 75 % to collected microbial terrestrial samples. There is limited or no representation of samples coming from significant microbial CH4 sources to the atmosphere, like wetlands, agricultural practices and landfills. To date, laboratory experiments were mostly focused on microbial (28 % of samples from laboratory experiments) and pyrogenic (15 %) methanogenesis or anaerobic (16 %), and aerobic (8 %) CH4 oxidation, with only single study of photochemical oxidation via OH and Cl, which constitutes 5 % of the laboratory experiments entries. The distinct ranges of Δ13CH3D and Δ12CH2D2 values measured in these studies suggests their potential to improve our understanding of atmospheric CH4.

 In recent decades, the climate of Tibetan Plateau has undergone notable changes, which has a strong influence on global climate systems and human activities, making it a research hotspot.

Through a clever use of differences between weather station measurements and reanalysis data, we estimated more realistic surface roughness values and created a new high-resolution map for China. This map greatly improves wind speed simulations and supports better decisions in wind-related fields. 
 Aerodynamic roughness length (z0) is a key parameter determining near-surface wind profiles, significantly influencing wind-related studies and applications. In high-roughness surface areas, surface roughness has been substantially altered by land use changes such as urbanization. However, many numerical models still assign long-standing and fixed z0 based on traditional land cover types, neither accounting for shifts in land cover nor updating class-specific z0, leaving z0 values in high-roughness surface regions outdated and unreliable. To address this issue, this study proposed a cost-effective method to estimate z0 values at weather stations by adjusting z0 values to minimize the wind speed differences between ERA5 reanalysis data and weather station observation data. Using this approach, z0 values were derived for 1837 stations in the high-roughness surface areas across China. Based on these estimates, a high-resolution monthly gridded z0 dataset was then developed for high-roughness surface areas in China using Random Forest Regression algorithm. Simulations with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model show that implementation of the new z0 dataset significantly improves the accuracy of 10 m wind speed over high-roughness surface areas, reducing mean wind speed errors by 79.8 % and 78.0 % compared to the default z0 in WRF and a latest gridded z0 dataset from Peng et al. (2022), respectively. Independent validations of 100 m wind speed against anemometer tower data further confirm the dataset's reliability. Therefore, this approach is valuable for wind-dependent studies and applications, such as urban planning, air quality management, and wind energy utilization, by enabling more accurate simulations of wind speed in high-roughness surface areas."

ACCESS-CM2-025 is more energetic and performs better in regions of elevated ocean mesoscale variability such as at western boundary currents. The higher resolution ACCESS-CM2-025 also features a more realistic ENSO life cycle and seasonality, with a reduced biennality, which is common in the lower resolution ACCESS-CM2-1. Both ACCESS-CM2 models share many biases, particularly near the sea surface and also affecting sea ice coverage, reflecting insufficiency in the atmospheric model component. While ACCESS-CM2-025 exhibits improved time-mean deep convection, sea ice, and mixed layer depth in the North Atlantic, it also experiences multidecadal variability, which is evident in many variables, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation."

FRISIA includes previously uncaptured coastal socio-economic feedback and a diverse set of impact strains, thereby improving the represenation of SLR impacts in IAMs. Here we describe the baseline behaviour of FRISIA, explore the effects of the additional feedback and showcase the coupling of FRISIA to an IAM. 
 Global warming is expected to lead to a substantial rise in coastal sea levels by the end of the century, which imposes future impacts and adaptation challenges on the coastal zone. Capturing the socio-economic costs of sea level rise (SLR) is therefore an important component of climate impacts in integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, there is a lack of process-based models of SLR impacts with a focus on global, time-varying dynamics. Current SLR impact models often follow a cost-benefit analysis approach, fail to represent diverse pathways of SLR impacts, or do not include coastal adaptation. Here, we present the Feedback-based knowledge Repository for Integrated assessments of Sea level rise Impacts and Adaptation version 1.0 (FRISIAv1.0), a model designed for process-based, non-equilibrium IAMs that follows a system dynamics approach. FRISIA's SLR component is based on existing models of SLR, while its impact component is a substantially modified adaptation of the Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) for use in globally or regionally aggregated models. While a reduced-feedback version of FRISIA approximately reproduces CIAM results, the integration of additional feedbacks in FRISIA leads to emerging new behaviours, such as a potential peak and decline in SLR-driven storm surge damages in the early 22nd century, due to economic feedbacks in the coastal zone. When coupling FRISIA to an IAM, global GDP is reduced by 1.5 %–6.2 % (17th–83rd percentile range) under the mean SSP5-8.5 global-mean sea level rise from the IPCC's AR6 report (0.77 m by 2100) and no coastal adaptation, which is in the range of previous studies. The coupling of a diverse set of SLR impact streams from FRISIA into a system dynamics IAM has the advantage of leading to a wide range of socio-economic consequences that go beyond just a reduction in global GDP, such as an effect on inflation. Our simulations highlight the benefits of accounting for dynamic coastal feedback and coupling diverse SLR impact and cost strains to IAMs, and showcase that FRISIAv1.0 is a useful tool for doing so."

This model can help to improve data input for large-scale sea-ice models. Results show a linear relationship between the proportion of ice floes in the field and the overall viscosity. Additionally, we found that viscosity responds nonlinearly to the inclusion of thermodynamic sea-ice growth. 
 We present WIce-FOAM 1.0, a numerical model built on OpenFOAM that couples the dynamics and thermodynamics of heterogeneous sea ice to analyse waves' response in marginal ice zone regions composed of consolidated ice floes and interstitial grease ice. The model represents prototypical conditions on the 5 km scale, where each 10 m grid cell classified as ice floe or grease ice may contain both ice types, but are predominantly occupied by one. Our model aims to study the mean shear viscosity of heterogeneous sea ice to bridge the gap with larger-scale ocean-sea ice models in which sub-grid details and wave effects are neglected. We tested the model in the Southern Ocean using a realistic sea-ice field from a SAR satellite image and complemented our analysis by idealised simulations. The thermodynamic model was coupled online to optimize the stiffness of the process scales and to explicitly account for the distinct characteristics of different ice types. We first investigated the dynamic response of sea ice to one-way wave forcing across a range of wave periods and directions. The results show that the domain-averaged sea-ice viscosity is scale invariant from approximately 800 m to 5 km and is primarily governed by the relative proportion of ice floes to grease ice, with less sensitivity to wave periods and directions. While the wave direction affects the local strain rate and viscosity, and the presence and orientation of narrow connections between the larger ice floes significantly influence the mean viscosity, these effects do not break the observed scale invariance. Finally, we demonstrate that, despite the different time scales, the mean viscosity responds nonlinearly to the inclusion of thermodynamic sea-ice growth. This model represents a first step towards a mechanistic understanding and description of heterogeneous sea ice, which is common in the Antarctic and is increasing in the warming Arctic. It can be used to design field experiments and to derive parametrisations of waves-in-ice response for large-scale sea-ice models."

 Traffic in urban areas is an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. Estimating traffic-related emissions is therefore a key component in compiling a city emission inventory. Inventories are fundamental for understanding, monitoring, managing, and mitigating local pollutant emissions.We present DRIVE v1.0, a data-driven framework to calculate road transport emissions based on a multi-modal macroscopic traffic model, vehicle class-specific traffic counting data from more than a hundred counting stations, and HBEFA emission factors.

In addition, we use traffic counting data to estimate the uncertainty of traffic activity and the resulting emission estimates at different temporal aggregation levels and with road link resolution. The framework was applied to the City of Munich, covering an area of 311 km2 and accounting for GHGs (CO2, CH4) and air pollutants (PM, CO, NOx). It captures irregular events such as COVID lockdowns and holiday periods well and is suitable for use in near real-time applications. Emission estimates for 2019–2022 are presented and differences in city totals and spatial distribution compared to the official municipal reported and national and European downscaled inventories are examined."

It directly impacts the local atmospheric conditions and the road surface temperature. These impacts are included in the numerical model of the Town Energy Balance, used to simulate local conditions in urbanised environments. Simulations show that road traffic has a significant impact on the road surface temperature up to a few degrees, and on local variables. 
 The impact of road traffic on local climate has often been overlooked, being modelled as an aggregated sensible heat flux released into the atmosphere, although it has multiple effects including turbulence, heat from energy inefficiencies of vehicles, tyre friction, snow compaction, and shadowing. These effects can impact road surface conditions and exacerbate the phenomenon of Urban Heat Island (UHI). This study aims to improve the representation of traffic impacts in the Town Energy Balance (TEB) V9.0 urban climate model. Particular attention has been paid to preserve physical consistency among the parameterisations of tyre friction, turbulence, energy inefficiencies, and radiation impacts of the road traffic within the model. In addition, a method has been developed to model the average engine efficiency of the entire automobile fleet with internal combustion engines (ICEs) using the Worldwide Harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycles (WLTC). The new parameterisations are evaluated using observations from two road weather stations in southern Finland, Nupuri and Palojärvi, which are characterised by clear commuting patterns. To evaluate the new traffic parameterisation, road surface temperature (RST) differences between the two road carriageways are used to isolate the traffic-induced effects from the natural factors. The results show that the new parameterisation is able to simulate the traffic-induced impacts on road surface temperatures. In addition, wind-induced impact and rolling friction have been shown to drive traffic effects on RST. Taking explicitly into account the traffic impacts might be better suited to simulate their actual impacts on the local scale."

It builds on the LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 and 8.1 papers published in GMD: whereas LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 focussed on GPU-parallelisation, and LISFLOOD-FP 8.1 focussed on static mesh adaptivity of (multi)wavelets, LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 combines GPU (graphics processing unit)-parallelisation with multiwavelet dynamic mesh adaptivity to drastically reduce simulation runtimes, achieving up to a 4.5-fold speedup. 
 The second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver of the two-dimensional shallow water equations in the raster-based LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 hydrodynamic modelling framework is mostly suited for predicting small-scale transients that emerge in rapid, multiscale floods caused by impact events like tsunamis. However, this DG2 solver can only be used for simulations on a uniform grid where it may yield inefficient runtimes even when using its graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelised version (GPU-DG2). To boost efficiency, the new LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 version integrates GPU parallelised dynamic (in time) grid resolution adaptivity of multiwavelets (MW) with the DG2 solver (GPU-MWDG2). The GPU-MWDG2 solver performs dyadic grid refinement, starting from a single grid cell, with a maximum refinement level, L, based on the resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Furthermore, the dynamic GPU-MWDG2 adaptivity is driven by one error threshold, ε, against normalised details of all prognostic variables. Its accuracy and efficiency, as well as the practical validity of recommended ε choices between 10−4 and 10−3, are assessed for four laboratory/field-scale benchmarks of tsunami-induced flooding with different impact event complexities (i.e. single- vs. multi-peaked) and L values. Rigorous accuracy and efficiency metrics consistently show that GPU-MWDG2 simulations with ε = 10−3 preserve the predictions of the GPU-DG2 simulation on the uniform DEM grid, whereas ε = 10−4 may slightly improve velocity-related predictions. Efficiency-wise, GPU-MWDG2 yields considerable speedups from L ≥ 10 – due to its scalability on the GPU with increasing L – which can be around 2.0-to-4.5-fold. Generally, the bigger the L ≥ 10, the lower the event complexity over the simulated duration, and the closer the ε to 10−3, the larger the GPU-MWDG2 speedups over GPU-DG2. The LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 code is open source, under the GPL v3.0 licence, as well as the simulated benchmarks' set-up files and datasets, with a video tutorial and further documentation on https://www.seamlesswave.com/Adaptive (last access: 6 July 2025)."

This study shows improvements in introduced into the IFS-COMPO (Integrated Forecast System-COMPOsition) simulating the surface concentrations of SIA and the resulting changes in the total wet deposition for Europe, the US and South-East Asia. 
 Secondary Inorganic Aerosol (SIA) makes up a considerable fraction of the total particulate matter exposure and, thus, is an important product from any forecasting system of atmospheric composition and air quality. The subsequent loss to the surface of SIA via dry and wet deposition determines the duration of the exposure time for humans and the extent of acidification imposed on sensitive ecosystems. Here we provide a description and evaluation of the most recent updates made towards aerosol production, aerosol scavenging and wet deposition components of the global Integrated Forecast System-COMPOsition (IFS-COMPO) chemical forecasting system, which is used as part of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. The implementation of the EQSAM4Clim simplified thermodynamic module in IFS-COMPO, for use in cycle 49R1, changes the efficacy of phase transfer of SIA precursor gases (sulphur dioxide, nitric acid and ammonia) which significantly impacts the respective SIA particulate concentrations by changing the fraction converted into SIA. Comparisons made against observational composites at the surface for Europe, the US, and Southeast Asia during 2018 show reductions in the global yearly mean bias statistics for both sulphates and nitrates. Updating the IFS-COMPO model towards cycle 49r1 increases both the burden and lifetime of sulphate and ammonium particles by one third. Coupling EQSAM4Clim into IFS-COMPO provides a better description of the partitioning between state phases involving ammonia and ammonium across regions, whereas changes for sulphate are minimal. For nitric acid and nitrates, the partitioning changes significantly, leading to lower particulate concentrations and a corresponding increase in gas-phase nitric acid with an associated improvement in surface nitrate. There is also a shift in the particle size distribution, with less nitrate production in the coarse mode and more in the fine mode. The impact on the total regional wet deposition values is generally positive, except for sulphates in the US and ammonium particles in Southeast Asia which are strongly influenced by the precursor emission estimates. This provides confidence that this update to IFS-COMPO has the ability to provide accurate deposition fluxes of S and N at global scale."

We use four case studies to demonstrate the functionalities introduced to r.avaflow  v4 and to discuss the related chances and challenges: (i) a generic planar rock slide with interlayer shearing, and (ii)–(iv) semi-generic representations of the prehistoric Köfels rock slide (Austria), the prehistoric East Fogo landslide and tsunami (Cape Verde), and the Dösen rock glacier (Austria). Our results clearly reveal the high potential of the additional functionalities to widen the scope of r.avaflow beyond the simulation of extremely rapid and freely deforming mass flows. Combinations of the layered model, mechanically controlled deformation, and the slow-flow model unlock potentials yet barely explored in the field of GIS-based landslide simulations. In addition, the layered model facilitates a more realistic simulation of landslide-reservoir interactions. We also highlight the limitations regarding the physical basis and the application of the functionalities presented.

 Mechanistic vegetation models serve to estimate terrestrial carbon fluxes and climate impacts on ecosystems across diverse biotic and abiotic conditions.

We estimated model parameters simultaneously from observed time series of ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP), and from globally distributed data on leaf carbon-13 isotopic discrimination (Δ13C) and the ratio of the maximum biochemical rates of carboxylation to electron transport (Vcmax/Jmax). The multi-target calibration yielded unbiased predictions for all variables simultaneously and produced similar distributions of prediction–observation residuals for both calibration and out-of-sample test data, indicating that the model generalises robustly across diverse environments. We found that a step-wise approach to successive model integration and calibration yielded best results, and that correlations among parameters related to the representation of water stress effects underpinned non-robust parameter estimations. This likely indicates a dominant source of model structural uncertainty related to the representation of the response of photosynthesis to dry conditions in soil and air."

 When a new, better-formulated physical parameterization is introduced into a global atmospheric model, aspects of the global model solutions are sometimes degraded. Then, in order to use the new global model to address science questions, there is an incentive to restore its accuracy.  Oftentimes this restoration is achieved by tuning of model parameter values. Unfortunately, the retuning process is expensive because characterizing the parameter dependence requires numerous time-consuming global simulations.To reduce the cost of tuning, this manuscript introduces a “poor man's” model tuner, “QuadTune”. QuadTune carves the globe into regions and approximates the model parameter dependence through the use of an uncorrelated quadratic emulator (i.e., response surface). The simplicity of the emulator reduces the required number of global model simulations and aids explainability of tuner behavior.Tuning removes parametric error but leaves behind model structural error. Structural error manifests itself as regional residual biases, such as stubborn biases and tuning trade-offs. To visualize these residual biases, QuadTune's software includes a set of diagnostic plots. This paper illustrates the use of the plots for characterizing residual biases with an example tuning problem."

 Volcanic eruptions are one of the major natural hazards, exerting profound effects on the environment and climate.

Traditional models struggle with accuracy, especially for heavy rain. Our model merges data from multiple forecasts, capturing detailed rainfall patterns and offering more reliable short-term predictions. 
 Accurate short-term quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) is critical for disaster prevention, mitigation, and socio-economic activities. However, due to the inherent limitations of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, precipitation forecasts still exhibit substantial inaccuracies. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly applied to improve precipitation forecasts, yet these approaches often produce overly smoothed outputs that fail to meet operational requirements for detail and accuracy. In this study, we propose a Generative Fusion Residual Network (GFRNet), a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework that integrates multi-source NWP forecasts to generate 3-hourly quantitative precipitation forecasts for North China up to 24 h in advance. GFRNet employs an adversarial learning mechanism to enhance spatial structure reconstruction, combined with a weighted loss function and carefully designed sampling strategies to address the long-tailed distribution of precipitation and improve model training efficiency. Using independent rainy-season datasets from 2022–2024, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of GFRNet against three NWP models, a linear ensemble method (MSEM), and a deep learning baseline model (FRNet). Results show that GFRNet consistently outperforms the NWPs and baseline models across light, moderate, and heavy rainfall thresholds. Compared to the China Meteorological Administration's highest-resolution regional model (CMA-3KM), GFRNet improves Threat Scores (TS) by 4 %, 28 %, 35 %, and 19 % at the 0.1, 10, 20, and 40 mm thresholds, respectively, and improves Fractions Skill Scores (FSS) by 13 %, 18 %, and 15 % at the 10, 20, and 40 mm thresholds. Moreover, GFRNet consistently achieves the highest Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) scores and significantly reduces RMSE, demonstrating robust spatial structure recovery, stable intensity control, and strong generalization ability. These advantages are particularly pronounced in systemic high-impact heavy rainfall events, underscoring the model's operational value. FRNet shows advantages in forecasting heavy precipitation but suffers from high BIAS and weaker generalization, limiting its practical applicability. MSEM exhibits robust performance in light and moderate precipitation scenarios but degrades significantly under extreme precipitation conditions.

The forecasts are produced daily and provide sea ice concentration predictions for the next 10 days. We evaluate the MET-AICE forecasts from the first year of operation, and we compare them to forecasts produced by three physically-based models. We show that MET-AICE is skillful and provides more accurate forecasts than the physically-based models. 
 There is an increasing need for reliable short-term sea ice forecasts that can support maritime operations in polar regions. While numerous studies have shown the potential of machine learning for sea ice forecasting, there are currently only a few operational data-driven sea ice prediction systems. Here, we introduce MET-AICE, a prediction system providing sea ice concentration forecasts for the next 10 d in the European Arctic. To our knowledge, it is the first operational data-driven prediction system designed for short-term sea ice forecasting. MET-AICE has been trained to predict sea ice concentration observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) at 5 km resolution. After one year of operation, we show that MET-AICE considerably outperforms persistence of AMSR2 observations (errors about 30 % lower on average), as well as forecasts from several dynamical models such as TOPAZ5, Barents-2.5 km and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System."

Wunch,A U.S. Scientific Community Vision for Sustained Earth Observations of Greenhouse Gases to Support Local to Global Action,"Managing carbon stocks in the land, ocean, and atmosphere under changing climate requires a globally‐integrated view of carbon cycle processes at local and regional scales. The growing Earth Observation (EO) record is the backbone of this multi‐scale system, providing local information with discrete coverage from surface measurements and regional information at global scale from satellites. Carbon flux information, anchored by inverse estimates from spaceborne Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentrations, provides an important top‐down view of carbon emissions and sinks, but currently lacks global continuity at assessment and management scales (<100 km). Partial‐column data can help separate signals in the boundary layer from the overlying atmosphere, providing an opportunity to enhance surface sensitivity and bring flux resolution down from that of column‐integrated data (100–500 km). Based on a workshop held in September 2024, the carbon cycle community envisions a carbon observation system leveraging GHG partial columns in the lower and upper troposphere to weave together information across scales from surface and satellite EO data, and integration of top‐down/bottom‐up analyses to link process understanding to global assessment."

Lora,Widespread Increase in Atmospheric River Frequency and Impacts Over the 20th Century,"Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a dominant role in water resource availability in many regions, and can cause substantial hazards, including extreme precipitation, flooding, and moist heatwaves. Despite this, there is substantial uncertainty about recent and ongoing changes in AR frequency and impacts. Here, we place recent observed trends in their longer‐term context using AR records extending back to 1940. Our results show that AR frequency has increased broadly across the midlatitudes, bridging the apparent discrepancy between the observed satellite‐era poleward shift and the general increase simulated in climate change projections. This increase in AR frequency enhances AR‐associated precipitation and snowfall across their region of influence in the mid‐ and high‐latitudes. We also find that, despite warmer surface temperatures associated with ARs, there is a decrease in the magnitude of AR‐associated temperature anomalies in high‐latitude regions due to Arctic amplification. An increase in AR‐associated humid heatwaves underscores the societal importance of changing AR activity."

A rotational bulge stabilizes the orientation of planets. Having only a tiny stabilizer, the rotational pole of Venus has been expected to separate from the figure pole in response to mantle flow, which has been used to explain why both poles are observed to be 0.5° apart. Here, we couple 3D mantle‐convection simulations and polar motion dynamics to explore how mantle flow, and in particular surface mobilization, drives Venus's polar motion. We provide a predictive framework for polar motion on slow rotators and show that the spin/figure pole separation (or offset) follows a simple law: it scales with the figure‐axis drift rate times the planet's Chandler period. Contrary to prior expectations, stronger internal loading does not amplify the offset, and the mantle‐driven polar motion is smooth rather than wobbly, more similar to that of fast rotators. In models matching Venus's geoid, figure‐axis drift rates reach only up to a few °/Myr, too slow compared to ca. 60°/Myr that is needed to match the observed offset. We therefore exclude mantle convection as the cause of Venus' spin and figure poles separation, and suggest that atmospheric and solid tides are not balanced instead."

However, not including end‐users, especially decision‐makers representing communities vulnerable to climate change, can limit model utility, increase epistemic risks, and lead to information misuse in decision‐making. While the ESM community increasingly values broad community engagement, end‐users may not initially perceive models as useful for local planning. Co‐designing models with end‐users fosters two‐way learning: users better understand models and their outputs, while modelers gain insights into fine‐scale local processes like monitoring practices and management priorities. Higher‐level co‐design can lead to more customized, priority‐driven, and useful modeling products. Despite these benefits, modelers often struggle to initiate meaningful partnerships with local communities. Therefore, this paper explores model co‐design from the perspective of modelers. This study presents two case studies where modelers and social scientists collaborated with Indigenous communities' decision‐makers to reflect their priorities in model design and application. In the Arctic Rivers Project, high‐resolution climate and hydrology data sets for Alaska were developed with guidance from an Indigenous Advisory Council, using optimized, coupled land‐atmosphere models. In the Mid‐Klamath Project, we partnered with the Karuk Tribe's Department of Natural Resources to assess climate change and prescribed burning impacts on terrestrial hydrology in the Klamath River Basin. Drawing from these studies, we introduce a four‐level framework: (a) Co‐design Configuration; (b) Model Tuning; (c) Incorporate Contextual Knowledge; (d) Co‐develop New Model Functions. We aim to help researchers consider and compare co‐design across diverse modeling projects systematically and coherently."

While previous studies have emphasized the role of large‐scale climate modes in this variability, the contribution of synoptic‐scale storms remains unclear. Using oceanic observations and the ERA5 reanalysis, we conduct a mixed‐layer heat budget analysis during storm‐active and storm‐weak periods within 1950–2020. Our results reveal that frequent storms contribute to a cumulative cooling of Tm, primarily through anomalous meridional Ekman heat transport.

Unlike isolated events such as the COVID‐19 lockdown, the Spring Festivals offer a more robust decade‐long (2015–2024) data set. Analysis of these observations reveals a striking shift in oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) response from negative to positive values over time despite similar emission reduction patterns each year. Chemical transport modeling indicates that meteorological factors are the primary drivers of these variations. Machine learning analysis further identifies cloud cover and radiation changes as controlling factors, with strong correlations between ΔOx and meteorological parameters (R = 0.85–0.94) across all regions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about emission control effectiveness, showing that meteorological variability overrides expected chemical responses.

This study uses a template matching approach with seismic data from temporary nodal and permanent stations to detect and locate DLP earthquakes near the LVC between 2017 and 2024.

Mixed‐effect models incorporated reservoir‐specific coefficients relating Secchi depth to water storage volume.

Reservoirs in west and central Texas tended to experience more severe drawdown and more pronounced loss of water clarity during drawdown.

Under low normal stress conditions (<4.0 MPa), permeability is enhanced during shearing due to dilation on intact asperities. With increasing normal stress, asperities break and gouge is formed, leading to a normal stress‐related transition where permeability tends to decrease during shearing.

The experiments, performed at conditions consistent with ∼4 km deep geothermal reservoir, yield evolved friction coefficients of ∼0.48 for limestone and ∼0.61 for dolostone, whereas the silicate‐carbonate fault gouges exhibit ∼0.55. Dolostone gouges exhibit unstable sliding at low displacement rates, whereas the limestone and silicate‐carbonate gouges are stable at all investigated conditions, with the dolostone and silicate‐carbonate samples exhibiting the most significant microstructural strain localization.

Its seasonality, however, shows an out‐of‐phase relation between sea surface temperature (SST) (peaking in December–February, DJF) and wind (peaking in June–August, JJA) indices that remain unclear. Through a mixed‐layer heat budget analysis, we reveal that thermodynamical wind‐evaporation‐SST feedback dominates SPMM‐SST growth, with its efficiency controlled by the seasonal cycle of mixed‐layer depth, dominating SPMM seasonality. Dynamical processes suppress SPMM‐SST anomalies, with meridional advection acting as the dominant damping mechanism in both JJA and DJF, and being particularly strong in JJA. Stronger meridional advection damping in JJA enlarges the DJF peak of SPMM‐SST, indicating a role beyond thermodynamics.

Composite analysis demonstrates that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation induced winds are largely responsible for variations in latent heat flux, which alter MLD and modulate the subduction rates. In addition, a west‐strong/east‐weak subduction rate pattern in 1963–1978 and a west‐weak/east‐strong subduction rate pattern in 1998–2011 are observed.

Enhanced drop coalescence from turbulence substantially increases the production of drizzle embryos just above cloud base, which in turn act as seeds that accelerate rain drop growth at mid and upper cloud levels even in highly polluted conditions. In contrast, pollution aerosols strongly inhibit rainfall when the commonly assumed gravitational‐only collision kernel is used and turbulent coalescence is neglected. Overall, turbulence‐enhanced drop coalescence strongly influences the response of warm cumulus clouds and precipitation to aerosol loading, suggesting that the effects of turbulent coalescence should be included in Earth system model representations of aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions and aerosol indirect radiative forcing."

Moreover, a fault barrier at ∼6 km south of the station is inferred by the reversed‐polarity fault‐parallel secondary pulse following the main pulse, interpreted as a stopping phase.

After correcting for SMB‐induced elastic deformation, we find that most GPS sites in the TAM region exhibit velocities approaching zero, with a median rate of 0.67 mm/yr.

This study diagnoses mortality trends in EM‐DAT, the largest public disaster mortality database, using a nonstationary Poisson‐Generalized Pareto statistical model. Several trends in frequency and/or intensity of deadly hazards are identified and discussed. Most notably, Asian floods and storms became less deadly and frequent due to reduced vulnerability via increased adaptive capacity, which is conservatively estimated to have saved 350,000 (95% CI: 220,000–560,000) lives. Storm Daniel in 2023 is also found to be a once‐in‐two‐centuries outlier event indeadliness for an African flood or storm.

Here we report on laboratory shearing experiments on natural samples from the localized shear plane of a well‐instrumented, active, slow landslide within the Franciscan mélange in central California. The shear plane material exhibits velocity strengthening frictional behavior over a range of slip velocities (0.001–30 µm/s), consistent with velocity strengthening friction previously inferred from field observations of landslide motion and pore pressure. Our results suggest that laboratory measurements of frictional rheology may provide a pathway to predict landslide behavior in the Franciscan as well as other lithologies. Fundamentally, our experimental data suggest that slow slip transients may arise in velocity strengthening material across a range of geologic and tectonic settings through the modulation of effective stress."

Here, simultaneous observations of thermospheric meridional winds and ionospheric electron density from the Sanya Incoherent Scatter Radar (SYISR) reveal that the terdiurnal tide (TDT), a crucial agent in atmosphere‐ionosphere coupling, is strongly correlated with ionospheric F‐layer oscillations on a day‐to‐day basis. During a major sudden stratospheric warming in 2024, day‐to‐day variability of both the TDT amplitudes and F‐layer oscillations exhibited pronounced modulation by enhanced planetary waves (PWs). Bispectral analysis revealed nonlinear interactions between PWs, the TDT, and secondary waves at lower and upper sidebands. The ionospheric bispectrum showed peaks shifted toward shorter periods than the PWs themselves. Numerical simulations indicate that variations in magnetospheric forcing modify the ionospheric response to PW‐modulated tides. Our results clarify how the ionosphere responds to coupled lower atmospheric and geospace disturbances on daily timescales."

Here, we analyze Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) deployed across both the forearc and incoming plate regions to investigate the S‐wave velocity structure beneath the central Mariana subduction zone. Using multi‐frequency receiver functions and surface‐wave dispersion data, we apply a transdimensional Bayesian joint inversion that accounts for water‐layer effects to obtain high‐resolution images of the subsurface structure. Our results confirm significant mantle hydration and reveal a distinct low‐velocity zone at the LAB. Unlike previous studies that depict the LAB as a single boundary, our results indicate a rapid velocity decrease followed by an equally sharp increase, delineating a ∼15 km thick melt‐rich zone. The existence of such a melt‐rich zone may reduce mantle viscosity and facilitate decoupling between the lithosphere and asthenosphere."

However, the impacts of submerged canopies on sediment transport have not been fully quantified. This study used model Vallisneria denseserrulata to construct submerged flexible canopies in a mobile bed. Velocity, turbulence, and bedload transport were measured for a range of canopy submergence and density and compared with theoretical models predicting near‐bed turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and bedload transport. Within a submerged canopy, the near‐bed TKE includes not only bed‐ and stem‐generated TKE, but also TKE generated in the shear‐layer at the canopy top. The prediction of near‐bed TKE and transport rate within submerged canopies improved when the contribution from canopy‐shear layer‐generated TKE was included. The proposed model can accurately evaluate sediment transport and thus increase the prediction accuracy of vegetated landscapes, providing guidance for the maintenance and restoration of rivers, wetlands and deltas."

To investigate the kinematic behavior of the High Pamir Plateau, we derive a geodetic slip model for the 2023 Mw 6.9 Pamir earthquake by using Sentinel‐1A and ALOS‐2 InSAR data.

Notably, the 2015 and 2023 ruptures extend to ∼20 km depth—deeper than typical Tibetan Plateau earthquakes—likely due to the thermal influence of the underlying cratonic lithosphere.

This study investigates a barite BaSO4 $\left(BaS{O}_{4}\right)$ precipitation process that forms a thin, low‐permeability layer between parallel flows. Three‐dimensional core‐scale flooding experiments are conducted in Berea sandstone to induce internal transverse mixing and precipitation. X‐ray imaging, axial pressure drop observations, and core plugs extracted along the transverse direction characterize the spatial distribution of the precipitation and its effects on permeability. The transverse thickness of the resulting precipitation layer increases with axial (downstream) distance according to a (square‐root) power law. On the other hand, the reduction in (transverse) permeability within the precipitation layer is more severe near the injection sources. A high‐resolution three‐dimensional reactive transport model is reconciled with observations using an empirical porosity‐permeability relation. This understanding is foundational to furthering emerging methods for scale mitigation and the design of flow control strategies."

Our analysis reveals that both extreme positive and negative IOD (EXpIOD/EXnIOD) events could enhance rainfall over western South Asia during August–September, even when ENSO signals are removed. This asymmetric influence arises from moisture convergence driven by anomalous winds. AGCM simulations indicate that EXpIOD‐related suppressed convection over the eastern pole induces a westward‐extended Gill‐type anticyclone, whose southwesterlies reinforce the background monsoon and promote orographic rainfall near the Western Ghats. Contrastingly, EXnIOD features an eastward‐shifted dipole; positive convection in the east drives a cyclonic circulation that transports Bay of Bengal moisture westward. This flow converges with cross‐equatorial southwesterlies generated by the western pole, enhancing rainfall over western India. These results suggest that the pattern asymmetry between EXpIOD and EXnIOD is a key factor that deserves consideration when assessing IOD‐monsoon interactions."

Two typical events show diffuse auroral patches associated with upstream dynamic pressure enhancements of the bow shock and magnetospheric compressions, followed by their east–west propagations. The statistical results suggest that most conjunction events were associated with foreshock activities, while the remaining events were associated with dynamic pressure enhancements in the pristine solar wind. These azimuthal motions can be either eastward or westward, with initial locations at ∼12–13 and ∼9–10 Magnetic Local Time, respectively, exhibiting a dawn‐dusk asymmetry. Additionally, poleward motions were found in all events. Larger dynamic pressure enhancements correspond to faster poleward motions and could push the initial diffuse auroral brightening toward lower latitudes.

Observations and numerical simulations reveal a robust polar–low‐latitude teleconnection: the March Arctic stratospheric polar vortex (ASPV) strongly modulates March–April compound dry–hot conditions across the region. When the March ASPV weakens, anomalous easterlies in the lower Arctic stratosphere induce corresponding tropospheric easterlies and persist through April, cooling Siberia and accelerating the mid‐latitude westerlies. The resulting anticyclonic shear drives an anomalous anticyclone over northern South and Southeast Asia. Combined with the region's climatologically dry–hot season, these processes promote compound dry–hot conditions further amplified by positive soil moisture–atmosphere feedback.

We employed an MCS tracking method PyFLEXTRKR, which can identify and track MCSs based on precipitation and brightness temperature. The CPM effectively captures key MCS characteristics, including lifetime, lifecycle total precipitation amount, and movement speed. However, it also has systematic biases: the model underestimates MCS size and meso‐α MCS frequency while overestimating meso‐β MCS occurrence and both mean and maximum MCSs precipitation intensities. Despite these biases, the model captures increasing (decreasing) trends in total and MCS precipitation over Manchuria and eastern China (Taiwan). In contrast, it struggles to reproduce observed total and MCS precipitation trends over North China Plain (NCP) and the Korean Peninsula (KP). These biases stem from the model's inability to capture enhanced moisture transport into East Asia, resulting in an underestimation of low‐level moisture over NCP and KP, as indicated by trends in vertically integrated moisture flux and 850 hPa specific humidity.

Recent studies report an anti‐Twomey phenomenon, where cloud droplet effective radius (Re) exhibits a positive correlation with aerosol optical depth (AOD), contrary to the classical Twomey effect. Using long‐term satellite and reanalysis data over East Asia, we found a strong positive Re‐AOD correlation. Further analysis reveals that AOD, as a column‐integrated quantity, lacks aerosol vertical information and cannot fully represent cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), potentially misleading the interpretation of the Twomey effect. Consequently, we analyzed aerosol vertical profiles and introduced a metric, Elevated Aerosol Ratio (EAratio), defined as the ratio of aerosol concentration integrals above and below clouds. Higher EAratio values correlated with a stronger anti‐Twomey phenomenon, while lower values aligned with the classical Twomey effect. Notably, the anti‐Twomey phenomenon primarily appeared under low liquid water path (LWP) conditions: as LWP increased, both the anti‐Twomey phenomenon and the influence of EAratio diminished. Moreover, the marine anti‐Twomey phenomenon is linked to pollution. Elevated aerosol layers in heavily polluted nearshore areas—driven by anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric dispersion—distort the Re‐AOD relationship. Additionally, while coarse aerosols suppress marine anti‐Twomey phenomenon, the EAratio‐based analysis remains valid when excluding their influence as much as possible.

Results reveal that the quasi‐Lagrangian captures the intensity and its variabilities more robustly during RI than the Eulerian framework, particularly highlighting the rapid increase in EKE (Eddy Kinetic Energy). Energy budget analysis shows that warm BoB regions serve as primary energy sources for RI, with the baroclinic conversion term emerging as the dominant driver of EKE during intensification. Additionally, the study shows that RI and non‐RI TC trajectories are statistically distinct, with RI TCs showing more northward movement and non‐RI TCs predominantly moving westward. Analysis of composite sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies reveals correlations with RI TC tracks, indicating a positive anomaly during RI phases. RI events are associated with more negative Surface Latent Heat Flux anomalies along the cyclone track, suggesting more substantial ocean‐to‐atmosphere heat transfer. Moreover, RI TCs experience weaker vertical wind shear than non‐RI events, further supporting RI. These distinctions underscore the relevance of RI and the role of energetics emphasizing the importance of baroclinic conversion in driving cyclone intensification.

Using high‐resolution atmospheric turbulence observations from relatively uniform flat terrain, Horqin station, this study identified four distinct regimes through spectral analysis, each representing different impacts of submesoscale motions and turbulence intermittency. Regime 1 conforms to the classical energy spectrum. Regime 2, dominated by submesoscale motions that lead to large‐scale intermittency, occurs most frequent (>70%). Regime 3, characterized by deviations in the inertial subrange, suggest small‐scale intermittency. Regime 4, where the full‐range energy spectrum departs from the classical form, implying full‐scale intermittency. Marked differences are observed in the turbulence time series characteristics and the performance of similarity relationships across the four regimes. Revised surface‐layer similarity relationships are established under Regimes 2 and 4 by removing submesoscale motions with a Hilbert‐Huang transform‐based separation, encompassing the connections among the normalized velocity and temperature standard deviations (ϕu,ϕv,ϕw,ϕθ ${\phi }_{u},{\phi }_{v},{\phi }_{w},{\phi }_{\theta }$), the flux‐profile functions (ϕm,ϕh ${\phi }_{m},{\phi }_{h}$), and the stability parameter z/L $z/L$. In this filtered framework, countergradient transport is substantially reduced, and the positive skill scores demonstrate that the new formulations achieve significant improvements. Furthermore, an empirical parameterization relationship is proposed linking the dimensionless submesoscale wind speed standard deviations to the bulk Richardson number, with validation from five independent data sets demonstrating its robustness and applicability.

Perturbed Physics Experiments,"Accurate representation of mesoscale cellular convective (MCC) cloud morphology over the Southern Ocean is essential for improving climate model parametrizations and reducing projection uncertainties given their highly variable radiative impacts. In this study, we investigate three potential drivers of the organization and transition from closed‐to open‐cell MCC clouds over the Southern Ocean under post‐frontal conditions: (a) sea surface temperature (SST) including its gradients, (b) cloud ice production processes, and (c) microphysical latent cooling. Using a convection‐permitting configuration of the WRF model and building on findings from Part I, we evaluate how each driver shapes the morphological evolution of MCCs. Perturbed physics experiments reveal that while SST is not the primary driver of the closed‐to‐open MCCs transition, it influences cloud cellular morphology in two ways: warmer SST deepens the boundary layer and enhances precipitation, whereas colder SST suppresses boundary layer mixing, leading to reduced cloud cover. Enhanced ice production plays a key role in MCCs organization, driving cloud “break‐up” by increasing precipitation formation. Cloud evaporative cooling significantly affects MCCs organization, likely by affecting negative cloud buoyancy, allowing clouds to grow deeper and drying the boundary layer. These findings highlight critical processes that govern MCCs behavior and provide valuable insights for improving the representation of shallow clouds in climate models, ultimately aiding efforts to reduce uncertainties in climate sensitivity projections."

Discrepancies between recent and previous generations of climate models highlight the need for better representation of low‐level clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO)—a region with unique modeling challenges due to complex interactions among dynamics, microphysics, and radiation, compounded by a historical lack of in situ observations. This study evaluates the performance of a convection‐permitting WRF model configuration during post‐frontal conditions, using recent field campaign data and satellite observations for validation. Our results show that the simulation effectively reproduces the key morphological distinctions between closed and open mesoscale cellular convective clouds (MCC), aligning with both in situ and remote sensing data. The simulation captures the higher cloud cover in closed MCC regions (65%) with lower cloud top heights (1.3 km), compared to open MCC regions (46%) with higher cloud tops (2.3 km), consistent with field measurements. Additionally, the simulation reproduces qualitative differences in ice production and precipitation frequency between closed and open MCCs. However, particularly at higher latitudes, the simulation underestimates cloud cover and significantly underrepresents precipitation and ice production, likely due to limitations in the representation of ice production mechanisms. This research also sets the stage for further analysis of the processes driving the mesoscale organization and transitions between open and closed MCC states (Part II).

To initialize the rate of emission and position of the volcanic ash in the ash dispersion simulation computational domain of the numerical model used for forecasting the ash clouds, in particular, currently relies on the preliminary simulation of the volcanic plume. The source modeling is generally carried out using simplified plume models that depends on parameters that cannot be accurately measured in real time, for example, the wind entrainment coefficient and the plume centerline height in case of wind affected (bent‐over) plumes. In this work, we test recently proposed correction factors for these parameters for two of the most widely used simplified plume models and compare with ash cloud satellite observations retrieved during the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. Specifically, we compare modeling results obtained with and without applying the corrections of the top plume height and wind entrainment coefficient. We show that, by applying the corrections, we significantly reduce the discrepancy between the simulated and satellite‐retrieved ash cloud observations."

Horowitz;Yuanyu Xie;Isabelle De Smedt,"Compound Drivers of Rising Ozone Extremes in the North China Plain (2013–2023): Aerosol Decline, Hot Droughts, Afforestation‐Driven BVOCs, and Reduced Vegetation Uptake","Over the past decade (2013–2023), PM2.5 levels in eastern China have dropped by ∼70% due to air pollution controls, yet ground‐level ozone (O3) has risen by 1–3 ppbv/yr, especially in the North China Plain (NCP). Persistent O3 extremes, with daily maximum 8‐hr average (MDA8) of 100–150 ppbv, have become more frequent. Using observations and chemistry‐climate model simulations, we identify key drivers of these trends. As aerosol declines reduce HOx scavenging and enhance radiation, afforestation‐induced increases in isoprene emissions enhance HOx supply during heat waves, thereby accelerating O3 formation in NOx‐rich environments. Aerosol declines have the greatest impact on lower‐percentile O3 increases, while biosphere‐atmosphere interactions during compound heat waves and droughts amplify high‐O3 extremes. On days when observed MDA8 O3 exceeds 100 ppbv, impacts of aerosol decline are statistically insignificant (3.1 ± 4.1 ppbv) while contributions are 6.6 ± 2.0 ppbv from interactions of afforestation‐driven isoprene with urban nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 5.3 ± 2.5 ppbv from reduced stomatal O3 uptake by drought‐stressed vegetation. Droughts limit dry deposition enhancement from afforestation by reducing stomatal uptake. Incorporating afforestation‐related changes in isoprene emissions improves agreement between simulated tropospheric HCHO and satellite observations. Simulated site‐days with MDA8 O3 > 100 ppbv increase from 11% to 18%, aligning with observed 17%. Offsetting afforestation‐driven O3 increases requires 40%–50% reductions in anthropogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Marked NOx reductions over the decade have shifted O3 production in NCP from VOC‐limited to a transitional regime. A 50% joint reduction in anthropogenic VOC and NOx emissions can lower O3 by 13.2 ± 3.3 ppbv, eliminating events above 100 ppbv, whereas reductions below 20% in either are insufficient."

Holmes,The GOES Eastern United States Fire Emissions Inventory,"Prescribed wildland and agricultural fires are common in the eastern United States (U.S.), but their small size and short durations have led polar‐orbiting satellite data sets to underestimate their emissions due to omission. The higher temporal resolution of the GOES‐16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) improves fire detection, enabling development of a new biomass burning emissions inventory: GOES Eastern U.S. Fire Emissions (GEUFE, pronounced “goofy”). GEUFE is based on geostationary fire radiative power (FRP) observations, incorporates improved crop type classification for agricultural fires, and includes a new emission factor (EF) compilation for 16 land cover types in the eastern U.S., including forest, crop, and grassland types that differ markedly from globally reported EF values. GEUFE provides daily estimates of dry matter (DM) consumption and emissions of CO2, CO, NOx, NH3, SO2, organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 2 km resolution. An intercomparison of 10 biomass burning emissions inventories (GEUFE, GBBEPx, QFED, NEI‐2017, RAVE, FEER, VFEI, GFAS, FINN, GFED) showed that OC estimates in the eastern U.S. during August 2019–July 2020 ranged from 0.05 to 1.32 Tg yr−1, with both EFs and DM consumption driving the large spread in aerosol estimates. GEUFE, at 0.64 Tg yr−1, is at the high end of this range due both to region‐specific EFs and continuous GOES‐16 monitoring, reducing missed short‐lived fires. GEUFE is a process‐based inventory that eliminates reliance on empirical scaling factors, such as QFED's aerosol optical depth‐based adjustments, while explaining previously inferred “missing emissions” from small fires."

Thunderstorms represent a major type of precipitation system across the TP and contribute significantly to regional rainfall. This study generated newly a continuous thunderstorm data set clustered by applying the density‐based spatial clustering of application with noise algorithm to lightning data obtained from the World Wide Lightning Location Network from 2010 to 2024. On the basis of this data set, a significant increase in thunderstorm activity was found over the TP in recent two decades, with the maximum rate of increase reaching 2.7 10−4 km−2 thunderstorms per year in the south‐central TP. At the same time, a weak decreasing trend of the thunderstorm intensity, as evidenced by its lightning production capacity. Investigations suggest that the increase in thunderstorm numbers is mainly driven by increased convective available potential energy due to the increased near‐surface moisture over the TP. A decrease in ice‐phase processes and more warm rainfall across the TP, caused by increased near‐surface moisture in western TP and warming in eastern TP, has resulted in decreased thunderstorm intensity. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of severe weather changes on the future global energy reallocation and water cycle."

Mini Micropulse Lidar (MPL) observations of the normalized ratio backscatter and depolarization ratios show pollen plumes emanating from the forest on 9 days during the pine and oak pollination time periods, with highly depolarizing particles within the boundary layer up to about 500 m–1.6 km depending on the meteorological conditions. We calculate the total particle backscatter and aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the 9 pollen plume days and find that during pollen plume events, the pollen contributes approximately 50% to the total AOD, with daily contributions ranging from 25% to 97%. Single particle measurements from passive samplers at three heights in and above the forest canopy (1.5, 15, and 30 m) observe pine and oak pollen grains, with biological aerosol particles comprising a large component of supermicron aerosols.

Using 26‐year observations by the Ku band radars onboard the Global Precipitation Mission and the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission satellites, isolated pixels with detectable radar echoes at altitude and without precipitation at the surface are identified as candidate “first echoes.” In general, the appearance of the “first echoes” show three altitude‐related modes in the tropics. The shallow mode at 1.5–2 km is mainly from the growth of warm rain from rapid coalescence. The mid mode between 0°C and −7°C is found mainly over land and coastal regions, that can be explained by the enhanced radar reflectivity by ice particles through heterogenous ice nucleation at relative warmer temperatures, followed by active riming. The deep mode between −12°C and −25°C is frequently found over both land and ocean. Around 12% of isolated echoes, mainly over desert regions, could be the remnant of dissipating precipitation, like virga. Cloud base height and total column water vapor derived from ERA5 reanalysis are found positively related to the “first echo” height. The mid mode first echoes are more likely found in a moist (ice‐supersaturated) environment, a favorable condition for crystal growth following heterogeneous ice nucleation. While the shallow mode over ocean tends to have more sea salt aerosols, large smoke and sulfate aerosol concentrations are often associated with the mid mode, and large dust aerosol concentrations are often involved with the deep mode."

Ullrich,A Greening Future Elevates Flash Drought Risk in Northern Mid‐to‐High Latitudes,"Flash droughts have become a growing concern, as they can emerge rapidly and increase the risk of crop failure. Although past studies have investigated the meteorological drivers and future changes of flash drought, why flash drought is more frequent over humid and vegetated regions remains underexplored. This study delves further into the mechanism by which vegetation regulates flash drought and its future change using observations from multiple data sets and large ensemble simulations from three Earth system models. On an interannual timescale, both observations and simulations show robust increases in flash drought frequency and a higher flash‐to‐sub‐seasonal drought ratio during spring or antecedent conditions with dense vegetation, supporting the important role of vegetation in flash drought occurrence, especially in the northern mid‐to‐high latitudes. In the latter regions, the large ensemble simulations show robust increases in flash drought (e.g., 67% and 46% increases in Eastern U.S. and North Asia in 2050–2100 relative to 1950–2000 under the high emission scenario), where the growing season is lengthening. Although greening might suggest reduced drought stress, it drives precipitation‐soil moisture‐evapotranspiration decoupling by increasing evapotranspiration partitioning to transpiration. As transpiration can access deep soil water through the plant root system, its increased portion can weaken the constraints of concurrent precipitation on evapotranspiration, thus accelerating soil moisture depletion under high evaporative demand, driving a slow‐to‐rapid drought transition. How vegetation regulates flash drought by regulating surface moisture budget is supported by observations and simulations. Although warming supports early planting, agriculture may increasingly be threatened by surging flash drought risk."

We present the first continental‐scale quantification of future climate change impacts on streamflow intermittence, achieved for Europe at a high spatial resolution that captures headwater streams. A hybrid modeling approach combines physics‐based and data‐based modeling, with a random forest model, trained on historical streamflow observations, using predictors representing the impact of climate change on high‐resolution (500 m) streamflow. These predictors were derived from a low‐resolution (50 km) global hydrological model, WaterGAP, which was driven by the outputs of five global climate models. The generated monthly time series of intermittence status for over 1.5 million reaches were used to calculate five ecologically relevant indicators of streamflow intermittence change. In Europe, the number of non‐perennial reach‐months is projected to increase in the future, for both low (SSP1‐RCP2.6) and high (SSP5‐RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, in almost all climate zones, particularly in August and September. Under SSP1‐RCP2.6, 3.8% of all reach‐months may experience no‐flow conditions in 2071–2100, only a small increase from 3.5% in 1985–2014. Under SSP5‐8.5, however, a larger increase to 4.8% of all reach‐months is expected; 2.8% of European reaches are projected to shift from being perennial to non‐perennial, even where annual precipitation increases, while 0.7% are projected to shift from non‐perennial to perennial. These shifts represent a fundamental change in ecological habitat and connectivity i.e. bound to erode aquatic species diversity and alter ecosystem functions across more than 87.000 km of river segments."

Most experimental studies rely on short‐term, single‐factor experiments in stable and food‐unlimited environments, making it difficult to provide practical guidance to growers and decision‐makers. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a land‐based automated system to expose bivalves to future climate scenarios under field‐realistic conditions using unfiltered, ambient seawater, assessing survival, growth, reproduction, and next‐generation development. Here we present the first results of exposing Pacific oysters and Mediterranean mussels, the two most cultivated species in the Mediterranean area, to present conditions and projected scenarios for the years 2050, 2075, and 2100. For the first time, our results reveal that future warming and acidification conditions have a dramatic impact on the production yield of oysters and mussels. Oysters exposed to conditions projected for 2100 exhibited a 7% reduction in survival and a 40% reduction in growth rate, along with lower reproductive maturity, which in turn negatively affected the early development of their offspring. Mussels are already experiencing summer temperatures above their upper thermal limits, with around 40% mortality observed under current conditions and near‐total mortality under those projected for 2050. These patterns reflect sporadic mass‐mortality events reported elsewhere in the Mediterranean and indicate that mussel farming in the region could be severely compromised by mid‐century.

Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, we assess projected changes in compound heatwaves (CHWs, defined as co‐occurring daytime and nighttime heatwaves) across Africa at three global warming levels (GWLs; 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C) and under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585). Our findings reveal a robust intensification of CHWs with increasing GWLs across all scenarios. Even though the projected change is consistent across all three scenarios, under SSP370 the population exposure is higher due to a larger increase in population. Similarly, under SSP585, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exposure is higher because of rapid GDP growth fueled by fossil energy. Western, central, and eastern Africa are the most affected, with exposures increasing by tens to thousands of times. Additionally, rare CHWs historically occurring once every 50 or 100 years are projected to become more frequent, potentially recurring every 5–6 years, even under modest 1.5°C warming. We find a strong, statistically significant positive correlation (r > 0.85, p < 0.01) between near‐surface temperature and changes in CHW metrics, indicating continued warming will further exacerbate CHWs. Surface energy budget analysis reveals that this projected warming is driven primarily by enhanced net downwelling surface radiation, modulated by enhanced downwelling longwave radiation under clear‐sky conditions. Strengthening mid‐to upper‐tropospheric anticyclonic systems further contribute to warming."

However, tracking progress under the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) policy, which aims to balance degradation with restoration, requires a systematic assessment of cumulative trends, a critical underexplored gap. Here, we present the first comprehensive annual assessment of land‐use changes in these hotspots (1992–2022) guided by the LDN framework. We found that 9.4% of hotspots experienced land‐use change, with rates declining by 0.06 Mha/year (1992–2015) before accelerating to 0.4 Mha/year (2016–2022). While human‐driven impacts (e.g., deforestation, agriculture shifts) initially dominated, causing net natural ecosystem losses, post‐2015 land‐use improvement efforts (e.g., revegetation) increased. Yet, net land‐use degradation outweighed improvement, resulting in a land‐use debt of 29.1 Mha (0.9% of global hotspots). Driven by tropical deforestation, dryland degradation, agricultural shifts and urbanization, this debt correlated with impaired ecosystem structure and function. For instance, agricultural dynamics strongly correlated with reduced greenness in high‐debt continents like Asia and the Americas (r = −0.92 and r = −0.80, respectively). Despite continental‐scale greenness stabilization post‐2015 (stable NDVI > 92%), these regions showed reversed carbon uptake, with net primary productivity declining to −0.0032 and −0.002 Kg C/m2 yr−1, respectively. This vegetation greenness paradox, where stable structural greenness masks functional degradation, reveals that current improvements remain insufficient to offset historical degradation, and that structural stabilization may not guarantee functional integrity. Thus, reversing land‐use debt necessitates a locally tailored policy framework that prioritizes functional recovery alongside structural greening to ensure LDN restoration practices deliver ecosystem integrity in these hotspots."

Data from five different satellite instruments going back to 2001 show that Canada and most provinces and territories experienced peak visible‐wavelength aerosol optical depth and ultraviolet aerosol index values in 2023. Longer‐term, 2023 had the highest number of “smoke” or “haze” reports in weather records by a factor of two compared with the previous record in 1981, and by a factor of seven compared with the 1953–2022 average. These reports show an east‐to‐west shift in Canada's summer air pollution patterns. Smoke and haze in eastern Canada have decreased since the 1980s because of pollution control measures domestically and in the US. On the other hand, wildfire smoke has increased in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan since the 2010s, and is now the main air quality concern in western Canada. Interpreting the analysis here for Canada alongside previous work over the US, there was a shift over North America in summer air quality concerns from the east to the west. Climate model projections suggest more wildfire‐driven smoke in the future throughout North America, particularly in the west. In contrast to air pollution from smokestacks and tailpipes that can be addressed at the source through government regulation, a future with more wildfire smoke will require downwind mitigation and will be the responsibility of public health officials."

While process‐based models and remote sensing can bridge this data gap, their estimates often fail to capture real IWW and are associated with large uncertainties. Here, we present a knowledge‐informed, explainable machine learning framework that combines random forest (RF) with Shapley additive explanations to generate spatially explicit IWW estimates across China. Our framework incorporates irrigation domain knowledge, state‐of‐the‐art irrigated cropland maps, and various socioeconomic, hydroclimatic, and auxiliary factors. RF shows reasonable performance in spatial and temporal cross‐validation, achieving a coefficient of determination exceeding 0.85 and a root mean square error below 0.45 km3/year when evaluated against held‐out prefecture‐level data. The predictions of IWW depth are primarily driven by geographic and knowledge‐based predictors, most of which exhibit nonlinear and non‐monotonic impacts on model outputs. By integrating the RF model with a temporal downscaling approach, we develop a new gridded IWW product for China (named CIWW1km), which provides monthly IWW depth and volume at 1 km resolution from 2000 to 2020. CIWW1km aligns closely with prefecture‐level IWW reports and explains over 85% of the variance in independent IWW observations (i.e., data excluded from training) across over 150 basins and counties. It highlights a rapid increase in IWW in China's arid zone, driven by irrigated area expansions.

Understanding its variability is crucial for improving predictions on subseasonal‐to‐seasonal timescales and for developing reliable climate change projections.

High‐frequency DHR events depend on strong temperature‐VPD (>0.6) and temperature‐solar radiation coupling (>0.5). Due to projected increases in DHR frequency, 2021–2050 maize production is expected to change by −4,151 ± 1,472t to −80 ± 28t for summer maize and −1,938 ± 681t to 1,787 ± 620t for spring maize under SSP1‐2.6, with similar trends under SSP5‐8.5. Although increased precipitation and radiation partially offset losses, the warming effect largely negates these benefits, resulting in production declines of 1.55% for summer maize and 9.35% for spring maize.

Temporal analysis reveals the impacts of major socioeconomic and climatic disruptions on urban water use in the period 2011–2021, including the COVID lockdown, the rapid growth of data centers, and the drought of 2012. In addition, our analysis suggests that economic growth in small and mid‐sized US cities continues to be accompanied by rising water use, contrasting with the opposite trend observed in large cities in prior studies. This implies that as smaller cities develop, their water use may increase above current levels until incomes reach a higher threshold, highlighting the need to improve water use efficiency.

All three models suggest that SSA injection induces cloud and sky brightening that can substantially cool the Arctic. However, uncertainties in aerosol‐cloud interactions mean that the SSA mass required for cooling varies greatly between models, a feature which was also found for injections at lower latitudes. We evaluate a possible Arctic MCB scenario in which SSA injection is scaled up over time to maintain near present‐day annual‐mean Arctic surface air temperature under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The MCB cooling of the Arctic successfully maintains Arctic sea ice and, in contrast to our expectation that cooling one hemisphere leads to the large tropical rainfall shifts, we do not see robust precipitation changes outside of the Arctic. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is also shown to be maintained but we caution that not all processes driving the AMOC are represented in these ESMs. Finally, we emphasize that we idealize aspects of the SSA injection in these simulations and we do not consider the technical or governance feasibility of deploying Arctic MCB, nor the impacts on coastal communities, ecosystems, and atmospheric chemistry."

While previous studies agree on the projected changes in intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes, there is a lack of consensus regarding how their size will change in response to an increase in radiative forcing. Moreover, the influence of different downscaling techniques on their characteristics has not been thoroughly examined. This study employs an ensemble of high‐resolution projections derived from six CMIP6 GCMs, using dynamical, statistical and artificial intelligence based downscaling techniques and two reference observations. Overall, we find noticeable differences in the size, average depth, and total precipitation volume of these storms among the climate ensembles in the historical period. Despite these differences in the historical period, we find consistent future changes across various ensembles. We find a robust projected increase in storm size during Winter and Spring but a decrease in size during Summer in the East. Nevertheless, irrespective of changes in their size, extreme storms are projected to intensify across all the ensembles and seasons."

The Pacific trough (PT) regime is a persistent circulation pattern modulating temperature, precipitation, and fires over North America. We show that the observed boreal winter‐spring (December to May) PT frequency and duration have increased significantly over the past 76 years, contributing to amplified extreme anomalous heat over western and central Canada. These observed changes are not well represented in the climate simulations analyzed herein. However, our results indicate that rising greenhouse gas concentrations likely contribute to increased winter‐spring PT frequency, which is further modulated by sea surface temperatures (SSTs). While the recent La Niña‐like and negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation‐like SST trends have dampened this increase, our results suggest that if an eventual emergence of the modeled El Niño‐like response to elevated CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ were to occur in reality, it would reinstate the increase in PT frequency, duration, and downstream amplification of regional extreme heat. However, the occurrence, timing, and magnitude of this shift remain uncertain, given the complex, interlaced role of external forcings and internal variability in modulating historical trends, as well as models' inability to reproduce them. Additionally, modeling decisions regarding future trajectories for anthropogenic emissions, including aerosols and greenhouse gases, play a critical role in projecting future changes in PT frequency.

These disproportionate impacts create shared challenges that require cross‐border mitigation efforts. However, understanding how coastal areas exhibit common risk patterns and how such patterns can inform risk‐based cooperation remains fairly limited. Here, we investigated international cooperation potential among 126 coastal countries from an integrated perspective of their risk similarity, geopolitical stance, and knowledge exchange. We conducted a high‐resolution assessment of multiple hazard risks (including earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and cyclones) and developed a bottom‐up similarity measure to identify common risk profiles across regions from both size and space. Our analysis revealed a notably high degree of risk similarity across country pairs, suggesting greater potential for cooperation than that previously recognized; 89% of country pairs with high risk similarity lacked strong partnerships in consensus‐building or knowledge‐sharing. This cooperation gap was even more pronounced in the Global South and small island developing states. Instead of relying solely on geographic proximity or existing alliances, we argue for a shift in focus toward partnerships grounded in shared risk challenges. This approach can help to build collective resilience to achieve Sustainable Development Goals for climate action (SDG 13) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17)."

While droughts are typically temporary events, persistent or recurrent droughts can indicate a transition toward aridification, that is, a gradual shift to drier conditions. We assessed how temporal changes in water supply and demand at multiple time scales affect vegetation productivity and land cover changes in continental Chile to diagnose the region's climate trajectory from drought to aridification. Since 2000, much of the region has seen a continuous decrease in water supply alongside a rise in atmospheric water demand. Further, in water‐limited ecoregions, evapotranspiration, likely reflecting reduced transpiration or vegetation cover, has declined over time, with this trend intensifying over longer time scales. A long‐term decline in water availability and shifting demand have led to declining vegetation productivity, especially in the Chilean Matorral and the Patagonia Steppe ecoregions. We discovered a link between these declines and drought indices related to soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration at time scales of up to 12 months. Further, our results indicate that the trends in drought indices account for up to 78% of shrubland and 40% of forest area changes across all ecoregions. The most important variable explaining cropland changes is the burned area. Our findings suggest that Chile is undergoing a transition from episodic drought to aridification, underscoring the need for adaptation strategies aligned with this emerging baseline."

Identifying different types of storms, along with their associated durations and uncertainties, provides valuable information for constructing accurate hydrographs and generating reliable flood maps. In this study, we characterize TWL storms, considering their shape and duration, with a focus on coastal flood analysis across Europe. Our proposed approach comprises three steps. First, we classify TWL storms based on their shape. We identify four storm types around Europe that reflect the different relative contributions of TWL components. Second, we introduce a method to determine the duration of individual historical storms, which is applied to estimate the durations of return level events using storm duration functions. We emphasize the importance of accurate duration functions, especially for the longest storms observed in the Mediterranean Sea, for both historical and extrapolated return period events. Third, we implement a new method to design hydrographs for extreme events, enabling the assessment of water volumes resulting from different scenarios. Due to regional variability of scenarios, the semi‐enclosed Baltic and Mediterranean Seas exhibit storm surge‐dominated and mixed‐type storms, respectively, with associated uncertainties exceeding 20%. Our approach considers uncertainties in both storm shape and duration, particularly when the contribution of TWL components is unknown."

Here, we introduce an integrated modeling framework to jointly explore water and sediment release strategies alongside dam planning, addressing the complex interplay between sediment transport, hydrology, and reservoir operations. Applied to the 3S river basin, a critical tributary of the Mekong River, the framework provides novel insights into optimizing sediment connectivity and hydropower production. By analyzing spatio‐temporal sediment dynamics and employing multi‐objective optimization, we assess how coordinated reservoir management can reconcile competing objectives. Our results show a fundamental shift in sediment transport dynamics, with hydropower infrastructure replacing hydro‐climatic variability as the dominant control. Since 2018, sediment loads at the basin outlet have dropped from an average of 25 Mt/yr to less than 10 Mt/yr, primarily due to Lower Sesan 2 dam. Optimizing flushing and sluicing strategies, we reveal the importance of coordinated reservoir operations: 57% of the identified Pareto‐optimal solutions outperform current dam management practices in all the objectives considered.

However, these objectives often conflict, as habitat loss and fragmentation caused by transportation networks and subsequent development are regarded as significant threats to biodiversity. Quantifying the extent of these contradictions and identifying strategies for balancing these goals are essential. In this study, an index of natural habitat areas without roads (i.e., roadless areas) is employed to quantify the contradiction and analyze changes in China's roadless areas from 2000 to 2020, with projections for potential changes from 2020 to 2035. The findings indicate that China's roadless area decreased significantly from 4.94 million km2 in 2000 to 4.31 million km2 in 2020, reflecting a reduction rate of 12.7%. It is conservatively estimated that this loss will continue at a rate of 4.58% over the next 15 years. Currently, only 22.8% and 35.8% of the total roadless area in 2020 are situated within biodiversity conservation priority areas and protected areas, respectively, highlighting significant conservation gaps. To address the rapid decline and inadequate protection of roadless areas in China, this study proposes several recommendations, including optimizing transportation route planning to avoid unnecessary loss of roadless area, constructing wildlife crossing structures to enhance habitat connectivity, and integrating high ecological value roadless areas into the conservation framework. This study offers valuable insights into the effective protection of ecosystem integrity amidst the expansion of road networks and presents new solutions for ensuring timely compliance with international agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity."

Climate projections are rarely downscaled appropriately to assess future changes in storm surge and concurrent river discharge extremes, and their interactions to exacerbate flooding. This is the first time that hourly and fine spatial resolution (7/2.2 km sea level/precipitation), physically consistent, climate projections are used to assess changes in storm surge and river discharge‐driven compound events. The analysis, applied to the Dyfi estuary, western UK, uses 12 downscaled perturbed parameter ensembles for the high‐emissions “RCP8.5” scenario from a global climate model (HadGEM3‐GC3.0). Residual surge and river discharge projections are assessed independently to identify changes in magnitudes and return periods—then combined to identify changing patterns of dependence and timing of compound events. Under RCP8.5 scenario to 2080, river discharge is expected to increase by 28%–29% for 1/20 and 1/50‐year events. Extreme (95th percentile) discharge events are more likely to occur concurrently with extreme surges, and compound events will occur more often, and with a shorter time lag between peak surge and peak discharge—potentially compounding flooding further. The analysis provided forcing conditions representative of future 1 in 20‐year and 1 in 50‐year events used to simulate a potential increased flood footprint in the estuary. The research raises the question of the wider pattern of future compound events throughout the UK, and worldwide, highlighting the critical need for downscaled, coastal and fluvial projections to futureproof flood management strategies."

While nitrogen fertilization and water‐saving irrigation are recognized as effective GHG mitigation strategies in rice cultivation, their synergistic effects and underlying mechanisms remain inadequately characterized. Based on 2,689 observations from 203 peer‐reviewed articles across 129 sites in major Asian rice cultivation areas, this meta‐analysis quantifies the comprehensive impacts of coupled water‐nitrogen management on rice yield and GHG emissions. Results revealed that nitrogen fertilization alone increased yield by 38.26% but elevated global warming potential (GWP) by 56.98%, whereas Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) irrigation reduced CH4 emissions (50.71%) and GWP (43.73%) without significantly affecting yield. Combined implementation of both practices increased yield by 46.67% while reducing yield‐scaled GWP (GHGI) by 36.17%. Under AWD conditions, nitrogen application rates of 180–270 kg ha−1 maximized GHGI reduction potential (42.31%). Random forest analysis identified soil pH, fertilizer type and precipitation as key determinants of mitigation efficacy. Our spatially‐explicit water‐nitrogen optimization model demonstrated that 67% of regional rice fields are suitable for AWD implementation, and that current nitrogen inputs could be reduced by 31% while maintaining yields and achieving a 49% reduction in GHGI. This study reveals critical water‐nitrogen synergistic mechanisms in rice agroecosystems and provides quantitative frameworks for optimizing management practices at regional scales, offering a sustainable pathway toward achieving future food security and climate change mitigation goals in Earth's most productive rice regions."

In today's rapidly warming world, many changes in the climate are detectable, even in the presence of internal variability, but whether climate changes under net zero are expected to be detectable is less well understood. Here, we use a set of 1000‐year‐long net zero carbon dioxide emissions simulations branching from different points in the 21st century to examine detectability of large‐scale, regional and local climate changes as time passes under net zero emissions. We find that even after net zero, there are continued detectable changes to climate for centuries. While local changes and changes in extremes are more challenging to detect, Southern Hemisphere warming and Northern Hemisphere cooling become detectable at many locations within a few centuries under net zero emissions. We also study how detectable delays in achieving emissions cessation are across climate indices. We find that for global mean surface temperature and other large‐scale indices, such as Antarctic and Arctic sea ice extent, the effects of an additional 5 years of high greenhouse gas emissions are detectable. Such delays in emissions cessation result in significantly different local temperatures for most of the planet, and most of the global population. The long simulations used here help with identifying local climate change signals. Multi‐model frameworks will be useful to examine confidence in these changes and improve understanding of post‐net zero climate changes."

Using Community Earth System Model ensemble simulations, we assess the response of climate metrics relevant to a set of climate tipping elements in SAI scenarios targeting different temperature stabilization goals and for implementation at different latitudes. We analyze responses of tipping element metrics in simulations of a multi‐objective SAI strategy that is designed to simultaneously stabilize global mean temperature (T0), interhemispheric temperature gradient (T1), and equator‐to‐pole temperature gradient (T2), as well as simulations of SAI strategies designed just to stabilize T0. We show that SAI strategies considered here would reduce the risks for many tipping elements, but may either increase or decrease the risk of Antarctic ice sheet collapse and Sahel greening, depending on the specifics of injection strategy. For the same 1.0°C temperature stabilization target, high‐latitude injection would reduce the risk of northern cryosphere‐related tipping elements more effectively, such as Greenland ice sheet, Barents winter sea ice, and boreal permafrost. Meanwhile, low‐latitude injection would be more effective in stabilizing low‐latitude biosphere‐related tipping elements such as Amazon rainforest and coral reefs. The multi‐objective SAI injection is more effective in reducing the risk of most high‐latitude tipping elements than low‐latitude injection, and is more effective in reducing the risk of most low‐latitude tipping elements than high‐latitude injection. Our study highlights the importance of careful consideration in the trade‐offs between tipping element risk reduction and temperature pattern optimization in response to SAI strategies."

Since individuals' dietary behavior is largely influenced by their demographic and anthropometric attributes, it is crucial to identify individuals who have a high dietary WF and prioritize them as the focus of policies. Several studies analyzing the driving factors behind dietary WF exist but have multiple limitations. These include the statistical models with rather modest performances, lack of rigorous sensitivity analysis/feature importance (FI) analysis, and lack of generalization ability. Here, we developed a novel ML‐based framework for analyzing the driving forces behind dietary WF. The framework incorporated three machine learning (ML) models (Extra‐Trees (ET), Histogram‐based Gradient Boosting (HGB), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) and an ML explanation approach Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This framework was applied to a case study on Chinese inhabitants. The derived results validated the proposed framework and demonstrated ML's superiority over conventional statistical methods. XGB was identified as the optimal model as it effectively captured the variability in the data and showed good generalization performance. The FI analysis for XGB revealed the most influential features on dietary WF, with income level, urbanization level, education level, and gender emerging as the top four features in descending order. Through the subsequent SHAP dependence analysis, the priority groups for dietary WF reduction interventions were identified as high‐income residents, urban residents, highly educated residents, and male residents. In light of these findings and their underlying causes, the paper concluded with a set of policy recommendations."

Crop production depends not only on yield but also on the harvestable fraction (HF), the ratio of harvested areas to planted areas. While the impacts of climate fluctuations on crop yields are well‐document, the role of HF‐a critical yet underexplored factor‐remains poorly understood. This study introduces HF as a key metric for assessing how temperature, drought, and precipitation affect the production of major staple crops (winter wheat, spring wheat, and maize) in the United States at the county level. Our findings indicate that Killing Degree Days (KDD) and Drought Days (DD) are key drivers of production declines, reducing both yield and HF. From 1982 to 2020, changes in KDD and DD led to more significant reductions in crop production in the Midwest compared to other regions. Projections for 2021–2100 under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) indicate even steeper declines in yield, HF and production, especially under the high‐emission scenario (SSP5‐8.5), with anticipated net production decreases of 6.08%, 8.2%, and 7.57% for the three crops. Although HF may increase in colder regions, this does not offset losses in warmer areas, leading to net HF decreases of 0.36%, 2.09%, and 5.82% for the three crops. This study finds that drought and extreme heat considerably reduce food production by simultaneously lowering yields and HF and underscores the need for adaptive strategies that address both yield and HF to enhance food security in a changing climate."

In a future H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ economy, H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emissions could increase across the supply chain. When H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$, a radiatively inert gas, is emitted, it undergoes similar chemical reactions to methane (CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$) in the atmosphere, leading to detrimental climate as well as air quality effects. Here, we study the interactions between hypothetical future increases in H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emissions and possible future CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission trajectories, utilizing the GFDL AM4.1 atmospheric chemistry‐climate model (CCM) driven by H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ and CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emissions to more fully simulate their chemical feedbacks. Due to their chemical coupling, the effects of H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ on atmospheric composition are dependent on background CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission levels. However, despite this dependency, the climate impact of H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ remains largely independent of background CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission levels, because of offsetting changes in the forcing from radiatively active gases as well as model rapid adjustments. Next, we find that an ambitious 45% anthropogenic CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission reduction not only delivers greater surface cooling than the surface warming caused from a hypothetical high‐end 480% H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emission increase, but also effectively counteracts the atmospheric composition impacts from the increase in H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emissions as well. Increased H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ adoption in an H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ economy, replacing fossil fuels, could contribute to reductions in other short‐lived climate forcer emissions, such as ozone precursors and aerosols. When these additional reductions are considered, CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ mitigation is increasingly important so as to maximize the climate and air quality benefits of an H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ economy."

Despite their importance, our understanding of long‐term changes in global nitrogen cycles remains limited. The foliar nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ15N) serves as a valuable metric for assessing changes in nitrogen cycling and potentially in plant nitrogen availability. However, existing observations of δ15N suffer from spatial bias and temporal discontinuity with contradictory findings across biomes, hindering our ability to detect and attribute drivers of change. Leveraging ground‐based observations as our calibration source, we derived annual maps of foliar δ15N spanning from 1984 to 2022 globally from Landsat spectra. We found that the Landsat‐derived δ15N effectively captured the observations, with an R2 of 0.77 and a normalized root mean square error of 0.15. Globally, we found widespread temporal changes in δ15N with significant decreases for 44% and increases for 16% of vegetated ecosystems. Foliar δ15N mostly declined in forest ecosystems but increased in non‐forest land cover types. Gross primary productivity and its trend consistently explained spatiotemporal variation of δ15N globally, indicating increasing plant demand could lead to decreasing δ15N. Our study presents an innovative approach to effectively monitor and track potential changes in global nitrogen cycles over the past four decades, setting the stage for more impactful management and conservation strategies."

We explored different windows of exposure (entire pregnancy, trimester, and gestational week) and calculated temperature percentiles based on climatic zone for each window. The 50th percentile served as the reference for comparison. General additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) adjusted for month and year of last menstrual cycle, maternal and paternal: age, education, and employment. Exposure to cold mean temperatures (≤10th percentile) in the total pregnancy period and each trimester was associated with a lower mean birth weight (−28.7 g for the total period, −45.9, −36.1, and −83.4 g for trimester 1, 2, and 3, respectively), whereas exposure to warm mean temperatures was associated with higher birth weight (21.3 g for >90th percentile). For extreme temperatures, exposure to both cold (≤10th percentile for minimum) and hot (>90th percentile for maximum) in the total pregnancy period related to lower birth weight: −48.7 g (95% CI −49.7; −47.6) and −17.48 g (95% CI −18.5; −16.4), respectively, with similar effects by trimester.

Emanuel;Gabrielle Moreau;Peter Cada,Fueling Inequity: Geospatial Analyses Reveal Racial Patterns in Vulnerability to Natural Gas Pipeline Impacts in North Carolina,"As the United States (US) has increased its domestic production of natural gas, transmission pipeline infrastructure continues to expand. Previous research highlights the environmental justice implications of this situation in the US, including fugitive methane emissions and the disproportionate concentration of pipelines in counties with high social vulnerability. However, gaps in publicly‐available data make it difficult to understand the intersection of social factors, pipeline prevalence, and race, particularly in rural areas and at community‐level spatial scales. This study begins to address this gap by examining the relationship between natural gas pipeline prevalence and demographics at the census block group level. This study uses North Carolina as a case study due to the state's dramatic increase in natural gas consumption driving an increase in pipeline infrastructure in recent years. This work highlights two critical findings: First, African American and American Indian people make up a disproportionately large share of the population living in block groups characterized by high social vulnerability and high densities of natural gas pipelines. Second, our main finding is insensitive to the threshold used to determine disproportionality, suggesting these results are robust. These data demonstrate a need for more equitable methods for energy infrastructure planning and maintenance. These results underscore the need for geospatial analysts to critically evaluate their methods for identifying disparities."

Calder,Hotspots of Bacterial Pathogen Abundance and Exposure Risk in Soils of the Contiguous United States,"Soils are reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria that cause human illness, particularly after mobilizing events such as extreme rain. Land‐use patterns (e.g., proximity to agriculture) and soil properties (e.g., moisture) are associated with abundance of individual pathogenic bacteria. However, there are major uncertainties in (a) the importance of local/regional land‐use decisions relative to overall natural variability of pathogenicity and (b) the correlations among pathogen abundance, climate‐linked physical processes increasing pathogen mobility, and the vulnerability of human receptors. This impairs identification of priority areas for outbreak surveillance, which has traditionally focused on food and water distribution networks, and the development of process‐based risk screening models. Here, we analyze a novel data set of 622 soil samples covering 42 of the 48 contiguous United States. We describe (a) the relationship between putative pathogenicity and natural and land‐use drivers and (b) how hotspots of putative pathogen abundance intersect with climate‐linked hazard of mobilization via fire, floods, wind, and fluvial transport, and the social vulnerability of local human populations. Variability in putative pathogenicity can be partially explained by known drivers, with natural variables having greater explanatory power than land‐use variables. Relative abundance of putative pathogens is generally higher in forested ecoregions, notably in the eastern and southeastern United States and in proximity to surface waters. Higher relative abundance of putative pathogens, climate risks promoting pathogen mobility, and a relatively vulnerable rural population intersect in the southeastern United States. Integrated sampling and modeling are needed to monitor and forecast health risks from soilborne pathogens."

Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for literature published from January 2020 to November 2024 using the DLNM to analyze the environmental exposures and health outcomes. After screening, removing duplicates, and reviewing full‐text articles, eligible studies were assessed using the DLNM to examine the health effects related to environmental exposure, particularly temperature and other environmental factors. From 2,847 studies, 274 studies from 36 countries were selected for analysis, primarily from China (164), Europe (28), and North America (23). There were 174 exclusive climate data sources, no standardized heat thresholds, and 131 unique sources of air pollutant data. Among the 53 adverse health outcomes identified using the DLNM, morbidity was the most prevalent (n=102 $n=102$), followed by hospitalization (n=39 $n=39$), hospital admission (n=40 $n=40$), and emergency room visits (n=22 $n=22$). This review highlights the utility of the DLNM in capturing complex temporal relationships between environmental exposure and health, clarifying lagged effects. Despite the challenges of standardization and computational efficiency, ongoing developments are enhancing the utility of the DLNM. Future research should focus on advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, and extend applications to other environmental health scenarios."

Barton,Real‐Time Empirical Risk Assessment From Recurrent Coastal Sewage Plumes,"Untreated wastewater enters the ocean at an outfall in Mexico and spreads to the San Diego‐Tijuana (USA‐Mexico) border region, posing significant risks to human health. Here, we developed a risk assessment tool for coastal communities, leveraging hindcast oceanographic simulations (2017–2019), to link changes in temperature and salinity at the coastline to high wastewater concentrations. We first calculated the modeled timescales (i.e., duration and return time) of wastewater exposure for popular beaches in the region. Most high wastewater exposure events occurred about once a month and lasted less than a week at the southern locations (e.g., Imperial Beach), and occurred less frequently and for shorter periods of time further north (e.g., Coronado). Using the same hindcast simulations, we then identified relationships between anomalous environmental conditions and wastewater concentration along the coastline. High wastewater concentrations were typically associated with lower salinity and temperature, reflecting the low salinity of wastewater and the colder temperatures of water originating south of the USA‐Mexico border. Statistical models with only parameters of salinity and temperature anomalies captured a large proportion of the variation in wastewater‐associated risk of illness (R2 = 0.63–0.78). We tested the risk assessment approach with several months of recent observations (January–December 2024) to show how this tool may be practically applied. This study provides an efficient method for developing risk models that utilize commonly measured environmental data, with applications to other pollution‐impacted coastal locations."

 The majority of breast cancers are driven by oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) activation, and endocrine therapy represents the mainstay treatment for these patients1. However, resistance is common and tumours often progress after years of endocrine suppression2. Periodic fasting enhances the efficacy of standard endocrine therapy and delays acquired drug resistance, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear3. Here we show that fasting induces extensive epigenetic reprogramming in ERα-positive breast cancer xenografts when combined with endocrine therapy, with large-scale activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor signalling and concomitant reduction in the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) family members. GR-driven gene programmes are selectively activated in in vivo models of ERα-positive breast cancer during fasting, and GR knockout hinders the anti-tumour effects of fasting combined with tamoxifen. Exogenous administration of GR ligands recapitulates fasting-enhanced anti-oestrogen action, thus promoting tumour regression. Patients undergoing a cyclic fasting-mimicking diet exhibited increased blood progesterone and cortisol concentrations. Additionally, tumours collected after the fasting-mimicking diet showed an inverse correlation of GR activation with proliferation markers, providing clinical confirmation of our observations in animal models. Our results indicate that GR activation has a pivotal role in the ability of fasting to enhance endocrine therapy activity in breast cancer and suggest that corticosteroid administration should be evaluated as an adjuvant to endocrine therapy in this setting. Beneficial effects of fasting combined with endocrine therapy for oestrogen receptor-α-expressing breast cancers can be recapitulated using exogenous glucocorticoid receptor ligands instead of fasting to reduce harmful effects."

 Observations have demonstrated the ubiquity of short-lived halogens (SLHs)—defined as organic and inorganic chlorine, bromine and iodine compounds with an overall atmospheric lifetime of less than 6 months—in the global atmosphere. They are primarily emitted naturally from the ocean, cryosphere, volcanoes, salt lakes and the biosphere. However, unregulated anthropogenic sources are increasingly contributing to their atmospheric loading. Some of their natural emissions have increased over time due to anthropogenic pollution, for example, the increased oceanic emissions of iodine compounds due to the deposition of ozone on the sea surface. SLHs affect chemical processes, such as ozone and methane chemistry, and therefore influence air quality and climate. Nevertheless, some of their sources and chemistry are not included in air-quality and climate models used in international assessment reports. Here we describe in detail the various impacts of SLHs on air quality and climate, and make a case for the inclusion of more comprehensive SLH chemistry in future atmospheric, air-quality and climate assessments. In doing so, we also identify gaps in our knowledge of SLH emissions, chemistry, and environmental and climate impacts.

 Dislocations are the crystalline defects responsible for the mechanical properties of conventional metals and alloys. When they become scarce or constrained, such as in nanocrystals1, grain-boundary-based mechanisms may compensate and lead to permanent deformation2,3. Shear-migration coupling is thought to be the most efficient of these processes4,5, but despite intense research activity, no consensus has emerged to quantify the possible shear produced by a migrating grain boundary6. Here we show experimentally that, in small-grained polycrystals, this shear does not depend on the grain boundary misorientation and that its efficiency remains low. These findings support a new concept of grain boundaries that may not be considered as crystalline defects carrying an intrinsic ‘coupling factor’7 (similarly to the Burgers vector of a dislocation) but rather as specific lattices containing peculiar defects, known as disconnections, that will, in turn, govern the properties, at least mechanical, of grain boundaries. They also confirm that polycrystals can plastically deform without dislocations but less effectively, providing a potential path to explain the poor ductility of nanocrystalline metals at low and room temperature. Experimental observations in small-grained polycrystals suggest a new concept of considering metallic grain boundaries not as defects but as separate defect-containing lattices, providing a potential explanation for the deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline metals."

 Gene drive technology presents a transformative approach to combatting malaria by introducing genetic modifications into wild mosquito populations to reduce their vectorial capacity. Although effective modifications have been developed, these efforts have been confined to laboratories in the global north. We previously demonstrated that modifying Anopheles gambiae to express two exogenous antimicrobial peptides inhibits the sporogonic development of laboratory-cultured Plasmodium falciparum, with models predicting substantial contributions to malaria elimination in Africa when integrated with gene drive1–3. However, the effectiveness of this modification against genetically diverse, naturally circulating parasite isolates remained unknown. To address this critical gap, we adapted our technology for an African context by establishing infrastructural and research capacity in Tanzania, enabling the engineering of local A. gambiae under containment. Here we report the generation of a transgenic strain equipped with non-autonomous gene drive capabilities that robustly inhibits genetically diverse P. falciparum isolates obtained from naturally infected children. These genetic modifications were efficiently inherited by progeny when supplemented with Cas9 endonuclease provided by another locally engineered strain. Our work brings gene drive technology a critical step closer to application, providing a locally tailored and powerful tool for malaria eradication through the targeted dissemination of beneficial genetic traits in wild mosquito populations. Engineering of local Anopheles gambiae under containment enables the generation of a transgenic strain equipped with non-autonomous gene drive capabilities that robustly inhibits genetically diverse Plasmodium falciparum isolates obtained from naturally infected children."

 Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are unique in their efferocytosis1 and cross-presenting abilities2, resulting in antigen-specific T cell immunity3 or tolerance4–8. However, the mechanisms that underlie cDC1 tolerogenic function remain largely unknown. Here we show that the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) acts as a critical switch that determines the tolerogenic function of cDC1s and the threshold of antigen-specific T cell responses. In total lymphoid irradiation-induced allograft tolerance9,10, cDC1s upregulate EPOR expression, and conditional knockout of EPOR in cDC1s diminishes antigen-specific induction and expansion of FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, resulting in allograft rejection. Mechanistically, EPOR promotes efferocytosis-induced tolerogenic maturation7,11 of splenic cDC1s towards late-stage CCR7+ cDC1s characterized by increased expression of the integrin β8 gene12 (Itgb8), and conditional knockout of Itgb8 in cDC1s impairs tolerance induced by total lymphoid irradiation plus anti-thymocyte serum. Migratory cDC1s in peripheral lymph nodes preferentially express EPOR, and their FOXP3+ Treg cell-inducing capacity is enhanced by erythropoietin. Reciprocally, loss of EPOR enables immunogenic maturation of peripheral lymph node migratory and splenic CCR7+ cDC1s by upregulating genes involved in MHC class II- and class I-mediated antigen presentation, cross-presentation and costimulation. EPOR deficiency in cDC1s reduces tumour growth by enhancing anti-tumour T cell immunity, particularly increasing the generation of precursor exhausted tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cells13 in tumour-draining lymph nodes and supporting their maintenance within tumours, while concurrently reducing intratumoural Treg cells. Targeting EPOR on cDC1s to induce or inhibit T cell immune tolerance could have potential for treating a variety of diseases.

 Microfold (M) cells are rare intestinal epithelial cells that reside in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer’s patches1. M cells transport luminal antigens to submucosal antigen-presenting cells2,3. These insights primarily derive from transmission electron microscopy and studies using genetically modified mice2–4. Here we establish an intestinal organoid model to study human M cells and reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of M cells through transcriptome profiling. The results indicate that as well as facilitating luminal antigen transport, human M cells also directly present antigens via the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II). Notably, the related enterocytes only express MHC-II in chronic inflammatory states and do not express typical dendritic cell markers. Human M cells physiologically express a gene profile that resembles that of dendritic cells. Similar to dendritic cells, M cell development is induced by RANKL and CSF2 and requires the transcription factors SPIB and RUNX2. HLA-DQ2.5 M cells process and present gluten antigen as demonstrated in organoid–T cell co-culture assays. These findings suggest that M cells may have a central role in coeliac disease.

 Iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters are essential metallocofactors that perform a multitude of biological functions1–7. Their synthesis is tightly regulated and defects in this process lead to severe diseases8–10, such as Friedreich’s ataxia, which is caused by defective expression of frataxin (FXN)11. However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. Here we show that efficient Fe–S cluster assembly requires a fine-tuned balance in the ratio of FXN and ferredoxin-2 (FDX2). Fe–S clusters are assembled on the scaffold protein ISCU2; sulfur is provided as a persulfide by NFS1, and the persulfide is cleaved into sulfide by FDX2 (refs. 12,13). FXN stimulates the whole process by accelerating the transfer of persulfide to ISCU2 (refs. 12,14,15). Using an in-vitro-reconstituted human system, we show that any deviation from a close-to-equal amount of FXN and FDX2 downregulates Fe–S cluster synthesis. Structure–function investigation reveals that this is due to competition between FXN and FDX2 and their similar affinities for the same binding site on the NFS1–ISCU2 complex, with higher levels of FXN impairing the persulfide reductase activity of FDX2 and higher levels of FDX2 slowing the FXN-accelerated transfer of persulfide to ISCU2. We also find that FDX2 directly hinders persulfide generation and transfer to ISCU2 by interacting with the persulfide-carrying mobile loop of NFS1. We further show that knocking down the expression of FDX2 increases fly lifespan in a Drosophila model of Friedreich’s ataxia. Together, this work highlights a direct regulation of Fe–S cluster biosynthesis through antagonistic binding of FXN and FDX2, and suggests that decreasing FDX2 in the context of FXN deficiency in Friedreich’s ataxia might constitute a novel therapeutic axis. A finely balanced ratio of ferredoxin-2 (FDX2) and frataxin (FXN) is essential for the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters, and interventions targeting this ratio could provide a way to treat related diseases, such as Friedreich’s ataxia."

 Reproduction is hypothesized to constrain lifespan1,2 and contribute to sex differences in ageing3–5. Various sterilization and contraception methods inhibit reproduction, but predictions differ for how these influence survival, depending on sex5, how sex hormones are affected4 and species life history6. Here, using data from mammalian species housed in zoos and aquariums worldwide, we show that ongoing hormonal contraception and permanent surgical sterilization are associated with increased life expectancy. These effects occur in both males and females, although the sexes are differently protected from specific causes of death. Evidence of improved survival in males is also restricted to castration, with stronger effects occurring after pre-pubertal surgery. Complementary meta-analyses of published data reveal improved survival with sterilization across vertebrates and increased healthspan in gonadectomized rodents. Improved survival occurs in laboratory and wild environments, and with female sterilization approaches that either remove the ovaries or leave them intact. Reported increases in survival in castrated men7–9 resemble the effects in other species, whereas survival of women is slightly decreased after permanent surgical sterilization. Thus the hormonal drive to reproduce constrains adult survival across vertebrates, regardless of the environment in which an animal resides. Data collected from zoos and aquariums worldwide show that hormonal contraception or permanent surgical sterilization in mammals increase life expectancy, with different mechanisms in males and females."

 Fire-making is a uniquely human innovation that stands apart from other complex behaviours such as tool production, symbolic culture and social communication. Controlled fire use provided adaptive opportunities that had profound effects on human evolution. Benefits included warmth, protection from predators, cooking and creation of illuminated spaces that became focal points for social interaction1–3. Fire use developed over a million years, progressing from harvesting natural fire to maintaining and ultimately making fire4. However, determining when and how fire use evolved is challenging because natural and anthropogenic burning are hard to distinguish5–7. Although geochemical methods have improved interpretations of heated deposits, unequivocal evidence of deliberate fire-making has remained elusive. Here we present evidence of fire-making on a 400,000-year-old buried landsurface at Barnham (UK), where heated sediments and fire-cracked flint handaxes were found alongside two fragments of iron pyrite—a mineral used in later periods to strike sparks with flint. Geological studies show that pyrite is locally rare, suggesting it was brought deliberately to the site for fire-making. The emergence of this technological capability provided important social and adaptive benefits, including the ability to cook food on demand—particularly meat—thereby enhancing digestibility and energy availability, which may have been crucial for hominin brain evolution3. Baked sediment, heat-shattered artefacts and introduced pyrite in a 400,000-year-old Palaeolithic occupation site in Suffolk, UK provide evidence of intentional fire-making, marking a pivotal moment in human development."

Zurlo,Observation of deuteron and antideuteron formation from resonance-decay nucleons,"The ALICE Collaboration provides details on the microscopic mechanism that ends up creating antideuteron in high-energy proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. 
 High-energy hadronic collisions generate environments characterized by temperatures above 100 MeV (refs. 1,2), about 100,000 times hotter than the centre of the Sun. At present, it is therefore unclear how light (anti)nuclei with mass number A of a few units, such as the deuteron, 3He or 4He, each bound by only a few MeV, can emerge from these collisions3,4. Here, the ALICE Collaboration reports that deuteron–pion momentum correlations in proton–proton (pp) collisions provide model-independent evidence that about 90% of the observed (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear reactions5 following the decay of short-lived resonances, such as the Δ(1232). These findings, obtained by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider, resolve a gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in ultrarelativistic hadronic collisions. Apart from offering insights on how (anti)nuclei are formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be used in the modelling of the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays6 and dark-matter decays7,8. The ALICE Collaboration provides details on the microscopic mechanism that ends up creating antideuteron in high-energy proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider."

 Tropical forests represent the warmest and wettest of Earth’s biomes, but with continued anthropogenic warming, they will be pushed to climate states with no current analogue1,2. Droughts in the tropics are already becoming more intense as they occur at successively higher temperatures3–5. Here we synthesize multiple datasets to assess the effects of hot droughts on a central Amazon forest. First, a more than 30-year record of annually resolved forest demographic data from a selective logging experiment showed higher tree mortality during intense droughts, particularly among fast-growing pioneer species with low wood density. Second, analysis of ecophysiological field measurements from the 2015 and 2023 El Niño droughts identified a soil moisture threshold beyond which transpiration rates rapidly declined. As rainless days beyond this threshold continued, drought conditions intensified, increasing the potential for tree mortality from hydraulic failure and carbon starvation. Third, analyses from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 demonstrated that under high-emission scenarios, a large area of tropical forest will shift to a hotter ‘hypertropical’ climate by 2100. Last, under a hypertropical climate, temperature and moisture conditions during typical dry season months will more frequently exceed identified drought mortality thresholds, elevating the risk of forest dieback. Present-day hot droughts are harbingers of this emerging climate, offering a window for studying tropical forests under expected extreme future conditions6–8. Thirty years of forest demographic data, combined with recent ecophysiological measurements, reveal that intense Amazon droughts sharply increase tree mortality once soil moisture falls below a threshold, and that these hot droughts will become more frequent and intense as Earth warms towards hypertropical conditions."

 Mitochondrial protein import is required for maintaining organellar function1. Perturbations in this process are associated with various physiological and disease conditions2. Several stress responses, including the mitochondrial compromised protein import response (mitoCPR), combat damage caused by mitochondrial protein import defects2. However, how this defect is sensed remains largely unknown. Here we reveal that the conserved mitochondrial Hsp70 co-chaperone, Mge1, acts as a stress messenger in budding yeast. During mitochondrial stress, unimported Mge1 entered the nucleus and triggered the transcription of mitoCPR target genes. This was mediated by the interaction of Mge1 with the transcription factor Pdr3 on DNA regulatory elements. The mitochondrial targeting sequence of Mge1 was both sufficient and essential for mitoCPR induction, demonstrating that in addition to their roles in mitochondrial protein import, targeting sequences can also function as signalling molecules. As protein import defects are a common consequence of various types of mitochondrial damage3,4, these findings suggest a novel function for the targeting sequence of Mge1 as an indicator of mitochondrial health. Cells can sense mitochondrial damage through signalling via an unimported mitochondrial targeting sequence."

Saltiel,Neutrophils preserve energy storage in sympathetically activated adipocytes,"Neutrophil-derived IL-1β has a role in preserving lipid stores during metabolic stress. 
 Adipose tissue maintains energy homeostasis by storing lipids during nutrient surplus and releasing them through lipolysis in times of energy demand1,2. While lipolysis is essential for short-term metabolic adaptation, prolonged metabolic stress requires adaptive changes that preserve energy reserves2,3. Here we report that β3-adrenergic activation of adipocytes induces a transient and depot-specific infiltration of neutrophils into white adipose tissue (WAT), particularly in lipid-rich visceral WAT. Neutrophil recruitment requires the stimulation of both lipolysis and p38 MAPK in adipocytes, and is mediated by the secretion of leukotriene B4. Recruited neutrophils undergo activation in situ, and locally secrete IL-1β, which suppresses lipolysis and limits excessive energy loss. Neutrophil depletion or blockade of IL-1β production increases lipolysis, leading to reduced WAT mass after repeated β3-adrenergic stimulation. Together, these findings reveal a role of neutrophil-derived IL-1β in preserving lipid stores during metabolic stress, highlighting a physiological function of innate immune cells in limiting lipid loss and maintaining energy homeostasis. Neutrophil-derived IL-1β has a role in preserving lipid stores during metabolic stress."

Smoller,Mapping the genetic landscape across 14 psychiatric disorders,"Genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders identifies five underlying genomic factors that explain the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders. 
 Psychiatric disorders display high levels of comorbidity and genetic overlap1,2, challenging current diagnostic boundaries. For disorders for which diagnostic separation has been most debated, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder3, genomic methods have revealed that the majority of genetic signal is shared4. While over a hundred pleiotropic loci have been identified by recent cross-disorder analyses5, the full scope of shared and disorder-specific genetic influences remains poorly defined. Here we addressed this gap by triangulating across a suite of cutting-edge statistical and functional genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders (1,056,201 cases). Using genetic association data from common variants, we identified and characterized five underlying genomic factors that explained the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders (around 66% on average) and were associated with 238 pleiotropic loci. The two factors defined by (1) Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (SB factor); and (2) major depression, PTSD and anxiety (Internalizing factor) showed high levels of polygenic overlap6 and local genetic correlation and very few disorder-specific loci. The genetic signal shared across all 14 disorders was enriched for broad biological processes (for example, transcriptional regulation), while more specific pathways were shared at the level of the individual factors. The shared genetic signal across the SB factor was substantially enriched in genes expressed in excitatory neurons, whereas the Internalizing factor was associated with oligodendrocyte biology. These observations may inform a more neurobiologically valid psychiatric nosology and implicate targets for therapeutic development designed to treat commonly occurring comorbid presentations. Genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders identifies five underlying genomic factors that explain the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders."

 All genomes have mobile genetic segments called transposable elements (TEs)1. Here we describe a system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects Caenorhabditis elegans and human genes against DNA-transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which seems to operate independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern-recognition system triggered by the base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells: AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A to allow RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a previously undescribed conserved and RNA-structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing, and that an identified function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of DNA-transposon-mediated gene perturbation. A new type of mRNA splicing mechanism discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans that detects and removes inverted repeats also occurs in human cells, thereby providing another strategy to protect against the negative effects of transposable elements."

 Understanding lung cancer evolution can identify tools for intercepting its growth1,2. Here, in a landscape analysis of 1,024 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) with deep whole-genome sequencing integrated with multiomic data, we identified 542 LUADs with a diverse clonal architecture. In this group, we observed divergent evolutionary trajectories based on tobacco smoking exposure, ancestry and sex. LUAD from smokers showed an abundance of tobacco-related C:G>A:T driver mutations3 in KRAS and short subclonal diversification. LUAD in people who have never smoked (hereafter, never-smokers) showed early occurrence of copy-number alterations and EGFR mutations associated with SBS5 and SBS40a mutational signatures. Tumours containing EGFR mutations exhibited long latency, particularly in female individuals of European-ancestry. Tumours from Asian never-smokers showed a short clonal evolution. Importantly, we found that the mutational signature ID24 is a marker of a previously unrecognized mechanism for LUAD evolution. Tumours with ID2 showed short latency and high long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, hereafter L1) retrotransposon activity linked to L1 promoter demethylation. These tumours exhibited an aggressive phenotype with genomic instability, elevated hypoxia scores, low neoantigen burden, metastasis propensity and poor overall survival. Reactivated L1-retrotransposition-induced mutagenesis probably contributes to the mutational signature ID2, including through the regulation of the transcriptional factor ZNF695, a member of the KZFP family5. The complex nature of LUAD evolution creates both challenges and opportunities for screening and treatment plans. Lung adenocarcinomas bearing the ID2 mutational signature display increased LINE-1 retrotransposon activity, which contributes to their fast evolutionary dynamics and aggressive phenotype."

 The extent to which exogenous sources, including cancer treatment, contribute to somatic evolution in normal tissue remains unclear. Here we used high-depth duplex sequencing1 (more than 30,000× coverage) to analyse 168 cancer-free samples representing 16 organs from 22 patients with metastatic cancer enroled in the PEACE research autopsy study. In every sample, we identified somatic mutations (range 305–2,854 mutations) at low variant allele frequencies (median 0.0000323). We extracted 16 distinct single-base substitution mutational signatures, reflecting processes that have moulded the genomes of normal cells. We identified alcohol-induced mutation acquisition in liver, smoking-induced mutagenesis in lung and cardiac tissue, and multiple treatment-induced processes, which correlated with therapy type and duration. Exogenous sources, including treatment, underpinned, on average, more than 40% of mutations in liver but less than 10% of mutations in brain samples. Finally, we observed tissue-specific selection, with positive selection in tissues such as lung (PTEN and PIK3CA), liver (NF2L2) and spleen (BRAF and NOTCH2), and limited selection in others, such as brain and cardiac tissue. More than 25% of driver mutations in normal tissue exposed to systemic anti-cancer therapy, including in TP53, could be attributed to treatment. Immunotherapy, although not associated with increased mutagenesis, was linked to driver mutations in PPM1D and TP53, illustrating how non-mutagenic treatment can sculpt somatic evolution. Our study reveals the rich tapestry of mutational processes and driver mutations in normal tissue, and the profound effect of lifetime exposures, including cancer treatment, on somatic evolution. High-depth sequencing of non-cancerous tissue from patients with metastatic cancer reveals single-base mutational signatures of alcohol, smoking and cancer treatments, and reveals how exogenous factors, including cancer therapies, affect somatic cell evolution."

 The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calls for rapid global expansion of protected areas in response to ongoing biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation1. One of its strongest selling points is the benefits protected areas provide to adjacent human communities2,3. However, little attention has been paid to how policy and management can support such benefits. Here, to address this gap, I explored influences on the effect sizes of vegetation spillovers from a candidate 12,513 Australian protected areas, defining spillovers as the difference in vegetation outside a protected area that occurs as a consequence of the existence of the protected area4. In 2020, 71% (2,189) out of the 3,063 protected areas for which full analysis was possible had a positive spillover effect of 0.1 or greater on at least 1 of 10 vegetation cover classes. Many protected area types were significant predictors of spillover magnitude. The covariance explained by protected area type with local and contextual variables was 14%, suggesting that internal management moderates adjacent locations. These findings highlight the potential to include spillover effects explicitly in global policy frameworks and suggest a pathway to an empirical basis for monitoring and accounting schemes that support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision adjacent to protected areas. Analysis of effect sizes of vegetation spillovers from protected areas in Australia shows that 71% of over 3,063 analysed protected areas had a positive spillover effect, and that these effects covary with protected area management type."

 The exceptionally low-energy 229Th nuclear isomeric state is expected to provide several new and powerful applications1,2, including the construction of a robust and portable solid-state nuclear clock3, perhaps contributing to a redefinition of the second4, exploration of nuclear superradiance5,6 and tests of fundamental physics7–10. Further, analogous to the capabilities of traditional Mössbauer spectroscopy, the sensitivity of the nucleus to its environment can be used to realize laser Mössbauer spectroscopy and, with it, new types of strain and temperature sensors3,11 and a new probe of the solid-state environment12,13, all with excellent sensitivity. However, current models for examining the nuclear transition in a solid require the use of a high-bandgap, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) transmissive host, severely limiting the applicability of these techniques. Here we report the first, to the authors’ knowledge, demonstration of laser-induced conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) of the 229Th isomer in a thin ThO2 sample whose bandgap (approximately 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy of the 229Th isomeric transition, this technique is compatible with materials whose bandgap is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study and the potential of a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock.

 Targeting innate immunity holds promise in cancer immunotherapy, particularly in improving checkpoint inhibitors. However, the use of agonists of the promising innate receptors TLRs and STING1–4 is facing challenges. Here we examined the antitumour function of the α-kinase 1 (ALPK1) receptor for bacterial ADP-heptose (ADP-Hep)5–7. Treatment of mice with ADP-Hep induced multiple proinflammatory factors including CXCL10 and CCL2, and stimulated Alpk1-dependent antitumour immunity. Mice bearing a gain-of-function ALPK1(T237M) disease variant8 also rejected grafted tumours. Using medicinal chemistry, we identified a more potent analogue, UDSP-Hep. In contrast to ADP-Hep, UDSP-Hep distinguished Alpk1 polymorphism, which correlates with mouse susceptibility to bacteria-associated colitis9–12. UDSP-Hep exhibited a stronger Alpk1-mediated antitumour effect and synergized with checkpoint inhibitors. The effect required CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and was sensitive to antibodies that block CXCL10 or CCL2 function. ALPK1 agonists activated DCs for cross-presentation, promoting tumour-specific T cell expansion in the tumour-draining lymph nodes. ALPK1 has wider expression than STING in non-immune cells with a distinct inflammatory signature. UDSP-Hep is differentiated from STING agonists in stimulating tumour-cell antigen presentation, macrophage–DC cross-priming and protective memory T cell differentiation, and it does not induce T cell apoptosis. Our study elucidates the antitumour effect of ALPK1 agonism and suggests the potential of ALPK1 agonists in cancer immunotherapy. The ALPK1 agonist UDSP-Hep stimulates tumour-cell antigen presentation, macrophage–DC cross-priming and differentiation of protective memory T cells."

 Genetic association studies provide a unique tool for identifying candidate causal links from genes to human traits and diseases. However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits. Here we propose approaches to bridge this gap by combining quantitative estimates of gene–trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests1 with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments2 in relevant cell types. By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait3. As a proof of concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene-regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes for traits, can bridge the gap between genetic association and biological mechanism. Approaches combining genetic association and Perturb-seq data that link genetic variants to functional programs to traits are described."

 Frataxin is a key component of an ancient, mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic machinery, serving as an allosteric activator of the cysteine desulfurase NFS1 (refs. 1–5). Loss of frataxin levels underlies Friedreich’s ataxia6, the most common inherited ataxia. Yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and human cells can tolerate loss of frataxin when grown in ‘permissive’ low oxygen tensions7. Here we conducted an unbiased, genome-scale forward genetic screen in C. elegans leveraging permissive and non-permissive oxygen tensions to discover suppressor mutations that bypass the need for frataxin. All mutations act dominantly and are in the ferredoxin FDX2/fdx-2 or in the cysteine desulfurase NFS1/nfs-1 genes, resulting in amino-acid substitutions at the FDX2–NFS1 binding interface. Our genetic and biochemical analyses show that the suppressor mutations boost iron–sulfur cluster levels in the absence of frataxin. We also demonstrate that an excess of FDX2 inhibits frataxin-stimulated NFS1 activity in vitro and blocks the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters in mammalian cell culture. These findings are consistent with structural and biochemical evidence that frataxin and FDX2 compete for occupancy at the same site on NFS1 (refs. 8,9). We show that lowering levels of wild-type FDX2 through loss of one gene copy can ameliorate the growth of frataxin mutant C. elegans or the ataxia phenotype of a mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia under normoxic conditions. These genetic and biochemical studies indicate that restoring the stoichiometric balance of frataxin and FDX2 through partial knockdown of FDX2 may be a potential therapy for Friedreich’s ataxia. A forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals that decreased levels of the ferredoxin FDX2 suppress the loss of frataxin in worms and in mice by relief of FDX2 inhibition of frataxin-stimulated NFS1 activity."

 The incidence of cardiometabolic diseases is increasing globally, and both poor diet and the human gut microbiome have been implicated1. However, the field lacks large-scale, comprehensive studies exploring these links in diverse populations2. Here, in over 34,000 US and UK participants with metagenomic, diet, anthropometric and host health data, we identified known and yet-to-be-cultured gut microbiome species associated significantly with different diets and risk factors. We developed a ranking of species most favourably and unfavourably associated with human health markers, called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Health Ranking 2025’. This system showed strong and reproducible associations between the ranking of microbial species and both body mass index and host disease conditions on more than 7,800 additional public samples. In an additional 746 people from two dietary interventional clinical trials, favourably ranked species increased in abundance and prevalence, and unfavourably ranked species reduced over time. In conclusion, these analyses provide strong support for the association of both diet and microbiome with health markers, and the summary system can be used to inform the basis for future causal and mechanistic studies. It should be emphasized, however, that causal inference is not possible without prospective cohort studies and interventional clinical trials.

 Since 1980, tropical cyclones have migrated poleward, but it remains unclear whether this trend reflects long-term climate change or temporary climate variability. Here we investigate the drivers of this poleward migration using multiple observational datasets and global models that permit tropical cyclones. We show that a tripolar pattern of Pacific sea surface temperature variability strongly modulates the interannual variation of cyclone latitudes and largely drove the poleward migration over 1980–2024. The tripolar pattern influences tropical cyclones more effectively than either the El Niño/Southern Oscillation or the Hadley circulation. When its effects are removed, poleward migration is negligible. When it shows negative trends, the model simulates equatorward migration. As the pattern exhibits alternating multi-decadal trends but no long-term trend since 1970, its recent trend—and the associated poleward migration—is unlikely to persist. In ensemble projections under a warming scenario, tropical cyclone activity decreases overall, leading to fewer occurrences at high latitudes despite the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell. These results indicate that climate variability has played a dominant role in the observed poleward migration of tropical cyclones, and that future changes may differ markedly from the recent multi-decadal trends.

Hemingway,Sedimentary conditions drive modern pyrite burial flux to exceed oxidation,"Modern pyrite burial in seafloor sediments exceeds pyrite oxidation on land, indicating that the sulfur cycle is out of balance, and acts to increase atmospheric oxygen levels, according to a diagenetic model validated by sediment cores. 
 Pyrite (iron sulfide) formation and burial in sediments decreases atmospheric CO2 and increases O2 levels. However, the environmental and sedimentological conditions that regulate pyrite burial remain poorly constrained. Here we investigate such controlling mechanisms using a non-dimensional diagenetic model that extracts the natural variables governing pyrite formation rate and sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S). Both properties are controlled by the local ratios of organic carbon content to sulfate concentration and organic carbon reactivity to sedimentation rate; formation rate is additionally sensitive to reactive iron delivery. Using only globally interpolated boundary conditions, our model accurately predicts signals in 216 sediment cores distributed across the modern ocean. Extrapolating this, we estimate a global pyrite burial flux of 7.0 × 1012 mol S yr−1 (sensitivity test range: 2.5 × 1012 to 19.0 × 1012 mol S yr−1) with a weighted-average δ34S value of −4‰ (range: −8 to +3‰). This flux is substantially larger than terrestrial pyrite oxidation, indicating that the sulfur cycle is currently not in steady state but is instead described by net pyrite burial and thus atmospheric O2 accumulation. Finally, we interpret the geologic pyrite δ34S record within this model framework and identify flooded shelf area as the main control on pyrite burial throughout the Phanerozoic Eon. Modern pyrite burial in seafloor sediments exceeds pyrite oxidation on land, indicating that the sulfur cycle is out of balance, and acts to increase atmospheric oxygen levels, according to a diagenetic model validated by sediment cores."

 Iron is the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, and consequently CO2 drawdown, in the Southern Ocean. A recurring phytoplankton bloom above the Australian Antarctic Ridge was recently attributed to hydrothermally sourced iron. Here we examine satellite remote-sensing estimates of net primary production, earthquake location catalogues and Lagrangian plume modelling of particle trajectories in surface ocean currents to show that interannual variability in net primary production is related to seismicity and the advective spread of downstream surface waters. By spatially decomposing the relationship between seismicity, advective spread and net primary production, we demonstrate that net primary production at the surface, above the hydrothermal vents, can be predicted by elevated seismicity in the months before the growing season. Farther from the vents, greater advective spread reduces net primary production. We hypothesize that the connection between earthquakes and net primary production is mediated by the link between seismicity and hydrothermal emissions while advective spread controls the dilution of entrained iron; however, the physical mechanism behind the rapid surfacing of hydrothermal iron is still unknown. These findings challenge prevailing views on how geophysical processes influence ocean primary production. Earthquakes influence the amount of hydrothermal iron entering the ocean over the Australian Antarctic Ridge, which can support phytoplankton blooms by relieving surface iron limitation, according to observations combined with surface particle tracking."

Comparison to previous heart-derived fibrils reveals variations linked to sequence differences and insights into fibril assembly and organ tropism in AL amyloidosis. 
 Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) into amyloid fibrils, leading to multiorgan deposition and dysfunction, with the kidneys being one of the most commonly involved organs. Here, we report high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of AL amyloid fibrils from the kidney of a male patient with renal AL amyloidosis. Two distinct polymorphic fibril structures, polymorph A and polymorph B, were identified, both featuring ordered cores (Gln16-Ser95) with β-sheet-rich architectures stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Notably, six mutations in the IGLV1-44*01 gene sequence, including Gln39His and Tyr37Phe, were identified within the fibril core. These mutations influence fibril stability and aggregation by altering intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, such as CH-π stacking and salt bridge formation. Comparative analysis with previously reported heart-derived IGLV1-44 fibrils reveals structural variations linked to light-chain sequence differences. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular determinants of fibril assembly and organ tropism in AL amyloidosis.

Here, Verkest et al. combine 3DMINFLUX nanoscopy, electrophysiology and mutagenesis to obtain unprecedented molecular insights into Yoda’s mode-of-action. 
 The small molecule Yoda1 has become an indispensable tool for dissecting the role of the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1 in physiological and pathological contexts. Previous studies proposed that Yoda1 first binds to a hydrophobic pocket at the interface of the transmembrane helical units 8 and 9 close to the inner leaflet of the membrane to induce conformational flattening and thus channel activation and then transitions to a deeper located binding site with higher affinity in the open conformation. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, electrophysiology, computational modelling and 3D-MINFLUX nanoscopy, we refine this model by demonstrating that mutation of the previously proposed Yoda1 binding site-I, solely abolishes Yoda1-induced activation and channel flattening but preserves modulation of mechanically-evoked PIEZO1 currents, whereas mutation of F1715, which lines a transient binding cavity accessible only in the flattened PIEZO1 conformation, eliminated modulation without affecting Yoda-induced calcium entry. Thus, our data support a revised model for Yoda’s mode of action that distinguishes discrete allosteric pathways for PIEZO1 activation versus modulation and provides a framework for the design of next-generation use-dependent PIEZO1 modulators. The small molecule Yoda1 is a crucial pharmacological tool for studying the ion channel PIEZO1.

 The rapid emergence of RNA therapeutics has highlighted the need for more efficient, scalable and sustainable methods for their manufacture. Biocatalytic approaches hold particular promise, but rely on a secure, sustainable and low-cost supply of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) building blocks, including those containing chemical modifications. Here we report the development of a biocatalytic approach and engineered enzymes to convert widely available nucleosides into NTPs featuring pharmaceutically relevant modifications using inexpensive phosphate donors. Importantly our strategy obviates the need for ATP as a phosphate donor that complicates NTP isolation using existing methods. To showcase the utility of our approach, we employ an engineered acid phosphatase, polyphosphate kinase and acetate kinase to produce 2′-O-methoxyethyl-ATP (2′-MOE-ATP) and 2′-fluoro-ATP, key building blocks of commercial therapeutics. Finally, we show that crude NTPs from our process can be used directly in enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesis, obviating the need for costly NTP isolation or purification steps.

Here, the authors monitor ribosome binding to the GTPase EF-G and the ensuing mechanical work on mRNA in real time, uncovering a major energetic contribution from EF-G binding, rather than GTP hydrolysis, to the mechanical work. 
 The GTPase EF-G catalyzes translocation of mRNA and tRNAs relative to the ribosome and helps maintain the reading frame during protein synthesis. Which events directly require EF-G-mediated GTP hydrolysis during translocation are still debated. Using high-resolution optical tweezers endowed with single-molecule fluorescence detection, we simultaneously monitored binding of fluorescently-labeled EF-G to ribosomes and either mRNA unwinding or mRNA translocation relative to the body domain of the small ribosomal subunit. Using EF-G mutants and GTP analogs, we find that neither mRNA unwinding nor translocation require GTP hydrolysis and that these are independent events that may or may not temporally coincide. We propose that “tight binding” of EF-G to the ribosome triggers mRNA unwinding and translocation of mRNA relative to the 30S body domain and that while GTP hydrolysis kinetically accelerates translocation, it is thermodynamically required only to liberate the tightly bound EF-G from the ribosome.

 The preservation and faithful propagation of genetic information is essential for all life forms and depends on cellular pathways that enable replication, recombination, and repair of DNA. The multifunctional XPF-ERCC1 DNA endonuclease complex acts in several DNA repair pathways and interacts with numerous partner proteins and large DNA repair assemblies, including the nucleotide excision repair machinery and the SMX tri-endonuclease complex. Here, we report structures of XPF-ERCC1 in complex with the DNA repair factors SLX4 and SLX4IP, thereby identifying key residues responsible for direct interactions with XPF-ERCC1. When introduced into human cells, point mutations in these interfaces impair the interactions between XPF-ERCC1 and SLX4 or SLX4IP, and disruption of the XPF-SLX4IP interface leads to cis-platin sensitivity. Furthermore, our data reveal the structure of the human XPF-ERCC1-SLX4IP-SLX4330-555 complex with DNA bound at its active site, and they complete the structural characterisation of molecular interactions required to assemble the SMX complex. Structure-specific endonucleases play an important role in several DNA repair pathways. Here the authors present structures of the endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 in complex with SLX4, SLX4IP, and DNA. Combined with functional analysis, these results provide insight into the mechanisms of XPF-ERCC1 recruitment and activation during DNA repair."

 Existing fossil-fuel-burning power plants must be retired (or retrofitted with technology to capture and store CO2 emissions) before the end of their operating lifespans to achieve the most ambitious international climate goals (around 2 °C). Abbreviated power-plant lifespans, costly retrofits and lost revenues to power-plant owners in turn represent stranded assets, namely investments that can no longer earn a viable return because of climate policies. Here we use detailed data of power plants worldwide to evaluate the scale of financial risks by region, generator type and corporate ownership. We find that of the 100 companies that own the most stranded assets by value, the very largest are state-owned and the top 25 companies cumulatively hold upwards of US$770 and US$224 billion in stranded assets under a 1.5 °C scenario and 2.0 °C, respectively.

This work now presents a cathode that delivers longer cycle life than high-Ni chemistry while substantially reducing Ni use. 
 The transition to sustainable energy storage demands lithium-ion batteries with high energy density and reduced reliance on critical metals such as nickel (Ni), yet current strategies to increase capacity have largely depended on raising Ni content, leading to escalating supply risks, rising costs and sustainability concerns. More critically, Ni-rich cathodes suffer from rapid electrochemical degradation driven by structural instability, creating an insurmountable trade-off between capacity and cycle life. Here we introduce a low-Ni chemistry cathode, Li(Li0.05Ni0.57Mn0.31Co0.07)O2, with a radial phase integration design that overcomes these limitations, enabling a remarkable Ni usage reduction (Ni < 0.6) while demonstrating high capacity (215 mAh g−1) and markedly improved cyclability (~97% retention over 400 cycles) compared to conventional high-Ni cathodes (Ni = 0.8). Advanced X-ray and electron microscopy analyses reveal that the designed cathode exhibits a highly reversible oxygen anionic redox, benefiting from a structurally stable surface and minimizing irreversible phase transitions. Moreover, the integrated structure substantially mitigates lattice strain and improves mechanical stability even under harsh conditions. This advance offers a general design principle for developing next-generation cathodes that combine resource efficiency with long-term electrochemical reliability.

A study maps these risks globally and finds that factoring them into plant closures could improve reliability while supporting climate goals. 
 Hydroclimatic risks, such as increased water temperatures and water shortages, can impair the cooling efficiency of thermal power plants, threatening energy security. These risks worsen when decommissioning strategies for the low-carbon transition prioritize retiring smaller but lower-risk plants while keeping larger yet higher-risk ones. Yet, how hydroclimatic risks interact with these strategies remain poorly understood. Here we develop a global unit-level, capacity-specific framework to systematically assess hydroclimatic risks to thermal power generation under climate change. This framework maps risk intensification and risk-level escalation, and evaluates how integrating hydroclimatic risks into decommissioning plans can enhance energy security. We find that by the 2050s, ~60.5% of global thermal power capacity would face greater hydroclimatic risks under SSP370, as indicated by declining usable capacity ratios (UCRs)—the share of nameplate capacity that remains operable under hydroclimatic constraints. Integrating unit-level hydroclimatic risk constraints into decommissioning strategies could effectively raise the average UCRs of priority-retention units by 26–37 percentage points, although these units are typically slightly older. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating hydroclimatic risks into decommissioning decisions to balance energy security and climate mitigation goals.

Compared with a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for 2022–2060, an accelerated transition to low-GWP refrigerants and enhanced energy efficiency (ATE) is projected to reduce cumulative HFC consumption by 12.6 ± 0.4 Gt CO2-eq, with 70% of these reductions achieved through compliance with the Kigali Amendment compliance and the remainder from faster adoption.

 Understanding the interannual variability of summer precipitation across the Central-Eastern Himalayas (CEH) is essential for guiding efficient water management and supporting socio-economic development in South Asia. However, the mechanisms through which climate variability shapes CEH summer precipitation variability remain insufficiently understood. Summer precipitation in the CEH is modulated by multiple climate factors, with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation as a sustained weak force and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) exerting non-stationary effects. The SNAO can trigger an anomalous anticyclone over South Asia, directing low-level winds toward the Himalayas’ southern slopes, inducing precipitation anomalies through topographic mechanical forcing. The position shift of the SNAO-driven anomalous anticyclone to the south of the CEH modulates the coupled and decoupled relationship between SNAO and CEH summer precipitation variability. Therefore, understanding the dynamic links between the SNAO and CEH summer precipitation is key to enhancing precipitation prediction accuracy."

 Measurements of pre-industrial conditions are of paramount importance for understanding historical climate change.

We demonstrate the importance of pelagic “open ocean” (OO) and sympagic “sea ice” (SI) regions in supplying distinct organic nitrogen aerosol components. In the aerosol phase, dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA) are both secondary, though DMA likely originates mainly from pelagic regions, while TMA is associated mainly with sympagic regions. Parallel measurements in ice and surface waters reveal that melting sea ice contains a factor of four more TMA than coastal Antarctic Peninsula waters; and seventeen times more TMA than OO regions - suggesting additional coastal Antarctic sources. To better interpret future climate change, we recommend employing regional atmospheric chemistry models to understand these diverse aerosol sources."

 Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a sensitive region of climate change, with its precipitation change attracting considerable scientific attention. This study couples dynamical downscaling simulation with the storyline attribution approach to investigate the impact of regional climate change over East Asia (RCC) and TP (PCC) on the sub-daily precipitation over TP. RCC significantly reduces overall precipitation, mainly through decreased morning and stratiform precipitation, but enhances afternoon precipitation by increasing convective precipitation. Furthermore, RCC reduces the precipitation frequency and precipitation intensity, most substantially for morning stratiform precipitation. PCC exerts smaller and less statistically significant impact on precipitation than RCC. The opposing morning–afternoon effects of RCC stem from differing physical mechanisms: RCC stabilizes the atmosphere and reduces moisture in the morning, suppressing convection, while it enhances instability, moisture, and convective energy in the afternoon. Regional differences in RCC-induced precipitation changes are attributed to variations in moisture flux and atmospheric dynamics."

 Entrainment rate parameterization is important for convection schemes but uncertain in climate models. A new deep convective entrainment rate (λ) parameterization (HL parameterization) is developed from aircraft observations and implemented into the convection scheme (Song and Zhang, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017MS001191) in the Community Integrated Earth System Model version 1.1.0, replacing the previously used parameterization (Gregory parameterization). Compared with the Gregory parameterization, the HL parameterization simulates overall larger λ values and improves convective and large-scale precipitation simulations in the 30°S-30°N region, agreeing better with observations. The mechanism is that the HL parameterization suppresses deep convective cloud development macrophysically and microphysically compared with the Gregory parameterization. Indirectly, compared with the Gregory parameterization, the HL parameterization increases large-scale precipitation and reduces shallow convective precipitation, lowering total precipitation closer to observations. The HL parameterization enhances the model’s ability to simulate precipitation, providing a valuable reference for improving the deep convection scheme in climate models."

 According to the scientific consensus, tropical convection must decrease with global warming. This decrease is manifested by a decrease of the mass transported in the upward branch of the atmospheric overturning circulation – the convective mass flux – and a connected decrease of high clouds in the tropics, with implications for climate sensitivity. By using kilometer-scale simulations in radiative-convective equilibrium and a convective tracking algorithm, we show that no such decrease occurs in storms when taken individually and that the mass transport per storm increases instead. Storms can achieve this result by aggregating more surface of the convective cores – the inner part of the storm doing the vertical transport – so that the decrease of tropical convection is actually explained by a decrease in the total number of storms. There is little variation of the mean pressure velocity in the cores of the storms, a robust finding of this study. This remarkable invariance of the mean pressure velocity points to an emerging property of convection that should receive more attention in future studies."

 Accurate precipitation forecasting often relies on high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, which are essential for capturing fine-scale and nonlinear atmospheric dynamics. However, the computational demands of these models can be substantial. Leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), we present a stretched-grid AI-driven weather model with 6-km horizontal grid increments over the Western United States and ~31 km in other regions globally. The model employs an autoregressive framework to generate forecasts in minutes and is evaluated against global and regional NWP systems, as well as a lower-resolution AI model. Our results show that the regional AI model reduces 24-h accumulated precipitation errors, performs competitively with the regional NWP model, and effectively captures extreme precipitation events, particularly those linked to atmospheric rivers, which global coarser models often underestimate. This work underscores the potential of regional, high-resolution AI models for precipitation forecasting at km-scales, and discusses some of the challenges for future development."

 Wetlands serve as vital carbon sinks; however, compared with the surface carbon pool, the relative stock and stability of organic carbon (OC) buried in deep sediment layers remain uncertain, particularly in alpine regions. Based on 42 sediment across seven wetlands on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, this study disentangled the OC accumulation process and its drivers since the Holocene. Our results highlighted that deep sediments ( >1 m) stored ~70% of the total OC in alpine wetlands, much of which was labile. Historical warming facilitated the accumulation of such labile OC. Moreover, an intercalated sedimentary structure, formed by silt and fine-grained clay both below and above the OC-rich layer, prevented them from rapid decomposition. Given that elevated groundwater temperatures and intensified hydrological processes in alpine regions may stimulate the decomposition of these massive labile OC pools, releasing carbon into surface water or the atmosphere, future climate change assessments should take this long-overlooked carbon pool into account.

 The US Corn Belt is among the world’s most productive agricultural regions and a global hotspot for mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), which supply vital growing season rainfall but also drive hazardous flooding. While evapotranspiration (ET) from shallow groundwater, extensive croplands, and irrigation is known to influence regional precipitation, its role in fueling convective storms remains poorly understood. Here we use a high-resolution regional climate model coupled with an advanced water vapor tracer to track moisture from Corn Belt ET into individual convective storms. We find that the integrated groundwater-crop-irrigation interactions amplify MCS frequency by 24-35%, extend storm lifetime by up to 10%, and accelerate storm movement. Moisture from Corn Belt ET enhances the warm-moist inflows, sustaining convective cells and enhancing precipitation near the storm center, with more pronounced effects in stronger storms. These findings highlight the significant role of shallow groundwater and agricultural activities in intensifying convective storms, creating cascading hazards that threaten water and food security.

 Technological progress can help reduce the flood adaptation gap, but its sector-specific impacts remain unclear. Here, we developed a text-mining approach to analyze how four technologies—drones, online rescue forms, navigation apps, and drainage systems—affect perceived flood losses. We applied this model to 3.58 million social media posts from extreme floods in two Chinese cities. Results show highly heterogeneous effects: drones and online rescue forms support multisectoral recovery, while navigation apps and drainage mainly target traffic and buildings. For reducing casualties and restoring communication and water/electricity supply, drones (43.0%–62.2%) and online rescue forms (19.5%–37.1%) ranked higher in importance than rescue effort effectiveness (17.3%–28.5%). Technology adoption reduced perceived losses primarily by improving rescue effectiveness, with online rescue forms showing the strongest propagation path (coefficient: 0.577–0.579). This study provides a text-based framework for evaluating technology in flood adaptation and supports planning under resource constraints. Drones and online rescue forms lead to broad flood recovery, while navigation apps and drainage target traffic and buildings, according to text-mining modeling of millions of posts revealing sector-specific technology impacts and adaptation pathways."

 Driven by the essential role of blue carbon ecosystems in mitigating climate change and by scarce regional data, here we aim to quantify carbon sequestration rates and storage in a Moroccan coastal vegetated ecosystem over time using nuclear approaches. The carbon stocks recorded over the past 60 years ranged from 1.35 to 11.07 Mg Corg ha−1 in Merja Kahla and from 3.55 to 54.48 Mg Corg ha−1 and from 3.57 to 104.58 Mg Corg ha−1 in two cores from Merja Zerga. The highest carbon accumulation rates were observed in the top 5 cm of sediment cores, ranging from 14.60 to 53.08 g OC m−2 yr−1, suggesting a noticeable increase in recent years. These findings highlight the need to integrate blue carbon ecosystems into national policies as nature-based solutions for mitigating climate change and for enhancing the management and conservation of coastal and marine resources threatened by human activities. Carbon accumulation rates in seagrass sediments in Northern Morocco have increased in recent years, according to sediment core analysis from coastal vegetated ecosystems in Northern Morocco."

 Phreatic eruptions are a potentially lethal type of volcanic activity that is notoriously difficult to forecast. Understanding the complex processes that make eruptions more likely is a key step towards detecting precursory signals. Here, we employ 3-dimensional numerical models of heat and fluid flow based on field and laboratory data from Whakaari/White Island Volcano in New Zealand to explore the thermal, hydraulic, and geologic conditions that promote phreatic eruptions. Our results show that hydrothermally mineralised low-permeability seals can trap rising steam and magmatic gases until the pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the rock within days to months. Changes in persistent degassing through secondary vents can provide valuable insights into when the main sealed conduit is building to eruption. This study provides new insights into the timescales and mechanisms promoting phreatic eruptions, and a starting point to quantitatively interpret volcanic signals in terms of subsurface activity and eruptive potential. Phreatic eruptions at Whakaari volcano are influenced by subsurface pressurisation magnitudes and timescales, which are significantly influenced by hydrothermal mineralisation and magmatic gas input rates, according to 3-dimensional numerical modelling of volcanic hydrothermal systems."

 Hydrocarbon seeps release fossil methane into the marine environment, but emission of this seep-derived methane to the atmosphere is challenging to constrain. Here, we measure the concentration and radiocarbon content of dissolved methane in seawater above seeps in the northern Gulf of Mexico that have previously been linked to considerable atmospheric emissions. In bottom waters above the seeps, methane radiocarbon content is close to zero, confirming the release of fossil seep methane. However, radiocarbon signatures approach modern values at shallower depths, indicating that only ~21% of the methane in surface waters is sourced from seeps. We observe a mid-depth methane concentration maximum and radiocarbon minimum at ~200 m below the surface, but this likely reflects lateral advection of fossil methane from shallower seep fields. Our findings are consistent with previous radiocarbon fingerprinting in coastal regions, and suggest that seeps deeper than ~400 m are not a major contributor to atmospheric methane emissions. Gulf of Mexico hydrocarbon seeps deeper than 400 m are not a major contributor to marine atmospheric methane emissions, according to analyses of the concentration and natural radiocarbon content of methane dissolved in seawater above Gulf of Mexico hydrocarbon vents."

 Sea-level rise poses a significant threat to Africa’s vital coastal ecosystems and the livelihoods of its growing populations. Here we analyze 31 years of satellite altimetry data to quantify sea-level change across Africa’s Large Marine Ecosystems, vast ocean regions of high biological productivity. The rate of rise has accelerated markedly to 4.34 mm/yr since 2010, over four times the 1990s rate. This is primarily driven by two factors: an increase in ocean mass from melting ice sheets accounts for over 80% of the total rise, with the remainder reflecting the expansion of warming ocean water. Regional rates are fastest in the Red Sea and Guinea Current, while increased salinity suppresses the trend in the Mediterranean. 2023 was particularly severe, with record-high sea levels across nearly 40% of Africa’s surrounding ocean. This uneven rise intensifies risks for over 50 million coastal residents, underscoring the urgent need for region-specific adaptation.
