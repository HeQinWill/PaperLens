 The intensification of extreme rainfall has exacerbated widespread landslide hazards, particularly in tropic and subtropic regions. Hong Kong—the world's most densely populated city situated on steep, forested terrain—faces chronic landslide risks that are challenging to monitor with conventional Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), as hillslope failures are typically small and hidden beneath dense canopy. This study develops a novel detection framework integrating: 1) HARMIE (Homogeneous Amplitude-phase RefineMent for local Inconsistent phase Estimation), which enhances localized phase variability for subtle displacement retention; and 2) a phase gradient-based detection approach, linking slope responses with extreme rainfall. Simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate that HARMIE outperforms conventional methods by better preserving localized phase detail and magnitude. Using high-resolution ascending and descending Lutan-1 (LT-1) SAR datasets (July 2023–October 2024) over Lantau Island, Hong Kong, the framework mapped widespread hillslope failures triggered by the October 2023 extreme rainfalls, achieving a 27 % higher recognition rate than amplitude-homogeneity-based detection, with notable improvements in capturing subtle failures as narrow as ∼10 m. Ten active landslides concealed beneath forests were also pinpointed. Beyond detection, our analysis reveals that prolonged antecedent rainfall drives seasonal progressive creep on minor slopes and, for certain slopes, may interact with extreme rainfall to accelerate destabilization. This study represents the first InSAR-based mapping of small, forest-covered landslides in Hong Kong using L-band SAR, offering new insights into hillslope destabilization in forested mountainous terrain and advancing the development of landslide early-warning systems in such regions."

 Satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) products frequently encounter extensive data gaps that significantly limit their practical utility, necessitating the development of robust gap-filling techniques to generate SM datasets with enhanced accuracy and continuous spatiotemporal coverage. Existing studies have typically relied on single machine learning or interpolation methods to fill SM gaps at regional scales. Machine learning approaches excel at filling missing values in large regions but tend to smooth out important local SM features, while the interpolation methods perform well in areas with low levels of missing data, but exhibit significant uncertainty in regions with large amounts of continuously missing data. These two kinds of approaches show potential complementarity and could together contribute to a more robust gap-filling method, which however have rarely been investigated. To fill this research gap, we established a novel SM gap-filling method by synergizing the advantages of machine learning for large-scale gap filling and the excellent gap-filling performance of interpolation in localized areas using the Stacking method at a global scale. The proposed approach integrates four base models including three machine learning techniques namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), and one interpolation method known as Natural Neighbor Interpolation (NNI), and employs the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) as the meta model. We compared the Stacking method and individual approaches in filling ESA CCI missing SM data, and validated the gap-filled SM using extensive ground SM from 1086 sites worldwide. The results indicate: (1) RF performs the best among the six selected machine learning methods, and its overall accuracy at a global scale is higher than that of interpolation methods. The feature importance analysis by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicates ERA5 SM, NDVI, and Global Aridity Index have high importance in the RF gap-filling model; (2) NNI is the best performing approach among the four selected interpolation methods, and it demonstrates better performance than machine learning methods in localized areas where the original SM data is relatively abundant; (3) Stacking is an effective method for SM gap filling on a global scale, with an averaged ubRMSE of 0.017 m3/m3, RMSE of 0.022 m3/m3, Bias of 0.006 m3/m3, and R of 0.87 against the original ESA CCI SM, and it reduces the RMSE by 0.009 m3/m3, ubRMSE by 0.006 m3/m3, and improves R by 0.15 relative to the individual best-performing RF method; (4) The gap-filled SM shows an improved skill than the original ESA CCI SM against global distributed ground SM, with Stacking displaying the lowest ubRMSE of 0.057 m3/m3 and the highest R of 0.63. The proposed Stacking method opens new avenues to fill the gaps in various satellite SM datasets."

 High spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images often show image features due to surface waves, swells, fronts, internal waves, eddies, and currents under different sunglint and skyglint reflections. Here, MSI images are used to estimate wave direction and wavelength through a simple but practical method using Angular spectrum analysis (ASA). The method does not require the complex transfer function between the image domain and the physical domain, but is based on the MSI-derived Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrum that reveals the wave direction, whose 180o ambiguity is then removed by the inter-band time lag between the B04 and B08 bands (0.74 s). The wavelength of different sea waves (wind wave and swell) can also be estimated by quantifying the MSI FFT images. There is a statistically significant linear relationship between MSI-derived and buoy-measured wave direction and wavelength (N = 144) with low bias. Further analyses according to wave age criterion show a better statistical relationship for wind waves (N = 62) than swells (N = 82). Comparison with the hourly wind products of the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) shows RMS differences of <1.4 m/s and 14.4o for wind speed and direction, respectively. These results demonstrate that, under certain observing conditions, high spatial-resolution optical remote sensing images can provide relatively accurate estimates of surface wave directions and wavelengths as well as wind speeds, while operational applications still require further work."

 Fine-resolution maps of forest carbon and aboveground biomass (AGB) effectively represent spatial patterns and can be flexibly aggregated to map subregions by computing spatial averages or totals of pixel-level predictions. However, generalized model-based uncertainty estimation for spatial aggregates requires computationally expensive processes like iterative bootstrapping and computing pixel covariances. Uncertainty estimation for map subregions is critical for enhancing practicality and eventual adoption of model-based data products, as this capability would empower users to produce estimates at scales most germane to management of the landscape: individual forest stands and ownership parcels. In this study we produced estimates of standard error (SE) associated with spatial averages of fine-resolution AGB map predictions for a stratified random sample of ownership parcels (0–2023 hectares) in New York State (NYS). This represents the first model-based uncertainty estimation study to include all four types of uncertainty (reference data, sample variability, residual variability, and auxiliary data), incorporate spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, and use methods compatible with algorithmic modeling (machine learning or nonparametric). We found that uncertainty attributed to residual variance, largely resulting from spatial correlation of residuals, dominated all other sources for all of the parcels in the study. These results suggest that improvements to model accuracy will yield the greatest reductions to total uncertainty in regions like the northeastern and midwestern United States where forests are divided into smaller spatial units. Further, we demonstrated that log–log regression relating parcel characteristics (area, perimeter, AGB density, forest cover) to parcel-level SE can accurately estimate uncertainty for map subregions, thus providing a convenient means to empower map users. These findings support transparency in future model-based forest carbon accounting and monitoring efforts."

 As global urbanization accelerates and ecological challenges intensify, effective monitoring and assessing ecological conditions have become critical for sustainable development. Remote sensing technologies play an increasingly crucial role in this context. The Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), a next-generation remote sensing satellite, provides 10-m spatial resolution and multispectral imaging capabilities, offering new opportunities for ecological monitoring. This study explores the ecological potential of SDGSAT-1 data, focusing on the comprehensive assessment of urban heat islands (UHI), urban vegetation coverage, and regional ecological conditions. This is achieved through a detailed comparison with the widely-used Landsat-8/9 data. The study develops several methodologies for cloud detection, atmospheric correction, and land dryness retrieval. Validation shows that the cloud removal effect achieved by the proposed SDGSAT Cloud Mask (SCM) algorithm is comparable to, or slightly better than, those of the CFMask algorithm for Landsat-9 and the machine learning-based S2cloudless algorithm for Sentinel-2A, with F1 scores greater than 0.92. The results show that the monitoring of regional ecological conditions by SDGSAT-1 is very similar to that of Landsat-8/9, with differences generally under 5 %. Because SDGSAT-1's multispectral and thermal infrared imagery has higher spatial resolution than Landsat-8/9, it can detect 5.6 % more vegetation area and 2.6 times larger high-temperature areas within urban environments than Landsat data. SDGSAT-1's finer resolution enables more detailed ecological assessments, supporting urban sustainability applications. However, due to the lack of shortwave infrared bands in the SDGSAT-1 imagery, it is less effective than Landsat-8/9 in interpreting land surface dryness and moisture content."

 Emperor penguins serve as early-warning sentinels for the Antarctic ecosystem and climate change. Understanding how climate change influences their habitat use offers insights into the fragile polar ecosystem for supporting the climate actions under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, it remains unclear how the gradual climate change and extreme climatic events affect the dispersal of emperor penguin breeding habitats due to the lack of a systematic and long-term dataset documenting their habitat use. Here, we first develop guano indices and present an automated approach to map emperor penguin breeding habitats at 30-m spatial resolution using Earth observation satellite imagery, achieving a user accuracy of 94.8 %. We further reveal that habitat dispersal is sensitive to four extreme events—heat, blizzard, storm, and low sea ice. Specifically, colonies exposed to intense climate extremes generally exhibit more fragmented distributions, with habitat reuse periods mostly under 3 years and interannual habitat dispersal exceeding 4 km. These four extreme events together explained 21 %–72 % of the variability in annual habitat dispersal. Under a high-emission scenario driven by fossil fuels, the warming-induced annual fragmentation of habitats is projected to be 255 m greater than that under a low-emission scenario using clean energy, leading to higher vulnerability in emperor penguins by disrupting their ability to survive and reproduce. The proposed method enables routine mapping and updating of emperor penguin breeding habitats, and the associated findings demonstrate that extreme climatic events significantly impact habitat use and dispersal patterns, highlighting the urgent need for global climate policies aligned with sustainable development to protect the Antarctic ecosystem."

 This study presents a new satellite ocean color data record of Secchi depth (ZSD) observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). As part of the NOAA enterprise satellite data processing, the decade-long ZSD data are derived from the visible and near-infrared reflectance measurements over oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Based on in situ data, the model is excellent in generating low-uncertainty ZSD data with an absolute percentage difference (APD) of 15%–29%. The satellite and in situ matchups confirm reliable satellite retrievals with APD = 19%–26% over the ZSD range of 0.1–60 m. Although the product uncertainties are dependent on optical water types, assessments show that the satellite ZSD estimations are very reliable, especially where ZSD ≥ 1 m. This new satellite product has enabled the ability to access Level-2 daily ZSD imagery and information as well as Level-3 data aggregated on daily to monthly scales. Our examination indicates that the ocean transparent windows are situated at 443 and 486 nm in the vast open oceans and 551 nm for most coastal waters. They shift to the red band at 671 nm for extremely turbid environments, such as large river estuaries. From a global perspective, the ZSD data extend from less than half a meter in nearshore environments to >70 m in the South Pacific Gyre, while demonstrating a strong dependency on the optical water types. Short-term fluctuations over time are registered in the satellite ZSD daily and monthly data from almost every aquatic environment. Trend analyses reveal significant increases in water transparency over many regions, especially the open ocean. We stress the necessity of normalizing satellite ZSD estimations to eliminate the uncertainties induced by different solar-zenith angles. The present satellite products can be further improved by accounting for the limitations imposed by the multispectral reflectance data with hyperspectral ocean color spectra."

 Global soil salinization and sodification threaten food security by causing excessive salt accumulation in soils, degrading productivity. However, their spatiotemporal patterns have not been well documented due to the lack of high-accuracy estimates of soil salinity and sodicity with a long-term perspective. Here we propose a novel framework combining the Box-Cox transformation that addresses the skewed distribution of samples and more critical predictors as well as remote sensing indices, to predict global soil salinity (electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract, ECe) and sodicity (exchangeable sodium percentage, ESP) from 1980 to 2024 with a 1 km × 1 km resolution using random forest. Model accuracy is higher than previous studies, with root mean square error (RMSE) of ECe and ESP as 2.24 and 6.04 respectively, and an R2 of 0.65, and 0.60 respectively. The implementation of the Box-Cox transformation significantly improved the model performance (R2) by approximately 100 % (from 0.35 to 0.79 for ECe and 0.59 to 0.85 for ESP), while the additional predictors further enhanced the performance (R2 increased by 15 %), ranking in the top 30 % of the feature importance list. Results revealed that global multiple-year average salinization and sodification are primarily concentrated in arid regions characterized by low precipitation and high temperatures. We also found a significant increasing trend of soil salinization in 20 % of global land and of sodification in 48 % of global land from 1980 to 2024, both most pronounced near the equator, as well as in central and eastern North America, Europe, southeastern China, and Mongolia.

The PROSPECT model is based on measurable parameters (the leaf biochemical content) and a non-measurable parameter (the leaf anatomical structure represented by the leaf structure parameter (N)). The effect of N on the optical properties of leaves has been investigated through a number of local and global sensitivity analyses. Other studies have directly evaluated the effect of the leaf anatomical structure on spectral reflectance, particularly in the near infrared region. However, the relationship between N and the anatomical structure is unclear. In this study, we leveraged eLeaf, a ray tracing-based 3D rice leaf simulator, to establish relationships between leaf anatomical features and spectral properties, enabling us to replace N in the PROSPECT-4 model with measurable leaf anatomical parameters and develop the RSPECT model. The leaf thickness at minor vein, leaf thickness at bulliform cells, mesophyll thickness at minor vein, and distance between two minor veins could be used to predict N effectively. The RSPECT model achieved spectral simulation accuracy comparable to PROSPECT-4 and was more suitable for parameter inversion of the physical and chemical properties of rice leaves, with relative root mean square errors of 7.4 % for chlorophyll content, 5.6 % for equivalent water thickness, and 7.5 % for dry matter content. In conclusion, RSPECT improves radiative transfer modeling by integrating measurable anatomical features and provides a framework for extending this approach to other vegetation types."

 High-resolution mapping of forest attributes is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and carbon budget assessments. Recent advancements have leveraged satellite imagery and deep learning algorithms to generate high-resolution forest height maps. While these maps provide valuable snapshots of forest conditions, they lack the temporal resolution to estimate forest-related carbon fluxes or track annual changes. Few studies have produced annual forest height, volume, or biomass change maps validated at the forest stand level. To address this limitation, we developed a deep learning framework, coupling data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2) and from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission, to generate a time series of forest height, growing stock volume, and aboveground biomass at 10 to 30-m spatial resolution that we refer to as FORMS-T (FORest Multiple Satellite Time series). Unlike previous studies, we train our model on individual S2 scenes, rather than on growing season composites, to account for acquisition variability and improve generalization across years. We produced these maps for France over seven years (2018–2024) for height at 10 m resolution and further converted them to 30 m maps of growing stock volume and aboveground biomass using leaf type-specific allometric equations. Evaluation against the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) showed an average mean absolute error of 3.07 m for height (r2 = 0.68) across all years, 86 m3 ha-1 for volume and 65.1 Mg ha-1 for biomass. We further evaluated FORMS-T capacity to capture growth on a site where two successive airborne laser scanning (ALS) campaigns were available, showing a good agreement with ALS data when aggregating at coarser spatial resolution (r2 = 0.60, MAE = 0.27 m for the 2020–2022 growth of trees between 10 and 15 m in 5 km pixels). Additionally, we compared our results to the NFI-based wood volume production at regional level and obtained a good agreement with a MAE of 1.45 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and r2 of 0.59. We then leveraged our height change maps to derive species-specific growth curves and compared them to ground-based measurements, highlighting distinct growth dynamics and regional variations in forest management practices. Further development of such maps could contribute to the assessment of forest-related carbon stocks and fluxes, contributing to the formulation of a comprehensive carbon budget at the country scale, and supporting global efforts to mitigate climate change."

 The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation provides unprecedentedly high spatiotemporal resolution for Earth observations but is limited by radiometric inconsistencies resulting from sensor degradation and spectral configuration differences. Existing harmonization methods often rely on internal or external references, limiting harmonization to only a subset of spectral bands or restricting applicability to localized spatiotemporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose Harmoni-Planet, a novel harmonization method that leverages graph-based greedy optimization to achieve holistic radiometric consistency across all PlanetScope bands without requiring reference data. The method consists of two components: (1) graph construction, which integrates unharmonized images into a graph with nodes representing images and edges connecting intersecting images, and (2) graph optimization, which iteratively minimizes radiometric inconsistencies between each image and its intersecting images to optimize consistency. Harmoni-Planet was validated across four geographically diverse regions (the Nile, Beijing, Indonesia, and Greenland), achieving substantial mean absolute error (MAE) reductions of 53 %, 53 %, 57 %, and 25 %, respectively, and outperforming the CubeSat-enabled spatiotemporal enhancement method (CESTEM; 40 %, 41 %, 47 %, and − 69 %, respectively) and the official harmonization algorithm (25 %, 33 %, −9 %, and 9 %, respectively). Harmoni-Planet significantly improves the spatial and temporal comparability of imagery across all PlanetScope bands, regardless of whether images are acquired by the same or different generations of satellites. In addition, it supports flexible scene-based and strip-based implementations, effectively resolving both intra-strip and cross-strip inconsistencies. It also demonstrates robust potential for near-real-time harmonization of newly acquired imagery to accommodate the rapidly expanding data volume of the PlanetScope constellation. Furthermore, Harmoni-Planet supports seamless integration with standard third-party reflectance products such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Harmoni-Planet provides a practical solution to address cross-sensor radiometric inconsistencies, substantially improving the quality and reliability of PlanetScope data for diverse Earth observation applications."

 The urban land-use map reflects the distribution of the different functional lands in the city, serving as a valuable reference for urban planning and management. High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) images provide detailed spatial information about parcels but lack socio-economic information, which is crucial for identifying land-use types. To enhance the mapping performance and obtain more comprehensive land-use information, the integration of HRS images and points of interest (POIs) with socio-economic information is crucial. Nonetheless, the existing land-use mapping methods based on HRS images and POIs are generally confronted with the following challenges: 1) due to the reliance on prior knowledge, the existing methods cannot automatically capture the complex relationships between multi-source data and land-use categories; 2) there are substantial semantic disparities between HRS images and POIs, so that the simple fusion approaches cannot fully utilize the complementary information; and 3) the existing methods are generally based on the assumption of complete modalities, resulting in them failing to work on POI-deficient parcels. In this paper, to address these issues, an end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating HRS images and multi-source geographic data (Multi-E2E) is proposed. The Multi-E2E framework automatically establishes the mapping from multi-source data to land-use categories through a data-driven approach, and generates informative fused representations with an adaptive fusion module (AFM). In Multi-E2E, the labeled HRS image-POI pairs are constructed using the areas of interest (AOIs), and the interactions between modalities are facilitated by the end-to-end architecture. To identify POI-deficient parcels and ensure that the modality-specific encoders are adequately supervised, a unimodal supervision module (USM) is introduced in the Multi-E2E framework. Experiments conducted with multi-source samples from 34 Chinese cities and the urban regions of Beijing, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Macao, and Helsinki validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for urban land-use mapping applications.

 Local climate zone (LCZ) provides a detailed classification system for building types in urban areas and offers a unified standard for block-scale surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, LCZ mapping methods with high classification accuracy for global applicability, and multi-city comparison of SUHI based on LCZ are still needed. In this study, we developed a transferable LCZ mapping framework for 30 China cities at 120 m by using multi-source remote sensing and GIS data, and random forest model. The gap-filled LST for 21 cities among 30 cities with diverse urbanized levels and climate conditions were generated, utilizing Landsat 8 data, LST retrieval algorithm and gap-filling method. Spatial patterns of SUHI intensity across climate zones and cities of different sizes were explored, and the impacts of urban morphology on SUHI in built-up LCZs were analyzed using the boosted regression trees model. Results showed that the proposed LCZ mapping framework achieved high accuracy in China cities, with overall accuracy from 0.86 to 0.93. Its robustness and transferability were further demonstrated in three cities in the United States with overall accuracy of 0.91 to 0.93. LST gap-filling method also performed well, with R from 0.71 to 0.91 and RMSE from 1.86 °C to 3.59 °C, respectively. Our multi-city assessment revealed consistent patterns of SUHI in LCZs across climate zones: compact mid-rise (LCZ 2) and large low-rise (LCZ 8) had the highest SUHI intensity, while sparsely built (LCZ 9) and open low-rise (LCZ 6) had the lowest values. Moreover, LCZ 2 tended to have higher SUHI intensity in colder climate regions, while LCZ 8 exhibited higher values in warmer climate regions. City size also influenced SUHI effect in built-up LCZs, with large cities exhibiting SUHI intensity up to 1 °C higher than small cities. Additionally, vegetation exhibited the largest of relative importance (20 % to 68 %) which impacted SUHI intensity in built-up LCZs, with a higher value in cold cities compared to warm cities. Impervious or building surface fraction also accounted for 13 % to 45 % of the SUHI contribution across LCZs, with relative importance about 3 % to 10 % greater in warmer and larger cities. The findings of this study can be useful in developing urban planning policies for intra-city SUHI mitigation, and our transferable LCZ mapping framework can be applied to other global cities for SUHI studies."

 Changes in forest structure (FS) significantly influence forest conditions and dynamics, ecosystem services, including biomass accumulation and biodiversity. Several LiDAR metrics have been described to analyse FS at a high spatial resolution, including vertical and horizontal attributes. This study aimed to investigate FS development in spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) through the first 50 years after planting and their relationship to biomass stocks and richness of arrival tree species. LiDAR and ground truth data were extracted from 60 plots. To characterize the FS, LiDAR metrics were calculated using a point cloud of 5.4 pulses/m2 under leaf-off conditions from 2019. Moreover, trees were measured in 2022 following the Danish National Forest Inventory protocols to calculate biomass and estimate tree species richness. FS changes and their relationship were analyzed by employing linear mixed models and principal component analysis (PCA). Results show that spruce stands exhibited rapid growth in height and the highest canopy cover values over time. Contrarily, oak stands developed a multi-layer canopy, increasing light availability and tree size variability with age. At later stages, beech stands reached similar height as spruce and showed the highest standard deviation of height (StDH) with age. The PCA revealed that tree maximum height and StDH were primarily age-dependent, while the internal vertical and horizontal variability tree species dependent. Spruce showed a constant homogeneous FS, oak was characterized by a high internal and external FS heterogeneity, while beech gradually decreased the FS variability over time. Old, tall and structurally homogeneous beech and spruce stands supported the highest biomass accumulation. Conversely, more structurally heterogeneous oak stands tended to harbor greater tree species richness. The study underscores the importance of incorporating both vertical and horizontal dimensions to understand FS changes and the trade-offs between biomass production and biodiversity in monoculture afforestation."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquisition is increasingly challenged by the overcrowded radio frequency bands, leading to the problem of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), particularly at L-band. Knowledges about global RFI are important for the protection of the microwave bands allocated for active remote sensing, SAR system design and operation, as well as the systematic mitigation of RFI for SAR data end users. It is becoming more important as we are entering the unprecedented golden age of L-band SAR satellites. In this work, we develop algorithms, workflow and system for operationally measuring global RFI experienced by L-band SAR data. We define a data format for recording the RFI measurements, which facilitates the computation of a number of RFI metrics. We process all available L-band SAR data acquired by the JAXA ALOS-1 (2006–2011) and JERS-1 (1992–1998) satellites. For comparison with RFI in C-band data, we also process part of the ESA Envisat (2002−2012) data archive acquired in the same time frame (2005–2007). The final results provide a global view of RFI at L-band, showing its spatial and temporal variations. We find heavy RFI pollutions in East Asia, North America, and the region consisting of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Comparison of results from ALOS-1 and JERS-1 indicates the increasing trend of RFI pollution. Comparison with C-band Envisat result shows that RFI at L-band is significantly more severe than at C-band. Comparison of results from different polarizations shows that cross polarization data are more susceptible to RFI due to their lower radar backscatter. The global RFI distribution from L-band SAR data is found similar to that from L-band passive radiometers including SMOS and SMAP."

 The accurate retrieval of land surface phenology (LSP) for drylands is extremely challenging. Drylands exhibit vegetation characteristics such as sparse and patchy vegetation cover, low seasonal greenness variability, and high spatial heterogeneity. The irregular rainy and dry episodes often complicate vegetation growth, leading to an irregular temporal trajectory with multiple growth stages during the greenup and senescence phases. Moreover, the heterogeneous phenological cycles among the vegetation species in a satellite pixel and other factors may lead to a long period with only a very slight increase or decrease in greenness before or after a vegetation growing cycle. Current phenological retrieval methods, however, commonly assume that vegetation greenness gradually increases in a greenup phase and decreases in a senescence phase, following a single sigmoidal growth trajectory, which is inadequate to describe the irregular growth in drylands. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm to improve on the hybrid piecewise logistic model (HPLM) for improving LSP retrievals, especially in drylands. Our enhanced HPLM (E-HPLM) algorithm addresses two characteristics of irregular growth trajectories: (1) the multiple plateau stages within a greenup or senescence phase, and (2) the long linear tail before the start or after the end of a growing season. Specifically, we identified multiple growth stages within a greenup or senescence phase in order to fit each stage separately with a logistic model, and added a linear parameter to the logistic model to eliminate long linear tails by adjusting the background values. We implemented this new algorithm to retrieve LSPs in global drylands using the 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) dataset from 2013 to 2022. The results were then compared with those of HPLM-retrieved LSPs. We also evaluated the E-HPLM results using phenometrics derived from the PhenoCam observations at site levels and the fused Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS)-PhenoCam dataset at regional levels. The E-HPLM was able to reduce the uncertainty by ∼10 days in the pixels with plateau stages from 2013 to 2022 in global drylands in comparison with the HPLM algorithm, where the plateau stage appeared in over 74 % of drylands. Compared with the HPLM, the E-HPLM improved overall phenology accuracy by two days for the PhenoCam sites and one to four days in HLS-PhenoCam areas, although the improvements varied with land cover types and aridity levels. The E-HPLM algorithm has the potential to replace the current HPLM algorithm, with improved ability to retrieve LSP in drylands and to generate global LSP products."

 Regressions are commonly used in environmental science and economics to identify causal or associative relationships between variables. In these settings, remote sensing-derived map products increasingly serve as sources of variables, enabling estimation of effects such as the impact of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and — because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs — errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimators from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to estimate regression coefficients relating a response variable and covariates to each other. PPI is a method that estimates parameters of interest by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth sample data and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors.

 Accurate urban land-use mapping is an essential undertaking for various urban issues, such as urban planning, disease transmission, and climate change. Recently, learning-based method has emerged as a prevalent approach for urban land-use mapping, although it relies heavily on abundant labeled data. However, since land-use categories are jointly determined by physical and social attributes, obtaining such labels is challenging. This scarcity of labeled data often leads existing learning-based methods to overfit, resulting in models that struggle to recognize diverse land-use categories. To bypass these limitations, this paper for the first time advocates knowledge graph to leverage indirect supervision from related tasks for zero-shot land-use mapping. Toward this goal, this paper introduces a multi-granularity knowledge graph reasoning (mKGR) framework.R Only with indirect supervision from other tasks, mKGR can automatically integrate multimodal geospatial data as varying granularity entities and rich spatial–semantic interaction relationships. Subsequently, mKGR incorporates a fault-tolerant knowledge graph embedding method to establish relationships between geographic units and land-use categories, thereby reasoning land-use mapping outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mKGR not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches, but also exceeds those with direct supervision, achieving improvements of 0.16, 0.08, and 0.20 on PA, UA, and OA. Furthermore, this paper reveals the superiority of mKGR in large-scale holistic reasoning, an essential aspect of land-use mapping. Benefiting from mKGR’s zero-shot classification and large-scale holistic reasoning capabilities, a comprehensive urban land-use map of China is generated with low-cost. In addition, a nationwide assessment of 15-minute city walkability over the land-use map provides insights for urban planning and sustainable development.

 Quantitative information on fracture distributions across Antarctic ice shelves is crucial for improving the predictability of ice shelf calving and retreat. Satellite imagery acquired by various optical and radar sensors provides a valuable resource for studying fracture processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Retrieving high-resolution fracture information at extended spatial and frequent temporal scales is particularly important for understanding the complex dynamics of ice shelves and improving the predictive modeling of their evolution. To efficiently retrieve spatiotemporal fracture information, we developed a novel multitask learning U-shaped network architecture (MLU-Net) for automatic and accurate fracture detection (including fracture areas and lines) from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We evaluated the performance and generalizability of MLU-Net through comprehensive experiments on the Amery, Thwaites Eastern, and Brunt ice shelves. Our results show that MLU-Net successfully maps the multitemporal fracture distributions over the three ice shelves in Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-1 SAR images, and that fusing the optical- and SAR-derived results enhances fracture detection. Quantitatively, MLU-Net achieves the highest F1 scores of 0.955 and 0.928 on the optical and SAR images, respectively, with a mean overall accuracy of 0.905 and a mean intersection over union of 0.792 across both image types. Beyond extracting fracture areas and lines, we formulated two fracture indices (fracture area-to-area and length-to-area ratios) that account for fracture distributions to characterize structural damage. Our findings indicate that the fracture area-to-area ratio is more sensitive to rift widening, while the fracture length-to-area ratio more effectively captures newly formed fractures with minimal sensitivity to image types and imaging conditions. Therefore, the proposed algorithm and fracture indices provide a promising framework for measuring ice shelf fractures at a continental scale, advancing the monitoring and modeling of ice shelf dynamics."

 Monitoring water quality and understanding how estuarine ecosystems respond to environmental changes is essential to sustain their ecological integrity and associated ecosystem services. In this study, we demonstrate that Optical Water Type (OWT) classification from Sentinel-2 MSI can be used as a stand-alone product rather than an intermediate tool for algorithm refinement, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring, using the Tagus Estuary as an example. In-situ measurements (Chl-a, temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen) were employed to characterize environmental conditions associated with OWT classes and to analyse the spatio-temporal and tidal variability during 2017–2024. We identified distinct water quality profiles among groups of OWTs, which were associated with marine, transitional and riverine waters with different physico-chemical characteristics that were related to different environmental drivers. Tides significantly influenced the distribution of OWTs, with high and neap tides favouring the occurrence of clearer marine waters. Specific OWT classes emerged as indicators for key environmental processes, including marine water intrusion, freshwater inputs and phytoplankton-rich waters. Time-series analysis revealed a trend of increasing marine waters inside the estuary alongside interannual variability driven by hydro-climatic forcings. Our findings highlight OWT classification as a valuable stand-alone satellite product for water quality monitoring, providing a powerful and scalable tool for estuarine science, policy, and management."

 Implementing high spectral resolution imaging from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) paved the way for detailed retrieval of agricultural traits for accurate crop monitoring and management. The proposed methodology involves the integration and detailed analysis of Radiative Transfer Modelling (RTM) with an integrated approach of machine learning (ML) and Active Learning (AL) algorithms for the retrieval of the Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC), Carotenoids (Car) and Leaf Area index (LAI) of wheat cropland from the continuous three years of the dataset. Reflectance values of leaf were collected using Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) − Spectroradiometer data ranging from 350-2500 nm and EnMAP satellite hyperspectral data extends spectral data range varies between 420 nm to 1000 nm in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) of EMR region, and from 900 nm to 2450 nm in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region for crop parameters mapping for a larger spatial area of Varanasi district, Uttar Pradesh, India. The PROSPECT + SAIL (PROSAIL) RTM was employed to simulate spectral (reflectance) data, and fourteen ML algorithms were assessed for implementation into a hybrid model. Kernel Ridge regression (KRR) was combined with Euclidean-based Diversity (EBD) algorithms to retrieve crop characteristics due to their exceptional accuracy and reduced uncertainty. Spectral profiles were further used to train hybrid models using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) feature selection, and combined techniques (ML + AL) were applied to retrieve LCC, Car, and LAI. Afterwards, biophysical and biochemical spatial large-scale estimation were provided through atmospherically corrected, and noise-removed EnMAP hyperspectral data with the help of a trained and tested hybrid (ML + AL) model and validated with the ground-measured datasets. The performance indicators showed significantly very high values of correlation during calibration (LCC = 0.99, Car = 0.74, and LAI = 0.99) and validation (LCC = 0.66, Car = 0.57, and LAI= 0.88). The work showed that the optimized hybrid (KRR + AL) models customized for EnMAP hyperspectral data can efficiently estimate the wheat biophysical and biochemical parameters in near-real time therefore, expanding this workflow to agricultural fields may enable more effective monitoring and management of wheat crops."

 Full-waveform airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) technology, in which the analyzed waveforms reflect the temporal positions and attribute information of targets, is effective in shallow water. However, weak seafloor echoes in full-waveform data induced by environmental and device characteristics are confused with noise signals, leading to difficulties in seafloor detection. This paper proposes a pregeneration–recognition method of detecting weak seafloor echoes for ALB. First, a two-stage local maximum algorithm is developed to identify potential seafloor echoes in waveforms and to pregenerate points. Then, an adaptive ellipsoidal neighborhood related to the point density is used to select neighborhood points, and eigenvalue-based spatial features are calculated. Finally, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) model is constructed using the points generated from surface–seafloor shots, and the seafloor points in seafloor-undefined shots are obtained by optimizing the BPNN results. The proposed method is verified on four swaths collected via the Optech Aquarius ALB system near Wuzhizhou Island and Ganquan Island in the South China Sea. The numbers of additional points detected with the proposed method near these two islands increase by 195.9 % and 40.1 % compared with the Aquarius system, which is better than the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution method. The coverages and maximum depth of seafloor points are improved and the accuracy evaluations demonstrate the credibility of the results. Therefore, the proposed pregeneration–recognition method can effectively improve the detection rate for weak seafloor echoes and the depth performance of ALB systems. Future research will focus on mitigating the impact of seafloor topography on the proposed method to expand its application scenarios."

 Savanna fires are a dominant ecological force in West Africa, shaping land systems, carbon dynamics, and biodiversity. Yet, their impacts on ecosystem productivity and recovery remain poorly quantified at meaningful spatial and temporal scales. This study presents a decadal assessment (2014–2023) of fire activity and post-fire vegetation response across a ∼ 229,000  km2 transboundary region of Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire. Using Harmonized Landsat–Sentinel (HLS) imagery and VIIRS active fire detections, we mapped burned areas (BA) at 30  m resolution—capturing extensive small fires often missed by global datasets. Fire-induced Net Primary Productivity (NPP) losses were estimated using downscaled MODIS productivity data, and post-fire recovery times were tracked at monthly and annual scales. Fires were highly seasonal, with > 80 % of BA occurring between November and January, peaking in December. Despite a dip around 2017, interannual BA remained relatively stable (0.29 % yr−1 increase, p > 0.05). Immediate NPP losses averaged ∼ 11 × 10–2 Mg C ha−1 per year, with higher per-hectare losses in forested and high-biomass zones. Roughly 65 % of BA recovered to pre-fire NPP levels within a year, primarily in grasslands and croplands. However, recovery in woody and mesic areas was slower and more variable. We emphasize that recovery was assessed in terms of NPP (carbon uptake), not structural biomass or species composition—functional recovery does not necessarily imply full ecological recovery. Using machine learning, we identified soil moisture (dry-season NDMI) and temperature as dominant predictors of recovery time, with soil fertility (nitrogen content) and water retention capacity emerging as key drivers. Interestingly, fire frequency and land cover type had limited predictive power once climate and soil factors were accounted for, suggesting that environmental factors, more than fire regime characteristics, shape recovery. These findings support the idea that well-timed, low-intensity fires—particularly early-season burns—can promote carbon resilience in fire-adapted landscapes. This underscores the value of high-resolution remote sensing and soil data in guiding fire-smart management and balancing ecological and livelihood goals under climate change."

 Estimating room layout from panoramas is a new trend in the holistic reconstruction of the 3D environment. However, a single panorama is easily occluded by walls and furniture, making it hard to reconstruct the whole indoor room accurately and completely. Besides, deep learning room layout estimating methods often perform poorly in unseen scenes. To address this need, this paper proposes an accurate room layout estimation method from multi-view panoramas with multi-label graph cut. The proposed method takes full advantage of each panorama by utilizing multi-label graph cut. First, room layouts of each panorama are estimated with pre-trained deep-learning models and projected to the ground as the labels; then, a geometry-aware ray-casting method is utilized to obtain the initial floorplan; next, the initial floorplan is regularized by multi-label graph cut with the estimated labels from each panorama; in the end, the final layouts of each panorama is obtained by transforming the regularized floorplans and estimated ceiling heights into layouts with panorama geometry. Experiments in the recently released multi-view panoramas dataset show that the proposed method can regularize the initial floorplan to a floorplan with accurate geometry. Furthermore, the accuracy of the layouts surpassed the layout estimation accuracy of the single panorama deep learning models (HorizonNet and LGTNet) and the state-of-the-art self-training layout estimation models with multi-view panoramas by a large margin."

Through weighted majority voting, the ensemble model achieved superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to individual models, enhancing the reliability of geospatial mapping under variable urban and weather conditions. To estimate photovoltaic yield, we integrated spatiotemporal solar irradiance data with surface meteorological measurements, including ambient temperature, wind speed, and humidity, yielding an annual RPV potential of 602.83 GWh for Karachi, with a potential reduction of 0.37 megatons of CO2 equivalent.

Sentinel–2 monthly time series composites were generated using Google Earth Engine and evaluated through proximity analysis to assess pixel distribution within the target month and correlations with consecutive months. The performance of deep learning models trained on these composites was further assessed by comparing their segmentation results.

 To better monitor global water resources, and understand how they will vary in the future, it is critical to track the extent and intensity of irrigated agriculture. Within the past decade, there has been increased interest in the satellite-based detection of anomalous soil moisture (SM) and/or evapotranspiration (ET) signals associated with irrigation. However, little comparative information is available concerning the relative merits of available ET versus SM satellite products for this purpose. Such uncertainty has hampered the development of optimal monitoring strategies that appropriately integrate information acquired across a range of remote sensing resources. Here, using relatively more mature irrigation products derived from a combination of ground data and visible/near-infrared remote sensing as a reference, we compare the skill of microwave (MW) SM and thermal-infrared (TIR) ET satellite products for mapping coarse-scale (36-km) spatial variations in the proportion of land irrigated across the conterminous United States. Results suggest that, while spatial mapping skill exists in both products, the irrigation signal in satellite-based ET products is stronger, and easier to interpret, than the analogous signal in SM products. Since MW-based SM and TIR-based ET products appear to possess approximately equal spatial precision (i.e., spatial correlations with respect to true SM and ET, respectively), this difference is attributed to the stronger impact of irrigation on spatial ET patterns versus surface SM.Plain Language Summary: To better monitor global water resources, and understand how they will vary in the future, it is important to track the extent and intensity of irrigated agriculture. To do this, different satellite-based methods have been proposed to track irrigation from space. Unfortunately, there has been little comparison of these methods, and it is unclear which ones work best. Here, we compare methods for monitoring irrigation based on two different remote sensing techniques: thermal infrared and passive microwave. While information derived from both types of remote sensing is useful for irrigation monitoring, results show that thermal-infrared remote sensing contains more information. This insight will help improve future efforts to globally monitor irrigation using satellite-based sensors."

When compared with statistical data in HLJ, the maps exhibit a highly linear correlation and achieve an R2 value of 0.996, corresponding to a paddy rice area of just 1.1 % less than the reported average. The results reveal that the optimal time-series feature combinations for paddy rice mapping are strongly affected by spatial, temporal, and weather-related variations.

To mitigate the weather-related constraints of optical data, the study is further to investigate the integration of the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) into the enhanced models. Experimental results demonstrate that the ratio-based method effectively refines vegetation transmissivity estimations, thereby enhancing SM retrieval accuracy: For L-MEB model, R increased from 0.63 to 0.72 and RMSE decreased from 0.119 m3/m3 to 0.061 m3/m3; for SCA-H and SCA-V, R increased from 0.48 and 0.54 to 0.71 and 0.63, and RMSE decreased from 0.150 m3/m3 and 0.102 m3/m3 to 0.053 m3/m3 and 0.067 m3/m3, respectively. This study presents a novel approach for SM retrieval. This work underscores the potential of the ratio-based method to improve SM assessments across diverse environmental and climatic conditions."

 Accurate identification of winter wheat from remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-scale agricultural monitoring. Despite the success of Transformer-based deep learning models in various fields, their application in crop identification has been limited by the scarcity of extensive labeled training data. This study proposes a dual-branch spatio-temporal Transformer (DST-Transformer) for winter wheat extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery using a small training dataset. By independently extracting temporal and spatial features, the DST-Transformer effectively delineates crop boundaries and reduces misclassification. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness with small training datasets, achieving over 90% overall accuracy (OA) and 88.25% mean intersection over union (MIoU) when evaluating on test datasets. The DST-Transformer was further applied to large-scale winter wheat extraction across Shandong Province, China (an area 66 times larger than the training region) to evaluate its cross-regional transferability. Evaluation results showed OA over 92% and MIoU exceeding 85% at all validation sites, highlighting the DST-Transformer’s robustness and strong generalization capability. This study underscores the DST-Transformer’s potential for large-scale crop identification and illustrates the promise of Transformer-based architectures for efficient, high-precision crop mapping with small training datasets, advancing the application of deep learning in agricultural remote sensing."

 Over the past 40 years, plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) has become a widely distributed and seasonally dynamic land use/land management type, driven by its significant contributions to improving crop yield and quality. However, expansion of PMF has far-reaching impacts on the climate, the environment, and rural livelihoods. In particular, the exposure duration of plastic mulching (EDPM) over the course of a year is a critical factor influencing climate change and the energy balance, underscoring the need for a novel approach to accurately characterize EDPM. However, accurately characterizing EDPM remains challenging and has yet to be implemented in practice. Therefore, this study proposes a spectral index-based approach to characterize EDPM at the object scale using Sentinel-2 imagery in the Hetao Irrigation District, China. First, an object-oriented machine learning approach was implemented to map the spatial distribution of PMF. This was achieved by optimizing both the scale parameter of image segmentation and input feature sets (including spectral, textural, geometric, and index features) extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, through iterative masking and stepwise optimization. Then, the time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), PMLI (Plastic-Mulched Landcover Index), and BSI (Bare Soil Index), along with their first and second derivatives, were analyzed to determine key timings, including the start day of plastic mulching, crop growing, and crop canopy closure. Finally, the EDPM, including Full exposure duration of plastic-mulching (FEDPM) and half exposure duration of plastic-mulching (HEDPM), was characterized based on these key timings. The result indicated that the object-oriented machine learning approach is highly effective in enhancing PMF detection and suppressing background information. The overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient were 91.5 % and 0.90. In addition, plastic-mulching primarily occurs in late April in the eastern part of the Hetao Irrigation District, and in late May in the western region. The crop growing takes place in early to late June, while the crop canopy closure mainly occurs in early August. Consequently, the EDPM lasts approximately 3 to 4 months, while the FEDPM and HEDPM last about 1 to 2 months. This research provides a valuable reference for characterizing EDPM at regional or global scales and can be used to assess the regional climate effects of PMF."

 Forest canopy height is a key indicator for estimating forest carbon sinks and managing vegetation growth. Existing methods for fusing optical and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data still have limitations in canopy height estimation for boreal forests. In this study, we develop a forest canopy height estimation model (VGG-AdaBins) that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract deep features from multi-source remote sensing data. By introducing an adaptive tree height distribution estimation module, the model enables the coupling of multi-source remote sensing data for forest canopy height estimation. A joint validation dataset is constructed, including Sentinel-1/2, PALSAR images, airborne LVIS LiDAR, and spaceborne ICESat-2 photon-counting LiDAR data. This dataset is used to train the canopy height model. Finally, the performance of the canopy height prediction model is evaluated using 100 independent airborne datasets. The model’s prediction of tree height shows an MAE of 1.42 m and a RMSE of 2.25 m. The predicted 30 m canopy height map exhibits good consistency with the existing airborne data and demonstrated higher accuracy compared with current forest canopy height maps, with an accuracy improvement of at least 20%. The high prediction accuracy demonstrates that VGG-AdaBins, by integrating multi-source remote sensing data, can map continuous canopy height at the regional scale. This approach contributes to the advancement of large-scale canopy height mapping and forest carbon stock assessment in boreal forests."

 Mapping surface water at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for managing water resources and mitigating disasters. Current global surface water datasets are typically generated at a relatively coarse monthly temporal resolution and 30-meter spatial resolution. Moreover, the mixed pixel problem further limits their ability to precisely map small water bodies. This study produced the global Dynamic Surface Water Fraction (DSWF) mapping by combining Sentinel-2 imagery and Dynamic World dataset using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Different from the analysis-ready wall-to-wall global datasets, DSWF is generated on-demand online in response to user-defined areas of interest and time. DSWF explored sub-pixel surface water fraction information at 10-meter spatial resolution, enabling the precise representation of fine-scale spatial features of surface water and minimizing the blurring artifacts commonly associated with conventional hard classification. The accuracy of DSWF was evaluated across 113 validation tiles, demonstrating an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.090 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.021 when validated against both pure and mixed pixels.

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a crucial parameter reflecting vegetation’s photosynthetic activity. Many LCC inversion algorithms based on satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data have been developed in recent decades. The one-dimensional radiative transfer model, like PROSAIL (1D model), has been a classic tool for LCC inversion. In recent years, three-dimensional radiative transfer models (3D model) have been developed rapidly. However, studies on 3D models for LCC inversion are limited, and their impact on inversion accuracy across different sensor resolutions remains unclear. This study focuses on winter wheat and integrates the DART, Adel-Wheat, and PROSPECT models to construct the 3D-model-derived look-up table (LUT). The 3D-model-based LUT and 1D-model-based LUT were applied to Sentinel-2 (S2) and UAV data to retrieve LCC. Validation results demonstrate that the 3D-model-based algorithm significantly improves LCC inversion accuracy for both S2 and UAV images. For UAV data, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreases from 9.90 μg/cm2 to 7.97 μg/cm2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) improves from 0.70 to 0.79. For S2 data, the RMSE decreases from 12.40 μg/cm2 to 8.68 μg/cm2, while R2 increases from 0.66 to 0.85. Additionally, overestimation at low LAI levels and underestimation at high LCC levels are effectively reduced. The high accuracy achieved under varying LAI and LCC conditions allows the 3D model to capture temporal trends throughout the growing season better. The 3D-model-based LCC inversion algorithm can better utilize the high spatial resolution advantages, thereby playing a significant role in vegetation physiological monitoring and crop phenotyping."

 For the challenges with nearshore small ship detection in remote sensing images (RSIs) under complex background, a lightweight network called “multi-path attention and shifted large kernel network for ship detection” (briefly called “MSS-Net”) in RSIs is proposed. Firstly, shifted large kernel with feature enhancement module (SLKE) is developed to enlarge receptive field by decomposing large kernels and shift operation while performing dynamic channel attention.

 Geohazards are sudden and catastrophic. Due to the complicated topography, geology and climate conditions along the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Transportation Corridor (QTPTC), many geohazards pose unprecedented challenges for engineering construction. Comprehensive and scientific geohazard detection has been infrequently performed in the QTPTC, so the study area still lacks a comprehensive geological hazard inventory. With the development of earth observation techniques, detecting geohazards in wide areas is possible. However, comprehensive geohazard detection over such a large spatial extent is considered impossible by individual remote sensing techniques and images. In this study, we used a combination of GACOS-assisted Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) phases, SAR amplitudes, and optical images to acquire deformational and geomorphological information of geohazards along the QTPTC. Based on deformational and geomorphological information, we establish a catalogue containing 2109 geohazards which were classified into five categories, i) actively deforming slopes (994); ii) reactivated historically deformed slopes (84); iii) stabilized historically deformed slopes (732); iv) glacier (283) and v) glacial lakes (16). A large percentage of geohazards are distributed at an elevation of 2500–5000 m with slope angles of 30-40°, five geohazards concentration regions are distributed on main active fault zones, and the types of geohazards in the five regions are influenced by precipitation and surface temperature. Finally, three field surveys were also carried out to verify 141 geohazards along the QTPTC.

 Grasslands play a crucial role in carbon cycling, biodiversity conservation, and human welfare. Identifying the drivers of grassland greening is essential for forecasting ecosystem responses to future climate change and developing effective adaptation strategies. Grasslands worldwide have experienced pronounced greening trends over recent decades. Despite this widespread phenomenon, the underlying biophysical mechanisms and dominant drivers remain insufficiently understood. By integrating satellite observations with model simulations, we show consistent increases in global grassland leaf area index (LAI) across both historical periods and future scenarios. A sustained increase in summer LAI is identified as the primary driver of grassland greening, contributing approximately 43.28% to the overall trend. Grassland greening exhibits strong spatial heterogeneity, with humid regions accounting for the largest contribution (i.e., 67.27%). Correlation analysis, structural equation modeling, and ridge regression reveal distinct regional differences in the dominant drivers across aridity gradients. Soil moisture (SM) emerges as the primary driver in arid regions, while temperature plays a more prominent role in semi-arid areas. In sub-humid and humid regions, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exerts a stronger influence on grassland LAI dynamics. Moreover, the synergistic effect of temperature and VPD enhances summer greening, particularly in humid regions and high-latitude areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Notably, the influence of VPD transitions from inhibitory in arid regions to facilitative in humid environments. In contrast, the role of SM in shaping vegetation dynamics weakens progressively along the aridity gradient. These findings advance our understanding of how grassland ecosystems respond to varying hydroclimatic conditions and offer key insights for forecasting vegetation dynamics under future climate change."

Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and monthly in-situ Chla measurement data from Erhai located in Southwest China spanning 2018 to 2020, this study tested the effectiveness of the DMP framework. The results demonstrated that: (1) The DMP framework dynamically selected the optimal model based on data-specific characteristics.

 Monitoring surface deformation is critical for understanding and mitigating natural and anthropogenic hazards, such as landslides and subsidence. Although Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) provides detailed displacement measurements, its application in continuous monitoring remains constrained by high computational demands and complex data processing, often interrupting observation continuity. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning-based method that processes wrapped Differential InSAR (D-InSAR) interferograms to directly detect surface deformation patterns.

The method achieved an average mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.9% in Central Taiwan. Temporal transferability was validated by detecting deformation one year beyond the original MT-InSAR observation period. Spatial transferability was confirmed by applying the model to Northern Taiwan, where an F1 score of 78.74% was achieved while effectively identifying both uplift and subsidence. By enabling deformation detection across different magnitudes, time periods, and regions, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable solution for extending MT-InSAR-based surface hazard tracking."

 Earth observation satellites play a crucial role in disaster response and management, offering timely and large-scale data for damage assessment. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques for automated building damage detection from satellite imagery, often based on the xBD dataset. This high-quality dataset features bi-temporal very-high-resolution image pairs of several disaster events. Notably, several studies have proposed new network architectures and demonstrated their improved performance on xBD. Although such highly engineered model-centric approaches achieve promising results on the original dataset split of xBD, we show that they underperform on a new event-based split, which evaluates them on unseen events. To reduce this generalization gap, we propose to follow a data-centric approach. For this, we first derive a simplified baseline method from the winning solution of the xView2 competition, with greatly reduced complexity. With a simple adjustment to this baseline method, we incorporate readily available disaster-type information, allowing it to account for disaster-specific damage characteristics. We evaluate the resulting disaster-adaptive model on the event-based split of xBD and demonstrate its improved ability to generalize to unseen events compared to several competing methods.

We used all sensors individually, as well as different combinations of data (Sentinel-1/2, EnMAP/Sentinel-1/2), and compared predictions to predictions based on LiDAR data – a well-proven standard in mapping species richness. Our results showed that a combination of EnMAP/Sentinel-1/2 performed as well or even better than airborne LiDAR data for predicting species richness, but predictive accuracies of individual spaceborne models were substantially lower. This suggests that optical, radar and hyperspectral data carry complementary information and combining this information unleashes the full potential of spaceborne data for species richness mapping. However, validating models by habitat type revealed higher errors within habitat types (i.e., forest or open habitat), especially for immobile species (fungi and plants) that likely vary at smaller spatial scales than the resolution of the spaceborne systems used in this study. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of spaceborne remote sensing for large-scale biodiversity assessments, offering valuable insights into spatial biodiversity patterns and their changes over time."

 Change detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery has consistently been a focus and challenge within the remote sensing community. We present a novel unsupervised method named Progressive Self-Optimization Network. In this method, a new sample strategy is developed based on the initial change detection across three feature domains: spectral, deep, and class signal, to capture the “weak-to-strong” change signals and collect training samples with high accuracy. A new lightweight convolutional neural network is designed by partially replacing traditional convolutional layers with weight-shared partial convolution. To detect changes, a progressive self-optimization pattern is proposed based on the “weak-to-strong” change signals. This pattern detects changes gradually from regions with weak and strong change signals to regions with moderate change signals in a progressive manner. During this progressive process, detection results from each progression are integrated with “weak-to-strong” change signals to reselect training samples for the transfer training in the following progression, thus attempting to optimize the lightweight network. The final change map is generated by fusing all progression results. Five open VHR datasets and fourteen state-of-the-art unsupervised methods validate the proposed method."

 Assessing sea surface nitrate (SSN) concentrations and dynamics is crucial for understanding marine ecosystem health, yet optical remote sensing of SSN remains challenging because of the lack of distinct spectral features. While various global-scale SSN regression and machine learning algorithms based on SSN-environment variable relationships have been developed, the prediction accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of their applications continue to face limitations. Additionally, there has been relatively little reporting on the interannual variability of global SSN in previous studies. Here we aim to enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of SSN retrievals by developing improved regression and machine learning models, enabling the generation of global daily ∼ 8 km SSN products from satellite and model data. To construct the empirical regression models, the global ocean was divided into five regions on the basis of the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and SSN: 80° S to 40° N, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, the Arabian Sea, and the eastern equatorial Pacific. After adding SSN-related physical variables, high-accuracy regional empirical models are developed, with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.641, 2.701, 1.221, 1.298, and 2.379 μmol/kg for the studied regions. For the machine learning models, seven algorithms, namely, extremely randomized trees (ET), multilayer perceptron (MLP), stacking random forest (SRF), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, were tested. After modeling, validation, and extensive tests using independent cruise dataset, the XGBoost model outperformed others (RMSD = 1.189 μmol/kg) and bypassed the need for regional segmentation. Mechanistic analysis revealed the driving variables influencing SSN in both regional empirical and XGBoost models, improving interpretability. Comparative validation confirmed that our models surpass traditional approaches in accuracy and applicability, demonstrating their potential to advance global SSN monitoring. Using XGBoost-derived products, we find a slight weak decreasing trend in SSN over 23 years. The proposed robust and explainable SSN retrieval models have the potential to assist in ocean environmental management."

 Secondary mangrove forests are ecosystems that regenerate in areas where original mangrove stands have been degraded or removed as a result of natural disturbances or anthropogenic activities. Compared to mature mangrove forests, secondary stands exhibit enhanced carbon accumulation, increased sediment trapping efficiency, and intensified nitrogen fixation, contributing significantly to coastal eutrophication mitigation. Accurately mapping secondary mangroves and determining their age is essential for sustainable ecosystem management and assessing their services. However, reliably determining mangrove forest age using remote sensing has been hindered by the complex dynamics of intertidal environments. To overcome these challenges, we developed a robust and efficient approach for estimating the age of secondary mangrove forests (ASMF) by integrating Landsat time-series data and the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We implemented this method in the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve (DNNR), which is the first mangrove nature reserve established in China, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.723. Key findings include: (1) the ASMF estimates exhibited high accuracy (R2 = 0.723), with optimal performance for forests aged 9–10 years; (2) secondary mangrove forests comprised 47 % (823.87 ha) of the total mangrove area within the DNNR; and (3) younger stands (1–9 years) represented 32 % of all secondary mangrove forests. This approach offers an effective solution for regional-scale mangrove age estimation and provides a critical basis for evaluating the carbon sequestration potential of secondary mangroves in the DNNR."

 Cropland non-agriculturalization (CNA) monitoring is a typical change detection (CD) problem based on remote sensing imagery, aimed at tracking cropland outflow changes, which holds significant importance for cropland protection and food security. Recently, numerous advanced CD methods have been proposed to address the CNA problem. However, applying these methods to cross-regional or large-scale CNA detection presents several challenges: (1) Radiance-feature differences of croplands across regions i.e., crop type and phenology differences arising from variations in planting structures and seasonality; (2) Change-pattern differences of croplands across regions, i.e., differences in predominant change types resulting from distinct regional economic development characteristics. These cross-regional differences, when coupled together, result in insufficient adaptability of CD methods across regions. To address these issues, a Cross-Region Cropland Change Detection (CR-CLCD) framework with Multi-View Domain Adaptation (MVDA) is proposed. Specifically, Pattern Distribution Contrastive (PDC) sub-module achieves feature alignment from the semantic view by imposing contrastive constraints across inter-domain categories. Radiative Discrepancy Adversarial (RDA) sub-module, performs inter-domain global and local feature confusion by identifying regions of local uncertainty and applying enhanced adversarial training. MVDA is a flexible, plug-and-play domain adaptation module that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing change detection backbone network (e.g., CNN, Transformer), enabling rapid generalization to new data under unsupervised conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CR-CLCD method achieves the best or second-best accuracy compared to other domain adaptation methods across different baselines."

 Ground-measured fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data are critical for validating satellite-derived FVC products. However, spatial scale mismatches between ground plots and satellite pixels, compounded by the scarcity of field data in remote regions, introduce significant uncertainties in product validation. This study proposes a novel multi-tiered representativeness framework integrating three key indices: the absolute difference of spatial upscaling transformations, the heterogeneity of the surrounding environment, and FVC temporal stability. The framework’s implementation leveraged an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observation network (870 monitoring plots, 2015–2024) within the alpine grassland ecosystem of the Three-River Source Region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, classified into four levels, with levels 1–2 indicating high level and 3–4 lower. Our results reveal that both the environmental heterogeneity of monitoring plots and scale mismatches substantially impact the validation accuracy of FVC products. By applying the proposed framework, validation using high-level monitoring plots reduced uncertainty by approximately 40 % compared to using all monitoring plots (GEOV3: R2 = 0.964, RMSE = 0.075 vs. R2 = 0.830, RMSE = 0.138; GLASS: R2 = 0.957, RMSE = 0.068 vs. R2 = 0.812, RMSE = 0.121), highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating spatial representativeness errors. Furthermore, the validation results for two global FVC products (GEOV3 and GLASS) highlight systematic biases in their performance within alpine ecosystems. These findings advance validation methodologies for remote sensing products in heterogeneous landscapes and provide actionable insights for improving algorithm parameterization. The framework’s modular design enables adaptation to other critical validation scenarios requiring spatial representativeness quantification."

 Urban trees play a crucial role in delivering ecosystem services, yet their structural complexity poses significant challenges for remote sensing. Although recent large-scale, open-access canopy height models (CHMs) offer potential alternatives to airborne LiDAR, their suitability for urban environments remains uncertain. This study systematically evaluated four prominent CHMs (Potapov, Lang, Tolan, and Malambo) using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data from Washington, D.C., with complementary analyses from four additional cities. We assessed their performance in both canopy classification and height prediction using classification and regression metrics, spatial autocorrelation, consistency tests, and explainable machine learning. Results revealed consistent limitations across products, including widespread misclassification of canopy, systematic tree height prediction biases — characterized by overestimation of low and underestimation of high canopies (the OLUH effect) — and pronounced spatial clustering of errors along urban–forest edges. Among the models, only the Lang CHM passed the Bland–Altman consistency test, showing marginal statistical agreement with reference data. Tree characteristic variables, especially canopy height itself, emerged as dominant drivers of height errors, while topography and built-up context also contributed. Consistent patterns observed across four additional cities indicated that these limitations are systemic rather than location-specific. We conclude that high-precision airborne LiDAR remains essential for urban forestry and recommend enhancing canopy height mapping techniques to better capture the structure of urban trees. A promising direction is the development of urban-specific CHMs with finer spatial and temporal resolution, improved temporal consistency, and integration with high-resolution imagery, contextual deep learning models, and local calibration strategies."

 Accurate and timely building damage assessment (BDA) is critical for effective disaster response and recovery. However, existing machine learning approaches in this context do mostly not account for uncertainties, which are essential for ensuring trustworthy and transparent results. This study introduces a hybrid Bayesian deep learning framework with integrated uncertainty quantification to enhance BDA, thereby making model predictions more reliable and interpretable. We propose BayeSiamMTL, a novel Bayesian Siamese multitask learning architecture that combines deterministic segmentation of building footprints with probabilistic change detection for damage level classification. By encoding model parameters as probability distributions and utilizing variational inference with Monte Carlo approximation, BayeSiamMTL produces pixelwise posterior predictive distributions, providing detailed insights into both damage predictions and their associated uncertainties. Our analysis explores key aspects of Bayesian modeling and, to our knowledge, is the first to provide quantified insights into the model’s classification dynamics, revealing internal decision-making tendencies and sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce confidence-informed damage maps in the form of stratified probabilities of damage clusters and minimum/maximum damage extents delineated from confidence intervals. Model performance is evaluated across multiple datasets to assess the impact of domain shifts and out-of-distribution samples. Experimental results show that BayeSiamMTL not only achieves a performance advantage over its deterministic counterpart but also exhibits significantly better generalization capabilities under domain shifts with a relative performance improvement of 42 %. While background pixels represent the primary source of confusion across all damage levels, our findings indicate that building destructions are more frequently confused with intact buildings rather than among varying degrees of damage."

 The phase coherence of radar signals makes synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis prone to significant challenges. Echo signal interference introduces speckle noise during imaging; noise appears as random fluctuations in pixel intensities. Besides, coherence exacerbates geometric distortions, complicating the accurate interpretation of spatial distributions within intricate geographic entities, thereby making it difficult to extract meaningful target information from SAR images. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces the DEcomposed-frequency PrOjection Network (Depo-Net), a segmentation-oriented model that mitigates SAR-specific interference through frequency-domain self-attention. It employs a dual-encoder structure for efficient semantic extraction and integrates Spatio-Frequency Synergistic Modulation (SFSM) to minimize speckle noise while maintaining structural integrity in the frequency domain. Additionally, the Harmonized Subspace Spectro-Temporal Attention (HSSTA) synthesizes Discrete Fourier and Wavelet Transform analyses to capture complex spatial correlations among geographic features. To mitigate noise amplification during decoding, the Pluri-frequency Mamba (purfMamba) module synergizes multi-dimensional spectral-spatial features, facilitating noise suppression during high-resolution restoration and maintaining a balance between global structure and local details.

 Variations in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) significantly influence flooding patterns, particularly through alterations in forest and cropland. However, existing flood prediction studies rarely utilize LULC maps as direct training inputs, typically generating probabilistic rather than spatially explicit flood distribution maps. This study addresses this gap by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with multi-source remote sensing data to predict flood distribution from LULC maps. We focus specifically on “Returning Cropland to Forest” initiative of China using 2020 remote sensing data from the Poyang Lake region. Flood impact ranges were extracted through Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data fusion, producing 3,972 LULC-flood map pairs for model training and validation. The multi-source fusion approach achieved substantial improvements in flood extraction accuracy. User accuracy increased from 60% (SAR-only) to 90% (SAR-optical fusion), while overall classification accuracy reached 89.76% with an F1 score of 94.58%. Model performance validation through Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores demonstrated high-quality flood map generation, with FID decreasing from 81.5 to 53 at epoch 45. Analysis revealed that reforestation ratios exceeding 50% significantly reduce flood occurrence. Optimal effectiveness was observed when forests are strategically positioned along rivers and lake edges rather than randomly distributed. These findings provide actionable guidance for planners to prioritize riparian zones for initial reforestation, then systematically achieve 50% reforestation ratios in flood-prone watersheds, integrating these targets within existing regulatory frameworks. This research contributes a robust framework for integrating LULC data into predictive flood models, advancing sustainable flood management and enhancing water resource security strategies."

 Under cloudy and rainy conditions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can provide essential data support for large-scale and high-timeliness flood monitoring. Although an optimal combination for Sentinel-1 VV-VH polarization data has been selected for flood mapping, its performance on complex terrains is not satisfactory, and it is unknown whether it can be further extended to generalize co- and cross-polarization data (not only VV-VH but also HH-HV). Therefore, we propose a shadow-robust unsupervised flood mapping method, called Topography and Dual-polarization Flood Mapping (TODFLOM). This method initially utilizes topography features to identify safe areas where floods are unlikely to occur in complex scenarios. Then, a Generalized Dual-Polarization Flood Index (GDPFI), based on the microwave scattering characteristics of complex inundation scenarios, is constructed to highlight flood features. Finally, GDPFI coupled with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used for generating the flood map, enabling the method to effectively suppress mountain shadows in areas with slopes below 30°. The integration of topography features and GDPFI-GMM empowers TODFLOM to remove shadows impact with a 5° safety threshold. Experiments reveal that TODFLOM achieves an F1 score greater than 0.88 across all four flood datasets, outperforming other advanced methods in large-scale complex inundation scenarios."

 Frequent abnormal bareness events on Earth’s surfaces (ABEES) seriously threaten ecosystem stability and the safety of people’s lives and property, and it is urgent to carry out fine detection and timely warning. However, existing remote sensing indices for ABEES detection are only applicable to one or two types of ABEES and easily confuse different background information with ABEES, which makes it difficult to achieve fine detection of multiple types of ABEES in complex and unknown scenes. Therefore, this study proposed an index for the fine detection of multitype ABEES (ABEESI). Specifically, this study first conducted a comparative analysis of the shape and position differences in spectral curves between various ABEES and different ground objects. Then, representative bands that effectively capture these differences were selected to construct ABEESI. To evaluate the performance of the proposed index, six common types of ABEES and a large unknown scenario (Mongolia) were selected for testing. The validation results indicated that ABEESI achieves an F1-score exceeding 0.84 for detecting multiple types of ABEES, which is significantly better than traditional remote sensing indices, especially in cases of landslides, debris flows, and sand boils. Meanwhile, ABEESI still maintains good performance in a large unknown scenario, with a detection accuracy F1-score still exceeding 0.81. Overall, ABEESI is less affected by different background environments, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional remote sensing indices that easily confuse ABEES with bright barren lands, artificial surfaces and other background environments. Moreover, ABEESI can effectively reflect different ABEES states, which makes it possible to provide an early warning in the early stages of ABEES and terminate warnings when the anomaly areas begin to recover."

An adaptive Euclidean distance method is employed to generate continuous uncertainty regions for the selected indoor trajectory based on extracted spatiotemporal features. By integrating GCN with LSTM, UMTrajNet effectively captures the complex spatial–temporal dependencies within the trajectory data thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional solely LSTM-based models in spatial context correlation modeling.

Previously, exposure to high ambient temperatures was linked with increased odds of TLBW, while results looking at fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure have been mixed. A growing body of studies report associations between PTB and air pollution. We evaluated the relationship between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and TLBW and PTB, and potential modification by concurrent exposure to extreme heat events (EHEs).MethodsWe used North Carolina birth registry data linked to exposure data using geocoded addresses obtained from the birth records (2006–2015) for live, singleton births (n = 1,280,064). TLBW was defined as births delivered at ≥37 weeks gestation and weighing <2,500g. PTB was defined as births delivered at <37 weeks gestation. PM2.5 concentrations were obtained using EPA's fused CMAQ model and were averaged over trimester and entire pregnancy. EHEs were defined as a census-tract specific daily maximum heat index >95th percentile for at least two consecutive days. The 95th percentile threshold for the EHE indicator variable were based on a 40-yr (1981–2020) historical distribution and specific to each census tract. For inclusion in a trimester analysis for summer months, portions of that trimester had to occur between May–September. We estimated risk differences with interaction terms for total number of EHEs during the corresponding exposure period.ResultsWe observed generally null relationships between PM2.5 and TLBW and PTB for all trimesters. Results remained null when extreme heat events were included as an interaction term and no interaction on the multiplicative scale was observed.ConclusionsAnalyses did not indicate substantial relationships between PM2.5 and TLBW or PTB, or effect measure modification by EHEs in this study."

 Roadside environments are critical interfaces where transportation systems intersect with urban ecosystems, often acting as hotspots for the accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). In arid and semi-arid regions with aged vehicle fleets and fuel quality concerns, the persistence and dispersion of PTEs pose heightened environmental and public health risks. This study aimed to investigate the spatial patterns, potential sources, and environmental drivers of PTE concentrations (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr) in roadside soils west of Isfahan City, Iran. Surface (0–2 cm) and background (30 cm) soils were collected from 209 stations, and analyzed using standard protocols with detection limits ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 ppm. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified two dominant components: PC1 (Zn, Cu, Cr) related to mechanical abrasion, and PC2 (Pb, Cd, Ni) linked to combustion sources. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and sensitivity analysis revealed that PC1 was primarily predicted by road slope and curvature, while PC2 was best explained by traffic volume and diesel vehicle proportion (R2 = 0.561 and 0.686, respectively). The results highlight the dual role of structural and operational road factors in shaping PTE distribution in dryland cities, with implications for land-use planning and pollution mitigation in rapidly urbanizing regions."

 This study investigates the inter-annual variability of carbonaceous aerosols (CA) over Kolkata, a megacity in eastern India, using dual carbon isotopes (14C and 13C) alongside measurements of the optical properties of brown carbon (BrC). Sampling was conducted during the post-monsoon, winter, and spring seasons over two consecutive years (2020–21 and 2021–22). The analysis reveals that PM2.5 and CA concentrations were higher in 2020–21 (194 ± 40 and 54 ± 15 μg m−3, respectively) compared to 2021–22 (141 ± 31 and 44 ± 21 μg m−3), likely due to higher precipitation in 2021–22. The contribution of biomass burning and biogenic sources to CA (fbio_TC) was slightly higher in 2020–21 (70 ± 3 %) than in 2021–22 (68 ± 3 %), with both years exhibiting a consistent decreasing trend from post-monsoon to spring. Observed lower values for oxidised CA proxies, such as the WSOC/OC ratio (0.41 ± 0.08) and AMS-derived f44 (0.13 ± 0.02), throughout the study period suggest that surface CA over Kolkata primarily originates from local sources rather than long-range transport. The relative radiative forcing (RRF) also showed a clear reduction in the subsequent year; however, on average, the RRF of methanol-soluble BrC (16 ± 6 %) was approximately three times higher than that of the water-soluble fraction (5.5 ± 2.2 %), highlighting the substantial role of BrC in influencing regional radiative forcing. These findings underscore the substantial impact of local emissions over transported pollutants on Kolkata's ground-level air quality."

 Despite considerable progress in air quality improvement, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution remains prevalent during the autumn and winter seasons in eastern Asian megacities: Beijing and Seoul. Here, we conducted synchronous field observations of PM2.5 chemical composition in Beijing and Seoul as part of the FRIEND Project, spanning the period from November 10th to December 10th, 2022 and we aimed to understand sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) formation mechanism. The observations revealed that SNA, especially nitrate, were the primary contributor to particle matter pollution, accounting for 66 % and 76 % of PM2.5 in Beijing and Seoul, respectively, during pollution period (PM2.5>60 μg/m3). This indicated secondary inorganic aerosol formation was a key driver to force the urban fine particulate matter pollution in eastern Asian megacities. We found that the enhanced aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) during pollution episode facilitated SNA formation, then, contributing to the PM2.5 pollution. Such phenomenon was found in both cities. Aerosol acidity in Seoul was higher than that of in Beijing, leading to the different sulfate formation pathways. During observed pollution episode, liquid-phase sulfate was primarily formed through oxidation by transition metal ions (TMI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Beijing, while in Seoul, sulfate was mainly formed through TMI-catalyzed oxidation. Nitrate primarily existed in the particulate phase during pollution period with ambient relative humidity larger than 60 % in Beijing. In contrast, around 20 % of nitrate was still in the gas phase in Seoul due to low aerosol pH. The sensitivity analysis of particulate matter to precursors in both cities highlighted the needs for differentiated management strategies to reduce NOx and NH3 emissions under varying ALWC and pH conditions."

 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) exists across a broad particle size range plays a crucial role in regional air pollution and climate, yet its formation mechanisms under varying meteorological conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, size-segregated aerosol samples (0.056–18 μm) were collected in Jiaxing, a coastal city in eastern China. Samples were categorized into land breeze (LP), sea breeze (SP), and dust event periods (DP). Oxygenated organic aerosols (OOAs) were identified as the dominant component of organic matters across all periods (65.9–81.6 %). Radiocarbon (14C) analysis revealed that fossil-derived OOA exhibited a dominant contribution to total OOC (78.1 %). High correlations of OOA and O3 in both fine and coarse modes indicated the important role of gas-phase oxidation across all particle sizes, while a specific association between fine-mode SOA and Fe ions suggested an additional aqueous-phase contribution in the fine mode. During the LP, the relative short transport distance of land air masses resulted in lower oxidation states for both fine and coarse particles, leading to the lowest O/C values. In contrast, during the SP, increased aerosol liquid water enhanced SOA formation, elevating O/C in coarse particles. During the DP, extensive multi-generational oxidation occurred during long-range transport, yielding higher fine-mode O/C. The coarse-mode OOA was positively correlated with Cl− and Ca2+, implying heterogeneous formation related to soil dusts. This study highlights the complexity of SOA formation pathways through multiple air mass types and different particle sizes, underscoring the necessity to incorporate various formation pathways into atmospheric models for accurate simulations and policy guidance."

 BackgroundParticulate matter (PM10/2.5) is a ubiquitous air pollutant with detrimental health impacts where fine particles (PM2.5) are posing serious threats to respiratory health. With potentially worse outcomes, it is silently damaging the lungs of people already suffering from respiratory diseases like asthma. The continuous exposures to poor air quality in recent years raises urgent questions for both, immediate and long-term health impacts. Both PM10/2.5 levels have surpassed the Indian National safety standards raising serious concerns about the environmental and health consequences.MethodologyThis study aimed to investigate impact of PM10/2.5 exposures on mice lungs where pathological changes in OVA-induced asthmatic mice lungs were compared with normal mice lungs. BALB/c mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA, i.p), followed by OVA aerosol (1 %OVA) challenge, and later subjected to PM10/2.5 exposures (0.5 mg/kg, i.n) continuously for five consecutive days. Lung samples were assessed for oxidative stress markers (ROS and lipid peroxidation), inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, histamine, myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, IL-6), fibrotic markers (collagen deposition, MMP-9 activity, α-SMA expression), and histopathological changes. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity, oxidative stress induced DNA damage in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) after PM10/2.5 exposures were thoroughly investigated. Curcumin derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa) is known anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule, was studied for its therapeutic efficacy on PM-induced asthma aggravations and fibrotic changes.Key findingsSignificant lung damage was noted after short-term PM10/2.5 exposures (5 days) with aggravated inflammatory and fibrotic changes in both, normal and asthmatic mice lungs, where PM2.5 exposure was severe. Significant morphological and histopathological changes like lung tissue remodeling, epithelial thickening, and collagen deposition was observed. Enhanced immune cell recruitment, ROS and MDA levels along with significantly decreased key antioxidant enzymes, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase, compared to the control group were noted with reduced GSH level. Upregulated expression of NF-kB, a transcription factor after PM10/2.5 exposure was found in normal mice which was heightened in asthmatic mice. Enhanced MMP-9 activity was also confirmed by immunofluorescent detection of Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Curcumin, a plant-derived molecule, significantly mitigated PM2.5 exposed airway inflammation and fibrotic changes in lungs by suppressing NF-κB expression and enhancing Nrf2 level. In vitro studies validated these findings, where dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and increased in ROS level along with apoptotic changes A549 cells were observed after PM exposure. Enhanced IL-6 and PARP-1 expression confirmed progressive PM2.5 exposure induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells which was reduced after curcumin treatment.SignificanceThese findings draw the attention towards detrimental impacts of poor air quality of Varanasi city with genotoxic effects which have not been reported before. Therapeutic potential of Curcumin as a natural protective agent against PM-induced respiratory damage revealed antioxidant-based interventions. It may be alarming for residents living in such polluted environments, particularly susceptible asthmatic population where silent pathological changes are in progress, thus, more detailed investigations are required along with improved air quality management policies in polluted urban areas in near future."

 This study investigates the physicochemical properties and potential health impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in three canteens (C1, C2, and C3) within an academic cum residential campus. This study comprehensively evaluated PM2.5 levels, chemical composition, and associated health risks. PM2.5 concentrations were significantly elevated in the facilities, exceeding outdoor levels by 200–400 %. Aerosol mass and number size distributions exhibited lognormal patterns, with modes in the fine particle range (<2.5 μm). Mean organic carbon (OC) concentrations were 45.44 (±14.29) μg/m3, 23.96 (±5.58) μg/m3,and 23.58(±3.98) μg/m3 in the C1,C2, and C3 respectively.

Secondary organic carbon (SOC) was found to be less prevalent than primary organic carbon (POC) in all the canteens. Overall, PM2.5 compositions were dominated by organics (>40 %) followed by elements and ions, though relative proportions varied significantly. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) constituted over 60 % of OC in the canteens and 50 % in the outdoor location. Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) analysis showed 8–9 times higher N/C ratios in the canteens compared to outdoor environments. Organic aerosol evolution also showed stark differences between canteens and outdoor environments. Elemental analysis revealed significant concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic elements in canteens. The total respiratory deposited dose (TRDD) was found to be approximately 3 times higher in C1, 2 times higher in C2, and 1.5 times higher in C3 compared to the outdoor location.

Daily average predictions for grass, alder and birch pollen were available for 2017–2023 from the COSMO-ART dispersion model, the operational forecast model at the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. In this study, we have compared estimated concentrations for overlapping pollen types and years at three levels: (1) pollen measurement stations, (2) a 1 × 1 km national grid, and (3) residential addresses of the Swiss National Cohort.At the grid and cohort address levels, statistical and dispersion models showed a strong correlation for grass (0.75) and birch (0.70) pollen and a moderate correlation for alder pollen (0.41). Cross-validated Pearson's correlations between statistically modelled and measured pollen concentrations ranged from 0.80 (alder), 0.85 (birch) to 0.86 (grass), with root-mean-squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) values of 0.33, 0.31 and 0.35, respectively.

 Carbonyl compounds play a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, leading to the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. Emissions of carbonyl compounds from construction machinery cannot be ignored. In this study, a total of 37 units of in-use construction machinery were tested using portable emission measurement system under real-world operating conditions. Carbonyl compounds were collected using the O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine derivatization method and analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The composite carbonyl compound emission factors of excavators, forklifts, loaders, road rollers, pile engines and graders were 3.30 ± 1.45 g/kg-fuel, 2.05 ± 0.97 g/kg-fuel, 3.20 ± 1.18 g/kg-fuel, 2.69 ± 1.02 g/kg-fuel, 5.55 ± 2.26 g/kg-fuel and 2.94 ± 1.31 g/kg-fuel, respectively. Pile engines exhibited the highest emission factors during working, whereas the others had the highest emission factors while idling. In addition, the continuous tightening of emission standards has effectively reduced the emissions of carbonyl compounds from construction machinery. The total emissions of carbonyl compounds from five typical construction machinery in China in 2019 were estimated to be 12.1 kt, with corresponding ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) of 82.5 kt and 360.1 t, respectively. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were the primary contributors to the total emissions and OFP, while benzaldehyde was the largest contributor to the SOAFP. The contributions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to total emissions of carbonyl compounds and their corresponding OFP and SOA were much higher than those of other provinces.

The results showed that winter PM2.5 OP was more twice than summer, and nighttime OP was higher than daytime both in summer and winter. In summer, the mass-normalized DTT consumption rate (DTTm) exhibited two peaks at 4:00–8:00 and 12:00–16:00. In winter, high DTTm appeared during the nighttime periods (20:00–4:00).

 Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), such as poultry farms, contribute significantly to air pollution, particularly ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Vegetative environmental buffers (VEBs) offer a sustainable, cost-effective, and low-maintenance solution for mitigating NH3 and PM emissions from CAFOs, and some previous studies showed that pollutant concentrations behind the VEBs were substantially reduced compared with concentration directly from the source. However, due to the lack of a controlled dataset for non-VEB situations, the net effect of VEBs could hardly be assessed. Thus, the dataset from the previous study was used to develop a methodology for quantitatively evaluating the efficacy of VEBs in reducing NH3 and PM emissions from a poultry house, and to distinguish the net pollutant reduction achieved by VEBs from those resulting merely from atmospheric dilution and dispersion. The results showed that VEB can effectively mitigate air pollutants emissions and attributes enhanced ground-level reductions of NH3 (72.7 % ± 9.1 %), total suspended particle (TSP) (61.9 % ± 10.0 %), PM10 (62.5 % ± 9.9 %) and PM2.5 (94.6 % ± 6.5 %). In addition, VEB demonstrated better mitigation performance during daytime. Meteorological conditions showed no correlation with pollutant concentrations or enhanced reduction ratios while significant positive correlations between reductions of NH3 and PM were also observed. These results demonstrated that VEBs are effective in reducing NH3 and PM emissions from poultry houses. The results from this study will inform conservation practice guidelines and assist land managers in employing VEBs for poultry house emitted air pollution reductions."

 The Alsace region in northeastern France frequently experiences autumnal and winter radiation fog, which significantly affects air quality through the accumulation and transformation of atmospheric pollutants. Despite numerous studies on either fog chemistry or particulate matter (PM) in Strasbourg, no prior research has simultaneously examined the interactions between fog and PM in this region. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of fog and PM samples collected in Strasbourg and the nearby suburb of Geispolsheim in fall 2016, focusing on carbonaceous components (organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC)) and their stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13CTC). Fog water was analyzed for pH, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), δ13CTC, and major ions, while PM2.5 and PM10 samples were analyzed for OC, EC, total carbon (TC), and δ13CTC. Results reveal significant changes in fog chemistry since the 1990s, including elevated pH and reduced sulfate and nitrate concentrations. Moderate scavenging of OC and negligible EC scavenging occurred in Strasbourg, while Geispolsheim exhibited higher EC scavenging, potentially due to aerosol aging during regional transport. Fog and rain events were found to selectively remove isotopically enriched carbon, resulting in δ13CTC depletion of interstitial PM. This depletion may reflect size-dependent scavenging or removal of carbonate-enriched coarse particles. Comparisons with datasets from California and the Po Valley suggest that differences in fuel usage—particularly diesel prevalence in France—affect δ13CTC signatures. This study offers new insights into fog–aerosol interactions in urban environments and represents the first isotopic characterization of PM and fog in Strasbourg. Future work should focus on particle size distribution, carbonate content, and source apportionment to refine understanding of scavenging processes and carbon isotope fractionation in fog-influenced air masses."

 Ketones, which are generated during the oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels and oxygenated derivatives, are promising candidates as biofuel materials and reactive intermediates. In this study, the temperature-dependent rate coefficients for the reactions of the simplest Criegee intermediate (CH2OO) with acetone (CH3COCH3, Ac) and methyl ethyl ketone (CH3COC2H5, MEK) were quantified through flash photolysis coupled with OH laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Experimental measurements were conducted over a temperature range of 283–318 K and a pressure range of 5–200 Torr revealed distinct kinetic behaviors. The CH2OO + Ac system exhibited pressure-independent kinetics and a negative temperature dependence. The high-pressure limit rate coefficient of (4.50 ± 0.63) × 1013 cm3 s−1 at 298 K and an activation energy of (−2.31 ± 0.20) kcal mol−1 (50 Torr/Ar). In contrast, the CH2OO + MEK reaction exhibited pressure-independent behavior between 5 and 100 Torr/Ar, with measured rate coefficients approaching the high-pressure limit of (6.05 ± 0.9) × 1013 cm3 s−1 at 298 K, in excellent agreement with previous experimental data. The kinetics of this reaction were temperature-dependent, with Arrhenius analysis, revealing an activation energy of (4.59 ± 0.36) kcal mol−1. The obtained data fall between the theoretical predictions derived from direct and indirect reaction mechanisms, suggesting that competing pathways govern the temperature-dependent reactivity of Criegee intermediates with carbonyl-containing ketones."

 To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first broad-scale, nation-wide analysis of a set of long-term morbidity effects of air pollution and assessment of their economic impacts in France.We used the Health Risk Assessment method and the latest concentration-response functions, both from the World Health Organization (WHO). The economic analysis - a comprehensive cost of illness approach - includes direct health and non-health care costs, indirect and intangible costs.Beyond its impact on mortality, the study shows that lowering PM2.5 levels over time in France would produce substantial health and well-being benefits by reducing the onset of several diseases.Documented here as attributable to long-term exposure to anthropogenic PM2.5 on average in a given year are 20 % of new cases of respiratory diseases in children and 7–11 % of new cases of respiratory, cardiovascular or metabolic diseases in adults. We also show that reducing PM2.5 concentrations to WHO's air-quality guideline (AQG) levels would reduce morbidity attributable to this anthropogenic pollution by up to 75 %. Finally, if average PM2.5 levels were reduced to their anthropogenic thresholds, annual benefits to health and well-being for the diseases studied would total €201812.88 billion.Given these findings, complying with WHO AQG would reduce mortality and morbidity attributable to air pollution in France and help achieve the objective of WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, namely a one-third reduction in the risk of dying from a chronic disease by 2030."

 The higher particulate matter (PM) level in Delhi presents a significant health hazard, emphasizing the need for innovative metrics that precisely capture its potential health impacts. This study investigates oxidative potential (OP) as a health-relevant metric. OP showed a significant variability across particle sizes (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) and their sources. Notably, OPv (volume normalized) surpassed OPm (mass normalized), suggesting a strong correlation of OP with aerosol composition and their sources (R2 > 0.6–0.76). The hazard index (HI) was notably higher for fine particles (PM1, PM2.5: 3.48 ± 2.09–9.28 ± 5.58) compared to PM10 (2.27 ± 1.01–5.05 ± 2.24). Chemical analysis of non-refractory PM1 revealed organic aerosols as the predominant constituents, followed by nitrate (NO3−) and sulfate (SO42−), while chloride (Cl−) being the least abundant. The elevated NO3− levels were attributed to the oxidation of SO42− in ammonium-rich environments, supported by sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR). Primary organic carbon (POC) significantly exceeded (2–4 times) secondary organic carbon (SOC) and charred elemental carbon (Char-EC) being more abundant in PM2.5 than soot-derived elemental carbon (Soot-EC), insightful for combustion processes. A comparison of OP with the Air Quality Index (AQI) and HI revealed that days categorized as having satisfactory air quality exhibited unexpectedly high both OP, comparable to days classified as very poor/severe AQI. This suggests that OP is an independent parameter influenced by various factors, including exposure level, chemical composition, inhalation rates, and aerosol characteristics. The OPv demonstrated significant correlations with measured parameters (R2: 0.54–0.86), particularly with primary aerosols (R2: 0.68–0.76), while showing weaker correlations with secondary aerosols (R2: 0.32–0.52). In contrast, OPm exhibited negative correlations (R2: −0.11 to −0.50), likely due to chemical species which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results providing critical insights into PM characteristics that could enhance existing air quality management strategies in Delhi."

 Toluene and α-pinene are typical anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds, respectively, which can contribute to urban fine particles through photochemical processes. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the formation and composition of SOA and possible interactions in mixed toluene-α-pinene systems. A high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used to determine the composition of SOA in the toluene-α-pinene mixed system. The results showed that the α-pinene-O3 channel was dominant in forming SOA from mixed system. Since α-pinene has a higher rate constant with OH radical than toluene, the consumption of toluene was reduced by 35 % due to competition from α-pinene. New products were found in mixed system based on SOA mass spectra, and the signal fraction of C15 ∼ 20 oligomers (3.7 ± 0.6 %) was higher than that of individual toluene system (0.7 ± 0.1 %) and individual α-pinene system (1.6 ± 0.2 %); The range of H/C and O/C ratios of SOA molecules from mixed system was similar to the individual α-pinene system, further show that the mixed SOA mainly from O3 channel oxidation of α-pinene.

 Ice core records from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provide regional indicators of climatic and environmental changes and permit reconstruction of variations in human-made atmospheric pollutants during past hundreds of years. To comprehensively understand the TP's climate and environment history, we addressed the past climate and environmental changes reconstructed by ice core evidences, focusing on the variations of anthropogenic pollutants (e.g., mercury, black carbon). Since the 1980s, more than 40 ice cores across the TP have been drilled and some of them are investigated. Key benchmarker layers within the TP ice cores, such as peak values of ß-activity and tritium in 1963 AD, provide effective means for precise dating. The TP ice core reconstructions revealed the recent warming from the 1900s with different warming rate on the southern or northern TP, which were also affected by the large-scale atmospheric circulations. Emissions of human-related pollutants have seriously affected and altered Earth's environment and shown an increasing trend in the TP ice cores, especially since the 1950s. These existed variability of the reconstructions among ice cores in different TP regions was mainly controlled by interactions between the South Asian monsoon and westerly intensity. We also discussed the uncertainties of TP ice core dating currently, highlighting the recent rapid climate warming is threatening ice core archives. In the future, new techniques for dating and chemical analysis should be explored and more ice core archives should be obtained for the next generation."

 The Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) plays crucial role in regulating the land-atmosphere interactions and the accurate estimation of its height (BLH) plays vital role in different meteorological applications. This study evaluates the performance and reliability of ERA-5 reanalysis dataset in estimating the BLH against the radiosonde derived BLH across 24 different stations in India during the period 2006 to 2020. The BLH from radiosondes was derived using multiple methods, with the Potential Temperature Gradient method (PT) showing the best agreement with ERA-5 estimates. Results indicate that ERA-5 generally underestimates the BLH, with a bias ranging between ∼0.2 to 0.5 km and regional correlation values from ∼0.32 to 0.81. Our analysis also revealed pronounced seasonal biases across different regions with largest discrepancies occurring during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM), followed by the Southwest Monsoon (SWM), summer (SUM), and winter. The influence and the relative contribution of the surface drivers on the BLH across different regions are investigated. Our analysis revealed that the thermal and moisture related factors have greater influence on the BLH over dry arid regions like NW and wet regions (NE) respectively. Seasonal and regional analysis reveals deeper ABL's during the pre-monsoon season with values ranging from ∼1.2 to ∼3.2 km and shallower ABL's registered during the winter season with values ranges from ∼0.5 to ∼1.4 km. Additionally, Central India (CI) and Northwest India (South India (SI) and Northeast India (NEI)) recorded deeper (shallower) ABL's during the study period. Trend results suggest that, the SI and NWI show positive increasing trend with values ranging between 0.12 and 3 m/year during the study period, whilst the CI and NI show negative decreasing trend of approximately −0.13-1.2 m/year.

 Using observational and reanalysis data, this study investigates the severe winter drought event in Eastern China during 2024/25, which is the most extreme in at least four decades. The event featured a record-low Eastern China winter precipitation (ECWP) of 36.24 mm, with over 80 % precipitation deficits in multiple Eastern China regions and numerous stations recording their lowest/second/third-lowest winter precipitation, 39 consecutive days of nearly no measurable precipitation. Statistical analysis and dynamic diagnostics reveal that the ECWP is synergistically influenced by the Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and Tibetan Plateau (TP) thermal conditions. The Equatorial-North Pacific (ENP) and Indian Ocean SSTs modulate the ECWP by affecting circulation to regulate moisture transport from the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal to Eastern China, respectively. The TP thermal effect exerts its effects through cold (warm) temperatures inducing an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) near the TP, which enhance (suppress) moisture transport to Eastern China and thereby increase (reduce) the ECWP. During the winter of 2024/25, both the Indo-Pacific SST and TP thermal conditions were unfavorable for the ECWP.

 Understanding the evolution of temperature extremes under global warming is crucial for effective regional climate adaptation. In South Korea—a region undergoing rapid urbanization and facing rising heat-related risks—there is a growing need to better understand these changes, particularly in relation to global climate drivers. To meet this need, this study employs a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model that incorporates global mean surface temperature (GMST) as a covariate. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 60 nationwide weather stations were analyzed, focusing on summer and winter extremes over durations ranging from 1 to 15 days during the period 1974–2023.The results reveal distinct regional and seasonal patterns of non-stationarity. Winter extremes have become milder, with broader temperature distributions and fewer cold events, indicating a weakening of cold spells. However, in terms of adverse societal and environmental impacts, summer extremes are more vulnerable. Tropical night events exhibit the greatest sensitivity to global warming, particularly along the west and south coasts, where their frequency and persistence have increased sharply. Heatwaves have also intensified, though less dramatically. These changes appear linked to large-scale climate dynamics, including intensification of the North Pacific Subtropical High and warming of surrounding seas, which enhance atmospheric moisture transport toward the Korean Peninsula. By integrating observational data with a dynamic statistical framework, this study provides new insights into the changing nature of temperature extremes and their drivers—offering a valuable basis for targeted adaptation strategies in South Korea."

 A robust and trustworthy rainfall projection over the Indian landmass is vital for devising climate adaptation strategies. However, past studies show large inter-model spread in Indian Summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall projections thus calling for more detailed investigations on the underlying process. In the present study, we investigate this aspect using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model projections (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSP5–8.5) and historical simulations. The Multi-Model Ensemble mean (MME) results show intensification of ISM rainfall at the end of the 21st century with ISM rainfall increasing by 1.6 ± 0.8 mm/day under SSP5–8.5 scenario. A moisture budget analysis for the MME further infers that the thermodynamic effect (TH) due to global warming plays a dominant role in enhancing ISM rainfall in the projections, with its dynamic counterpart (DY) assuming an additional contribution. It is also revealed that both DY and TH terms contribute to the inter-model uncertainty in ISM rainfall, but with DY dominating over the other this time. The inter-model uncertainty in DY and ISM rainfall changes is linked to inter-model spread in interhemispheric thermal contrast which in-turn depends on the diversity in Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Global Mean Temperature (GMT) among the models. Intriguingly, when we remove the inter-model diversity in ECS through a GMT scaling, an Atlantic meridional surface temperature gradient, involving both land and ocean, emerges as a crucial driver in controlling the uncertainty in both DY and ISM rainfall changes, and drives large-scale monsoon circulation changes over African and the Indian subcontinents."

By the end of the century (2081–2100), precipitation declines under SSP1–2.6 but resurges under SSPP5–8.5, with maximum moistening concentrated in central NWC. Regarding the precipitation recycling rate (ρ), the overall rate in NWC is projected to fluctuate within ±5 % under the SSP1–2.6. In contrast, it is expected to exhibit a fluctuating downward trend under the SSP5–8.5, decreasing by 1.04 % per decade and reaching nearly 5.1 % lower than the baseline period by the end of the 21st century. This indicates progressive weakening of internal cycling under high emissions. Spatially, the distribution of ρ is highly uneven. The internal cycle is expected to increase significantly in the central region of NWC due to the abnormal enhancement of evaporation, while it will gradually weaken over time in other regions. Future precipitation increases primarily derive from the combined effects of internal and external cycling, but is primarily driven by changes in external cycling precipitation (Po) through enhanced moisture transport. Moreover, under the high emission scenario, the contribution from external cycling demonstrates progressive increase, while internal cycling exhibits gradually weaken. This suggests that as climate warming accelerates in NWC, the rapid ablation of glaciers and snowmelt may lead to a transition from strengthening to weakening of the internal cycle because of the increasing ineffective evaporation. Even if the absolute precipitation increases in the future, the additional moisture may be offset by ineffective evaporation, making it difficult to convert into usable water resources. This poses a severe challenge for future water resource management in NWC."

 Based on the Climate Research Unit (CRU) monthly rainfall data and the NationalCenters for Environment Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis atmospheric circulation data during 1961–2020, we examine the interdecadal change in the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and summer rainfall in northern Central Asia (CA). Results show that the NAO negatively (positively) correlates with summer rainfall in northern CA during 1969–1989 (1990–2010), but it becomes obviously closer in the second period, indicating their relationship has experienced a significant interdecadal change over the past 60 years. The varying relationship between the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA is caused by the interdecadal change in the NAO-related large-scale circulation anomalies. The positive NAOI is well related to the strengthening subtropical westerly jet over CA, an anomalous cyclone over west of CA and southerly wind prevailing over northern CA and convergences of water vapor occupying the whole northern CA, so the relationship between the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA has become stronger during 1990–2010. Furthermore analysis suggests that the intensity of subtropical westerly jet over CA plays an important role in linking the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA. In the first period, the atmospheric teleconnection pattern triggered by the NAO only has weak effects on the subtropical westerly jet over CA, but in the second period it can strongly modulate the change in the intensity of subtropical westerly jet over CA."

 Heat waves (HWs) are complex, multivariate, extreme weather events that cause significant harm to human health, ecosystems, and economies. Correct detection and attribution of HWs to anthropogenic climate change is important to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to improve predictions. In this work, we address this issue and propose a multivariate version of a hybrid approach to reconstruct heat waves, consisting of the AM and deep Autoencoders (MvEA-AM algorithm), improving existing less effective methods used until now, such as the multivariate Analogue Method (MvAM). The proposed hybrid approach produces a more reliable representation of the event than the classical MvAM for reconstructing and attributing HWs in Europe. The explainable and interpretable analysis of the obtained results is based on leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to explain deep learning algorithms, a capability that is not achievable with the MvAM. This explainability analysis shows that our model learns useful features during the training of the algorithm, which are aligned with the Physics of the problem, and employs the correct features during reconstruction and attribution analysis of the HWs considered."

 The Leh-Ladakh region is a high-altitude cold desert (3255 m above mean sea level), located under the rain shadow of the Himalayas, display various cloud features crucial to understand the extreme weather conditions. Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) parameter helped to show that almost 37 % of rain falls over Leh-Ladakh region (7–38°N, 62–100°E) during last 23 years of monsoon season. Low rainfall though facing extreme rainfall events, need a continuous monitoring of cloud measurements.

Our comparative findings suggested that Ceilometer's CBH measurements aligned with calculated MODIS CBH, whereas ERA5 CBH gets underestimate. Further, Ceilometer measurements of multi-layer clouds, consist of three distinct layers. These day-to-day seasonal variations in clouds show highest occurrence frequencies during the pre-monsoon (67.94 %) and monsoon (98 %), clearly reflects the onset and active phases of the Indian summer monsoon.

 This study employs the WRF-based RMAPS-ST numerical weather prediction model to conduct 1-km resolution simulations of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games on February 2022. An inter-comparison of the SH, the SMS and the IUM scale-aware PBL schemes is conducted. The performance of YSU as a traditional PBL scheme is also evaluated as a baseline. The investigation focuses on their ability to forecast over three distinct competition areas, Beijing (BJ), Yanqing (YQ), and Zhangjiakou (ZJK), each characterized by different terrain. The results reveal that the IUM and SMS schemes generally outperform the YSU and the SH schemes, particularly in the BJ area, where IUM exhibits the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) for 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed. In YQ, with its complex topography, there are no significant discrepancies among the schemes, while SMS improves wind speed forecasts in ZJK. An abrupt nocturnal warming and a gusty wind case are chosen to further demonstrate the performance in all schemes. Results show that IUM scheme can reproduce these two cases, attributed to its stronger turbulence mixing length.

 As a strong upper-tropospheric easterly jet stream over the Afro-Australian monsoon region, the tropical easterly jet (TEJ) originates from the meridional thermal contrast between the Asian landmass, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in particular, and the tropical Indian Ocean in boreal summer. Here, we find that the atmospheric heat source anomaly over the southeastern TP can induce an opposite response of the upper-tropospheric zonal wind over the western Pacific, where the TEJ usually inflows and manifests as the double easterly jets. Positive TP heating anomaly could accelerate the northern branch of double easterly jets and decelerate the southern one, and vice versa. Two pathways linking the TP heating and the TEJ are proposed. First, positive heat forcing over the southeastern TP can directly induce the easterly responses over the South Asia by the thermal wind which is mainly determined by the changed meridional temperature gradient. The associated easterly response significantly accelerates the northern part of the TEJ. The other pathway suggests that the TP heating will indirectly modulate the southern branch of double easterly jets by changing the thermal condition over the western North Pacific (WNP). The negative WNP heat anomaly exerts a pair of upper-level cyclones straddling the equator with anomalous westerly in between, primarily decelerating the south branch of the double easterly jets over the Maritime Continent. Our findings suggest the TP heating anomaly significantly influences the upper-tropospheric TEJ, especially the double jets in its inflow region, advancing understanding of the TEJ variability and the Asian summer monsoon dynamics."

 Data merging is widely applied to improve large-scale precipitation estimates. However, traditional merging algorithms rely heavily on gauge observations and suffer from increased uncertainties in data-sparse regions. Statistical uncertainty analysis (SUA) offers a potential solution by estimating merging weights analytically and thereby reducing dependence on gauge data. However, the comparative effectiveness of SUA-merged and traditional gauge-merged precipitation datasets remains unclear, largely due to the scarcity of truly independent validation data. Here, using 268 wholly independent rain gauges, we show that SUA-based merging can effectively suppress random errors and outperform remote sensing and reanalysis products. Notably, compared to traditional gauge-merged datasets, SUA-merged precipitation demonstrates averagely stronger correlation with independent observations and lower root-mean-square errors. These results provide direct evidence for the ability of SUA to mitigate reliance on gauge data, especially in observation-scarce regions. However, SUA-merged products still show limitations with regards to accurately classifying rain/no-rain events, highlighting the need for future enhancements targeting false precipitation detection."

 Pre-existing tropical disturbances often serve as a precursor to tropical cyclone (TC) formation. However, a very small percentage of these disturbances turn up as TCs, depending on the environmental conditions. Disturbances that remain non-developed throughout their lifespan have very similar characteristics to the disturbances that develop as a TC. Therefore, it is important to comprehend the environmental factors responsible for transforming tropical disturbances into tropical cyclones. In this study, we analyzed the environmental conditions surrounding the disturbance vortex, as well as the structural evolution of the vortices during the pre-genesis stage, for two non-developing and two developing disturbances (which later evolved into different categories) over the Bay of Bengal. The analysis was conducted using output data from the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model, blackbody temperature observations from INSAT-3D, and daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature analysis data. All the disturbances processed over the Indian Ocean warm pool region where the sea surface temperature (SST) was above the threshold of TC genesis. However, the SST anomaly was negative ahead of the non-developing disturbance and positive for the developing disturbances. The main characteristics of the developing disturbances that differed from the non-developing disturbance are the upright structure of the vortex with undistorted vortex core from the dry air intrusion, larger area coverage of cold cloud top with persistent cyclonically spiral cloud bands centred at the vortex core, and the extension of the strong ascending region over time. The intensity of low-level vorticity was unable to identify the developing potential of the disturbances. The synchronous incremental variation of the kinetic energy density of primary and secondary circulations and the vertical helicity in the developing disturbances was helpful for their sustainability."

 Regional convection-permitting meteorological reanalyses substantially improve the atmospheric representation compared to convection-parameterized counterparts. This holds particularly for multi-scale driven variables such as precipitation in terms of spatial structures, intensity and frequency rates, or the timing and peak of its summer diurnal cycle. However, the simulation of convective-related phenomena is highly model-dependent, implying the inability to sample the full range of natural variability with single-model experiments. This challenge is exacerbated for km-scale simulations owing to the intrinsic chaotic nature underlying convection. Multi-model ensembles of high-resolution climate models demonstrate to reduce the simulation errors associated with individual model outputs over Europe. When applied to retrospective estimates, such ensemble approach could then offer a comprehensive, homogeneous, and optimized assessment of past atmospheric states.This study presents the first multi-model ensemble of regional reanalyses over Italy considering four recently produced datasets to assess the added value of their joint use. These products are derived by dynamically downscaling the global reanalysis ERA5 with different numerical models: MERIDA_HRES, MOLOCH, SPHERA and VHR-REA_IT. The reference dataset for comparison is the pluviometer-based hourly analysis GRIPHO. The investigation over 2007–2016 includes the annual and seasonal variations in daily and hourly mean rainfall intensity and frequency, heavy precipitation occurrences, and their summer diurnal cycles. No single dataset systematically outperforms the others, and substantial inter-model variability is detected for summer precipitation. The ensemble improves rainfall statistical estimates compared to individual reanalyses by providing more realistic spatial patterns, enhanced skill, and reduced biases relative to observations. These findings have potential implications for downstream reanalysis applications."

 By pinpointing the temporal and spatial key zone where hail precipitation instantaneously responds to cloud condensation nuclei concentration (CCNC) explosions, this study offers significant advancements in understanding CCNC-cloud-hail interactions and the potential for artificial hail suppression. An idealized hailstorm was simulated using high-resolving (500 m) across a comprehensive ensemble comprising 151 runs. This simulation incorporated five distinct time points from convective initiation to hail formation. It encompassed six vertical zones of initial CCNC. Five categories of CCNC explosions between 700 cm−3 and 70,000 cm−3 were considered. The results indicate that the value of the minimum hail precipitation rate is from below 10 % to 45 % of control member with convection development. At the initial time point, hail precipitation rate exhibits a non-monotonic response to CCN concentration, first decreases and then increases. Raindrops' formation (10 and 15 min) shifts the inflexion point. Hail formation (20 min) causes the response to first increase and then decrease. The small cloud droplets from CCNC explosions impede raindrop formation (suppressing hail precipitation, dominant at low CCNC) and promote raindrop growth (enhancing hail precipitation, dominant at high CCNC). As convection develops, the key zone for the response of hail precipitation to CCNC explosions rises from the atmospheric boundary layer region to the 0 °C layer. This increase is due to changes in the critical region of microphysical processes at different time points. The CCNC explosion in the key zone causes smaller cloud droplets, rise rapidly to exceed the critical region, and inhibit its collection by hail particles."

 Reanalysis datasets are essential substitutes for direct observations and play a critical role in weather and climate research. However, the resolution of existing reanalysis over China is too coarse to capture mesoscale atmospheric phenomena and climatic extreme events. To address this limitation, a convection-permitting (CP; resolution ≤4 km) regional reanalysis product over China is necessary. To verify the feasibility of constructing a CP regional reanalysis, this study conducts a CP regional reanalysis experiment over China with the spectral nudging technique (SN). The results reveal that the application of SN can enhance the capability in the reproduction of spatiotemporal precipitation characteristics, regional precipitation features, and Meiyu period precipitation dynamics compared to classical dynamical downscaling. Diagnostic analysis reveals that SN aligns geopotential height at 500 hPa with ERA5 (daily spatial correlations >0.96) and weakens excessive vertically integrated moisture flux convergence in classical dynamical downscaling by >0.2 g/(m2 s), explaining the statistical gains. Furthermore, the CP regional reanalysis outperforms the global reanalysis ERA5 in reproducing regional precipitation and extreme precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. It also excels in representing the characteristics of mesoscale convective system and their associated diurnal cycles during the Meiyu period. These findings highlight the potential of SN in constructing high-resolution reanalysis datasets and underscore its value for developing a long-term CP regional reanalysis product over China."

Here, for the first time, we estimate spatio-temporal tree cover loss patterns and the resultant carbon emissions in these forested peatlands using Global Forest Change data from 2001–2021. We find tree cover loss affected 1.4% of the peatlands over 20 years (0.07% yr−1), with 89% occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, 0.06% yr−1) and 11% in the Republic of the Congo (RoC, 0.008% yr−1). Though low, tree cover loss rates in the peatlands have increased 5x in the DRC and 2x in the RoC between the 2000’s and 2010’s, but are a fraction of the contemporary rate of peatland deforestation in Insular Southeast Asia and are 5x–7x lower than total tree cover loss rates in each country, respectively. The increase in the rate of tree cover loss and in the size of patches of tree cover loss over time and the occurrence of losses near access routes (settlements, roads and waterways) suggests increasing anthropogenic causes. Smaller loss patches are likely due to anthropogenic and natural causes. In the DRC, only 19% of patches were >0.1 km2 in the 2000’s; this rose to 81% in the 2010’s. We detected one anomalously large patch of deforestation (75 km2). A ground-truthed analysis of this patch shows that rice cultivation is driving deforestation on seasonally-flooded forest not underlain by peat and areas of peatland forest underlain by shallow peat. This is a previously unidentified threat to peatland degradation in the Cuvette Centrale. Deforested tropical peatlands can result in significant carbon emissions. We estimate that committed emissions are 108 (76.34–131.81) Tg CO2 from peat decomposition and aboveground biomass loss in the DRC between 2001–2021. Overall, tree cover loss, deforestation and carbon emissions are low compared to other regions with large areas of tropical peatlands, with 98.6% of the Cuvette Centrale peatlands being intact when considering tree cover loss. Ground-based studies including participation from residents of peatland-adjacent communities are acutely needed to validate our findings, improve peatland maps and prioritise local people in future management decisions, and prevent future greater losses."

Recent work has highlighted the importance of semi-arid ecosystems in interannually driving global concentrations of atmospheric CO2. We therefore need to better understand the dynamics and drivers of the CO2 fluxes and their modeling along semi-arid to humid gradients. Respiration is an even more uncertain flux compared to photosynthetic fluxes and its spatially variability is not well understood. Here we focus on terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) in Australia, and, specifically, on disentangling the impacts of temperature and soil water on TER. We use nighttime net ecosystem exchange data as a viable proxy for daily TER collected by 40 flux tower stations within the OzFlux network over the last 20 years in Australia. These stations cover a broad range of climatic conditions enabling us to analyze the dependence of TER on soil moisture under varying aridity and temperature conditions. We find that the sensitivity of TER to soil moisture is the strongest in semi-arid regions. In these moisture-limited locations, the TER sensitivity to soil moisture increases strongly with temperature. Soil respiration fluxes at humid stations are large but exhibit low sensitivity to high soil moisture levels indicating that TER at humid stations is not water-limited. Using the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ, we show that common model approaches assuming increasing TER with increasing soil moisture for all soil moisture levels perform poorly in reproducing the observed TER patterns in Australia due to interactions with carbon availability and representation of soil hydrology. Hence a more sophisticated description of the dependence of TER on soil moisture is necessary to capture TER dynamics under different climatic conditions accurately."

However, amid rapid digitalisation and decentralisation of energy systems, its limitations have become increasingly apparent, posing significant challenges for inclusive and equitable stakeholder engagement in the transition. Stakeholders including consumers, prosumers, energy communities, aggregators and electricity utilities, face unequal distribution of grid-related costs and benefits. There is thus a need to understand and address coupled grid-societal vulnerability (GSV). However, there is still no comprehensive study identifying factors influencing GSV and the corresponding challenges vis-à-vis stakeholders. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the disparities in access to hosting capacities for new renewable energy projects and grid congestion due to increased energy demand from households and businesses. We contribute to the literature by developing a comprehensive view of GSV through a systematic literature review of 185 peer-reviewed academic papers focusing on the European context. Three main factors influencing GSV are identified: grid constraints, cybersecurity risks, and regulatory barriers. A complex interrelationship exists between stakeholders in the electricity grid and, as a result, we find there are (in)direct implications of their grid challenges across stakeholders. Therefore, tackling GSV and inequalities in the energy transition requires an integrated solutions approach combining supportive policies, regulatory frameworks and market-based mechanisms with technological integration, innovations and consumer engagement."

Blichner;Daniel Yazgi;Moa K. Sporre,Seasonal differences in observed versus modelled new particle formation at two European boreal stations,"This study is an investigation of the model representation of how particles are formed and grow in the atmosphere. Using modelled and observed data from two boreal forest stations in 2018, we identify key factors for new particle formation to improve particle climate predictions in the global EC-Earth3 model. Comparisons with the detailed ADCHEM model show that adding ammonia improves particle growth predictions, though EC-Earth3 still greatly underestimates the number of particles during warmer months. 
 Realistic representation of atmospheric aerosol size distribution dynamics in large-scale climate models is important for developing accurate descriptions of aerosol–cloud interactions. Despite the dynamic nature of the distributions, which have large seasonal and diurnal changes, model evaluations often focus on the annual median size distribution. Using more comprehensive monthly and diurnal model illustrations can be crucial for evaluating model performance and potential aerosol effects for short-term variations. In this study, we assess the impact of a molecular model scheme for NH3–H2SO4 nucleation integrated in the Earth System Model (ESM) EC-Earth3, across different seasons, months, and days within the boreal climate during the year 2018. Measured number size distributions from two in situ boreal stations are used to evaluate and study particle formation and growth representation in EC-Earth3 over 2018. Additionally, we utilize results from the ADCHEM model, a state-of-the-art 1-D Lagrangian aerosol chemistry model. This allows us to compare EC-Earth3 against results from highly detailed model descriptions of aerosol formation and growth at the boreal stations. When comparing diurnal EC-Earth3 model results with in situ observations at an hourly temporal resolution, we establish that using solely organic–H2SO4 nucleation parameterization will underestimate the aerosol number concentrations. The newly added NH3–H2SO4 nucleation parameterization in this study improves the resulting aerosol number concentrations and the reproduction of particle formation events with EC-Earth3. However, from March to October, EC-Earth3 still underestimates particle formation and growth."

Their formation is related to multiple atmospheric physical and chemical processes. Accurate Es intensity prediction is significant for understanding atmospheric coupling. We proposed a novel stacking machine learning method incorporating physical observations to achieve higher-precision global Es intensity prediction than previous methods. Our results indicate the importance of considering related physical factors for Es prediction. 
 Sporadic E (Es) layers, the irregularities of enhanced electron density commonly occurring in the ionospheric E region, are affected by the interactions between distinct atmospheric layers. Es intensity (EsI) is a crucial parameter to describe Es layer characteristics, while there still lacks the method for high-precision EsI prediction due to its complex spatiotemporal variation and physical driving mechanisms. We propose a novel stacking machine learning (SML) method for global EsI prediction, which combines the advantages from different ML models to obtain better performance than using a single ML model. Various Es-related physical observations, including vertical ion convergence, gravity wave potential energy, and solar and geomagnetic indices, are incorporated as the inputs of SML together with the EsI derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) measurements. SML performs well in both long-term and short-term EsI prediction and characteristics reconstruction. SML-predicted EsI is in good agreement with GNSS RO-derived EsI, with the mean error (ME) of 0.032 TECU km−1 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.158 TECU km−1. Taking ionosonde observations as reference, SML has the RMSE of 1.064 MHz, which is reduced by 20.1 %–40.5 % compared to existing prediction methods. The higher accuracy of our method than methods not incorporating physical observations illustrates the significance of considering multiple related physical factors when constructing the Es prediction model. The proposed method can be expected to provide valuable information for not only ionospheric irregularities monitoring and space weather forecasting but also the mechanisms of Es layer formation and atmospheric coupling."

 Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS), a key component of brown carbon (BrC), significantly promote the light absorption of aerosols. However, their linkages to pollution sources and ambient temperature in cold environments remain unresolved. Here, we analyze wintertime urban aerosol samples in Changchun, northeast China, using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS). HULIS show a high light absorption efficiency (MAE365 = 1.81 ± 0.24 m2 g C−1) and high mass concentration (2.97 ± 1.54 µg C m−3), exceeding values reported from other global regions. Through UHPLC-HRMS/MS characterization, we identify 264 compounds at the molecular structure level, accounting for 38.2 %–78.1 % of the total HULIS mass. Compositional analysis demonstrates biomass burning and coal combustion are the main BrC sources during haze events. We screen out 39 strong BrC chromophores, mainly nitrophenols, that contribute 28.9 ± 10.4 % of the total light absorbance at 365 nm. Low ambient temperatures potentially enhance the accumulation of these strong BrC chromophores in the aerosol particles by suppressing photobleaching processes and altering thermodynamic reaction equilibria. These findings emphasize the potential of BrC to exert a more significant and persistent environmental effect in the cold-region atmosphere."

Raindrops are modeled as oblate spheroids, and backscattering properties are computed via the T-matrix method, including noise, turbulence, and spectral averaging effects. When comparing simulations with measurements, differences in the amplitudes of polarimetric variables are noted. This shows the challenge of using simplified shapes to model raindrop polarimetric variables when moving to millimeter wavelengths. 
 In this work, the T-matrix approach is exploited to produce simulations of spectral polarimetric variables (spectral differential reflectivity, sZDR, spectral differential scattering phase, sδHV, and spectral correlation coefficient, sρHV) for observations of rain acquired from slant-looking W-band cloud radar. The spectral polarimetric variables are simulated with two different methodologies, taking into account instrument noise and the stochastic movement of the raindrops, introduced by raindrop oscillations and by turbulence. The simulated results are then compared with rain Doppler spectra observations from W-band radar for moderate rain rate conditions. Two cases, differing in levels of turbulence, are considered. While the comparison of the simulations with the measurements presents a reasonable agreement for equi-volume diameters less than 2.25 mm, large discrepancies are found in the amplitude (but not the position) of the maxima and minima of sZDR and, more mildly, of sδHV. This pinpoints a general weakness in approximating raindrop as spheroids to simulate radar backscattering properties at the W-band."

Moreover, a semi-automated code was also developed, which can be used to create a burn severity atlas of any other region in the world. The maps of this atlas can be used not only in fields related to fire ecology and management but also within research areas related to air, water, and soil. 
 Long-term burn severity assessment can support better pre- and post-fire management plans. In this study, the Portuguese Burn Severity Atlas was created, containing historical fires in Portugal from 1984 to 2022. As prerequisites, fire data were gathered and delimited for all years. Due to the availability of satellite images, for different years, different imageries from Landsat sensors (30 m) were applied. Exploratory analysis showed that burn severity estimates are significantly affected by the time lag between the satellite imagery acquisition and the fire date. We explicitly incorporated the effect of time lag into the degradation of burn severity estimates in the selection of the most suitable pre- and post-fire satellite images for each fire. Using Google Earth Engine, burn severity estimates were calculated for fires that were equal to or larger than 100 ha and that occurred from 1984 to 2022 with known dates (valid fires). Different indices were calculated, such as the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), the relative dNBR (RdNBR), the relativized burn ratio (RBR), and a burn severity index that combines the dNBR with the enhanced vegetation index (dNBR-EVI). Overall, in Portugal, 4.85×106 ha burned over the 38-year period (1984–2022), with the burned area covering 3.29×106 ha being caused by valid fires (68 %). Among these, a total area of 3.18×106 ha had burn severity estimates via the applied indices (97 % of valid and 66 % of all fires). Results show that Portugal has experienced, on average, “high” burn severity throughout this period, with large percentages of dNBR pixels between 0.419 and 0.66 (32 %) and >0.66 (21 %). Estimates from different burn severity indices provided a more complete representation of the burn severity impacts. This atlas can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12773611 (Jahanianfard et al., 2025) and can be used by researchers to have a better understanding of historical fires and their corresponding impacts on vegetation cover, air, soil, and water quality, as well as to identify the most influential environmental and climatic drivers of burn severity."

 High-resolution climate datasets are of critical importance for the comprehension of spatial and temporal variations in climate and hydrology. However, their development is significantly influenced by the availability, density, and quality of observational data. Building on the China global land surface air temperature 2.0 (C-LSAT 2.0) station data, we collected and integrated nearly 3000 additional station observations and conducted quality control and homogenization processing to complete the updates to the C-LSAT 2.1 dataset. The coverage of the C-LSAT 2.1 dataset has been significantly enhanced, further improving the representativeness of global land diurnal temperature range (DTR) data with greater spatial heterogeneity. Compared to C-LSAT 2.0, C-LSAT 2.1 shows consistent overall trends, except for a slight post-2010 increase for the Southern Hemisphere LSAT anomaly. Furthermore, we employed a “thin-plate spline (climatology) and adjusted inverse distance weighted (anomaly fields)” technical framework to develop a high-resolution (0.5°×0.5°) LSAT (C-LSAT HRv1) and DTR (C-LDTR HRv1) dataset covering January 1901–December 2023.

The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility has been making atmospheric measurements since the early 1990s, including measurements of turbulent fluxes using two well-established methods: the energy balance Bowen ratio and eddy covariance. This paper documents key aspects of these datasets, including their history, changes through time, and best use practices. 
 Processes mediating the coupling of terrestrial, aquatic, biospheric, and atmospheric systems influence weather, climate, and ecosystem dynamics via transfer of energy, momentum, water, and carbon (or other species). These exchange processes are quantified by measurements of near-surface turbulent fluxes. Understanding processes at these interfaces provides insight toward understanding and predicting current and future states within the Earth system. The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility has been conducting measurements of near-surface turbulent fluxes since the early 1990s at long-term fixed locations and shorter-term mobile deployments across the Earth. ARM has utilized two established methods for conducting these measurements: energy balance Bowen ratio (EBBR) and eddy covariance (EC). Primary measurements from the former include sensible and latent heat flux, while the latter also measures fluxes of momentum and carbon (primarily carbon dioxide, with methane fluxes measured at two locations to date). The EBBR systems have been deployed at 22 locations, and, to date, the EC systems have been deployed at over 50 sites, with plans for additional novel site locations in the future.

This method can handle any mesh type and is ideal for processing output directly from unstructured-mesh models. Computation is split into preparation and solving phases, with GPU acceleration ensuring fast processing. 
 Scale analysis based on coarse graining has been proposed recently as an alternative to Fourier analysis. It is now broadly used to analyze energy spectra and energy transfers in eddy-resolving ocean simulations. However, for data from unstructured-mesh models it requires interpolation to a regular grid. We present a high-performance Python implementation of an alternative coarse-graining method which relies on implicit filters using discrete Laplacians. This method can work on arbitrary (structured or unstructured) meshes and is applicable to the direct output of unstructured-mesh ocean circulation atmosphere models. The computation is split into two phases: preparation and solving. The first one is specific only to the mesh. This allows for auxiliary arrays that are then computed to be reused, significantly reducing the computation time. The second part consists of sparse matrix algebra and solving the linear system. Our implementation is accelerated by GPUs to achieve excellent performance and scalability. This results in processing data based on meshes with more than 10 million surface vertices in a matter of seconds. As an illustration, the method is applied to compute spatial spectra of ocean currents from high-resolution FESOM2 simulations."

We present a high-resolution (~10 km) ocean model that simulates seasonal and year-to-year variability in ocean, including currents, oxygen levels, and phytoplankton growth. This model is a powerful tool to study how climate change and human activities influence the northern Indian Ocean, which can be used for marine resource applications and management. 
 We introduce and evaluate the regional ocean model MOM6-COBALT-IND12 version 1 coupling the MOM6 ocean dynamics model to the Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophics (COBALT) biogeochemical model at a horizontal resolution of 1/12°. The model covers the northern Indian Ocean (from 8.6° S to the northern continental boundaries), central to the livelihoods and economies of countries that comprise about one-third of the world’s population. We demonstrate that the model effectively captures the key physical and biogeochemical basin-scale features related to seasonal monsoon reversal, interannual Indian Ocean Dipole and multi-decadal variability, as well as intraseasonal and fine-scale variability (e.g., eddies and planetary waves), which are all essential for accurately simulating patterns of coastal upwelling, primary productivity, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels. Well represented features include the timing and amplitude of the monsoonal blooms triggered by summer coastal upwelling and winter mixing, the strong contrast between the high evaporation/high salinity Arabian Sea and high precipitation/high runoff/low salinity Bay of Bengal, the seasonality of the Great Whirl gyre and coastal Kelvin upwelling/downwelling waves, as well as the physical and biogeochemical patterns associated with intraseasonal and interannual variability. Quantitatively, the model exhibits relatively small biases, as reflected by root mean square error (RMSE) values in key variables: sea surface temperature (0.25–0.3 °C), mixed layer depth (7–8.09 m), sea level anomaly (0.02 m), sea surface salinity (0.53–0.71 psu), vertical chlorophyll (0.03–0.3 mg m−3), subsurface temperature (0.33 °C), and subsurface salinity (0.07 psu). A major model bias (16 µmol kg−1 of oxygen) is the larger oxygen minimum zone simulated in the Bay of Bengal, a common challenge of ocean and Earth system models in this region. This bias was partly mitigated by improving the representation of the export and burial of organic detritus to the deep ocean (e.g., sinking speed, riverine lithogenic material inputs that protect organic material and burial fraction), and water-column denitrification (e.g., nitrate-based respiration at higher oxygen levels) using observational constraints. These results indicate that the regional MOM6-COBALT-IND12 v1.0 model is well suited for physical and biogeochemical studies on timescales ranging from weeks to decades, in addition to supporting marine resource applications and management in the northern Indian Ocean."

 Our study evaluates the impacts of an alternate snow cover fraction (SCF) parameterization on snow simulation in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC). Three reanalysis-based meteorological datasets are used to drive the model to account for uncertainties in the forcing data. While the default parameterization assumes a simple linear relationship between SCF and snow depth with no dependence on topography, the alternate parameterization accounts for the topographic effects of sub-grid terrain on SCF. We show that the alternate parameterization improves SCF simulated in CLASSIC during winter and spring in mountainous areas for all three choices of meteorological datasets. Annual mean bias, unbiased root mean squared area, and correlation improve by 75 %, 32 %, and 7 % when evaluated with MODIS SCF observations over the Northern Hemisphere. We also demonstrate that the improvements to simulated SCF lead to further improvements in variables related to surface radiation, energy fluxes, and the water cycle. Finally, we link relative biases in the meteorological forcing data to differences in simulated snow water equivalent and SCF. Assessment of simulations with different combinations of SCF parameterizations and meteorological datasets reveals the large impact of meteorological forcing on snow simulation in CLASSIC. Two out of the three meteorological datasets were bias-adjusted using observation-based datasets. However, simulations forced by the dataset without bias correction outperform relative to simulations forced by datasets with bias correction, suggesting that there are large uncertainties in the observation-based datasets and/or methods used for bias correction. This study underscores the importance of accounting for topographic effects of sub-grid terrain and accurate meteorological forcing on snow simulation in land surface models."

Comparable 87Sr/86Sr ratios for different tree species, cambial ages and root systems suggest that bioavailable Sr in wood is little affected by biotic factors.

This study compares the E3SM simulation results with remote sensing and reanalysis data during the Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) field campaign to better understand the stratocumulus‐to‐cumulus cloud transition (SCT) over the northeast Pacific. E3SM results are extracted along the CSET Lagrangian trajectories. The comparison shows that the E3SM simulation applying horizontal wind nudging performs well in reproducing thermodynamic variables of the MBL and evolution trends of cloud variables along the trajectories. However, substantial overestimations of aerosol and cloud drop number Nd $\left({N}_{d}\right)$ are observed, which is explained as an issue with version 2 of the model. Cloud fraction (CF) does decrease from the Californian coast to Hawaii in the E3SM simulation, but most CF values indicate either an overcast or almost clear sky, which differs from satellite and reanalysis data. The effect of Nd ${N}_{d}$ overestimation on CF evolution is assessed via prescribed‐Nd ${N}_{d}$ simulations. Those simulations with Nd ${N}_{d}$ modifications show negligible CF changes. A comparison of estimated inversion strength (EIS) also shows that the simulated EIS values are similar to those of reanalysis data.

To address this, recent studies made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long‐range propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range‐dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and provides epistemic and data‐related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on the 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included in the training. This represents a significant step toward near real‐time assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive sources."

Even within this relatively small area, the combination of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change creates significant spatial variation in extreme climate events. This study analyzes mean seasonal temperature and precipitation trends in the WMed using ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data from 1951 to 2020 taking into consideration the climatic heterogeneity of the region. A non‐hierarchical K‐Means clustering method was applied to delineate nine climatically homogeneous regions within the WMed. A timescale decomposition analysis was then conducted to disentangle long‐term, decadal, and interannual variability components of seasonal data. Results indicate that long‐term trends explain most of the total observed variance in temperature (∼65%), whereas interannual natural variability dominates observed precipitation (∼60%). These patterns vary seasonally, with the strongest warming trends along the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa in summer and the most significant drying trends in the southwestern Mediterranean during both summer and winter. The influence of different modes of climate variability in the observed trends is assessed and appears to contribute to winter drying, but no evidence was found of its influence on warming trends. This study lays a foundation for future climate change detection and attribution efforts in the WMed, emphasizing the need for sub‐regional analysis due to the region's pronounced heterogeneity."

Merino,Evaluation of WRF Model Performance for Hailstorms in Southern France Using DPR‐GPM Data,"Understanding and better predicting severe meteorological phenomena such as hailstorms is increasingly important because of their capacity to cause major socioeconomic losses. We analyzed seven case studies with confirmed hail on the ground. To do so, we used four microphysical parameterizations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (horizontal resolution 3 km) that incorporate hail formation. Predictive variables for hailstorm severity were extracted from the Dual‐Frequency Precipitation Radar‐Global Precipitation Measurement (DPR‐GPM) sensor, a novel and effective tool for monitoring extreme events. The main objective was to evaluate WRF model data by comparing them with DPR‐GPM observations during hailstorm days in southern France. For this, the SAL score was used, an object‐oriented method that robustly evaluates the simulations. To deepen the analysis, other metrics were calculated. The selection of microphysical parameterizations for simulating hail is challenging because of their specific assumptions and dependence on other model parameterizations. However, for southern France, the best parameterization for simulating maximum reflectivity in the vertical profile and vertically integrated precipitation water in the solid phase was the Milbrandt‐Yau Double‐Moment 7‐class. For vertically integrated precipitation water in the liquid phase, it was the WRF Single‐Moment 7‐class (WSM7), with WRF Double‐Moment 7‐class (WDM7) standing out in the localization of all three variables. In contrast, the NSSL 2–Moment 7‐class scheme generally showed poorer performance in hail prediction and simulation of the analyzed variables. Identifying optimal parameterizations for hailstorm prediction in southern France will enhance future simulations of extreme weather in the Mediterranean."

However, the impact of the boundary layer jets (BLJs), with their unique low‐level vertical wind shear structures and moisture transport properties, on cold pools remains incompletely understood. This study utilizes observations from the 356‐m high Shenzhen Meteorological Tower to compare cold pool characteristics under BLJ and non‐BLJ conditions during April to June from 2018 to 2020. A total of 54 cold pools are identified, with 26 influenced by BLJs. BLJ‐related cold pools typically exhibit weaker average temperature drops, more pronounced decreases in specific humidity, and higher turbulence transport compared to those unrelated to BLJs. The enhanced moisture transport by BLJs constrains rainfall evaporation, resulting in weaker cold pools. In addition, the strong wind shear associated with BLJs promotes upward energy transport and turbulence, further weakening the intensity of cold pool. These distinctions are particularly pronounced in cold pools associated with mesoscale convective systems rather than individual convective cells. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interactions among cold pools, BLJs, and convection in South China."

 Advancing electromechanical resonators towards terahertz frequencies opens vast bandwidths for phononic signal processing. In quantum phononics, mechanical resonators at these frequencies can remain in their quantum ground state even at kelvin temperatures, obviating the need for millikelvin cooling typically required for GHz resonators. However, electrical actuation and detection at such high frequencies are challenging, primarily due to device miniaturization needed to support acoustic waves with nanometer-scale wavelengths. This requires thinning piezoelectric films to a thickness that matches the acoustic wavelength. In this work, we reduce the thickness of lithium niobate from 300 nm to 67 nm through several stages, and fabricate suspended Lamb-wave resonators at each thickness level. These resonators achieve resonant frequencies of nearly 220 GHz, doubling the previous record and approaching the terahertz threshold. While ultrathin films exhibit a clear advantage in frequency gains, they also experience increased acoustic losses. Our results suggest that future advances in terahertz nanomechanics will critically rely on mitigating surface defects in sub-100 nm thin films.

 Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moiré potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moiré-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moiré potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moiré-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

 Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) are widespread bacterial immune systems that trigger host suicide via cyclic nucleotide-activated effectors. The predominant strategy to induce cell death in CBASS is membrane disruption. Here, we demonstrate that patatin-like phospholipase CapV, the most abundant CBASS effector, relocates and cleaves membrane phospholipids at the cell pole upon 3’3’-cGAMP binding, inducing polarized membrane disruption and cell death. Using cryo-EM, we reveal that apo-CapV adopts both dimeric and tetrameric states, with its phospholipid-binding pocket occluded and locked in an inactive conformation. Binding to 3’3’-cGAMP induces filamentation and substantial conformational change of CapV, enhancing membrane binding via electrostatic interactions between its interspaced basic surfaces and the negatively charged phosphate moieties of phospholipids. Simultaneously, the rearrangement opens the phospholipid-binding pocket, enabling the accommodation of two fatty acid chains of phospholipid within distinct hydrophobic pockets. Our findings reveal a filament-dependent activation mechanism for phospholipase-mediated membrane disruption during antiviral response.

 Skyrmions, topologically non-trivial localized spin structures, are fertile ground for exploring emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics and next-generation magnetic-memory technologies. Although magnetics and optics readily lend themselves to two-dimensional realizations of spin texture, only recently have breakthroughs brought forth three-dimensional (3D) magnetic skyrmions, whereas their optical counterparts have eluded observation to date because their realization requires precise control over the spatiotemporal spectrum.

Precise control over the spatiotemporal polarization texture of light – a key requisite for synthesizing 3D optical merons – is the product of synergy between novel methodologies in the modulation of light jointly in space and time, digital holography, and large-area birefringent metasurfaces.

 Critical fluctuations play a crucial role in determining spin orders in low-dimensional magnetic materials. However, experimentally linking these fluctuations to scaling theory-and thereby uncovering insights into spin interaction models-remains a challenge. Here, we utilize a nitrogen-vacancy center-based quantum decoherence imaging technique to probe critical fluctuations in the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2. Our data reveal that critical fluctuations produce a random magnetic field, with noise spectra undergoing significant changes near the critical temperature. To explain this phenomenon, we developed a theoretical framework showing that the spectral density exhibits 1/f noise characteristics near the critical temperature, transitioning to white noise behavior away from this regime. By experimentally adjusting the sample-to-diamond distance, we identified the crossover temperature between these two noise types. These findings offer an approach to studying phase transition dynamics through critical fluctuations, enabling precise determination of critical exponents associated with long-range correlations. This methodology holds promise for advancing our understanding of critical phenomena across diverse physical systems.

 Anecdotal evidence has suggested an association between psychiatric drugs and psoriasis, but consensus is absent due to contradicting reports, and the mechanism remains poorly defined. Here, we investigate the function of serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), a receptor commonly targeted by psychiatric drugs, in regulating psoriasis. HTR2A antagonistic drugs worsen psoriatic outcome, and HTR2A modulation reduces psoriatic inflammation. Using the Imiquimod-induced psoriasiform model, HTR2A-deficient mice manifest exacerbated inflammation. Hematopoietic cells, particularly monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (moLC), are involved in this phenotype. Mechanistically, the exacerbated inflammation is due to increased interleukin-23 (IL-23) secretion, and HTR2A suppresses this by inhibiting activation of the non-canonical NFκB pathway. Serotonin is the putative agonist modulating HTR2A, attenuating psoriatic inflammation. Lastly, our findings in mice are also validated clinically. Our data demonstrate that serotonin modulates HTR2A, attenuating psoriatic inflammation by suppressing IL-23 secretion via inhibiting the non-canonical NFκB pathway in moLCs.

 Volcanic eruptions are among the strongest climate drivers, yet their regional impacts on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remain poorly constrained. Post-eruption amplified winter cooling in MENA is often attributed to a volcanically forced positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but the concurrent occurrence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) complicates attribution. Furthermore, summer climatic responses, including tropical warming and mid-latitude cooling, remain underexplored. Here, we present a pioneering research using a high-top coupled climate model (MIROC6) to assess volcanic-induced ENSO–NAO interactions and their regional climate impacts. We demonstrate that volcanic-induced NAO variability is the primary driver of post-eruption MENA winter cooling, with El Niño acting as a modulator rather than a fundamental trigger. We further reveal distinct summer climate anomalies, including suppressed precipitation over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

 Coastal sea ecosystems are increasingly threatened by global change and human activities. Our understanding of these changes is limited, especially in dynamic coastal regions lacking thick sediment sequences. Iron-manganese concretions, biogeochemical precipitates on the seafloor, grow in non-depositional coastal areas and record numerous marine processes and environmental variability. Establishing reliable geochronology for these precipitates has been challenging. We combine anthropogenic lead accumulation, cobalt chronometry, and radiocarbon dating to develop a high-resolution Bayesian age model for a rapidly growing iron-manganese concretion from the Baltic Sea. The concretion core formed ca. 11,000 cal. BP, with overgrown material showing successively younger ages from 7500 years ago to recent decades. Analyses of microstructure, magnetic microscopy, and bulk mineral magnetic properties, trace elements, and iron isotopic composition reveal that the concretion records environmental variability over the past 7000 years. Our study may serve as a benchmark for paleoenvironmental records from coastal iron-manganese concretions.

 The gap between climate pledges and action remains wide, including in the United States, where politicization and misconceptions hinder action. Interactive simulations could help overcome this gap by enhancing knowledge about climate change and motivating action. But little is known about whether this approach increases knowledge about climate solutions or whether such gains persist over time and foster real-world action. Here we analyze the impact of the En-ROADS Climate Action Simulation on participants’ understanding of high-leverage climate solutions, affective engagement, intent to act, and real-world action. Data from 1246 participants show gains in climate knowledge and engagement, sustained over 6 months, and fostering real-world actions. These gains are not influenced by participants’ sociodemographic traits or sociopolitical values. These results, together with the simulation’s accessibility and adaptability to diverse settings, highlight its potential to foster informed climate action.

 Due to the negative environmental consequences of current land-use, and land’s important role regarding carbon, biodiversity and food security, there is an urgent interest in reforming land-use. Policy objectives for tree planting to sequester carbon and the protection of land to increase biodiversity require land reallocation, which leads to inevitable trade-offs. Here, we evaluate the trade-offs between three objectives for rural land: agricultural/forestry production, carbon sequestration and biodiversity, by calculating metrics for these three objectives on a 500 m grid covering Great Britain. We use a multi-objective optimisation that allows us to explore the full option space of possible land conversions and identify the land allocations that entail limited trade-offs. Our results show that current land-use in Great Britain is far from optimal for any combination of objectives. We identify the locations where carbon sequestration and biodiversity can be substantially improved without compromising overall agricultural production, provided conversions are located carefully.

We found urbanization and water management as primary drivers, with agriculture and climate as secondary. Urbanization explained up to 62% of the variance in Texas-Gulf, 44% in California, and 32% in the Mid-Atlantic regions. Water management dominated in Tennessee (37%) and Ohio (30%) regions. Agriculture was most influential in the Great Lakes (17%) region, while climate contributed in the Rio Grande (15%) and California (11%) regions.

The term ‘(co)benefit’ is used deliberately to encompass both the direct benefits of averted impacts due to climate change as well as the indirect or ancillary benefits resulting from mitigation and adaptation interventions. We conducted a systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, Web of Science, and the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change Reports.

As global warming intensifies, MHWs are expected to become more extreme, emphasizing the need for precise model evaluations and deeper understanding of the underlying causes of bias to improve MHW simulations. In this study, we evaluated the MHW intensity simulated by 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models in the North Pacific Ocean by comparing them with the optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) dataset over a 33 year period (1982–2014). Over 80% of the CMIP6 models showed a dipole-pattern bias in the mean MHW intensity over the Kuroshio Extension, characterized by overestimation to the north and underestimation to the south. Hierarchical clustering based on the spatial pattern of the intensity bias in the Kuroshio Extension identifies four distinct clusters: two showing a dipole-pattern bias with slightly different magnitudes and the other two showing weaker or stronger intensity. The separation latitude based on the maximum surface current revealed that the models with the dipole bias pattern simulated the northward overshooting of the Kuroshio Current. This northward overshooting likely enhanced the transport of warmer sea surface temperatures to higher latitudes, thereby intensifying the MHWs. These findings highlight the critical role of ocean currents in the simulation of MHW in the western boundary current regions, including the Kuroshio region."

We find evidence of a threshold in salinity levels in the 25–30 g kg−1 range for most gears employed in the fishery.

Using eight LE models, here we show that compared to low-frequency fitting methods that can be applied directly to observation and a single-member simulation, the ensemble-mean detrending approach induces spurious SST variability in the equatorial Pacific, resulting in an underestimated ENSO amplitude response to greenhouse warming. The source of spurious variability relates to a residual effect associated with ENSO nonlinear rectification, which is inherently unavoidable though its influence decreases with ensemble size.

However, the effects of these movements on cold extremes remain understudied. This study classifies the movements of atmospheric blocking into westward-moving, eastward-moving, and quasi-stationary across different regions during winters from 1979/80–2020/21 and investigates their respective impacts on surface air temperature. We found that, in the western North Pacific, westward-moving blocking events exhibited the highest frequency, while other regions showed quasi-stationary blocking occurring most frequently. These results reveal the regional difference in the frequency of blocking movement types, but the blocking persistence showed a common characteristic across all regions, with westward-moving blocking events persisting longer compared to other types. Interestingly, these long-lasting and westward-moving blockings were associated with notable cold temperature anomalies in downstream areas during blocking dissipation phase. This arises from the enhanced advection of high-latitude mean cold temperature by blocking-induced wind anomalies at low levels, despite their relatively low occurrences. These characteristics were successfully reproduced in Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble (CESM1-LENS) simulations, suggesting that better understanding of blocking mobility can improve our ability to predict extreme cold winters."

Roemer,Variation in shortwave water vapour continuum and impact on clear-sky shortwave radiative feedback,"We investigated the impact of the shortwave water vapour continuum absorption on clear-sky shortwave radiative feedback. For current temperatures, the impact is modest (<2%). In a warmer world, continuum-induced uncertainty in estimated feedback would be up to ~5%. Representing continuum absorption with the widely used semi-empirical model in radiative transfer calculations leads to an underestimation of this feedback. Constraining the shortwave continuum will help reduce these discrepancies. 
 This work assesses the impact of the current differences in the strength of the shortwave water vapour continuum on clear-sky calculations of shortwave radiative feedback. Three continuum models were used: the MT_CKD (Mlawer–Tobin–Clough–Kneizys–Davies; versions 2.5 and 4.1.1) and CAVIAR_updated (Continuum Absorption at Visible and Infrared Wavelengths and its Atmospheric Relevance) models. Radiative transfer calculations were performed with the ECMWF radiation scheme (“ecRad”). The correlated k-distribution gas-optics tables required for ecRad computations were trained with each of these continuum models using the ECMWF correlated k-distribution software tool. The gas-optics tables trained with the different continuum models were tested individually in the shortwave. The atmosphere configuration was as follows: fixed surface temperatures (TS) between 270 and 330 K, fixed relative humidity at 80 %, a moist adiabatic lapse rate for the tropospheric temperature, and an isothermal stratosphere with the tropopause temperature fixed at 175 K. At TS = 288 K, it was found that the revisions of the MT_CKD model in the shortwave over the last decade and a half have a modest effect (∼ 0.3 %) on the estimated shortwave feedback. Compared to MT_CKD_4.1.1, the stronger CAVIAR_updated model has a relatively greater impact; the shortwave feedback is ∼ 0.006 W m−2 K−1 (∼ 1.6 %) more positive. Thus, for the clear-sky situation investigated, uncertainties due to the shortwave continuum are insignificant for the present-day climate. The uncertainty in the shortwave feedback increases up to 0.008 W m−2 K−1 (∼ 2.0 %) between the MT_CKD models and 0.018 W m−2 K−1 (∼ 4.6 %) between the CAVIAR_updated and MT_CKD_4.1.1 models at TS ≈ 300 K. At TS ≈ 300 K, a large portion of shortwave feedback originates at windows where CAVIAR_updated and MT_CKD_4.1.1 differ substantially, leading to the larger feedback uncertainty."

During the summer monsoon season, d-excess and δ18O mainly reflect the effect of raindrop evaporation which leads to lower vapor δ18O but higher d-excess values. These findings provide new insights into using water isotopes to track moisture sources and dynamics over the TP. 
 The Southeast Tibetan Plateau (SETP) has experienced a significant drying trend in recent decades, which is likely linked to shifts in moisture sources. To investigate the roles of ocean surface evaporation, continental air mass intrusion, and precipitation-vapor interactions, we present a three-year daily time series of near-surface vapor δ18O and d-excess data from the SETP station. Our analysis reveals that apparent negative correlations between d-excess and relative humidity over the Indian Ocean are primarily due to anticorrelated seasonal cycles, which become insignificant or marginal when examined seasonally. This result underscores the need for caution in interpreting d-excess as a conservative tracer of ocean surface evaporation. Instead, we identify local and upstream specific humidity as the primary determinants of non-monsoon season d-excess variability, which is influenced by the intrusion of cold and dry air from upper levels. During the summer monsoon season, both d-excess and δ18O reflect the effect of raindrop evaporation during transport, which decreases δ18O but increases d-excess. These findings offer new insights into the use of water isotopes to track moisture sources and circulation changes across the SETP, especially under varying seasonal circulation systems. In particular, the findings for d-excess will contribute to our understanding of shifts in moisture sources and provide a framework for interpreting d-excess in various hydroclimatic applications, including ice core studies."

Our research shows that, in regions with very few stations, assimilating tropospheric gradients on top of zenith total delay observations can enhance the performance of existing improvements. 
 The assimilation of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) zenith total delays (ZTDs) into numerical weather models improves weather forecasts. In addition, the GNSS tropospheric gradient (TG) estimates provide valuable insight into the moisture distribution in the lower troposphere. In this study, we utilize a newly developed forward operator for TGs to investigate the sensitivity effects of incorporating TGs into the Weather Research and Forecasting model at varying station network densities. We assimilated ZTD and TGs from dense and sparse station networks (0.5 and 1°, respectively). Through this study, we found that the improvement in the humidity field with the assimilation of ZTD and TGs from the sparse station network (1° resolution) is comparable to the improvement achieved by assimilating ZTD only from the dense station network (0.5° resolution). These results encourage the assimilation of TGs alongside ZTDs in operational weather forecasting agencies, especially in regions with few GNSS stations.

This is important for dry ecosystems, as they are often driven by changes in soil water availability. We showed that this update resulted in a better match with observations and that the updated model is more sensitive to soil texture. The new model can also simulate a groundwater table. This updated model can help us to better understand the future of dry ecosystems under climate change. 
 Dryland ecosystems are globally important, yet state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models often lack specific processes or parameterizations that are critical for accurately simulating dryland dynamics. These missing processes include a realistic calculation of soil water movement, detailed plant–water relations, or a representation of deep water uptake. In this study, we show how including a process-based soil hydrology scheme in the LPJ-GUESS (Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) model can improve its usefulness for simulating the functioning of dryland ecosystems. By replacing the default 15-layer bucket representation of soil hydrology in LPJ-GUESS v4.1 with a mechanistic description of soil water movement based on the 1D Richards equation, we show that the model is better able to capture seasonal patterns of water cycling through dryland ecosystems at both the site and regional levels. In addition, the inclusion of a new set of bottom boundary conditions, such as a permanent groundwater layer, further expands the range of ecosystems the LPJ-GUESS model can simulate. We show that soil bottom boundary conditions, in particular varying levels of groundwater depth, can have a large influence on vegetation composition and water cycling.

It has not yet been extensively explored, using observation, how such a collaborative evolution changes systematically from region to region over tropical oceans. In this study, the ERA5 reanalysis data and satellite measurements from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar are analyzed to examine the variability of the large‐scale vertical velocity (ω) and diabatic heating (Q1 ${Q}_{1}$) profiles over tropical oceans. Hour‐to‐hour variability in these variables is examined based on composite time series to delineate the evolution of ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ before and after Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) precipitation peaks. Four tropical basins are selected to study regional differences: western Pacific (WP), eastern Pacific (EP), Indian Ocean (IO), and Atlantic Ocean (AO). The composite time series reveal that the ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ distributions align with the typical life cycle of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition is applied to the vertical structure of ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ in terms of top‐heaviness. The ω and Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ top‐heaviness ratio (THR) delineate similar evolutionary curves in that THR enhances as convection intensifies, but the peak hour occurs earlier for Q1 ${Q}_{1}$ by several hours than for ω. The top‐heaviness of ω and Q1 ${\,Q}_{1}$ exhibits a notable regionality that they are bottom‐heavier in EP and AO than in WP and IO.

Although super resolution deep learning models such as YNet show promise in global downscaling efforts, we found their performance on ISMR less effective, particularly for extreme rainfall and intraseasonal variability. The transferability of downscaling algorithms trained on reanalysis data to climate model simulations, as well as a comprehensive evaluation across key timescales of ISMR variability, remain unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose two variants of YNet: YNet_D, which incorporates atmospheric variables to enhance downscaling accuracy, and YNet_DE, which prioritizes extreme rainfall using a weighted loss function. YNet_D and YNet_DE outperform YNet, reducing root mean squared error from 12.41 to 12.25 mm and 11.97 mm, respectively. For extremes, they lower the R95p bias from 78.27 to 56.52 mm and 40.22 mm.

Skinner,The Impact of CO2‐Driven Vegetation Changes on the Future of Flash Drought in the Northern Hemisphere,"Vegetation plays a crucial role in soil moisture regulation and the development of rapid‐onset droughts known as flash droughts. We use climate model experiments with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) to examine how the vegetation response to rising CO2 impacts projections of future flash drought in the Northern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes. By isolating the influences of CO2 fertilization and CO2 stomatal conductance effects from CO2 radiative forcing, we find that: (a) CO2‐induced changes to plant characteristics are of sufficient magnitude to modify flash drought characteristics, (b) CO2 fertilization effects counteract the CO2 stomatal conductance effects on projected flash drought occurrence, and (c) the combined influence of the vegetation response to rising CO2 can either amplify or counteract CO2 radiative‐driven flash drought changes depending on location. In water‐limited regions such as the western United States, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, and west/central Asia where CO2 fertilization dominates and surface vegetation strongly controls water availability, elevated leaf area offsets reductions in stomatal conductance and transpiration, increasing the likelihood of future flash droughts. Vegetation‐driven increases in flash drought in these areas are generally aligned in sign with projected increases due to radiative forcing. Conversely, in more energy limited regions such as western Canada, East Asia, and parts of Europe, preserved soil moisture from reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration suppresses flash droughts despite increased leaf area from CO2 fertilization. These reductions in flash drought from vegetation counteract radiative‐driven increases. This study elucidates physical processes underlying projected flash drought development, improving predictive capabilities and mitigation strategies."

However, as the kinds and frequencies of satellite observations are increased, it is desirable to switch to physics‐based objective analysis. This study is conducted to test its feasibility by examining the assimilation of high‐resolution atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) obtained by a recently proposed method. Even though the method can retrieve low‐level high‐speed winds near the inner edge of the eyewall cloud, it cannot directly measure the maximum wind speed, which is normally achieved in the eyewall. On the basis of an ensemble Kalman filter assimilation system, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are performed by assimilating pseudo‐AMV observations created from a nature run during the mature stage in a real TC. Mimicking the real AMVs, the pseudo‐observations are limited to low‐level AMVs in the eye without the maximum wind in the eyewall. The AMV assimilation limited to the eye reduces the spread of the TC‐center position among the ensemble members. Although the present OSSE has a limitation to assume that the model used is unbiased and highly dense AMVs are always obtained in a vertical layer of the eye, these results suggest that assimilating high‐resolution low‐level AMVs in the eye can be a hopeful approach to realize improvement of the TC structure with small errors in the model for the physics‐based objective analysis of TC intensity in the future."

Despite significant advancements in transferring hydrological knowledge from data‐rich to data‐sparse basins, such as regionalization techniques for hydrological prediction and novel deep learning (DL)‐based Transfer learning (TL) methods, the application of models trained in data‐rich basins introduces inevitable noise into predictions within data‐sparse basins. This potential distortion could misinterpret rainfall‐runoff patterns within specific basins. This study introduces a TL framework based on data augmentation (DA‐TL) within the context of hydrological modeling. The framework employs augmented rainfall data as input for conceptual models to generate pretraining runoff samples, addressing the challenges of sample scarcity and imbalance in target basins. Subsequently, TL is applied to fine‐tune predictions in the target basin, thereby mitigating inappropriate hydrological knowledge transfer associated with cross‐basin learning. The DA‐TL framework was validated across nine river basins in China, representing three distinct climate zones (semi‐arid, semi‐humid, and humid regions). Results indicate that the DA‐TL approach outperforms current DL methods for regionalized hydrological modeling. Specifically, under varying data scarcity scenarios, DA‐TL achieved average Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency improvements of 3.8% and 1.0% compared to similar‐basin modeling and all‐basin modeling strategies, respectively. Model interpretability analyses reveal that the effectiveness of the DA‐TL framework primarily stems from its adept learning of the runoff generation and routing processes in target basins. These findings underscore the potential of using synthetic data derived from process‐based models for pretraining in TL, offering promising avenues for improving hydrological extremes forecasting accuracy in observation‐limited regions."

In Papua New Guinea (PNG), malaria is widespread in lowland areas but rarely transmitted above 1,600 m. This study assessed changes in malaria transmission suitability across PNG from 1960 to 2019 and projected shifts through 2040, using satellite‐derived temperature data and climate models. We applied a temperature‐dependent basic reproduction number (R0) to identify shifts in geographic suitability, estimate the population at risk, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Malaria temperature suitability ranges have subtly changed between 1960 and 2019, with the proportion of people living in suitable areas increasing from 58% to 61% (equivalent to an additional 249,125 people). Under a conservative climate change model, this proportion is expected increase to 74% by 2040 (equivalent to an additional 2,802,709 people). Interventions had a larger impact on malaria incidence in areas with R0 < 0.3, mitigating the current and future impact of climate change. Nevertheless, the number of people requiring access to malaria control is expected to double by 2040, to 13.4 million with 2.8 million attributed to climate change alone. The impacted areas are densely populated highlands regions with a more susceptible population and an increased potential for epidemics and clinical disease. These findings underscore the challenges of climate change for malaria elimination in PNG and highlight the need to accurately guide preparedness and forecast the additional resource requirements."

 Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded). By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.

 It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and Fe50Pt50), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency. This agrees with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (≥2 nm for Ni) results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM.

Here, the authors propose a method for the rapid detection and identification of such defects by combining thermographic and electromagnetic signals. 
 Thermal barrier coating system plays key role in high temperature gas turbine blades. During the manufacture and in-service processes, defects are inevitable due to the inconsistent deformation and fatigue loading. The typical defects, e.g. interfacial debonding and crack in substrate, may significantly degrade the performance, safety and service life of gas turbine. However, it is challenging to non-destructively evaluate the small defects and/or coexistent multi-defects in thermal barrier coating system. Here, we propose a non-destructive method to detect the defects in thermal barrier coating system using the results of both infrared thermography and eddy current testing. Using this method, we detect interfacial debonding as small as 0.7 mm within 0.2 s and identify defect types which are essential for turbine blade fabrication and maintenance. By leveraging multi-physical fields, we achieve effective and quantitative evaluation of coexisting defects in thermal barrier coating system. This method integrates multiple non-destructive evaluation techniques and provides an approach to assess defects in multilayer structures without damaging them.

 Altered histone post-translational modifications are frequently associated with cancer. Here, we apply mass-spectrometry to study the epigenetic landscapes of breast cancer subtypes, with a particular focus on triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a heterogeneous group lacking well-defined molecular targets and effective therapies. The analysis of over 200 tumors reveals epigenetic signatures that discriminate TNBCs from the other BC subtypes, and that distinguish TNBC patients with different prognoses. Employing a multi-OMICs approach integrating epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, we investigate the mechanistic role of increased H3K4 methylation in TNBCs, demonstrating that H3K4me2 sustains the expression of genes associated with the TNBC phenotype. Through CRISPR-mediated editing, we establish a causal relationship between H3K4me2 and gene expression for several targets. Furthermore, treatment with H3K4 methyltransferase inhibitors reduce TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results unravel a novel epigenetic pathway implicated in TNBC pathogenesis and suggest new opportunities for targeted therapy.

Here, the authors present a readily fabricated, organised human motor assembloids-on-a-chip approach for neuromuscular research and hypoxia disease modelling. 
 Precision medicine leverages stem cell-derived models to dissect complex interactions underlying disease-driven neuromuscular damage. However, such reductionist models form stochastic structures without external guidance, while available engineering solutions remain intricate. Here, simplified surface modification engineering is used to render spatially patterned human motor assembloids-on-a-chip by geometric confinement. The anisotropic architecture of skeletal muscle organoids (hSkM) can be conferred solely by localized mechanobiological cues within this predefined device without aligned scaffolds or adjuncts. The hSkM-orchestrated coupling of motor neuron spheroids (hMNS) promotes synergistic neuromuscular development. Furthermore, integration of optogenetic and microelectrode array mapping enables visualization of functional patterning in assembloids. Applied to oxygen deprivation model, hSkM exhibits structural anomalies, fatigable muscle remodeling and dysfunction, recapitulating muscle pathologies in intermittent hypoxia (IH)-associated respiratory disorders. Electrical activity mapping reveals the heterogeneity in neuromuscular responses to IH, indicating the neuroregulatory etiology of muscle dysfunction. Finally, we identify mitochondrial bioenergetic imbalance as a key IH target, proposing evaluation of NAD+ salvage pathway-targeting agents.

In this work, Soubias et al, using an integrated structure-function approach, discovered a mechanism where a GAP PH domain binds directly to a GTPase to induce allosteric changes facilitating GTP hydrolysis. 
 GTPase-activating proteins are important regulators of small GTPases; among these, ASAP1 stimulates GTP hydrolysis on Arf1 and is implicated in cancer progression. ASAP1 contains a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain essential for maximum Arf·GTP hydrolysis. The prevailing view of PH domains is that they regulate proteins through passive mechanisms like membrane recruitment. In sharp contrast, we show that the PH domain of ASAP1 actively contributes to Arf1 GTP hydrolysis. By combining NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, kinetic assays, and mutational analysis, we find that the PH domain binds Arf·GTP at the membrane, to establish an active state primed for GTP hydrolysis. We identify key residues on the PH domain and Arf that drive this allosteric mechanism, which mathematical modeling shows contributes as much to GTPase activation as membrane recruitment. The finding that PH domains directly modulate small GTPases has broad implications for the Ras and Rho oncoprotein families. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) often contain regulatory PH domains.

 Riverine floods that occur simultaneously over multiple regions often lead to amplified societal and environmental impacts compared to individual events. However, the pattern and mechanisms governing the global interconnection of peak river discharge across spatially distant and proximate locations remain largely unexplored. Here, on the basis of a global annual peak discharge database from 4,407 observational hydrometric stations, we identify hubs for remotely linked discharge peaks spanning thousands of kilometres. We show increasing trends in the number of remotely linked watersheds and the total drainage area, pointing to amplified synchronization of global peak river discharge since the 1980s. Ocean–atmosphere oscillations, through the perturbation of both temperature and precipitation anomalies, dictate the global coupling pattern and temporal evolution of discharge peaks. Our findings highlight an emergent profile of global peak river flow in a warming climate that can benefit coordinated flood risk management.

 While the potential intensity (PI) theory provides a foundation for projecting future tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, uncertainties remain regarding how future TC maximum intensity will change due to potential offsets from interaction between TCs and their ambient environment. Using high-resolution downscaling simulations based on future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phases 5 and 6, this study examines the relative influence of local environment along TC tracks and large-scale atmospheric conditions on TC lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) in future projections. Analyzing TC intensity distributions for the final two decades of the 21st century in the western North Pacific (WNP) basin shows that the LMI increases in all future scenarios in this basin, despite less favorable local conditions along TC tracks. This increase in LMI is driven by a rise in the occurrence of long-lived TCs and a decline in short-lived TCs, enabling more TCs to reach higher intensities during their lifetime even as local environments become more hostile to TC development in warmer climates. The mechanism behind this LMI increase is linked to a northeastward shift in the Western Pacific Subtropical High, which alters TC track patterns in the WNP basin. These findings highlight the critical role of large-scale environment in TC intensity projections, underscoring the need to move beyond basin-wide PI analyses when assessing future TC activity."

 Arctic winter warming is stronger than in summer, but its driving mechanisms remain debated, particularly the roles of local processes, like sea-ice loss, versus remote factors, like atmospheric heat transport. Here we introduce a novel decomposition framework that characterizes Arctic warming as a function of historical atmospheric circulation, sea ice concentration, and carbon dioxide changes using observational and reanalysis data. We show that sea ice changes explain about 55% of the winter Arctic near-surface temperature trend during 1959–2015, after removing the effects directly connected to atmospheric circulation. Dynamically induced warming accounts for about 20% at surface and up to 80% in mid-troposphere. The remaining ~25% is attributed to the increase in carbon dioxide, though it also indirectly affects sea-ice loss and circulation-related warming. These findings highlight the dominant role of sea ice loss and change in atmospheric dynamics in affecting the historical Arctic winter warming.

 Wing dams, used in rivers like the Mississippi and Danube, improve navigation by increasing water depth during low flow. Their hydromorphological effects are complex, and their influence on flood risk remains debated. Here we developed an approach that identifies local physical patterns from detailed numerical calculations, enabling extension to larger river sections and longer time scales previously difficult to study. We apply this numerical method to assess wing dam impacts on water and bed levels over decades to centuries. Our results show that rivers with bed materials prone to armouring tend to experience long-term water level increases due to wing dams, while others may see decreases. Adjustments to new stable conditions take decades, with temporary water level rises even in uniform beds. For the Mississippi River, wing dams likely caused initial water level increases, but effects declined over time, indicating evolving riverbed responses.

 Extraction of agricultural field parcels is of great importance for agricultural condition monitoring, farm management, and food security. Several methods have been developed to map the distribution of agricultural field parcels, among which deep learning-based supervised learning is increasingly employed. Nevertheless, advanced deep learning models face two major limitations: limited ability to generalize across different spatial，temporal and sensor contexts with varying scene and object characteristics, and high requirement for annotated datasets to support training and validation. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework (UDA-Field Teacher, UDA-FT) for agricultural field parcel instance segmentation, which is designed to transfer knowledge from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains. UDA-FT is based on the Mask R-CNN framework and incorporates a target-oriented teacher model and a cross-domain student model. This cross-domain student model embeds an image adaptation module and an instance adaptation module, employing adversarial learning strategies to mitigate cross-domain distribution differences. Additionally, we propose a consistency mutual learning module based on soft pseudo-label technology, overcoming the limitations of traditional hard pseudo-labeling in confidence threshold selection and improving model robustness in the target domain. Furthermore, to address the difficulty in generating independent instance labels for densely packed agricultural field parcels and capturing spatial contextual relationships during soft pseudo-label generation, we propose two data augmentation methods, namely CutMatch (CM) and LeakyMask (LM). We adopted the proposed framework on cross-scene and cross-sensor datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and robustness under different scenes. Quantification and visualization results demonstrate our UDA-FT outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for cross-scene and cross-sensor agricultural field parcels across all metrics. Ablation studies highlight the substantial impact of strong data augmentation on model performance, emphasizing the importance of learning from out-of-distribution data. As an innovative application of unsupervised domain adaptation in agricultural field parcel instance segmentation, this research provides a novel method for domain shift in agricultural remote sensing imagery, enabling more accurate field instance segmentation with significant implications for global agriculture."

 Cloud cover significantly hinders the use of optical remote sensing data, such as Sentinel-2, by obscuring critical information needed for environmental monitoring. This study introduces Enhanced Diffusion Model for Cloud Removal (EDM-CR), an enhanced cloud removal framework that integrates Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery using efficient diffusion models. Our approach features three key novel aspects: (1) a forward diffusion process conditioned on both the previous timestep image and cloudy Sentinel-2 data, simulating cloud addition to improve the backward diffusion process; (2) a two-branch backward diffusion process conditioned on the current timestep image, cloudy Sentinel-2 data, and Sentinel-1 data, enhancing cloud removal fidelity and restoration efficiency; and (3) a modified Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) loss function that incorporates all 13 Sentinel-2 spectral bands, ensuring comprehensive spatial information preservation. The framework is trained using paired and co-registered Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images (both cloudy and cloud-free) from the SEN12MS-CR dataset and validated on a large set of unseen cloudy images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms five state-of-the-art cloud removal techniques. Furthermore, the cloud-removed Sentinel-2 images are used as year-round inputs for farmland segmentation in the Netherlands, providing temporal context that improves segmentation accuracy compared to using limited timesteps. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our diffusion model framework in integrating multi-sensor data for robust cloud removal and highlight the benefits of incorporating temporal information for accurate semantic segmentation of farmland."

 Accurate farm-level yield estimation is crucial for informed agricultural decision-making and food security, particularly in data-scarce, small-scale rainfed systems such as those found in South Africa. This study explores the integration of remote sensing-derived leaf area index (LAI) into the WOFOST crop model using a recalibration-based data assimilation (DA) approach. Data from eight farms across two growing seasons (2020–2021) in the Eastern Cape were used. Key phenological parameters were calibrated, and a yield gap factor influencing daily gross assimilation was introduced and optimized alongside the specific leaf area using LAI observations from two farms in 2020. The optimized parameters were validated across additional farms and seasons. Results show that DA significantly improved yield predictions (RMSE = 472 kg.ha−1; NRMSE = 11%) compared to simulations without assimilation (RMSE = 4817 kg.ha−1; NRMSE = 112%). These findings highlight the method’s potential to adapt crop models to data-limited contexts, quantify yield gaps, and support efficient resource management.

 Climate change has fundamentally altered global seasonal patterns, yet quantifying these shifts remains challenging due to heterogeneous definitions of seasons. Here, we develop a standardized 5d temperature-based classification system for seasons from 1971 to 2021 using the fifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5). Our analysis reveals a pronounced redistribution of seasonal durations. Specifically, summer expanded by 3.2 % grid globally, while spring, autumn, and winter decreased by −2.8 %, −12.1 %, and − 0.9 % in 2021, respectively, compared to 1971. The prolongation of summer in mid-latitude regions is due to an earlier onset and delayed termination, as well as the poleward migration of thermal transition zones (1.1° latitude over 1971–2021). Additionally, hemispheric asymmetry is quantified by the poleward migration of warm-side boundaries: 0.22°N decade−1 vs. 0.20°S decade−1, i.e., 10.3 % faster in the North Hemispheric, attributed to its greater landmass and thermal sensitivity. This study provides a unified framework for understanding global seasonal dynamics, which is critical for predicting climate-ecosystem interactions."

 Freezing precipitation (rain and drizzle) is a complex atmospheric phenomenon with severe impacts on transport, energy and infrastructure. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of freezing precipitation climatology in the Far East for a 30-year period (1994–2024) using the ERA5 reanalysis data set. The wide spatial coverage (25–65°N, 110–150°E) and the application of regional diagnostic algorithms for the detection of freezing precipitation provided valuable information on their frequency variability, areas of high activity, and the temporal characteristics of their distribution. It was found that: the maximum activity of freezing precipitation is observed in the southeastern China and on the northwestern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk (up to 13 h/season); freezing precipitation in the Far East is characterized by pronounced seasonal variability. In autumn, freezing precipitation is concentrated in two latitudinal zones (46–50°N and 39–44°N), in winter it prevails in China, and in spring it shifts to the northern regions and island territories (Sakhalin and Hokkaido). The key result is the detection of an autumn “southern shift” of the increased freezing precipitation activity area in the third decade (2014–2024). The composite analysis showed that this change was accompanied by a displacement of the cyclonic activity area 600–700 km to the south and a strengthening of the tropospheric circulation meridionality. The results obtained are of important practical significance for forecasting extreme weather events and assessing climate risks in the Far East. The research highlights the need for a further study of the impact of global warming on the spatial and temporal distribution of freezing precipitation."

 On 24 April 2022, a low-topped supercell developed in northeastern Hungary along a near-surface thermal boundary that separated a warm, dry air mass to the south from a cool, moist air mass to the north. The storm produced large hail (>2 cm) and damaging winds (>25 m s−1). To assess the role of the thermal boundary in this case, we analyzed the convective environment based on surface observations and examined the evolution and intensification of the supercell along the boundary using Doppler radar data. To further investigate the role of the boundary in the intensification of the storm, a one-way nested high-resolution numerical simulation was performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 600 m horizontal grid spacing. Lagrangian diagnostics were used to quantify baroclinic and tilting contributions to horizontal vorticity generation along parcel trajectories, while Eulerian fields characterized the spatial structure of the boundary. Between 1230 and 1250 UTC, most inflow parcels passed through or near the boundary before entering the supercell updraft. During this period, the baroclinic term was approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the tilting term. Moreover, the cumulative baroclinic contribution approached the total amount of absolute horizontal vorticity present in the parcels by the end of the trajectory period, underscoring its dominant role in the generation of inflow vorticity. Given the complexity of supercell dynamics, no final conclusions can be drawn; however, the results point to the thermal boundary as a major contributor to near-surface baroclinic horizontal vorticity. Parcels that traversed this zone appear to have imported substantial amounts of horizontal vorticity into the supercell inflow, which likely supported the development of a stronger low-level mesocyclone through subsequent tilting and stretching processes. These findings highlight the potential influence of mesoscale thermodynamic boundaries on storm evolution, particularly in regions with complex terrain and convective variability."

Regarding global agriculture, laboratory experiments suggest that early crop exposure to heat may either confer tolerance or enhance vulnerability to subsequent heat during the critical crop flowering stage. We show that warm early-seasons improve crop yield potential, particularly for soybean and maize, but also increase the impacts of subsequent heat by 5%–55% compared to years with average early-season temperatures. The impacts of this increased yield sensitivity outweigh the benefits of early season heat when mid-season temperature anomalies exceed 0.7 C–5 C (depending on the crop). Analyzing projected temperatures under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0, we find a tenfold increase in the likelihood of experiencing sequential heat in early and mid-season crop growth stages, defined as a joint 90th percentile event. Accounting for the interactive effects of early and mid-season warming increases projected temperature-related crop yield losses by 2%–44%, depending on crop and region. These results underline the emerging nonlinear risks from sequential heat extremes to food systems, which can largely be avoided when limiting warming to 1.5 C globally."

Highly time-resolved measurements of the submicron PM found residential heating with wood and oil and hydrocarbon-like organics from traffic, as well as sulfur-containing aerosol, to be the key pollution sources. Remarkable differences existed between complementary instruments, warranting the deployment of multiple tools at sites, with wide-ranging influences. 
 Fairbanks, Alaska, is a sub-Arctic city that frequently suffers from the non-attainment of national air quality standards in the wintertime due to the coincidence of weak atmospheric dispersion and increased local emissions. As part of the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) campaign, we deployed a Chemical Analysis of Aerosol Online (CHARON) inlet coupled with a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF MS) and an Aerodyne high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to measure organic aerosol (OA) and non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1), respectively. We deployed a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis for the source identification of NR-PM1. The AMS analysis identified three primary factors: biomass burning, hydrocarbon-like, and cooking factors, which together accounted for 28 %, 38 %, and 11 % of the total OA, respectively. Additionally, a combined organic and inorganic PMF analysis revealed two further factors: one enriched in nitrates and another rich in sulfates of organic and inorganic origin. The PTRCHARON factorization could identify four primary sources from residential heating: one from oil combustion and three from wood combustion, categorized as low temperature, softwood, and hardwood. Collectively, all residential heating factors accounted for 79 % of the total OA. Cooking and road transport were also recognized as primary contributors to the overall emission profile provided by PTRCHARON. All PMF analyses could apportion a single oxygenated secondary organic factor. These results demonstrate the complementarity of the two instruments and their ability to describe the complex chemical composition of PM1 and related sources. This work further demonstrates the capability of PTRCHARON to provide both qualitative and quantitative information, offering a comprehensive understanding of the OA sources. Such insights into the sources of submicron aerosols can ultimately assist environmental regulators and citizens in improving the air quality in Fairbanks and in rapidly urbanizing regional sub-Arctic areas."

This could be attributed to a faster freezing time compared to a slower mass expulsion time, along with ice shell formation during freezing. This result helps improve our understanding of the interaction between ice microphysical processes and chemistry in deep convective clouds. 
 The influence of freezing processes and vertical transport of trace gases into the upper atmosphere during deep convection is critical to understanding the distribution of aerosol precursors and their climate effects. We conducted experimental studies inside a walk-in cold room for freely levitating raindrops (drop diameter: 2 mm) using an acoustic levitator apparatus. We investigated the effect of freezing raindrops on the retention of organic species for the first time with silver iodide as the ice-nucleating agent. Quantitative chemical analysis determined the retention coefficient, which is defined as the fraction of a chemical species remaining in the ice phase compared to their initial liquid-phase concentrations. We measured the retention coefficients of nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, and 2-nitrophenol as single components. Furthermore, we determined the retention coefficients of these substances as binary mixtures. Our results show the dominance of physical aspects such as drop size and ice shell formation over their chemical counterparts with regard to overall retention for the investigated large drops. Thus, for rain-sized drops, almost everything is fully retained during the freezing process, i.e., retention coefficients close to 1, even for species with low effective Henry's law constants (H*<10-4). An ice shell is formed within 4.8 ms around the drops just after the freezing is initiated. This ice shell formation was found to be the controlling factor for the overall retention of the investigated species, which inhibited any further expulsion of dissolved substances from the drop."

Samples from PM2.5 filter extracts were frozen at -15 °C in an acoustic levitator without artificial nucleators and analyzed using ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal a non-normal distribution of retention coefficients that differs from current literature on cloud droplets. 
 The freezing of hydrometeors causes certain water-soluble organic compounds dissolved in the supercooled cloud droplets to be released into the gas phase. This may lead to the vertical redistribution of substances that become available for atmospheric processes in the upper troposphere, such as new particle formation or ozone formation. Drop-freezing experiments were performed on the Mainz acoustic levitator (M-AL) using aqueous extracts of ambient samples of Beijing urban aerosol. The retention coefficients of over 450 compounds were determined. Most nitro-aromatics and organosulfates were fully retained, along with the aliphatic amines (AAs) and higher-order amines and amides, while the observed sulfides, lipids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and long-chain compounds are among the most unretained and, incidentally, are the fewest species present. The findings here also indicate that N- and S-containing compounds, primarily nitro and sulfate components of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) anthropogenically related to NOx and SO2 chemistry, have enhanced retention, likely due to their increased polarity. An insignificant positive correlation between polarity and freezing retention, along with a significant negative correlation with vapor pressure and freezing retention, was observed. No sigmoidal relationship with the effective Henry's law constant was observed. This differs from the parameterizations of riming retention presented in the current literature, which is justified by the lower surface-to-volume ratio of the large drop size investigated. This study greatly expands upon the available experimental measurements of retention by investigating hundreds of compounds in complex chemical conditions that are more similar to the atmosphere than in previous literature studies."

This investigation evaluates these two datasets against measurements from a floating ship-based lidar, collected during a novel measurement campaign in the Baltic Sea. 
 The accurate characterisation of offshore wind resources is crucial for the efficient planning and design of wind energy projects. However, the scarcity of in situ observations in marine environments requires the exploration of alternative and reliable data sources. In response to this challenge, this study presents a comprehensive comparison between wind profiles derived from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) satellite observations and the ECMWF Reanalysis fifth-generation (ERA5) dataset against ship-based lidar measurements in the northern Baltic Sea. The aim is to investigate the applicability of ship-based lidar measurements for validating these datasets and to better understand the reliability, accuracy, and limitations of ASCAT- and ERA5-derived wind statistics for offshore wind characterisation at wind turbine operating heights. To extrapolate ASCAT observations from sea level to turbine rotating heights, a mean correction of atmospheric stability effects based on ERA5 and a probabilistic adaptation of the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory were implemented. The comparison between the two gridded datasets, extrapolated ASCAT and ERA5, reveals an overall good agreement in average wind speeds at 100 m height, with ASCAT exhibiting overall mean wind speeds approximately 0.6 m s−1 higher than ERA5 across the entire study region. However, excluding regions within 40 km of the coastline reduces this bias to around 0.4 m s−1, highlighting the negative impact of coastal contamination in ASCAT measurements and the difficulties ERA5 faces in accurately capturing wind conditions in complex coastal areas due to its coarse resolution. The validation against the ship-based lidar measurements shows a comparable performance of both datasets, with bias below ±0.2 m s−1 at heights between 90–170 m, with an overestimation by ASCAT and underestimation by ERA5. Both datasets show deteriorating performance with height, which is particularly notable in ASCAT profiles, with rapidly increasing biases above 170 m, peaking at around 0.5 m s−1 at 270 m."

Richter,Lagrangian aerosol particle trajectories in a cloud-free marine atmospheric boundary layer: implications for sampling,"Sea spray affects air–sea interaction, cloud microphysics, and the radiative budget. However, meteorological processes at the wind-gust level complicate the physical interpretation of measured aerosol particle properties. We used meter-scale models to track the life history of thousands of particles under different conditions to show that investigators must account for key factors to link observations at aircraft level to sea-spray emissions at the ocean's surface. 
 Meteorological processes such as gust fronts, roll structures, internal boundary-layer development and smaller-scale turbulence complicate the physical interpretation of measured aerosol particle properties, fluxes, and transport in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL). To better decipher maritime aerosol measurements by aircraft, ships, and towers we describe an ensemble of particle trajectories using high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of surface-emitted aerosol particle within a Lagrangian framework. We identified two clusters of particle trajectory types from which we created probabilistic distributions of particle histories: (a) short-lived particles that do not exit the surface layer and are subsequently deposited back to the ocean; and (b) much older particles that are able to exit the surface layer into the mixed layer and subsequently oscillate up and down through convective roll structures. After emission in a neutral atmosphere, particles slowly disperse through the MABL requiring, on average, up to 100 min to mix to the ∼ 570 m deep mixed-layer inversion. However, for even slightly unstable conditions, particles are rapidly transported to the top of the MABL in roll structure updrafts, where they then more slowly diffuse downwards, with some similarities to a looping plume rise to the stable inversion followed by fumigation. Consequently, particles can exhibit a bimodal lifetime distribution that results in different particle ages by altitude. Further, based on wind speed and stability, the initial looping behavior following an emission event spans 15 to 30 min and may result in sampling “blind spots” up to 15 km downwind. Overall, our findings suggest that there should be a consideration of the representativeness of particle ages, even in what is often assumed to be a well-mixed MABL. This representativeness is related to how long particles have been suspended and whether they were sourced locally, which is critical for situations such as for measuring wind-generated emissions or ship track plumes. Further, the Lagrangian technique for treating the particle transport captures the inherently random motion of the MABL turbulence and does not exhibit artificial numerical diffusion. As such, it produces differences when compared to a traditional, column-based eddy-diffusivity approach used in mesoscale to global scale models. We used the LES to drive a one-dimensional (1D) column model to approximate single grid point physics. The results were starkly different near the surface, with the 1D column model missing the looping behavior and showing a slow upward dispersion. This difference in the 1D and LES frameworks is an excellent example of subgrid problems and may explain some of the differences between observations and global and mesoscale model simulations of marine particle vertical distribution and dry scavenging."

Argyropoulou;Kalliopi Florou;Spyros N. Pandis,Continuous chemical characterization of ultrafine particulate matter (PM0.1),"Ultrafine particles (diameter of less than 100 nm) are suspected to cause significant health effects. Accurately measuring their chemical composition and physical properties in real time is challenging due to their low mass and interference from larger particles. This study proposes a method for the continuous, automated measurement of their composition, tested in a pilot field study to explore their chemical characteristics, physical properties, and sources. 
 Ultrafine particles (diameter of less than 100 nm) are primary suspects for enhanced negative health effects on humans. Measuring the chemical composition and physical properties of ultrafine particles online, continuously, and accurately is particularly challenging because of their typically low mass concentration (PM0.1) and susceptibility to interference from larger particles. The few past PM0.1 chemical composition measurement studies have used cascade impactors and at least a daily temporal resolution. In this study, we perform, for the first time, high-temporal-resolution measurements of the composition and sources of PM0.1 using an aerodynamic aerosol classifier (AAC) to separate PM0.1 from larger particles, integrated with other instruments. These include a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS, for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride), a single-particle soot photometer (SP2-XR, for black carbon), and an Xact625i (for elements).Ambient PM0.1 composition measurements were conducted in a suburban area in Greece to test the system. The hourly PM0.1 levels varied from 0.4 to 1.5 µg m−3, with an average of 0.7 µg m−3. Most of the PM0.1 (45 %) was organic aerosol (OA). On average, sulfates contributed 14 %, ammonium contributed 7 %, nitrate contributed 3 %, and black carbon contributed 4 % to PM0.1. Calcium (Ca) showed a surprising high average contribution to PM0.1 (18 %). The rest of the detected elements were Fe, K, Zn, and Ti, contributing 7 % together. Source apportionment analysis showed that most of the PM0.1 OA during this summertime period was oxygenated OA (90 %), with 70 % being less oxidized and 20 % being more oxidized, while only 10 % was fresh hydrocarbon-like OA."

 Plastic-covered greenhouse (PCG) is widely used in agricultural production due to its temperature control, water conservation, and wind protection characteristics, significantly enhancing crop yields and economic benefits. However, its long-term and extensive use can lead to environmental issues, such as the accumulation of local toxic gases and the degradation of soil physicochemical properties. Therefore, obtaining a comprehensive distribution of PCGs is essential. To monitor PCGs on a large scale, this study developed a novel approach for producing the first global 10 m PCG dataset (Global-PCG-10) with high-quality. Firstly, the globe was divided into multiple 5° grids, and grids for classification were organized based on global cropland layer. Then, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and initial labels of PCGs were obtained through Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create a training set for deep learning. Next, initial labels were optimized with the active learning strategy combined with the deep learning model, APC-Net. Finally, the PCG classification results were predicted, spatially analyzed, and compared with publicly released land use and land cover (LULC) datasets.

It covers key pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It reveals emissions’ long-term spatiotemporal trends and driving factors, such as population migration and economic growth, offering efficient control strategies. This dataset is crucial for air pollution and health impact studies. 
 Cooking emissions are a significant source of PM2.5, posing considerable public health risks due to their high toxicity and proximity to densely populated areas. Despite their importance, there is currently a lack of an accurate, long-term, high-resolution national cooking emission inventory in China, primarily due to the challenges of obtaining high-quality activity-level data over extended periods at fine spatial scales. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict activity levels and further estimate emissions.Specifically, we develop an ensemble model of machine learning algorithms – random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), and deep neural networks (DNNs) – to accurately predict cooking activity levels across Chinese counties based on statistical indicators related to population, economy, and the catering industry. The ensemble machine learning model demonstrates exceptional generalization and transferability (R2= 0.892–0.989), outperforming traditional statistical models and individual machine learning models. Unlike previous inventories that rely on simplistic proxy data such as population for calculation and downscaling, our inventory precisely calculates county-level cooking emissions, providing more accurate emission estimates and spatial distributions. Furthermore, we incorporate critical but previously missing toxic pollutants, such as ultrafine particles (UFPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into the national cooking emission inventory. Therefore, we develop China's first county-level cooking emission inventory, spanning 1990 to 2021, with high spatial resolution and wide pollutant coverage.According to our inventory, in 2021, China's total cooking emissions of organics in the full volatility range, PM2.5, UFPs, and PAHs are 997, 408 kt, 6.50 × 1025 particles, and 15.8 kt, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, emissions of these pollutants increased by over 65 %, and their spatiotemporal trends were affected to varying degrees by external factors, such as population migration, economic development, pollution control policies, and the pandemic in different periods. We further analyze the contribution patterns of key driving factors, such as urbanization rate, population, and pollution control, to emission changes. Notably, driver analysis reveals that existing control measures are insufficient to curb the rapid growth of emissions, necessitating enhanced controls. Regarding control strategies, our county-level inventory finds that 62.3 % of China's organic emissions are concentrated in 30 % of the counties, which are densely populated and occupy only 14.4 % of the national land area. Therefore, prioritizing control of these areas will be an efficient and targeted strategy. Our research provides crucial data and insights for understanding the impact of cooking emissions on air pollution and health, aiding in policy development. Our long-term, high-resolution emission datasets are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26085487 (Li et al., 2025)."

However, many global ET datasets overlook soil moisture constraints, causing large uncertainties. In this study, we developed an improved model that better captures the influence of soil moisture on vegetation and soil evaporation. Our model significantly improves ET estimation accuracy and provides a new long-term global ET dataset to support water cycle and climate research. 
 Accurately quantifying the impact of soil water availability on evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for improving ET retrieval accuracy. However, most global satellite-derived ET datasets do not explicitly incorporate soil moisture constraints, leading to significant uncertainties, particularly in water-limited regions. In this study, we propose an enhanced soil moisture constraint scheme that effectively captures soil moisture's influence on vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation using a quantile-based approach. Unlike previous methods, this scheme relies solely on soil moisture data, reducing uncertainties associated with heterogeneous soil hydraulic properties. We integrated this approach into the process-based land surface ET/heat fluxes algorithm (P-LSH, or P-LSHv1), developing an improved version, P-LSHv2. Using observations from 106 global flux towers, we calibrated biome- and climate-specific parameters and quantified moisture constraints across diverse climates and land cover types. P-LSHv2 achieves notable improvements in ET estimation, with a reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.67 mm d−1 and an increased Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.81, indicating strong agreement with flux tower observations. As a result of these improvements, P-LSHv2 outperforming its predecessor, P-LSHv1, particularly in arid regions. Comparative analyses show that P-LSHv2 surpasses the Penman-Monteith-Leuning model and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model in capturing soil moisture anomalies' effects on ET, enhancing global ET accuracy. Employing the P-LSHv2 algorithm, we have produced a long-term global daily ET dataset spanning 1982–2023, providing a valuable resource for research on terrestrial water and energy cycles and climate change.

It quantifies a relative distance between model output and reality, even though it is impossible to know the absolute distance from model predictions to reality. The relative ranking among models is based on concepts of model selection and multi-model averages previously developed for simple statistical models, but adapted here for ESMs. 
 Inferences in Earth system science rely to a large degree on the numerical output of multiple Earth System Models. It has been shown that for many variables of interest, the multi-model ensemble average often compares better with observations than the output from any one individual model. However, a simple arithmetic average does not reward or penalize models according to their ability to predict available observations, and for this reason, a weighted averaging approach would be preferred for those cases in which there is information on model performance. We propose an approach based on concepts from information theory with the aim to approximate the Kullback-Leibler distance between model output and unknown reality, and to assign weights to different models according to their relative likelihood of being the best-performing model in a given grid cell. This article presents the theory and describes the steps necessary for obtaining model weights in a general form, and presents an example for obtaining multi-model averages of carbon fluxes from models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP6. Using this approach, we propose a multi-model ensemble of land-atmosphere carbon exchange that could be used for inferring long-term carbon balances with much reduced uncertainties in comparison to the multi-model arithmetic average."

Averages longer than 1 Myr are required to lower the standard deviation of the average to 10% of the natural variability.

We measured water level fluctuations at two microtidal marshes in Chesapeake Bay to evaluate how this assumption misrepresents hydrological stress and marsh vulnerability. Tidal attenuation reduced water level fluctuations from 60 cm at tidal creeks to 20–30 cm in deteriorating interior marsh and caused increasing hydrological sensitivity to elevation loss. Poor drainage of interior marsh zones led to consistently higher water levels and slower recession at low tide. Consequently, hydroperiod and soil saturation in interior marshes were underestimated by 10%–62%, while plant performance was overestimated by 10%–25%. These biases suggest that future models must incorporate spatially decreasing tidal range and increasing baseline water levels from marsh edge to interior to improve predictions of marsh resilience under SLR."

We found that both increased Ptotal and decreased Pfreq delayed EOS, with the effect of reduced Pfreq likely mediated through increased maximum temperature and elevated soil moisture resulting from higher precipitation intensity. We further developed a process‐based autumn phenology model that incorporated the effect of Pfreq, which significantly improved model performance.

 The art of kirigami allows programming a sheet to deform into a particular manner with a pattern of cuts, endowing it with exotic mechanical properties and behaviours1–17. Here we program discs to deform into stably falling parachutes as they deploy under fluid–structure interaction. Parachutes are expensive and delicate to manufacture, which limits their use for humanitarian airdrops or drone delivery. Laser cutting a closed-loop kirigami pattern18 in a disc induces porosity and flexibility into an easily fabricated parachute. By performing wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations using a custom flow-induced reconfiguration model19, we develop a design tool to realize kirigami-inspired parachutes. Guided by these results, we fabricate parachutes from the centimetre to the metre scale and test them in realistic conditions. We show that at low load-to-area ratios, kirigami-inspired parachutes exhibit a comparable terminal velocity to conventional ones. However, unlike conventional parachutes that require a gliding angle for vertical stability20 and fall at random far from a target, our kirigami-inspired parachutes always fall near the target, regardless of their initial release angle. These kinds of parachutes could limit material losses during airdropping as well as decrease manufacturing costs and complexity.

 The primary driver of type I diabetes is the autoimmune T cells that destroy insulin-producing β-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas1. Pancreatic islet macrophages have also been variably linked to disease onset and progression. As macrophage-mediated removal of dying cells through efferocytosis regulates tissue homeostasis and immune responses2, here we investigated how efferocytosis by intra-islet macrophages influences the immune environment of pancreatic islets. Using a series of complementary omics-based and functional approaches, we identify a subset of anti-inflammatory intra-islet efferocytic macrophages (e-Mac) within the pancreas of mice and humans. When limited β-cell apoptosis is induced in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and diabetic-prone NOD mice, islet macrophages adopt this e-Mac phenotype without an apparent increase in the total numbers of intra-islet macrophages. Such limited β-cell apoptosis and increase in e-Mac numbers led to long-term suppression of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. This e-Mac phenotype could also be recapitulated ex vivo by co-culturing macrophages with apoptotic β-cells. Mechanistically, the e-Mac-enriched populations imparted an anergic-like state on CD4+ T cells ex vivo and promoted accumulation of such anergic-like CD4+ T cells in vivo within the islets. Analysing macrophage–T cell interactions within pancreatic islets using NicheNet and targeted experimental validation, we identify the IGF-1–IGF1R axis as a contributor to the anergic-like T cell phenotype in the islets. Collectively, these data advance a concept that efferocytosis-associated reprogramming of the islet macrophages and the subsequent influence on the adaptive immune response could be beneficial in modulating diabetic autoimmunity. Enrichment for efferocytic macrophages in the islets of Langerhans promotes the accumulation of anergic-like CD4+ T cells and dampens autoimmune diabetes."

 A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter their cellular composition in response to dietary cues1–8. The mammalian small intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ+ T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22 signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the response, and mice with CD8αβ+ T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ+ T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8+ T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.

 In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is the first line of defence against antimicrobial agents and immunological attacks1. A key part of outer membrane biogenesis is the insertion of outer membrane proteins by the β-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM)2–4. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a member of the Bacteroidota, a phylum that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum. For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota.

At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits8 but can also potentially enhance9 sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor. Our approach uses time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering10 in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. We observe that optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo11,12. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opportunities for practical entanglement-enhanced quantum sensing. The experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor is reported."

 Metabolism enables life to sustain dynamics and to repeatedly interact with the environment by storing and consuming chemical energy. A major challenge for artificial molecular machines is to find a universal energy source akin to ATP for biological organisms and electricity for electromechanical machines. More than 20 years ago, DNA was first used as fuel to drive nanomechanical devices1,2 and catalytic reactions3. However, each system requires distinct fuel sequences, preventing DNA alone from becoming a universal energy source. Despite extensive efforts4, we still lack an ATP-like or electricity-like power supply to sustain diverse molecular machines. Here we show that heat can restore enzyme-free DNA circuits from equilibrium to out-of-equilibrium states. During heating and cooling, nucleic acids with strong secondary structures reach kinetically trapped states5,6, providing energy for subsequent computation. We demonstrate that complex logic circuits and neural networks, involving more than 200 distinct molecular species, can respond to a temperature ramp and recharge within minutes, allowing at least 16 rounds of computation with varying sequential inputs. Our strategy enables diverse systems to be powered by the same energy source without problematic waste build-up, thereby ensuring consistent performance over time. This scalable approach supports the sustained operation of enzyme-free molecular circuits and opens opportunities for advanced autonomous behaviours, such as iterative computation and unsupervised learning in artificial chemical systems. Heat recharges enzyme-free DNA circuits, enabling complex logic operations and neural networks to perform multiple computations, offering a universal energy source for molecular machines and advancing autonomous behaviours in artificial chemical systems."

 The ‘silent pandemic’ caused by antimicrobial resistance requires innovative therapeutic approaches. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the most transformative and safe drugs in oncology1 and autoimmunity2, are rarely used for infectious diseases and not yet used for antimicrobial resistance3. Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and pandrug-resistant lineage that is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the KL64 capsule and the O-antigen. However, although mAbs displayed bactericidal activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were protective against fulminant bloodstream infection by ST147 and two geographically and genetically distant carbapenem-resistant KL64-bearing K. pneumoniae. Protection observed in vivo correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study thus describes a mAb that protects against pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and provides a strategy to isolate mAbs and identify mAbs that confer protection against bacteria with antimicrobial resistance.

 Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges in early childhood1,2, many autistic people are diagnosed later in life3–5. It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated (rg = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism. A study of several longitudinal birth cohorts and cross-sectional cohorts finds only moderate overlap in genetic variants between autism that is diagnosed earlier and that diagnosed later, so they may represent aetiologically different conditions."

 Emergence of drug resistance is the main cause of therapeutic failure in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)1. To study drug resistance in patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome sequencing2 with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers, enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis. Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data3 indicated pre-existing and clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome. Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies.

 The application of biocatalysis in synthesis has the potential to offer streamlined routes towards target molecules1, tunable catalyst-controlled selectivity2, as well as processes with improved sustainability3. Despite these advantages, biocatalysis is often a high-risk strategy to implement, as identifying an enzyme capable of performing chemistry on a specific intermediate required for a synthesis can be a roadblock that requires extensive screening of enzymes and protein engineering to overcome4. Strategies for predicting which enzyme and small molecule are compatible have been hindered by the lack of well-studied biocatalytic reaction datasets5. The underexploration of connections between chemical and protein sequence space constrains navigation between these two landscapes. Here we report a two-phase effort relying on high-throughput experimentation to populate connections between productive substrate and enzyme pairs and the subsequent development of a tool, CATNIP, for predicting compatible α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)/Fe(ii)-dependent enzymes for a given substrate or, conversely, for ranking potential substrates for a given α-KG/Fe(ii)-dependent enzyme sequence. We anticipate that our approach can be readily expanded to further enzyme and transformation classes and will derisk the investigation and application of biocatalytic methods.

 Squamates (lizards and snakes) comprise almost 12,000 living species, with wide ecological diversity and a crown group that originated around 190 million years ago1,2. Conflict between morphology and molecular phylogenies indicates a complex pattern of anatomical transformations during early squamate evolution, which remains poorly understood owing to the scarcity of early fossil taxa1,3. Here we present Breugnathair elgolensis gen. et sp. nov., based on a new skeleton from the Middle Jurassic epoch (167 million years ago) of Scotland, which is among the oldest relatively complete fossil squamates. Breugnathair is placed in a new family, Parviraptoridae, an enigmatic group with potential importance for snake origins, that was previously known from very incomplete remains. It displays a mosaic of anatomical traits that is not present in living groups, with head and body proportions similar to varanids (monitor lizards) and snake-like features of the teeth and jaws, alongside primitive traits shared with early-diverging groups such as gekkotans. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple datasets return conflicting results, with parviraptorids either as early toxicoferans (and potentially stem snakes) or as stem squamates that convergently evolved snake-like dental and mandibular traits related to feeding. These findings indicate high levels of homoplasy and experimentation during the initial radiation of squamates and highlight the potential importance of convergent morphological transformations during deep evolutionary divergences.

 The doughnut-shaped framework of social and planetary boundaries (the ‘Doughnut’) provides a concise visual assessment of progress towards the goal of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet1–3. Here we present a renewed Doughnut framework with a revised set of 35 indicators that monitor trends in social deprivation and ecological overshoot over the 2000–2022 period. Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall.

 Stem cell-based human embryo models offer a unique opportunity for functional studies of the human-specific features of development. Here we genetically and epigenetically manipulate human blastoids, a 3D embryo model of the blastocyst1, to investigate the functional effect of HERVK LTR5Hs, a hominoid-specific endogenous retrovirus, on pre-implantation development. We uncover a pervasive cis-regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids. Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism. Despite mediating recruitment of TRIM28, at many of these promoters ZNF729 acts as a transcriptional activator.

Morehouse,The Panoptes system uses decoy cyclic nucleotides to defend against phage,"The Panoptes antiphage system defends bacteria by detecting phage-encoded counter-defences that sequester cyclic nucleotide signals, triggering membrane disruption and highlighting a broader strategy of sensing immune evasion through second-messenger surveillance. 
 Bacteria combat phage infection using antiphage systems and many systems generate nucleotide-derived second messengers upon infection that activate effector proteins to mediate immunity1. Phages respond with counter-defences that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE, wherein OptS is predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide products, including 2′,3′-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-c-di-AMP), which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ‘sponge’ that antagonizes second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus. The Panoptes antiphage system defends bacteria by detecting phage-encoded counter-defences that sequester cyclic nucleotide signals, triggering membrane disruption and highlighting a broader strategy of sensing immune evasion through second-messenger surveillance."

Doudna,A miniature CRISPR–Cas10 enzyme confers immunity by inhibitory signalling,"Panoptes, an anti-phage defence system against virus-mediated immune suppression, is revealed. 
 Microbial and viral co-evolution has created immunity mechanisms involving oligonucleotide signalling that share mechanistic features with human antiviral systems1. In these pathways, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling systems (CBASSs) and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response2–4. Here, in an unexpected inversion of this process, we show that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that represses a toxic effector. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing the spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TMβ. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TMβ-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse.

 Remote epitaxy, in which an epitaxial relation is established between a film and a substrate through remote interactions, enables the development of high-quality single crystalline epilayers and their transfer to and integration with other technologically crucial substates1,2. It is commonly believed that in remote epitaxy, the distance within which the remote interaction can play a leading part in the epitaxial process is less than 1 nm, as the atomically resolved fluctuating electric potential decays very rapidly to a negligible value after a few atomic distances3. Here we show that it is possible to achieve remote epitaxy when the epilayer–substrate distance is as large as 2–7 nm. We experimentally demonstrate long-distance remote epitaxy of CsPbBr3 film on an NaCl substrate, KCl film on a KCl substrate and ZnO microrods on GaN, and show that a dislocation in the GaN substrate exists immediately below every remotely epitaxial ZnO microrod. These findings indicate that remote epitaxy could be designed and engineered by means of harnessing defect-mediated long-distance remote interactions. Experimental evidence demonstrates long-distance remote epitaxial interactions of thin films even through thick amorphous carbon buffer layers and shows that these can be induced through dislocations in the substrate."

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons. Neuroinflammation is apparent in affected tissues, including increased T cell infiltration and activation of microglia, particularly in the spinal cord1,2. Autoimmune responses are thought to have a key role in ALS pathology, and it is hypothesized that T cells contribute to the rapid loss of neurons during disease progression3,4. However, until now there has been no reported target for such an autoimmune response. Here we show that ALS is associated with recognition of the C9orf72 antigen, and we map the specific epitopes that are recognized. We show that these responses are mediated by CD4+ T cells that preferentially release IL-5 and IL-10, and that IL-10-mediated T cell responses are significantly greater in donors who have a longer predicted survival time. Our results reinforce the previous hypothesis that neuroinflammation has an important role in ALS disease progression, possibly because of a disrupted balance of inflammatory and counter-inflammatory T cell responses4. These findings highlight the potential of therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing regulatory T cells5, and identify a key target for antigen-specific T cell responses that could enable precision therapeutics in ALS. An analysis of T cell responses in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis shows that the C9orf72 antigen is a key target of autoimmune responses in the disease, and identifies C9orf72 epitopes that are recognized."

Yao,Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond,"An ensemble of spins from nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamonds is prepared in a spin-squeezed state. 
 Spin-squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement1–7. These squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals8–16. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. Here we report the experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly interacting ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (−0.50 ± 0.13 dB) below the noise of uncorrelated spins is generated by the native magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between nitrogen–vacancy centres. To generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome several challenges. First, we develop an approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids. An ensemble of spins from nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamonds is prepared in a spin-squeezed state."

 There is rising concern that several parts of the Earth system may abruptly transition to alternative stable states in response to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. Key candidates of such tipping elements include the Greenland Ice Sheet, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the South American monsoon system and the Amazon rainforest. Owing to the complex dynamics and feedbacks between them via oceanic and atmospheric coupling, the levels of anthropogenic forcing at which transitions to alternative states can be expected remain uncertain. Here we demonstrate how such interactions can generate spurious signals and potentially mask genuine signs of destabilization. We further review and present observation-based evidence that the stability of these four tipping elements has declined in recent decades, suggesting that they have moved towards their critical thresholds, which may be crossed within the range of unmitigated anthropogenic warming. Our results call for better monitoring of these tipping elements and for increased efforts to stop greenhouse gas emissions and land-use change.

 The stark contrast between the Moon’s nearside and farside in topography, volcanic activity and crustal structure provides critical insights into lunar formation and evolution. However, the absence of farside samples has long limited the investigations into the mechanisms driving this hemispherical asymmetry. The Chinese Chang’e-6 mission recently returned the first rock samples from the lunar farside, offering a unique opportunity to probe its volcanic processes and thermal history. Here we investigate the petrology and geochemistry of the returned lunar basalt fragments. The farside Chang’e-6 basalts dated at 2.8 billion years ago (Ga) reveal that their mantle potential temperature is about 100 °C lower than those recorded by nearside basalts returned by the Apollo and Chang’e-5 missions. Geochemical modelling based on remote sensing data for the 2.8 Ga basalt unit at the Chang’e-6 landing site also yields a ~70 °C lower mantle potential temperature compared with a contemporaneous nearside basalt unit. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the lunar farside mantle was relatively colder than the nearside mantle, consistent with the hemispherical differences in crustal thickness and heat-producing element distribution, and provide constraints on the thermal evolution of the Moon and the origin of its global asymmetry. Basalt clasts returned by Chang’e-6 suggest a lunar farside mantle potential temperature that is approximately 100 °C cooler than the nearside mantle, according to a petrologic study combined with thermobarometric modelling and remote sensing data."

Here the authors show that hydrogen-bond adaptability allows spontaneous formation of twisted bilayer ice at magic angles in 2D confinement, establishing a new class of Moiré materials. 
 Twisted bilayer van der Waals materials have become a transformative framework for the design of quantum and electronic devices, yet their counterparts, the twisted bilayer non-van der Waals materials, remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the first molecular-dynamics simulation evidence of the spontaneous formation of twisted bilayer ice with moiré patterns. Unlike the twisted bilayer van der Waals materials which can be produced by manually twisting one monolayer relative to another, twisted-bilayer-ice formation hinges on the structural adaptability of hydrogen bonds to achieve thermodynamic stability. First-principles molecular-dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of the twisted bilayer ice with two different moiré patterns, one with commensurate twist angle of 21.8° and another 27.8°. A phase diagram illustrates the stability region of twisted bilayer ice, providing guidance for future experimental validation. This work not only expands the family of two-dimensional ices but also advances the notion of twisted bilayer hydrogen-bonding materials, thereby offering opportunities to investigate emergent properties and potential applications of twisted bilayer non-van der Waals materials.

Using a mouse model of epididymitis, here, the authors report on the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) under conditions of chronic inflammation, and show that TLSs sustain immune activation, contributing to anti-sperm autoantibody production and epididymal injury. 
 Gaps in knowledge about the epididymal mucosa contribute to the prevalent classification of male idiopathic infertility. Inflammatory triggers, such as infections and autoimmunity, can breach immune privilege, induce anti-sperm antibody (ASA) production, and impair fertility. However, the mechanisms governing ASA production are poorly characterized. Here, using a murine model of epididymitis induced by regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion, we show that the disruption of immunotolerance leads to chronic autoimmunity characterized by the presence of ASA, and distinct testicular and epididymal immune landscapes. These inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive subfertility. Treg depletion induces the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the epididymis, as indicated by the presence of B and T cell clusters, fibroblasts, and high endothelial venules. Similar autoantibody responses were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting conserved mechanisms. Thus, we provide an in-depth analysis of immune cell dynamics and TLS during epididymitis, offering insights for the development of precision-targeted therapies for fertility disorders, as well as the identification of new contraceptive strategies.

 Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are characterized by atypical brain maturation, including alterations in structural similarity between regions. Using structural MRI data from 195 healthy controls (HC) and 352 individuals with SSD, we construct individual Morphometric INverse Divergence (MIND) networks. Compared to HC, individuals with SSD mainly exhibit reduced structural similarity in the temporal, cingulate, and insular lobes, being more pronounced in individuals exhibiting a ‘poor’ clinical status (more impaired cognitive functioning and more severe symptomatology). These alterations are associated with cortical hierarchy and maturational events, locating MIND reductions in higher-order association areas that mature later. Finally, we map 46 neurobiological features onto MIND networks, revealing a high presence of neurotransmitters and astrocytes, along with decreased metabolism and microstructure, in regions with reduced similarity in SSD. These findings provide evidence on the complex interplay between structural similarity, maturational events, and the underlying neurobiology in determining clinical status of individuals with SSD.

Here, the authors show that disease-linked mutations remote from intramolecular OFF state interfaces can allosterically impair myosin autoinhibition 
 At the molecular level, clinical hypercontractility associated with many hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-causing mutations in β-cardiac myosin appears to be driven by their disruptive effect on the energy-conserving, folded-back ‘OFF’-state of myosin, which results in increased number of heads free to interact with actin and produce force. While many characterized mutations likely act by directly perturbing intramolecular interfaces stabilizing the OFF-state, others may function allosterically by altering conformational states of the myosin motor. We investigate two such allosteric HCM mutations, Y115H (Transducer) and E497D (Relay helix), which do not directly contact OFF-state interfaces. Biochemical analyses and high-resolution crystallography reveal that both mutations increase active myosin head availability likely by destabilizing the pre-powerstroke conformation required for OFF-state formation. We propose that destabilization of the folded-back state of myosin, either directly or allosterically, represents a common molecular mechanism underlying hypercontractility in HCM across a broader spectrum of pathogenic mutations than previously recognized.

 Intensive efforts have been made to enhance the weak piezoelectric coefficients of ferroelectric polymers for flexible and wearable devices.

 Whether today’s heavy metal pollution constitutes an unprecedented threat to biodiversity remains unresolved. Although evidence of metal enrichment exists for several deep-time biotic crises, direct causal links to extinction are lacking. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the relationship between elevated environmental heavy metal concentrations and biological responses, including malformations and extinctions, across marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Drawing on analogies from modern environments, we assess the role of heavy metal toxicity in past mass extinction events. While some studies implicate heavy metals as primary extinction drivers, shown for instance by sporomorphs malformations, others interpret these signals as post-extinction artifacts linked to organic matter decomposition. Our analysis highlights the influence of normalization methods, particularly sulfur-based approaches, and emphasizes the role of metal bioavailability as a key factor influencing biological effects. Further research is needed to clarify the role of heavy metals in Earth’s biotic history and ongoing environmental risks.

 Subsurface structure investigation on Mars is crucial for understanding its geological evolution and past hydrological conditions. Elysium Planitia (EP), located near the hypothesized ancient ocean shorelines, could contain clues for past water activity and paleoclimate. Here we present better-constrained subsurface models beneath InSight extending to ~800 m depth, obtained from joint inversion of seismic and seismoacoustic coupling data, and use the well-resolved subsurface structure to explore the lithological profile through rock physics models. The derived subsurface lithology agrees well with local geological context and exhibits a shallow 60-m-thick low-rigidity layer consistent with hydrated sedimentary materials. Despite possible contributions of aeolian and volcanic deposits, we favor the interpretation that the low-rigidity layer originated from fluvial activity in EP during the Hesperian or Hesperian-to-Amazonian epoch, as supported by adjacent paleo-shoreline morphology observations. These results hint at a period of warmer paleoclimate at low latitudes, possibly during high-obliquity phases of Mars’ rotational axis.

 Ecological and geomorphic theory assume longitudinal connectivity; here, we test whether these concepts apply in naturally disconnected paraglacial stream networks with lakes and coarse glacial sediment. We determined downstream hydraulic geometry relationships (DHG) for channel width; riparian vegetation was inventoried across process domains (rapids, flats, lakes) over 10 km in two northern Swedish catchments—one above and one below the former highest coastline (FHC). Below the FHC, finer sediment from marine/deltaic deposition may allow more stream self-adjustment. DHG relationships were weak overall, with large local width variation, but slightly stronger in the FHC-below catchment, where a lake-effect was found, with wider channels downstream of lakes. Riparian vegetation species density did not substantially increase downstream as in connected stream networks, and vegetation similarity between reaches was weakly related to distance, suggesting disrupted dispersal. These findings indicate that formerly glaciated catchments are highly fragmented, with local factors dominating geomorphic and ecological patterns.

 Earth’s only active carbonatite volcano Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania, is a peculiar endmember of volcanism in a young rift segment. Targeted by many petrological studies due to its effusive, cold carbonatite eruptions, its subsurface structure has only been recently explored using geophysical approaches. Here we use data from a short-term seismic deployment, to exploit coherent seismic signals in the frequency domain to detect, characterize and locate volcanic tremor. We show that narrow-band tremor is related to degassing and the ascent of carbonatite melt across the crust close to the Natron border fault, which was previously linked to the ascent of carbonatites. We further show how narrow-band and quasi-harmonic tremor partly alternate and interpret this as the interplay of deeper magmatic injections into a shallow reservoir which causes resonance. Our findings yield important implications on how physical properties, structures and dynamics of volcanic plumbing systems are linked to tremor signals.

 Climate conditions, in complex interrelations with other socioenvironmental, economic, political and cultural factors, significantly play a key role in shaping population density and movement. However, the impacts of climate change on global human migration remain poorly understood. This study assesses the sensitivity of international migration to climate change across 160 countries and regions, focusing on temperature-related climate indices. The results show that migration patterns are strongly influenced by a country’s baseline climate and economic conditions. Under global warming, countries in mid- to high-latitudes with lower baseline temperatures are projected to experience substantial increases in migration inflows, while low-latitude countries are likely to see rising migration outflows. This climate sensitivity is especially pronounced in higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) countries, whereas lower-GDP countries show little dependence on baseline climate. A simple predictive model based on projected changes in climate and GDP suggests that populations in low-GDP, low-latitude countries will face worsening conditions and increasing migration pressure by the end of the 21st century. The results underscore the growing influence of economic factors on migration and call for urgent integration of climate justice into migration policy to support vulnerable populations in a warming world.

 Catastrophic flooding has been noted to occur with greater frequency following deforestation, but limited observations have been available to test this connection over large spatial scales. Here we used the data of mega forest fires impacting a region of 25,000 km2 in Australia exhibiting rapid loss in forest canopy, where the runoff generation has been carefully observed with minimum anthropogenic influences for more than half a century. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of the forest canopy loss on large-scale fluvial flooding. A state-controlled hypothesis test, with the climate and watershed states controlled to enhance robustness, shows a statistically significant increase in annual maximum flows resulting from the forest loss treatment. The reasoning for this natural experiment is that the forest loss impact on the interception potential of forest canopy, fallen leaves, and root-zone soils in wide region could have a recognizable impact on the fluvial flood.

 The terrestrial biosphere plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by absorbing anthropogenic CO2. However, accurately quantifying the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), which is a key indicator for monitoring carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems, remains a major challenge. Widely used products from large-scale ecosystem models and atmospheric inversions operate at coarse resolutions (0.25° or greater), which hinders the ability to resolve the carbon dynamics of heterogeneous landscapes and poses a significant challenge to understanding the impact of climate and land-use changes. In this study, a remote sensing data-driven water‑carbon coupling model with the incorporation of terrestrial carbon cycle processes, Penman–Monteith–Leuning Version 2 Carbon (PMLV2C), is developed for estimating daily NEE over China at a 500 m resolution. The parameters of PML-V2C model were well calibrated against observations from 41 eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites across nine plant functional types (PFTs) over China, demonstrating a strong performance for daily NEE estimates (r = 0.71, RMSE = 1.85 g C m−2 day−1). The model is only slightly degraded when compared with independent global FLUXNET data across 157 sites, demonstrating its robustness and transferability across diverse climates and biomes. Applying the model from 2003 to 2020, our product revealed a significant enhancement of China's terrestrial carbon sink with an increasing trend of 0.041 Tg C yr−2 (p < 0.01). This enhancement was primarily driven by the increasing GPP from forests in Southern China, grasslands in Northern China, and croplands across the East and North China Plain. Our high-resolution, process-based NEE product driven by satellite data provides a new evaluation of the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration and land management policies, offering valuable insights for achieving national carbon neutrality goals."

 High-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for advancing earth science research. However, the scarcity of high-resolution data in specific non-visible spectral bands, such as short-wave infrared (SWIR) or thermal infrared (TIR), is challenge for various downstream tasks. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel cross-band super-resolution (CBSR) method. This method improves the spatial resolution of targeted bands, specifically SWIR, within remote sensing images, and the methodology was tested with multi-band data from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER). The approach involves training a neural network on high-resolution visible and near-infrared single-band data, then the trained model is applied to generate high-resolution SWIR imagery. Validation was conducted over the Duolong Cu–Au porphyry district using ASTER imagery, focusing on mapping hydrothermal alteration. Through Bayesian optimization, the model achieved optimal performance with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 43.17 dB, which is better than traditional methods. CBSR-reconstructed SWIR imagery, fused with principal component analysis, accurately delineated argillic alteration halos and ring structures. Furthermore, zero-shot transfer of the ASTER-trained model to Sentinel-2 imagery demonstrated the framework’s generalizability across sensor configurations. The proposed CBSR approach thus provides a robust, spectrally consistent mechanism for enhancing multi-resolution satellite data, with direct implications for mineral exploration, lithological mapping, and other domains reliant on high-fidelity SWIR information."

We determined their likely sources through concurrent DNA sequencing of airborne bacteria and fungi and found persistent mixtures of local and longer-range sources at all times. 
 The Arctic is warming at a rapid rate, with implications for microbial communities as the ecosystems change. Some microbes and biogenic materials can affect the persistence of long-lived mixed-phase clouds by serving as ice nucleating particles (INPs). The presence of INPs modulates the cloud phase, and long-term measurements are important to elucidate their seasonal sources and to predict future change. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in 2019–2020 provided the first year-long measurements of bioaerosols and INPs in the central Arctic, with 3 d filters for amplicon sequencing and cumulative INP concentrations from −5 to −30 °C. Here, we investigated the INP seasonal cycle and its relation to the seasonal cycle of bacteria and eukaryotes. INPs were greatly elevated and compositionally similar in summer, aligning with a greater prevalence of local bioaerosol sources, but, despite this, a diverse mixture of sources (marine and terrestrial) was present all times. A common broader Arctic INP population is hypothesized for much of the year by comparable coincident data collected in Svalbard and a sensitivity of both the INPs and bioaerosols to large-scale events."

We find significant changes in projected warming patterns and circulation changes under increased CO2 conditions. Our findings are supported by similar relationships across state-of-the-art climate models. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing clouds for predicting regional climate change impacts. 
 Stratocumulus clouds are thought to exert a strong positive radiative feedback on climate change, but recent analyses suggest that this feedback is widely under-represented in global climate models. To assess the broader implications of this model error for the simulated climate change responses, we investigate the impact of Pacific stratocumulus cloud feedback on projected warming patterns, equilibrium climate sensitivity and tropical atmospheric circulation under increased CO2 concentrations. Using the Community Earth System Model, with modifications to enhance low-cloud-cover sensitivity to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in Pacific stratocumulus regions, we find increased tropical SST variability and persistence, a higher equilibrium climate sensitivity, an enhanced east–west warming contrast across the tropical Pacific, and a stronger slowdown of the Walker circulation under 4×CO2 conditions. Our findings are supported by inter-model relationships across CMIP6 4×CO2 simulations. These results underscore the importance of accurately representing cloud feedback in climate models to predict future climate change impacts not only globally but also on a regional scale, such as warming patterns or circulation change."

We found that fungal spores are the main contributors to ice formation at warmer temperatures. These particles are released locally and vary with the weather. Our results also show that we know very little about which fungi can form ice in the atmosphere, highlighting a major gap in our understanding of how nature influences weather and climate. 
 Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) can influence weather and climate by acting as high-temperature ice nucleating particles (INPs), especially in clean, rural regions like the European sub-Arctic. However, the actual contribution to atmospheric ice nucleation and the exact identity of PBAPs serving as INPs remain poorly understood.Here, we present measurements of INPs and highly fluorescent aerosol particles (HFAPs) over the course of 1 year at the Pallas Atmosphere-Ecosystem Supersite in the Finnish sub-Arctic, aiming to determine whether PBAPs significantly contribute to atmospheric INPs and to identify which types do so. Our findings indicate that certain HFAPs are strongly influenced by meteorological variables, with high concentrations occurring when the station is within the atmospheric mixing layer, suggesting local biological sources. These HFAPs are the main contributors to high-temperature INPs, with an exceptionally strong correlation (r=0.94, p<0.0001) between HFAP concentrations and INPs active at −13.5 °C. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we combine INP and HFAP data with direct fungal spore counts and environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to determine the biological origins of HFAPs and INPs. The results suggest that most high-temperature INPs are likely fungal spores. eDNA analysis further reveals that airborne fungi are dominated by Basidiomycota and that only a small fraction of the detected fungal genera have, to date, been tested for ice nucleation activity (INA) according to the literature. Among those reported in the literature, most exhibit very low or no INA. This underscores the significant knowledge gap in our understanding of biological ice nucleation in the atmosphere."

The purpose of this dataset is to promote the three-dimensional studies of rain cell precipitation systems and to reveal the spatial and temporal variations in their scale, morphology, and intensity. 
 Understanding the characteristics of the rain cell, the most basic unit in the natural precipitation system, is helpful in improving the cognition of the precipitation system. In this study, based on the merged precipitation profile data, reflectance and infrared data, and microwave brightness temperature data observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR), visible and infrared scanner (VIRS) and TRMM microwave imager (TMI), rain cells were identified in the PR swath. For the identified valid rain cells, two fitting methods (the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) and the best fit ellipse (BFE)) were applied to fit the external frame. Then, the geometric and physical parameters of rain cells were also calculated. By analyzing the geometric parameters (length, width, height, and so on) and physical parameters (rain rate, visible reflectance and thermal infrared brightness temperature from cloud top, and microwave brightness temperature from cloud column) of two rain cells (weak rain cell and strong rain cell), the results indicate that the strong rain cell is filled with deep convective precipitation and has low thermal infrared brightness temperature at the cloud top, while the weak rain cell is mainly characterized by stratiform precipitation with low rain rate. Compared to the BFE method, the area of the external frame calculated by the MBR method is generally larger. The filling ratio of the BFE method is slightly higher than that of the MBR method. In general, the results indicate that the rain cell definition parameters using the two fitting methods are reasonable and intuitive.

It offers 9 d maps on a 25 km EASE-SL grid, from 2011 to 2023, covering areas south of 30° S. The product is accurate beyond 150 km from sea ice, with nearly zero bias and a ~0.22 STD. It tracks well seasonal and interannual changes and will contribute to the understanding of processes influenced by upper-ocean salinity, including ice formation/melt. 
 This paper presents a newly developed Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) product for the Southern Ocean (SO), derived from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) measurements by the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). The primary challenges in retrieving SSS from L-band brightness temperature (TB) measurements in the Southern Ocean include degraded sensitivity in cold waters, radiometric signal contamination near sea ice edges and low variability in SSS across the region. To address these challenges, significant improvements were made to the retrieval algorithms. The BEC SO SSS product v1.0 delivers 9 d SSS maps on a 25 km EASE-SL grid, generated daily. The time series spans from 1 February 2011, to 31 March 2023, with spatial coverage below 30° S (https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/15493, González-Gambau et al., 2023).The product shows high accuracy farther than 150 km from sea ice edges, with nearly zero bias and a standard deviation of 0.22 (compared to marine mammal data) and 0.25 (compared to TSG data from research vessels). Larger errors are observed within 150 km from the ice edges, due to residual sea-ice contamination and sampling-related errors in these dynamic areas. The product effectively captures seasonal and interannual variability, in line with the SOSE regional model. Although differences between satellite-derived and in situ salinity are more pronounced in these regions, the satellite product successfully reproduces the dynamics near ice edges.This product will significantly contribute to the understanding of processes influenced by upper-ocean salinity, including sea ice dynamics, particularly, the reduction of Antarctic sea ice extent and the opening of offshore polynyas."

Stappard;Jamie D. Wilson;Andrew Yool;Toby Tyrrell,NutGEnIE 1.0: nutrient cycle extensions to the cGEnIE  Earth system model to examine the long-term influence  of nutrients on oceanic primary production,"This research explores nutrient limitations in oceanic primary production. While traditional experiments identify the immediate limiting nutrient at specific locations, this study aims to identify the ultimate limiting nutrient (ULN), which governs long-term productivity. A mathematical model incorporating nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron nutrient cycles is used. The model's results are compared with ocean observational data to assess its effectiveness in investigating the ULN. 
 Understanding the nuances of the effects of nutrient limitation on oceanic primary production has been the focus of many bioassay experiments by oceanographers. A theme of these investigations is that they identify the currently limiting nutrient at a given location, or in other words they identify the proximate limiting nutrient (PLN). However, the ultimate limiting nutrient (ULN; the nutrient whose supply controls system productivity over extensive timescales) can be different from the PLN. Our motivation is to investigate the identity of the ULN. The ULN constrains oceanic primary production over extensive timescales and consequently overall ocean fertility. The rate of oceanic photosynthesis affects planetary oxygen and carbon dioxide, impacting climate. Understanding past ocean fertility is fundamental to understanding Earth system history and biological evolution.Investigations that have considered the ULN have often utilised box models for example the work of, Tyrrell (1999) and Lenton and Watson (2000). To facilitate investigation of the ULN the carbon-centric Grid Enabled Integrated Earth system model (cGEnIE) nutrient cycles have been extended to create NutGEnIE. NutGEnIE incorporates three open nutrients cycles nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron. The impacts of diazotrophs, capable of fixing nitrogen, are represented alongside those of other phytoplankton. NutGEnIE is capable of extended duration model simulations necessary to investigate the ULN while, at the same time, including iron as a potentially limiting nutrient. NutGEnIE is described here, with particular focus on the biogeochemical cycles of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus. Model results are compared to ocean observational data to assess the degree of realism. Model-data comparisons include physical properties, nutrient concentrations, and process rates (e.g., export and nitrogen fixation). The comparisons of NutGEnIE to ocean observational data are largely positive, suggesting that the dynamics of NutGEnIE are valid. The validations, allied to the ability to run an Earth System model with open nutrients cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron over extensive time periods supports the proposed use of NutGEnIE to revisit the question of the ULN for oceanic primary production."

 Chronic infections and cancer cause T cell dysfunction known as exhaustion. This cell state is caused by persistent antigen exposure, suboptimal co-stimulation and a plethora of hostile factors that dampen protective immunity and limit the efficacy of immunotherapies1–4. The mechanisms that underlie T cell exhaustion remain poorly understood. Here we analyse the proteome of CD8+ exhausted T (Tex) cells across multiple states of exhaustion in the context of both chronic viral infections and cancer. We show that there is a non-stochastic pathway-specific discordance between mRNA and protein dynamics between T effector (Teff) and Tex cells. We identify a distinct proteotoxic stress response (PSR) in Tex cells, which we term Tex-PSR. Contrary to canonical stress responses that induce a reduction in protein synthesis5,6, Tex-PSR involves an increase in global translation activity and an upregulation of specialized chaperone proteins. Tex-PSR is further characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and stress granules and an increase in autophagy-dominant protein catabolism. We establish that disruption of proteostasis alone can convert Teff cells to Tex cells, and we link Tex-PSR mechanistically to persistent AKT signalling. Finally, disruption of Tex-PSR-associated chaperones in CD8+ T cells improves cancer immunotherapy in preclinical models. Moreover, a high Tex-PSR in T cells from patients with cancer confers poor responses to clinical immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings indicate that Tex-PSR is a hallmark and a mechanistic driver of T cell exhaustion, which raises the possibility of targeting proteostasis pathways as an approach for cancer immunotherapy. A proteotoxic stress response specific to exhausted T cells, governed by AKT signaling and accompanied by increased protein translation, represents a mechanistic vulnerability and a new therapeutic target to improve cancer immunotherapies."

 During the Last Glacial Maximum (23,000 to 19,000 years ago), the Patagonian Ice Sheet covered the central chain of the Andes between 38 °S and 55 °S. The paleoclimatic evidence from Patagonia and New Zealand suggests that the maximum glacier expansion of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes was desynchronized with the Northern Hemisphere glacial history. Here we present numerical simulations of the Patagonian ice sheet throughout the Last Glacial Cycle. Our analysis suggests that the Patagonian ice sheet had two main periods of advance, during the Marine Isotope Stage 4 and late Marine Isotope Stage 3, experiencing inter-millennial scale variability. We show that the Patagonian Ice Sheet long-term evolution can be attributed to changes in the integrated summer insolation, which combines the summer duration and insolation intensity and has an obliquity-like periodicity. We further suggest that this metric also modulated the behaviour of glaciers over the entire Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.

 Copy number variations (CNVs), the gain or loss of genomic regions, are associated with disease, especially cancer. Single cell technologies offer new possibilities to capture within-sample heterogeneity of CNVs and identify subclones relevant for tumor progression and treatment outcome. Several computational tools have been developed to identify CNVs from scRNA-seq data. However, an independent benchmarking of them is lacking. Here, we evaluate six popular methods in their ability to correctly identify ground truth CNVs, euploid cells and subclonal structures in 21 scRNA-seq datasets. We discover dataset-specific factors influencing the performance, including dataset size, the number and type of CNVs in the sample and the choice of the reference dataset. Methods which include allelic information perform more robustly for large droplet-based datasets, but require higher runtime. Furthermore, the methods differ in their additional functionalities. We offer a benchmarking pipeline to identify the optimal method for new datasets, and improve methods’ performance.

 Conjointly activating metal and oxygen sites to trigger the adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen mechanisms coupled path holds promise for balancing activity and stability in oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, yet confronting great challenges. Herein, we develop Fe species and oxygen vacancies co-regulated Ni-(oxy)hydroxide from the deep reconstruction of Fe-Ni2P/NiMoO4 pre-catalyst achieving the adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen dual-path mechanism. Experimental details and theoretical calculation analysis reveal the enhanced adsorbate evolution mechanism kinetics at the Ni sites via the co-regulation of Fe species and oxygen vacancies, while the Fe incorporation activates the O sites with preferable adsorption free energy for lattice oxygen mechanism intermediates. Benefiting from the dual-path mechanism, the activated catalyst affords an ampere-scale current density of 1.0 A cm-2 at low overpotentials of 274.5 ± 4.2 and 299.1 ± 2.8 mV in alkaline freshwater and seawater, respectively, and maintains seawater electrocatalysis for 500 h in the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.

 Tectonic processes and astronomical cycles are key drivers of Earth’s climate and carbon systems. However, their interplay in shaping late Paleozoic climate variability remains poorly constrained. Here, we divide the late Paleozoic (~360–250 Ma) into three distinct tectonic phases based on full-plate tectonic reconstructions, geochemical datasets, and carbon cycle modeling, thereby elucidating how global sea levels and organic carbon burial responded to astronomically forced climate fluctuations under different tectonic phases. Our results show that intervals spanning ~360–330 Ma and ~280–250 Ma were characterized by elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and intensified tectonic activity, which coincided with heightened climate variability and reduced regularity in orbitally paced sea-level changes. In contrast, during ~330–280 Ma, multiple proxies indicate reduced tectonic forcing and lower CO2 concentrations, which were accompanied by more stable climate conditions and clearer expression of astronomical cycles. These conditions facilitated rhythmic deposition and widespread organic carbon burial.

 Although genome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, translating these findings to causal genes and their downstream mechanisms remains challenging. We performed trans expression quantitative trait locus (trans-eQTL) meta-analysis in 3734 lymphoblastoid cell line samples, identifying four robust loci that replicated in an independent multi-ethnic dataset of 682 individuals. The trans-eQTL signal at the ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18) locus colocalised with a GWAS signal for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). USP18 is a known negative regulator of interferon signalling and the SLE risk allele increased the expression of 50 interferon-inducible genes, suggesting that the risk allele impairs USP18’s ability to effectively limit the interferon response. Intriguingly, the USP18 trans-eQTL signal would not have been discovered in a meta-analysis of up to 43,301 whole blood samples, reaffirming the importance of capturing context-specific genetic effects for GWAS interpretation.

Moreover, direct use CO2 as the C1 source in the multicomponent alkene carbonylative couplings can be achieved under a tandem electro-thermo-catalysis, thus allowing us to rapidly and reliably construct unsymmetric ketones with ample scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Remarkably, our protocol encompasses a broader of polyhaloalkanes as the electrophiles, which underwent radical-relay couplings in a completely regio- and chemoselective fashion.

 We present the first systematic study on Arctic iceberg area retrieval from Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath SAR data. Our dataset contains 4014 Arctic icebergs in open water. To detect icebergs in Sentinel-1 images, we applied a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm. Icebergs were matched in co-located Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 acquisitions for a period from May to September in the years 2016 to 2023. The Sentinel-1 iceberg areas are moderately correlated with the Sentinel-2 reference areas, with Pearson’s r-values of 0.65 at HH- and 0.69 at HV-polarization. The CFAR algorithm mostly overestimates iceberg areas in both channels, but in some cases underestimates iceberg areas in the HV channel when the iceberg backscatter is low. The 10th and 90th percentiles of the relative error are -36% and +569% at HH-, and -37% and +349% at HV-polarization. In addition to a resolution-imposed size-dependency of the error, we find that the HH ocean clutter is moderately negatively correlated with the relative error (Pearson’s r-value: -0.64). Additionally, we observe weak correlations between the HH (HV) iceberg backscatter and the Sentinel-2 iceberg area, with a Pearson’s r-value of 0.34 (0.26). We utilize the analyzed relationships to predict iceberg areas from Sentinel-1 data, using a gradient boosting regression. Backscatter-sensitive retrieval models yield more accurate iceberg areas than backscatter-insensitive models. In the HH (HV) channel, the former models reduce the mean absolute error by 58% (49%). Backscatter-sensitive retrieval of iceberg areas will foster consistent SAR-based observations of Arctic iceberg areas during summer months. Future studies need to quantify the combined impact of iceberg area retrieval and iceberg detection performance on area distributions and total iceberg areas."

 Forests are the key component of terrestrial ecosystems, playing a vital role in the global carbon and water cycles as well as in climate change. Satellite remote sensing imagery has the advantage of quantitatively monitoring and assessing the health status of forest canopies at large scales. With the improvement in spatial resolution of satellite sensors, it has become feasible to conduct quantitative research at high spatial resolutions (< 10 m). However, classic physical models that are based on simplified assumptions and only account for the radiative transfer process within the target pixel face challenges in supporting quantitative analysis at high-resolution scales, as high-resolution pixels are subject to significant radiative influences from adjacent pixels. In this study, we propose a high-spatial resolution forest canopy reflectance model, APPLE-GO, which comprehensively considers the shading effect and cross-radiation caused by adjacent pixels. The two-dimensional path length distribution (2-PLD) method is used to calculate the area fractions of each component, while shading factors are introduced to quantitatively calculate the reductions in the area fractions of sunlit components due to adjacent pixels. Multiple scattering energy is calculated based on the spectral invariant theory and the eight-neighborhood convolution algorithm. The bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) calculated by the APPLE-GO model was evaluated against the three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer model LESS, yielding RMSEs/RRMSEs of 0.008/10.2 % and 0.054/15.9 % in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, respectively. The model was also validated with satellite observations, showing RMSEs below 0.01 (RRMSE <27 %) for larch forests and under 0.017 (RRMSE <35 %) for mixed forests in the visible bands. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately calculate the BRF in the nadir viewing direction, highlighting its potential for extracting vegetation parameters from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery."

 Large-drop heavy rainfall, defined as heavy rainfall (>10 mm h−1) with relatively large raindrop diameters and low number concentrations, has been known to occur mainly in continental deep convection based on previous ground-based studies. With spaceborne radar, global analysis of raindrop size has become possible, providing a unique opportunity to revisit this understanding. Using 10 years (2014–2023) of GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) observations, large-drop heavy rainfall events are classified into two types with a Gaussian Mixture Model based on storm height. The two resulting types—high storm height (HSH) and low storm height (LSH)—exhibit similar DSD characteristics but distinct structural and environmental properties in observations and reanalysis data. The HSH type is associated with continental deep convection under warm conditions favorable for collision–coalescence processes. In contrast, the LSH type features shallower storm structures in cold environments, with large drops likely formed by melting snow. Seasonal analyses show that HSH events occur mainly over continental regions in summer, whereas LSH events are mostly observed over midlatitude oceans in winter. For diurnal variation, HSH events exhibit a daytime peak, while LSH events show no diurnal cycle. Notably, more than half of the LSH events at midlatitudes are linked to extratropical cyclones.

 The geometric configuration of building rooftops considerably influences the lightning leader attachment process. However, observational and modeling studies on how rooftop geometries affect this process remain limited, particularly regarding the combined impacts of building height and lightning peak current on striking distances across diverse rooftop designs. To address this gap, a physics-based lightning strike model for tall buildings was developed based on an established three-dimensional variable grid upward leader initiation model. The model incorporated the attachment process between upward and downward leaders. Four representative rooftop geometries were systematically analyzed: flat-top, sloped roof, cuboid-tower, and cylindrical-tower configurations. The results revealed two critical trends: Qie et al. (2024) (1) Striking distances decrease as rooftop geometries approximate flat-top profiles, whereas rod-like configurations exhibit increased striking distances; Xiao et al. (2023) (2) For sloped roofs, those with a vertex angle exceeding 45° exhibit striking distance characteristics similar to flat-top structures under varying peak currents, whereas steeper slopes behave more like rod-type roofs. Empirical correlations between striking distance (D) and peak current (Ip) are derived for 100 m structures: D = 2.27 × IP0.92 (flat-top) and D = 4.29 × IP0.80 (rod-type). Furthermore, two universal patterns emerged: (a) Striking distances and upward leader lengths increase proportionally with building height across all geometries; (b) Rooftop geometry exerts a stronger influence on the attachment process at lower peak currents (20 kA), with diminishing effects at higher peak currents (60 kA). These findings provide quantitative guidelines for optimizing lightning protection systems in architecturally complex structures."

 A long-standing problem of all numerical weather predictions, regardless deterministic or ensemble, is the more accurate assessment in probability (or likelihood) for the predicted scenario to occur, especially at longer lead times due to typically larger errors. The rapid development of artificial intelligence today may offer an effective method to tackle this issue. In this study, a neural-network machine-learning model is developed to, after training, project the expected value of the similarity skill score (SSS) of predicted total rainfall distribution in Taiwan for westward-moving typhoons during their influence period, thus serving as an objective guidance for the quality of the prediction. Ten typhoons are included, and a total of 105 parameters linked to rainfall are used from time-lagged forecasts (out to 8 days) every 6 h by a cloud-resolving model, when they cover the entire influence period (inside 300 km from Taiwan) with enough lead time. For each typhoon, only data from the other nine cases are used to train the model.The results indicate that machine learning can capture the tendency of the actual SSS (calculated against observed rainfall) for most cases (eight out of ten), thereby informing the forecasters which quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are more trustworthy and which other ones are less so beforehand. Such guidance is particularly valuable at longer lead times, when the forecast uncertainty is relatively high. Thus, our results are highly encouraging. Nevertheless, if a typhoon behaves differently in forecasts from those that serve as the training data, the outcome would be less useful. Possible directions to remedy this issue and make further improvement are also offered."

The number of LSS systems is expected to continue to grow, and such expansion will require support from local communities that are asked to host new projects. Here, we perform a systematic literature review of studies that evaluate: (1) the factors that shape the perception, acceptance, and opposition of LSS; and (2) the role of stakeholders and community engagement in current LSS siting conflicts. Our review of the literature finds that local communities have complex, location-specific opinions and attitudes towards solar projects. Shaped by project characteristics such as size, land use type, and project ownership type, people value local benefits such as jobs, reduced pollution, increased tax revenue, and local ownership, and are critical of highly localized burdens such as impacts to the local landscape. We further find that scholars promote early and direct communication of potential benefits and tradeoffs, as well as an inclusive decision-making process and engagement activities that reflect community values and build trust. Our review reveals that further research is needed to investigate the roles and impacts of: (1) emerging LSS configurations such as solar plus storage hybrids and LSS projects paired with transmission and substation additions; (2) evolving LSS stakeholder groups including landowners, agricultural industry, and the media; and (3) causal relationships between public perceptions, community engagement activities, and project outcomes."

This study identified the potential source of nurdle pollution using a combination of chemical analysis and numerical modeling. Chemical data of the nurdles collected from over 70 sites from Houston to the Yucatán Peninsula during 2021–2024 revealed distinct patterns in polymer type, color distribution, and weathering status, providing strong evidence for Texas as the primary source of these nurdles. Color distribution results showed that white nurdles, representative of fresher nurdles, dominated the Texas sites and more weathered, yellow nurdles, were found in Mexico regions. This color trend suggests an increased surface degradation as nurdles move southward. Analysis through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows polyethylene (PE) as the dominant polymer across all sampled sites, showcasing a linked homogeny through the regions, and the data were further used to build chemical weathering indices, which provided a way of quantifying the degree of oxidation nurdles have undergone. Results showed that the Mexico nurdles had higher indices than those in Texas, reinforcing the hypothesis that the Mexico nurdles have undergone longer environmental exposure. Physical oceanographic modeling, incorporating wave and current dynamics, confirmed that nurdles released from Texas can be transported to Mexican coastlines, while nurdles released from Mexico do not reach deep into the US. shorelines due to strong prevalent downcoast currents along the inner shelf. This movement pattern, together with chemical and weathering evidence, strongly supports Texas as the primary source of nurdle pollution along the gulf coast.

As global warming continues, understanding the compound events (CEs) characterized by dry hazards is crucial especially in Asia, where dense populations heighten vulnerability. This study examines the intricate characteristics of 2023 compound heatwave, drought, and fire (CHDF) events in Asia by analyzing spatial and temporal patterns from 1960 to 2023 during the extended warm season (April–October). Results reveal that the 2023 CHDF notably diverged from historical trends, with heatwave-driven CEs exhibiting a four- to eightfold increase in spatial extent since 1980. The severity and duration of 2023 HDF reached return periods of approximately 23 and 40 years, respectively. In particular, urban cores in East and Southeast Asia emerged as hotspots for CHDF events, pointing to the influence of land transformation. Attribution analysis further highlights the dominant role of human-induced climate change in amplifying the likelihood of 2023-like CEs, with DF responding more modestly than heatwave-driven CEs. Projections under SSP245 suggest that 2023-level CHDF events may stabilize by the 2060s with mitigation, while SSP585 indicates continued escalation and earlier emergence (≈1–5 years). Findings from this study emphasize the growing risk of compound dry hazards and the pressing need for targeted mitigation efforts and adaptive strategies to reduce Asia’s vulnerability to climate extremes."

This allows study of both recent trends and projections for the first time in a consistent way. The observed hurricane intensification is simulated but underestimated.

Assessing agricultural areas impacted by soil salinity change is very important to support decision-makers or planners in sustainable land use planning. To overcome limitations in current spatial extrapolation methods for a reliable prediction of salinity trends across extensive river deltas, an advanced synthesis approach was developed with the use of machine learning (ML) particularly appropriate to account for a multitude of factors representing land cover conditions, processes, and interactions. This study aims to: (i) address the extrapolation challenge in ML-based soil salinity mapping, and (ii) predict land cover changes due to soil salinity. The Mekong River Delta (MRD) and Red River Delta (RRD) were selected as case studies. A hybrid ML approach and land change modeler were used to analyze 39 contributing factors. To resolve the spatial extrapolation issue in soil salinity monitoring, we used 109 salinity-affected locations in the MRD and 72 in the RRD. Land cover data from 2000 and 2023, along with salinity maps, were used to project the 2050 land cover. Multiple ML models were used to cross-verify and obtain robust results. All models achieved R2 scores above 0.85, with the best model exceeding 0.93, demonstrating high predictive performance. Among the models, XGR-particle swarm optimization achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.939), followed closely by XGR-fennec fox optimization, XGR-coati optimization algorithm (R2 = 0.932), and XGR-osprey optimization algorithm (R2 = 0.921), respectively, highlighting the robustness of optimization-enhanced XGBoost models. Future projections show that cropland will decline from 67% of the area (in 2000) to 64% (2023) and about 60% (2050) under the influence of salinity, with approximately 41 km2 of cropland converted to aquaculture by 2050, mostly in high-salinity coastal zones. This study develops a powerful synthesis framework to address the problem of spatial extrapolation challenges related to natural hazard mapping in general and soil salinity mapping in particular, based on ML and on accurate prediction of land cover/land use change under effects of soil salinity in the context of climate change. Results from the synthesis approach help accurately identify areas affected by salinity intrusion, useful for the development of effective solutions in space and time towards the goal of sustainable development."

Yet limited research explicitly measures community resilience to health risks of a changing environment. This review aimed to identify and assess the dimensions and indicators of community resilience frameworks for the health and wellbeing impacts of environmental and climate change. Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science), grey literature, and reference lists of included studies were systematically searched and screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria at the title and abstract level and then full-text, according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines. Charted data was analysed using qualitative and quantitative synthesis methods, with dimensions and indicators coded and re-categorised to identify core resilience components and their co-occurrence. Across the 8243 studies screened, 11 unique dimensions and 41 indicator categories of community resilience were identified. The most common dimensions were economic, community capacity, social, and institutional and political dimensions, with no frameworks including both health and environmental dimensions. Consensus on how to measure common dimensions was lacking and many of the indicators required for a comprehensive assessment of health-related community resilience were inconsistently or infrequently employed. Overall, the capacity of the frameworks to account for socially differentiated impacts across a community, as well as factors relating to health and wellbeing, culture, communication and information, and knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural practices, was insufficient. Findings highlight the need for further studies focused explicitly on health impacts and hazards to establish greater consensus on core dimensions and indicators, including under-represented components and their interconnections. This review makes a strong case that community resilience frameworks for the health impacts of climate change will require greater integration of environmental and health dimensions; factors that more accurately reflect public health interests and dynamics; and equity considerations for unique place-based contexts."

Following the educational intervention, participants demonstrated significant increases in self-reported CDR knowledge and more favourable risk-benefit assessments across all CDR technologies, with the largest gains for enhanced weathering and biochar. Qualitative analysis revealed that, rather than simple endorsement, education fostered more nuanced evaluation capabilities, with participants developing greater appreciation for both benefits and method-specific limitations. Notably, participants shifted away from technology-specific preferences and towards more portfolio-based thinking, recognizing the complementary roles of different CDR approaches. These findings suggest that informed engagement with CDR technologies produces sophisticated rather than uncritical assessment frameworks, with implications for how CDR communication and engagement strategies might be designed to support constructive public dialogue about these emerging technologies."

Next, we show that when one accounts for multiple wave frequencies and wave spatial variations, the amplitude and phase of the whistler wave can be described by the Ginzburg‐Landau equation (GLE), providing a framework for the investigation of solitary wave behavior of chorus modes.

As a dengue fever (DF) hotspot, Guangzhou lacks research on how extreme weather characteristics and spatial factors interact to shape DF patterns. This study analyzed DF distribution in Guangzhou from 2017 to 2019, using a zero‐inflated negative binomial spatial lag (ZINB‐SAR) regression model to assess the effects of daytime heatwaves (DHW), nighttime heatwaves (NHW) and extreme precipitation (EP) on DF. Results revealed that DF cases were predominantly clustered in central urban areas, with an epidemic season from May to November. The ZINB‐SAR model outperformed negative binomial regression and spatial econometric models, with all spatial effect coefficients significantly positive. Analysis of lagged effects showed that each additional DHW event increased DF cases by up to 10.80% (95% CI: 6.22%–15.59%) at a 2‐month lag, while NHW events increased DF by 2.73% (95% CI: −1.59%–7.23%). Threshold analysis indicated DHW intensity shifted from promoting to inhibiting DF between 0.66°C and 0.76°C, while NHW intensity transitioned between 0.95°C and 2.28°C. EP demonstrated the strongest effects at a 3‐month lag, increasing DF cases by 12.05% (95% CI: 9.03%–15.17%), although its intensity was not statistically significant. Seasonal and spatial variations in DF incidence were evident. In conclusion, DHW and EP impacts were primarily driven by event frequency rather than intensity, whereas NHW effects were more dependent on intensity. These findings highlight the complex spatiotemporal interplay between extreme weather and DF in Guangzhou, providing critical evidence for developing targeted climate‐adaptive disease control strategies."

 Monolayer amorphous carbon (a-C), an atom-thin two-dimensional (2D) carbon amorphous material, has attracted significant attention due to its structural and transport properties. Here, we report a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach for directly synthesizing monolayer a-C films on insulating substrates, achieving high control over their size, thickness, and fabrication. The synthesized films exhibit a complete coverage over a 2-inch wafer, with high uniformity. Our theoretical analysis reveals the critical role of tellurium in promoting the growth of monolayer a-C on the substrate. Moreover, quantum tunneling measurements at liquid helium temperature were conducted on the a-C films, confirming the samples’ homogeneity and their insulating behavior. This work provides a promising strategy for direct synthesis of atom-thin insulating amorphous materials and deepens our understanding of quantum phenomena and electronic properties in low-dimensional disordered materials.

 Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystals. Here we report the observation of multiple time crystals in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gases, in which continuous time crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals and high-harmonic time crystals are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation.

Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.

The compound reduced fibril formation by approximately 75%, providing insights relevant to Alzheimer’s drug development. 
 Alzheimer’s disease is a specific neurodegenerative disorder, distinct from normal aging, with a growing unmet medical need. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, primarily consisting of amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils. Therapeutic antibodies can slow down the disease, but are associated with potential severe side effects, motivating the development of small molecules to halt disease progression. This study investigates the interaction between the clinical drug candidate small molecule anle138b and lipidic Aβ₄₀ fibrils of type 1 (L1). L1 fibrils were previously shown to closely resemble fibrils from Alzheimer’s patients. Using high-resolution structural biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that anle138b selectively binds to a cavity within the fibril. This structural insight provides a deeper understanding of a potential drug-binding mechanism at the atomic level and may inform the development of therapies and diagnostic approaches. In addition, anle138b reduces fibril formation in the presence of lipids by approximately 75%. This may suggest a mechanistic connection to its previously reported activity in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease. This study characterizes the interaction between the clinical candidate anle138b and Aβ₄₀ fibrils in a lipid environment. The compound reduced fibril formation by approximately 75%, providing insights relevant to Alzheimer’s drug development."

 Metronomic photodynamic therapy is a long-term, low-dose treatment strategy that employs optical devices with continuous photosensitizer administration and requires stable device attachment with a consistent power source. These factors significantly limit patient mobility. Currently, no metronomic photodynamic therapy modality can operate independent of external devices, underscoring the critical need for in vivo light sources that function without external energy inputs. In this study, we integrate self-luminous bacteria with a photosensitizer in alginate microcapsules to create a self-driven metronomic photodynamic therapy that can be securely implanted within a tumour, thereby enabling continuous light emission without requiring an external energy source or ongoing replenishment of photosensitive reactants. By harnessing nutrients from the tumour microenvironment, this system sustains the generation of reactive oxygen species. A single injection effectively eliminates larger tumours (>300 mm3) in an opaque melanoma mouse model and transplanted hepatocarcinoma rabbit model. Self-driven metronomic photodynamic therapy demonstrates advantages over traditional photodynamic therapy, indicating its potential as a versatile therapeutic approach for cancer treatment with deeply situated lesions.

 Conservation benefits from dietary change are commonly assessed without accounting for different conservation objectives. By representing fine-scale habitat and landscape change within a dynamic land-system model, we assess how a partial or full transition to healthier diets would affect indicators across the ‘Nature for Nature’ and ‘Nature for Society’ conservation value perspectives. We find that most diet-related conservation benefits are already achieved by a partial shift to healthier diets. This is because, particularly in many countries in tropical Africa and Asia, adopting healthier diets would mainly involve substituting staple foods with more varied plant-based foods rather than replacing resource-intensive livestock products. Conservation action in line with the Global Biodiversity Framework, by contrast, most consistently improves outcomes across both value perspectives, even under current demand trends, showing that spatial planning is central for decoupling conservation outcomes from food demand. However, any progress towards healthier diets not only lowers greenhouse gas emissions but also reduces barriers to effective conservation, such as higher food prices and imports. This study examines the outcomes of dietary shifts across intrinsic and instrumental conservation perspectives, finding that most conservation benefits already come from a partial shift to healthier, more plant-based diets, whereas greater benefits depend on more targeted conservation action."

 Livestock are vital for global food security, but are a significant source of methane, a greenhouse gas. Breeding for highly efficient nitrogen utilization and lower emissions is therefore a key goal for sustainable agriculture. Here we compared these traits across wild, indigenous, crossbred, and improved bovines via an extensive meta-analysis, supplemented with measurements of 150 yaks. Our results revealed that indigenous bovine produce less methane and have lower urinary nitrogen loss than improved breeds, indicating superior feed conversion and nitrogen efficiency. Notably, crossbreeds also produce significantly less methane, revealing a hybrid advantage for sustainable breeding. Furthermore, our direct measurements showed that methane emissions from yaks were 39% lower than predicted by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier2 models, a pattern of overestimation also evident in other indigenous bovines. These findings reveal that well-adapted indigenous breeds are crucial genetic resources, highlighting the need for breed-specific data to guide global mitigation efforts.

 Marine authigenic carbonates are considered a major long-term carbon sink, yet the role of silicate weathering in their formation remains unclear. Here we use lithium isotope compositions of authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Mexico to trace the coupling between silicate weathering and carbonate authigenesis in marine sediment. In contrast to the positive δ7Licarb values in seep carbonates formed near the seafloor, carbonates originating from organoclastic sulphate reduction in deeper burial settings exhibit negative δ7Licarb values (−6.6‰ to −1.2‰). Calculated δ7Lifluid values (−4‰ to +1.4‰) in pore fluids closely match the δ7Lisilicate values of the silicate component in the rocks, suggesting congruent silicate weathering is approached. A positive correlation between δ7Lifluid and δ13Ccarb values indicates organoclastic sulphate reduction enhances silicate weathering, which together promote carbonate authigenesis in anoxic sediments.

 Understanding drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and stocks is critical for carbon (C) neutrality in Earth’s extensive dryland croplands. Here, we analyzed 721 soil samples across northern China and revealed divergent regional dynamics of SOC stocks in topsoil (0–20 cm) over three decades. Agricultural intensification in northern China, marked by tripled productivity via strategic N-fertilization and policy-driven increases in straw return, created a major C sink (+3.1 Mg C ha−1), offsetting ~1.5% of China’s average annual emissions. Conversely, Northeast China experienced SOC depletion (−3.9 Mg C ha−1; ~12% loss since 1980s) driven by warming-enhanced decomposition of organic matter. Encouragingly, an annual straw return in excess of 270 kg C ha−1 could offset SOC losses in the face of future warming. Therefore, it is imperative to implement effective soil management practices and adaptation strategies to bolster soil resilience and health, as continued climate warming may undermine soil carbon sequestration.

 We developed a Time-series-based Image Fusion (TIF) algorithm to generate 10-m surface reflectance time series by synthesizing Landsats 8/9 and Sentinel-2 A/B data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on image pairs or thematic maps, TIF extracts all valid pixel-level observation pairs across time to build per-pixel linear regression models. This approach captures the spectral relationships between sensors while accounting for land surface dynamics. A temporal weighting scheme and an iterative refinement strategy improves the fusion process, yielding reusable coefficients that support efficient, scalable 10-m time-series generation. TIF was applied to all Landsat multispectral bands, using native 10-m Sentinel-2 bands (Blue, Green, Red) and resampled bands (NIR and SWIR1/2) for visual assessment, with quantitative accuracy evaluated at the original Sentinel-2 resolutions. Experiments across five U.S. sites show TIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like STARFM, FSDAF 2.0, Sen2Like, and ESRCNN. For instance, TIF demonstrated a reduction in RMSE by 24 % and an increase in SSIM by 6 % compared to FSDAF 2.0 and ESRCNN, and outclassed STARFM and Sen2Like, which showed weaker results across all metrics. In multi-date change detection, TIF-predicted images achieved a mean F1 score of 0.70 and a mean disagreement rate of 0.05 against reference maps. TIF offers a potential practical and efficient pathway for creating 10-m versions of NASA's HLS products, opening new opportunities for fine-scale, time-sensitive Earth observations."

 The cooling effect generated by urban green space (UGS) plays a vital role in mitigating heat waves and enhancing citizen well-being. However, long-term studies examining the evolution of cooling effect alongside rapid urbanization-induced UGS changes remain scarce. Focusing on Beijing, China, this study quantifies the spatiotemporal changes in UGS cooling effects and identifies their key two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) drivers over nearly four decades (1985–2023). We innovatively proposed three distinct cooling intensity (CI) indicators for spatially explicit analysis and employed both stepwise regression analysis and machine learning models. Key findings include: (1) Beijing’s UGS coverage exhibited an overall slight decline, yet its spatial distribution became more balanced. The proportion of grids with UGS coverage below 20 % decreased significantly, from 8 % in 1985 to less than 1 % in 2023. (2) The perceived trend in cooling effect strength (strengthening vs. weakening) critically depended on the CI indicator used. The traditional CI (temperature difference between UGS and surroundings) showed a continuous decrease from 2.65 °C in 1985 to 1.83 °C in 2023. Conversely, regression model slopes indicated that a 10 % increase in UGS coverage yielded a stronger cooling effect in recent years, despite declining model R2 values. Additionally, nearly 32 % of the study area exhibited an increase in outside CI of at least 0.5 °C, indicating a strengthening trend in the cooling effect. (3) Both statistical and machine learning analyses consistently identified the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the dominant driver, explaining over 50 % of CI variations. Landscape metrics and 3D UGS features contributed 38 % and 10 %, respectively. Combining all 2D and 3D characteristics explained over 70 % of CI variations, with NDVI, mean vegetation height, and aggregation index (AI) being the top three positively influential features."

 Understanding pollution, source and effect of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) is crucial for improving air quality in urban suburbs. This study utilized a proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole mass spectrometer to investigate OVOC pollution characteristics and environmental impacts across four seasons (2022–2023) in an urban suburb of Guangzhou. Results showed that OVOCs dominated total VOCs (averaging 75.4 %), with methanol, acetone, formaldehyde, and carboxylic acids as predominant species. These compounds significantly contributed to ozone formation potential (40.6 %–60.3 %) and OH reactivity. OVOC concentrations exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern (spring > autumn > winter > summer), influenced by photochemical processes and regional transport. Diurnal variations indicated that methanol peaked in the morning and evening linked to primary emissions, while aldehydes and ketones peaked in the afternoon due to secondary formation. Carboxylic acids displayed complex multi-peak patterns with significant nighttime accumulation, correlating with PM2.5 and suggesting a key role in secondary organic aerosol formation. Photochemical age-based source apportionment revealed diverse contributions: primary emissions were crucial for methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, and acetic acid; secondary formation was important for acetaldehyde, methyl ethyl ketone, and acetic acid; biogenic emissions contributed to formic acid, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and acetone; and background sources impacted methanol in colder seasons. Trajectory clustering and potential source contribution function analyses identified seasonally modulated transport patterns influencing the source areas of OVOCs, PM2.5 and O3. The study highlights OVOCs as key drivers of O3 and SOA formation in urban suburb, while effective mitigation of photochemical pollution in such area requires a multi-faceted control strategy that not only targets local primary precursors (e.g., from traffic and solvents) but also incorporates regionally coordinated efforts to address seasonally varying transboundary pollution."

Over-dispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analyses were applied to estimate the effect sizes, followed by stratified analyses and estimates of the interaction with ozone. Our findings indicate that PM2.5 and its components are significantly associated with increased daily mortality. Specifically, every interquartile range increase in PM2.5 resulted in a 1.97 % increase in all-cause mortality, 2.15 % increase in cardiovascular mortality, and 2.34 % increase in respiratory mortality. Similar but less significant effects were found in five PM2.5 components.

This study challenges that assumption, showing these peaks can have a geophysical basis. Using a free‐running coupled model, we analyze the relationship between MAT and sea surface temperature (SST). Results indicate that MAT variation includes a significant component from the adiabatic response to pressure changes driven by the semi‐diurnal solar atmospheric tide. This component can cause secondary MAT maxima. Furthermore, it influences air‐sea heat fluxes.

 The region of the Red River Delta represents one of the most crucial economic zones of Vietnam, and its capital, the city of Hanoi, is in the heart of the delta. To satisfy the water demand for agricultural irrigation, urbanization, and industrialization, over-pumping groundwater-induced-ground subsidence has long hindered the region’s sustainable development. Existing studies do not systematically assess land subsidence with two-dimensional analysis in the RRD mega-city region. In this work, a comprehensive analysis relying on the exploitation of the interferometric SAR technologies and the use of multi-track SAR datasets acquired from the European Copernicus Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X has been carried out to generate and interpret the 2017–2024 dynamics of the RRD terrain deformations, by generating 2-D maps, along the vertical and horizontal directions, and ground deformation time series. As a result, the megacities Hanoi, Hai Duong, and Nam Dinh of the delta are found to be affected by significant subsidence. Specifically, we found that substantial subsidence occurred in the urban-suburban fringe of Hanoi (four districts: Ha Dong, Hoai Duc, Thanh Tri, and Dan Phuong). Experimental results confirm that the subsidence dominated the ground deformations, whereas the horizontal displacements of the terrain (i.e., along East-West) are almost negligible. Our study also comprehensively analyses the relationships between population, land-cover changes, the distribution of built-up areas, the role of over-pumping groundwater, geological setting, and ground subsidence, revealing that geological setting and groundwater pumping are dominant factors of the observed ground subsidence bowls."

 Glacier crevasses are critical indicators of ice dynamics and stability, yet their detailed monitoring is hindered by the limitations of traditional remote sensing. This study presents an innovative, integrated framework combining Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR Scanning (UAV-LS), photogrammetry, and an optimized deep learning model, C-TransUNet, for automated, high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) crevasse characterization. We conducted surveys at the terminus of the Yanong Glacier (YNG), Tibetan Plateau, acquiring centimeter-resolution orthophotos and LiDAR point clouds. The enhanced C-TransUNet model, featuring a local–global collaborative encoder and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion, significantly outperformed a suite of well-established and representative methods in crevasse extraction (mIOU = 88.04 %, F1-Score = 87.06 %) and demonstrated promising spatial transferability. A novel workflow integrating the deep learning results with UAV-LS point clouds enabled the systematic extraction of 3D crevasse geometry, including length, width, orientation, and unprecedented detail in depth (average 3.06 ± 3.91 m, max 26.69 m). Five distinct crevasse types were identified and meticulously mapped, revealing significant variations across different altitudinal zones. Furthermore, surface strain rates calculated from UAV-derived velocity data revealed preliminary quantitative links between crevasse patterns and underlying glacier dynamics. Our initial findings suggest that transitions between crevasse types correspond to changes in the local strain regime. This study establishes a powerful, automated framework for fine-scale, multi-dimensional crevasse analysis, offering a robust foundation for gaining crucial insights into glacier mechanics and stability in response to climate change."

 Timely identification of active landslides is critical for disaster early warning and risk management. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology, which can capture subtle displacements of active landslides over large areas, has become a key tool for landslide identification. The development of deep learning provides new opportunities to improve InSAR-based landslide identification. However, existing approaches often struggle to balance identification accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, we propose the Context-aware Adaptive Fusion Network (CAFNet), a lightweight encoder-decoder framework that optimizes multi-scale feature learning from color-mapped deformation. In the encoder, the Wavelet-based Down-sampling Block (WDB) is introduced to perform down-sampling while preserving fine-grained details. Additionally, we develop a Multi-branch Scale-aware Aggregation (MSA) module to adaptively select and integrate multi-scale features based on target characteristics, ensuring flexible feature alignment. The decoder employs an efficient Conv-based Up-sampling Block (CUB) to progressively restore spatial resolution while refining boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that CAFNet outperforms existing deep learning models such as DeepLabV3+ and ResUNet, achieving 90.8 % precision and 83.3 % IoU at the pixel level, and 89.5 % correct detection and 7.3 % false alarm rate at the object level. Notably, CAFNet achieves these results a 20 × reduction in parameters and a 50 % decrease in computational costs, while maintaining robust generalization abilities. These findings highlight the potential of CAFNet for the establishment and periodic updating of active landslide inventories, which is essential for minimizing losses caused by landslide disasters."

 Wildfire frequency and severity have escalated in South Korea, with the March 2025 event being the most destructive in its history. This study presents a dual-stage analytical framework that integrates deep learning to assess wildfire susceptibility and multi-sensor satellite classification to delineate burn areas. First, a nationwide wildfire susceptibility model was constructed using a decade of NASA FIRMS hotspot data (2014–2024) and 12 conditioning factors. Among the four tested deep learning models, SqueezeNet achieved the highest predictive performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of approximately 0.83 and minimal error metrics. Second, active burn areas from the 2025 wildfire were mapped by fusing Sentinel‑1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which includes amplitude and coherence change detection, and Sentinel‑2 spectral indices, enabling precise delineation of burn across five provinces. A support vector machine classifier yielded an overall accuracy of 97.5 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.95. The susceptibility map, validated against the 2025 fire perimeters, achieved an AUC of 0.78, confirming the reliability of the proposed integrated framework.

 Accurate burned area (BA) mapping is essential for assessing wildfire impacts on ecosystems and climate. While existing BA products derived from coarse-resolution sensors (e.g., MODIS) have primarily relied on Landsat-based validation protocols, the advent of higher-resolution products such as those from Sentinel-2 necessitates adapted validation methodologies to match their enhanced spatial detail. This study presents the Sentinel-2 Burned Area Validation Grid (S2BAVG); a global sampling framework designed to support BA validation using Sentinel-2 imagery. S2BAVG consists of 19,263 non-overlapping spatial units covering the global land surface, addressing limitations of previous grids by ensuring full orbital coverage and eliminating overlaps, thereby enabling consistent sampling and rigorous validation. Key attributes—including fire activity indicators and cloud-free image availability— facilitate the implementation of stratified sampling designs. Additionally, we provide an open-source framework to support the sampling process with customizable input parameters. The framework includes statistical inference tools to estimate accuracy metrics and their standard errors, ensuring rigorous BA product assessment. By leveraging Sentinel-2′s high spatial and temporal resolution, S2BAVG provides a flexible and standardized methodology for BA validation. The S2BAVG tile grid dataset and sampling framework (with an illustrative sampling design approach) are openly available at https://github.com/magifranquesa/S2BAVG, promoting reproducibility and enabling broader applications in fire science and Earth observation."
10.1016/j.jag.2025.104887,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该论文主要研究利用卫星遥感技术进行全天候海面温度（SST）反演。它侧重于使用AHI和ATMS两种卫星传感器的数据，通过卷积神经网络（CNN）融合，提高在各种天气条件下的SST反演精度。虽然使用了卫星观测技术，但其核心应用是海洋遥感，而非大气环境遥感，例如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['Sea Surface Temperature (SST)', 'satellite observations', 'Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)', 'Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS)', 'all-weather SST retrieval', 'ocean remote sensing']",Donglin Fan;Xin Yang;Hongchang He;Hongjie He;Bolin Fu,Bridging the cloud gap: AHI/ATMS synergy through CNN feature fusion for all-weather SST retrieval,"•Proposes CNN-based AHI/ATMS synergy for all-weather SST retrieval. •Leverages ATMS data to overcome cloud obstruction in SST retrieval. •Demonstrates higher accuracy than operational AHI SST product. •Quantifies SST retrieval uncertainty across cloud types. 
 Infrared-based Sea Surface Temperature (SST) retrieval methods face persistent challenges from cloud-induced data gaps and accuracy degradation. This study bridges this critical limitation through multisensor satellite synergy, integrating geostationary Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) with Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) data via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for all weather SST retrieval. The CNN model adaptively extracts features from multi-band AHI/ATMS imagery, effectively predicting SST under varying cloud conditions. Evaluation results demonstrate a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.07 °C, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.22 °C, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88 on the test dataset. Under the same CNN framework, unimodal retrievals from AHI and ATMS alone yield substantially lower performance (R2 = 0.51, RMSE = 3.45 °C; and R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 2.64 °C, respectively), confirming the complementary benefits of multisensor fusion. Comparisons with a Transformer-based model, the daily OSTIA product, and the official AHI SST product (clear-sky conditions) further indicate that the proposed CNN achieves the highest accuracy. Although RMSE exceeds 1 °C for certain cloud types, the method substantially mitigates cloud-induced data loss and provides a reliable, high-accuracy, all-weather SST retrieval strategy for satellite ocean remote sensing."

 Bimolecular reaction rate coefficients (kOH, L mol−1s−1) for the aqueous oxidation of pinic, caric, caronic, norpinic, and norpinonic acids by OH radicals were measured within the presented study. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis was performed for selected products formed in the studied OH reactions, including those known in the literature, SOA components of α-pinene and δ-3-carene. Values of kOH were measured for the neutral (pH = 2) and deprotonated (pH = 10) forms of the terpenoic acids under investigation in the temperature range between 288 and 308 K. The reactions of caronic and caric acids with OH radicals appear slightly faster (kOH298K pH2 = 3.3 ± 0.1 × 109 L mol−1s−1 and kOH298K pH2 = 3.3 ± 0.1 × 109 L mol−1s−1, respectively) than those of norpinic (kOH298K pH2 = 1.2 ± 0.1 × 109 L mol−1s−1), norpinonic (kOH298K pH2 = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 109 L mol−1s−1) and pinic acids (kOH298K pH2 = 2.1 ± 0.1 × 109 L mol−1s−1). The calculated activation energies (E) fall in a 9–21 kJ mol−1 range, explaining the very weak temperature dependence of the measured reaction rates. The calculated lifetimes decreased with increasing LWC (from 10−12 m3 m3 in aerosol to 10−5 m3 m−3 in storms), indicating that the acids undergo significant aqueous processing under realistic atmospheric conditions. The analysis of extremely low-volatility products allowed proposing reaction paths from earlier– to later–generation products (only carboxylic acid) of α-pinene. We measured that terebic acid can be formed through the aqueous phase OH reaction of norpinic acid, but also through terpenylic acid oxidation. Moreover, we found that the reaction of terpenylic acid + OH radicals is almost 10 times slower than the oxidation of pinic and pinonic acids. Therefore, observed in the atmosphere, terebic acid formation is mainly through direct oxidation of an early-generation oxidation product of α-pinene (pinic and pinonic acids) rather than from the secondary reaction of terpenylic acid."

 Under global warming, droughts across China exhibit pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, posing severe threats to agricultural production, water security, and ecosystem stability. To address the limitations of conventional drought monitoring methods, which include sparse station coverage, poor spatial continuity, and inadequate representation of nonlinear interactions, this study develops a Comprehensive Drought Monitoring Model based on a Meta-learning Ensemble Algorithm (CDMMMLEA). The model integrates multi-source remote sensing data, including canopy temperature, vegetation indices, soil moisture, and canopy water content, with meteorological and auxiliary geospatial data. Using an ensemble learning framework, CDMMMLEA significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of drought monitoring across China from 2001 to 2023. The findings suggest that (1) CDMMMLEA outperforms five benchmark machine learning models across China, achieving the highest correlation with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and lowest error, particularly in the Songliao River Basin (SLRB) and Yellow River Basin (YRB); (2) Compared to SPEI, it more effectively captures the spatial propagation of drought, including its boundary shifts, intensity gradients, and temporal persistence, even maintaining errors below 10 % in regions with sparse station data; (3) Analysis of drought evolution from 2001 to 2023 reveals a phased pattern: high-frequency, high-intensity, and long-duration droughts dominated during 2001–2010, followed by a mitigation phase after 2011, with intensity decreasing by 25 % and duration shortening by 0.5–1.3 months per event. Autumn droughts were most severe, affecting 62.3 % of the Loess Plateau and western SLRB. CDMMMLEA provides a reliable tool for high-resolution spatiotemporal drought assessment, supporting operational early warning systems, optimized water resource allocation (e.g., South-to-North Water Diversion Project), and region-specific drought adaptation strategies (e.g., northwest water-saving irrigation) across China."

 Precipitation in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) shows contrasting decadal changes from 1961 to 2022, with the northern part becoming drier and the southern part becoming wetter. Based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, this study finds that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a key moderator of the decadal variability of precipitation across the YRB. Specifically, precipitation decreases significantly over most parts of the YRB during positive PDO phase, while it increases during negative phase. Further studies revealed that this distribution is closely related to water vapor transport and atmospheric circulation. During the positive PDO phase, the core of the westerly jet (20°N-60°N, 80°E-160°E) is located over the northwest of the YRB, generating a cyclonic circulation at its southeastern periphery. Meanwhile, the water vapor is dominated by divergence, resulting in insufficient water vapor conditions. This configuration inhibits upward movement and suppresses precipitation in the basin. In contrast, during the negative phase of the PDO, the westerly jet receded to the west and weakened, resulting in increased transport of warm moist air from the ocean to the YRB. Multi-model simulation results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show that the decadal trends of precipitation in the YRB show opposite patterns during the positive and negative phases of the PDO. The YRB precipitation phase reverses under the SSP585 scenario with respect to the historical period, the SSP126, and SSP245 scenarios, which has a profound impact on the future socio-economic development of the YRB. This study provides new insights into the physical drivers of decadal precipitation variability over the YRB, offering a valuable reference for improving future climate projections and regional water resource management."

One model undergoes runaway ice growth, while the other has slower ice expansion and even transient sea ice retreat in the north Pacific. The latter is linked to the development of a strong Pacific meridional overturning circulation, which transports heat northward and slows ice growth. The model with less ice growth also exhibits greater “cold uptake into” (or heat release from) the deep ocean.

 Abrupt climate changes repeatedly occurred during glacial periods, caused by intrinsic instabilities of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) leading to Dansgaard–Oeschger events, and by the AMOC’s response to massive iceberg discharges in the North Atlantic, known as Heinrich events. This AMOC-driven millennial-scale climate variability is most prominent in the North Atlantic but also propagates to the Southern Ocean, where its imprint is particularly strong during cold (Stadial) phases featuring Heinrich events. Here we use an Earth system model to show that the qualitative differences between Heinrich Stadials and non-Heinrich Stadials seen in proxy records can be explained by a sudden start of convection in the Southern Ocean triggered by a strong weakening of the AMOC during Heinrich events. The sudden convection onset leads to rapid warming and sea ice retreat in the Southern Ocean, and the resulting ventilation of the deep ocean explains the rapid CO2 increase of ~15 ppm on centennial timescales during some Heinrich Stadials. We propose a general mechanism whereby a shutdown of convection in the North Atlantic triggers convection in the Southern Ocean—a phenomenon we refer to as a bipolar convection seesaw—which could also be activated by a potential future weakening of the AMOC.

 Evergreen conifers are key components of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, playing a significant role in shaping ecosystem structure, function, and resilience to climate change. While very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery enables accurate classification of evergreen conifers and creation of reference fractional cover maps, scaling this capability to regional levels using coarser-resolution time-series satellite data remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches are limited by their inability to fully exploit the spatial detail of VHR imagery and capture sequential patterns in satellite time series. To address these limitations, we developed a deep learning-based framework for mapping evergreen conifer fractional cover at 30 m resolution in mountainous forests. The framework integrates a 3D U-Net model to extract spatial and spectral features from bi-temporal WorldView imagery—while mitigating terrain shadows—and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn sequential dependencies from Landsat time series for regression. We compared our framework against a random forest baseline. Independent spatial and temporal transferability assessments showed that our approach achieved an R2 of 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.14, outperforming the benchmark method. To further interpret the spatial predictions, we quantified the spatial configuration of evergreen conifers using landscape metrics across areas with varying conifer cover.

This framework improves the accuracy and transferability of fractional cover mapping and offers a scalable solution for ecosystem monitoring in topographically complex forested landscapes."

 Perennial crops are vital to economic growth, environmental sustainability, and human well-being. However, due to the diversity and complexity of natural environments and agricultural management practices, there is currently no widely transferable mapping strategy for these crop types, particularly in regions with diverse perennial species. To address this gap, we propose a novel perennial crop mapping strategy based on intra-annual changing patterns of spectral endmembers (CPSEM). This strategy integrates a unified spectral endmember (EM) space with a harmonic model to characterize and quantify the biophysical processes and morphology of vegetation. Using Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA), Sentinel-2 time-series data (2020−2022) were unmixed into a unified spectral EM space comprising green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil (SL), and dark surfaces (DA), enabling the reconstruction of land surface component (LSC) trajectories at the pixel level. We developed two EM-based morphology indices to capture structural and compositional relationships among EMs. A harmonic model was applied to extract key parameters from the EM fractions and EM-based morphology indices, representing vegetation biophysical processes. Finally, a Random Forest model was used to classify perennial crop types. The results show that perennial crops of the same type exhibited similar biophysical processes and morphology, while distinct types exhibited substantial differences. Our method effectively maps perennial crop types across diverse environments and planting conditions, achieving classification accuracies of 87.27 %–90.91 %. Compared to traditional spectral-based methods, the proposed strategy improves perennial crop classification by 1.7 %–3.9 % and overall vegetation classification by 5.3 %–8.4 %. Additionally, this strategy effectively addressed the limitations inherent in traditional phenological indices for accurately classifying perennial crops, demonstrating robust performance even in complex classification scenarios. Incorporating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features did not further improve classification accuracy. This strategy enhances interpretability and transferability through the use of a unified spectral EM space and detailed biophysical characterization. Thus, the CPSEM-based perennial crop mapping strategy provides a robust and scalable approach for accurately identifying perennial crops and land cover at large scales."

Given the contentious nature of conflict damage assessment, these estimates must be fully reproducible, explainable, and derived from open access data. This paper introduces a new method for building damage detection– the Pixel-Wise T-Test (PWTT)– that satisfies these conditions. Using a combination of freely-available synthetic aperture radar imagery and statistical change detection, the PWTT generates accurate conflict damage estimates across a wide area at regular time intervals. Accuracy is assessed using an original dataset of over 2 million labeled building footprints spanning 30 cities across Palestine, Ukraine, Sudan, Syria, and Iraq. Despite being simple and lightweight, the algorithm achieves building-level accuracy statistics (AUC=0.87 in the full sample) rivaling state of the art methods that use deep learning and high resolution imagery. The workflow is open source and deployed entirely within the Google Earth Engine environment, allowing for the generation of interactive Battle Damage Dashboards for Ukraine and Gaza that update in near-real time, enabling the public and humanitarian practitioners to immediately get estimates of damaged buildings in a given area."

Pinto;Andreas Christen,Is satellite land surface temperature an appropriate proxy for intra-urban variability of daytime heat stress?,"•Can land surface temperature (LST) be used to predict urban heat stress (UTCI)? •Extensive comparison of Landsat LST and modelled microscale UTCI at pedestrian level. •LST poorly represents UTCI in dense urban areas, especially during heat waves. •LST-UTCI relationship nonlinear and inconsistent, with large intra-urban variability. •Models considering urban morphology and land cover outperform LST-only models. 
 Adaptation of urban areas to heat extremes requires adequate information on intra-urban variability patterns of outdoor thermal comfort (OTC). Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperatures (LST) are often used to map heat hotspots in urban areas. However, this approach has limitations as LST and OTC are influenced by different physical processes. This study investigates the relationship between satellite-derived Landsat Level-2 LST data and pedestrian-level Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) predictions from a microscale thermal comfort model across Freiburg, Germany. A cluster analysis of the differences is performed, and multiple random forest models are trained using different combinations of LST, ERA5-Land reanalysis, and local-specific urban morphology and land cover data as predictors.While a linear relationship between LST and UTCI exists under non-heat stress conditions (UTCI <26 °C) and in vegetated or open areas, this becomes non-linear and spatially inconsistent under heat stress, particularly in compact urban environments. The growing divergence between LST and UTCI along an urbanization gradient ranging from −1 K to +9 K highlights the significant impact of urban morphology on the LST-UTCI relationship, leading to substantial intra-urban variability. This variability appears to persist even within similar urban typologies (e.g. LCZs/clusters), with only limited reduction in spatial variability. Random forest models confirm these findings: those based solely on LST or global-scale predictors struggle to capture intra-urban UTC variability, while models incorporating local urban morphology and land cover data outperform them (even without LST input). This suggests that the contribution of LST to neighborhood-scale UTC modeling is limited under certain conditions and environments."

 The green fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an essential parameter used to characterize the spatial pattern of vegetation coverage. Remote sensing provides the most efficient way to estimate FVC at regional and global scales. However, existing FVC-estimation approaches based on remote sensing fail to achieve high accuracy, broad applicability, and ease of use simultaneously, thus limiting their practical implementation. Based on the unique spectral shapes of green vegetation and soil within the visible to near-infrared spectrum (400–1000 nm), we proposed the vegetation coverage index (VCI), which is a novel index for directly indicating the FVC. VCI utilizes the spectral reflectance from the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands to quantify the vegetation signal and soil signal as 1 and 0, respectively, and then establishes a quantitative relationship with FVC through the linear spectral mixing model. The performance of VCI in FVC estimation was first tested using simulated datasets generated by the radiative transfer model LESS under varying factors, including the vegetation structure, leaf area index, soil background, and solar zenith angle. It was then validated at 15 in-situ test sites in China, using UAV-derived reference FVC and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. These sites covered 10 vegetation and land cover types, 4 phenological phases, and 10 soil types. Additionally, VCI was compared against existing FVC products across another 40 in-situ comparative sites in China, using Landsat-8/9, Sentinel-3, and MODOCGA data at spatial resolutions of 30 m, 300 m, and 1000 m, respectively. Simulation results demonstrated that VCI performed comparably or slightly better than the dimidiate pixel model (DPM), reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.21 % to 14.42 %. Validation at 15 test sites showed that during the green-up to peak phase, when pixels are primarily composed of green vegetation and soil, VCI and DPM exhibited similar average accuracy (VCI: RMSE = 0.13; DPM: RMSE = 0.12). In contrast, during the peak to dormancy phase, with the presence of non-photosynthetic vegetation, VCI (RMSE = 0.11) clearly outperformed DPM (RMSE = 0.21), achieving a 46.8 % reduction in RMSE. At the 40 comparative sites, VCI yielded RMSE comparable to the MultiVI FVC product and outperformed the GEOV3 FVC and GLASS FVC products, with RMSE reductions of 20.00 % and 30.77 %, respectively. VCI provides a simple and efficient approach for FVC estimation through basic spectral band calculations. Moreover, VCI demonstrates broad applicability across widely used remote sensing sensors, including the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, showing strong potential for FVC monitoring across various spatial and temporal scales."

 Satellite-collected nighttime light provides a unique perspective on human activities, including urbanization, population growth, and epidemics. However, global, long-term, and fine-grained nighttime light observations are lacking, hindering the analysis and application of continuous light changes in specific facilities over extended periods. To address this gap, we reformulated the super-resolution task – reconstructing low-resolution nighttime light data into high-resolution images – by explicitly incorporating temporal difference information. Rigorous validation across three evaluation years demonstrates that our dataset consistently outperforms existing products at global, national, and city scales. Case studies of high-value infrastructure sites, such as artificial islands and international airports, highlight our dataset’s unprecedented ability to capture both long-term gradual illumination changes associated with development and abrupt intensity oscillations caused by wars.

 Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for remote sensing image understanding, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial–temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN– and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play Mamba-based decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in feature fusion. Ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets, and the LoveDA (54.8% mIoU) dataset."

 The association between long-term air pollution exposure and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains inconclusive. A total of 133,261 participants from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort were included. Incident IBD cases were ascertained from the administrative database of the National Health Services. Air pollution exposure (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and NOx) at participants’ residential addresses was estimated by spatio-temporal models. Cox regression models were used to assess the associations between air pollution and IBD. Metabolic signatures were constructed by summing selected plasma metabolites associated with air pollution through elastic net regression. Afterwards, mediation analyses were conducted to investigate the potential mediation of metabolic signatures on the air pollution-IBD associations. During a mean follow-up of 11.61 years (SD: 1.78), 824 incident IBD cases were identified. Long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx was positively associated with IBD risk: hazard ratios were 1.019 (95 % CI: 0.933, 1.112), 1.033 (95 % CI: 0.942, 1.132), 1.112 (95 % CI: 1.026, 1.227), and 1.121 (95 % CI: 1.028, 1.223), respectively. As PM2.5 and PM10 were not significantly associated with incident IBD, subsequent metabolic analysis was only conducted for NO2 and NOx. The metabolic signatures for NO2 and NOx included 26 and 18 metabolites (mostly related to amino acids, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism), respectively. The significant associations of NO2 and NOx with incident IBD were explained by their metabolic signatures (mediation: 10.13 % (95 % CI: 4.56 %, 42.87 %) and 9.17 % (95 % CI: 3.87 %, 38.64 %), respectively). Our findings suggest that long-term air pollution exposure could increase IBD risk, potentially through mediation by metabolic changes."

We also highlight the collaborative effort that made the installation of NPW possible. The high-quality recordings from NPW offer critical insights for seismic hazard assessment in the region. 
 We present an overview of the Naypyitaw station (NPW) in Myanmar, which is managed by the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) and is part of the GEOFON (GE) network (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15921214, Bindi et al., 2025). The station is equipped with both strong-motion and broadband sensors and is situated 2.6 km from the Sagaing Fault, providing an exceptional near-fault recording of the Mw 7.7 earthquake that occurred on 28 March 2025. The installation and ongoing maintenance of NPW are the result of a collaborative effort between DMH and the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), prompted by the GFZ International Training Course on seismology and seismic hazard assessment (ITC) in 2016. In this study, we provide background information on the collaborative effort that led to the installation of the only station providing near-fault, on-scale measurements of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake. Given the widespread interest in the data recorded by the station, we describe the instrumental settings in detail and how to access data and metadata for station NPW. Given the relevance of the near-fault recordings at NPW not only for constraining the rupture process of the mainshock but also for engineering seismology applications, we analyze key features of the mainshock from an engineering seismology perspective. This includes an examination of ground motion amplitudes, frequency content, response spectra, and near-fault effects such as the fling effect and pulse-like motion. The high-quality near-field data at NPW provide valuable information for seismic hazard assessment in the region and offer useful constraints for studies investigating the rupture characteristics of the mainshock, which preliminary findings suggest propagated at supershear speed."

 Air–sea turbulent heat fluxes – latent heat flux (LHF) and sensible heat flux (SHF) – are fundamental to the Earth’s energy and moisture budgets and to ocean–atmosphere coupling. Global flux estimates via bulk aerodynamic algorithms depend on sea surface temperature (SST), surface wind speed (SSW), near-surface air temperature (Ta), and specific humidity (Qa), but orbital sampling and cloud contamination leave gaps in satellite inputs that propagate uncertainty to Ta/Qa and hence to LHF/SHF. Here we present DeepFlux, a global daily 1° × 1° heat-flux dataset for 29 years (January 1992–December 2020). The dataset is produced with a concise completion-then-retrieval workflow: Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) variables (SSW, cloud liquid water, total column water vapor, and rain rate) are first gap-filled using the AI-based Generalized Data Completion Model (GDCM) to yield spatiotemporally continuous inputs; these – together with Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) – are then used to retrieve Ta and Qa via the AI-based Matrices-Points Fusion Network (MPFNet). LHF and SHF are then computed using a bulk algorithm. Validation against in-situ buoy observations shows that the dataset closely matches the true measurements, with RMSEs of 0.53 °C (Ta), 0.70 g kg⁻¹ (Qa), 5.53 W m⁻² (SHF), and 25.28 W m⁻² (LHF). Comparisons with widely used flux products indicate differences among products, reflecting variability in flux estimates from different sources.

ALS transects bridge the gap between ground measurements and satellite mapping, providing a powerful new resource to understand, monitor, and manage northern forests. The lidar plots and point cloud metrics described form part of an open-data initiative to enhance structural information. This dataset supports key applications in forest inventory, wildfire risk assessment, and ecosystem monitoring. 
 Mapping vegetation is required for monitoring the condition of forest resources. Satellite data provide information on land cover and change; however, forest structural attributes are difficult to model without additional measurements from ground plots or airborne laser scanning (ALS, also known as airborne light detection and ranging or lidar) instruments. Over large and inaccessible areas, such as Canada's northern and predominantly unmanaged forests, ground plots are expensive, difficult to install, and unlikely to form a statistically valid probability sample. An alternative means to obtain information regarding forest structure in these situations is samples of ALS (hereafter lidar plots). Transect-based samples of ALS data can be used to provide structural information for the calibration and validation of spatially explicit predictive modelling for wide-area mapping of forest attributes. Here we describe and share data from the recent acquisition and processing of ALS transects across Canada's northern forests. To date, approximately 43,000 km of ALS transects have been acquired in 2023 and 2024, with additional coverage ongoing for 2025. Acquisition flight lines were designed to sample a range of northern forest conditions and to correspond with a concurrent ground plot sampling campaign. Airborne laser scanning data were processed into height-normalized point clouds and reprojected to a custom Lambert conformal conic projection to align with existing national satellite information products. More than 15 million 900 m2 lidar plots were generated from the 2023 transect dataset with point cloud metrics (i.e., area-based statistical summaries of the ALS point cloud) calculated for each 30 by 30 m cell. Presently, the 2023 lidar plots and their associated point cloud metrics are stored in openly available SQLite GeoPackages, with additional annual transect collections to be added when available. To accommodate a wide range of users and applications, both comprehensive and abridged versions of the metric databases, with 369 metrics and 40 metrics, respectively, are shared. The framework that led to the data shared here is portable to other areas with similar information needs. The data structure used was designed to enable updates with additional open access databases of ALS transects as data acquisition and processing are completed. This open-access dataset constitutes a vital resource for the scientific and operational forestry communities, offering detailed and scalable measures that bridge the gap between ground observations and wall-to-wall satellite-based inventories.

 The HYD-RESPONSES dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14713274; von Matt et al., 2025) provides new daily catchment-level time series for key hydro-meteorological variables, including precipitation, snow water equivalent, temperature, soil moisture, (potential) evaporation, and streamflow. The dataset covers 184 small to large Swiss catchments of the surface water monitoring network operated by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN). The catchments range across a variety of streamflow regime types, mean altitudes, biogeographic regions, and anthropogenic influences. The data set provides daily average streamflow derived from measurements by the FOEN and daily hydrometeorological data (precipitation, temperature, radiation, snow and soil moisture) on the catchment level extracted from spatially gridded data provided by MeteoSwiss (RhiresD, TabsD, TmaxD, TminD, SrelD), MeteoSwiss and the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF (SPASS), SLF (OSHD), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF (ERA5-Land)."

Here, we use coupled land‐atmosphere model simulations to quantitatively assess the effects of vegetation greening on summer mean and extreme land surface temperatures in Eastern China over the 2003–2018 period. We show that the modeled cooling effect on summer mean land surface temperature is more pronounced in arid Northeastern China than in humid Southeastern China, consistent with satellite‐derived temperature responses. In contrast, for extreme hot temperatures, the spatial pattern of the cooling effect reverses, largely because high temperatures accompanied by strong radiation can alleviate energy constraints on evaporative cooling in Southeastern China.

In the rate‐and‐state friction framework, we observed that fine‐grained gouge is strongly velocity‐weakening over a substantially broader range in temperature than coarse‐grained gouge at V of 1–100 μm/s. Velocity‐weakening may result from a combination of mechanical comminution (grain size reduction) and dilatant granular (i.e., cataclastic) flow, operating in competition with compaction and creep involving grain scale mass transfer by pressure solution. We also infer that temperature‐dependent grain growth of ultrafine particles plays a role in determining the upper temperature limit of velocity‐weakening."

These changes are consistent with environmental conditions modulating RI, including mid‐level moisture, vertical wind shear, sea surface temperatures and potential intensity.

These echoes persist for 10s of milliseconds up to several minutes and are known as nonspecular trails. The turbulence from these trails is highly aspect sensitive and typically only observed within a few degrees of perpendicular to the magnetic field.

We find notable underestimation of drought severity and coverage by GWMs, across diverse regions, including North America, South America, Africa, and Northern Asia. When examined without trend removal, the underestimation of TWS droughts is more pronounced in recent years (2016–2019) compared to 2002–2015, especially in northern latitudes. This underrepresentation highlights the necessity to improve GWMs to simulate TWS droughts. Our results imply that previously reported future TWS projections could have underestimated droughts."

Freunberger,Marcus kinetics control singlet and triplet oxygen evolving from superoxide,"The release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. 
 Oxygen redox chemistry is central to life1 and many human-made technologies, such as in energy storage2–4. The large energy gain from oxygen redox reactions is often connected with the occurrence of harmful reactive oxygen species3,5,6. Key species are superoxide and the highly reactive singlet oxygen3–7, which may evolve from superoxide. However, the factors determining the formation of singlet oxygen, rather than the relatively unreactive triplet oxygen, are unknown. Here we report that the release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. We found that as the driving force for the reaction increases, the initially dominant evolution of triplet oxygen slows down, and singlet oxygen evolution becomes predominant with higher maximum kinetics. This behaviour also applies to the widely observed superoxide disproportionation, in which one superoxide is oxidized by another, in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems, with Lewis and Brønsted acidity controlling the driving forces. Singlet oxygen yields governed by these conditions are relevant, for example, in batteries or cellular organelles in which superoxide forms. Our findings suggest ways to understand and control spin states and kinetics in oxygen redox chemistry, with implications for fields, including life sciences, pure chemistry and energy storage. The release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour."

 Nitrogen (N) assimilation consumes carbon (C) in plants, and climate warming can alter soil N availability, thereby affecting plant N assimilation and associated C costs. However, the global C cost of N assimilation in terrestrial plants has long been unconstrained, and its warming response remains uncertain. Here we constructed a modelling framework of plant C costs for nitrate, ammonium and extractable organic N assimilation and assessed global C costs of plant N assimilation. Globally, the C costs for plant N assimilation were 208 ± 12 and 249 ± 15 TgC yr−1 under the present-day and 2.0 °C warming scenarios, respectively, which exceed the C emissions caused by deforestation and degradation fires and are comparable to the forest C fixed by atmospheric N deposition. Under the warming scenario, the global C cost would increase by 47% (41 ± 19 TgC yr−1), with a greater percentage increase at higher latitudes, due partly to enhanced contributions and C cost of soil inorganic N. We conclude that the C cost for N assimilation in terrestrial plants should be incorporated into global C budgets, while its positive response to warming would improve predictions of terrestrial C-cycle feedbacks to global warming. Modelling suggests the carbon cost for nitrogen assimilation by plants will rise substantially under future climate change with further increase at higher latitudes, due partly to enhanced contributions of soil inorganic nitrogen."

This method is effective with a wide array of (hetero)aryl and aliphatic imines bearing diverse functional groups.

However, the nAb correlate was weaker and shorter-lived in a vaccine-immunity versus hybrid-immunity population. 
 People with HIV (PWH) are understudied in COVID-19 vaccine trials, leaving knowledge gaps on whether the identified immune correlates of protection also hold in PWH. CoVPN 3008 (NCT05168813) enrolled predominantly PWH and reported lower COVID-19 incidence for a Hybrid vs. Vaccine Group (baseline SARS-CoV-2-positive and one mRNA-1273 dose vs. negative and two doses). Using case-cohort sampling, antibody markers at enrolment (M0) and four weeks post-final vaccination (Peak) are assessed as immune correlates of COVID-19. For the Hybrid Group [n = 287 (195 PWH)], all M0 markers inversely correlate with COVID-19 through 230 days post-Peak, with 50% inhibitory dilution BA.4/5 neutralizing antibody titer (nAb-ID50 BA.4/5) the strongest and only independent correlate (HR per 10-fold increase=0.46, 95% CI 0.28, 0.75; P = 0.002). For the Vaccine Group [n = 115 (86 PWH)], Peak nAb-ID50 BA.4/5 correlates with reduced COVID-19 risk (1.9%, 1.1%, and 0.3% at titers 10, 100, and 1000 AU/ml) through 92, but not 165, days post-Peak. Using multivariable Cox analysis of binding and nAb, nAb titers predict COVID-19 in PWH. Two doses of a 100-µg Ancestral strain mRNA vaccine in baseline-SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals elicit sufficient cross-reacting Omicron antibodies to reduce COVID-19 incidence for 90 days post-Peak, but viral evolution and waning antibodies abrogate this protection thereafter.

 Transition metal oxides with partially filled d orbitals serve as effective polysulfide conversion catalysts in lithium-sulfur batteries. Nonetheless, a predictive descriptor to elucidate their structure-activity relationship is still lacking. To fill this gap, here we investigate the occupancy of t2 orbitals as a possible descriptor for the polysulfide conversion activity of spinel oxides. The electrochemical characterizations reveal a volcano relationship between t2 occupancy and the polysulfide conversion activity of spinel oxides. The theoretical calculations indicate that the t2 occupancy effect is associated with the ability of tetrahedral cations to cleave S-S bonds and form Li-S bonds. As such, Mn0.5Co0.5Cr2O4, with an optimized average t2 occupancy of 2.88, is designed and demonstrates promising polysulfide conversion activity among representative oxides. This work elucidates that t2 occupancy serves as an effective descriptor for evaluating the polysulfide conversion activity of spinel oxides. With the catalytic mechanism proposed, the current study prompts further exploration of the application of t2 occupancy as a descriptor for predicting the polysulfide conversion efficiency of other catalytic systems beyond the spinel structure.

 The nature of Archean tectonics and the associated geodynamic regimes are much debated in modern geoscience, despite decades of research. In this study, we present a geophysical model to show that, by the Neoarchean, convective forces from rising mantle plumes or early forms of plate subduction caused widespread extension, creating linear zones of crustal growth. These regimes can be identified as Archean rifts in the ancient rock record by the topography of the Moho, i.e., a shallowing of the boundary between the crust and the lithospheric mantle. Gravity data collected over the Abitibi greenstone belt, a particularly well-preserved portion of Neoarchean crust located in Canada’s Superior Province, was modeled to produce a topographic map of the Moho. The model shows corridors of shallow Moho surrounding islands of thick, intrusion-filled crust and is interpreted to be a snap-shot of microplate growth and breakup between 2.75 to 2.69 Ga. The connectivity of the interpreted relict rifts is possible evidence for the existence of Neoarchean plate boundaries and triple junctions and supports a model of at least local mobile-lid tectonics during this stage of Earth’s history.

 Reducing interfacial non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/electron transport layer interface remains a critical challenge for achieving high performance and stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. This study analyzes energy losses and design bilayer passivation for enhancing the performance and durability of tandem solar cells. Our experimental results confirm that, the bilayer passivation strategy, precisely modulates perovskite energy level alignment, reduces defect density, and suppresses interfacial non-radiative recombination. Moreover, the ALD-AlOx forms a homogeneous film on the perovskite grain surface while creating island-like structures at grain boundaries, enabling nanoscale local contact areas for subsequent PDAI2 deposition. While serving as an ion diffusion barrier, this structure facilitates moderate n-type doping and enhances charge extraction and transport efficiency.

 Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials are promising for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their narrowband emission and efficient triplet utilization. However, realizing stable deep-blue emission with high practical efficiency remains challenging, largely due to limited strategies for hypsochromic shifts without compromising photophysical properties.

 Segregated networks of mesoscale functional units convey highly specific functional signals within and across early visual areas. However, it remains unclear whether higher-order category-selective areas exhibit a similar mesoscale functional organization. In this study, we investigated the mesoscale functional architecture of face-, body-, and object-selective regions in macaque monkeys using sub-millimeter fMRI (0.22 mm3 voxels) combined with single-cell recordings. Our findings reveal that these category-selective areas are subdivided into spatially clustered mesoscale functional units, which are highly consistent across subjects. Notably, mesoscale functional units of the same type exhibit segregated interhemispheric functional connectivity, forming long-range mesoscale functional networks. Single-cell recordings from a body-selective area confirmed this mesoscale organization and showed a remarkable correspondence between fMRI-defined mesoscale functional units and neuronal tuning profiles. These mesoscale functional units also displayed sharp functional boundaries and response similarity decay patterns, similar to those observed in previous single-unit recordings. Our findings suggest that mesoscale functional networks are a fundamental feature of primate cortex and highlight the power of high-resolution, high-sensitive fMRI in mapping neural circuitry at mesoscale level.

 The impacts of boreal Forest Cover Change (FCC) during winter are somewhat neglected due to a lack of evapotranspiration and solar radiation. This study incorporates the observed FCC into the Earth System Model, and the ensemble simulations agree on a significant winter cooling over Eurasia with a land-atmosphere coupled framework caused by a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex. We find that afforestation in western Europe leads to more snow interception on canopy in November, inhibiting snow accumulation and reducing surface albedo. The stronger snow-albedo feedback as the source of perturbation stimulates upward planetary wave propagations, weakening the stratospheric polar vortex, and forming a negative Arctic Oscillation pattern at the surface.

 The North China Craton underwent extensive lithospheric thinning and crustal reworking during the Mesozoic, challenging classic views of craton stability.

Here we reconstruct crustal thickness evolution along the southern margin of the North China Craton using strontium to yttrium and lanthanum to ytterbium ratios, plus neodymium isotopic data from granitoids. Thickening began in the Jurassic and peaked around 130 Ma, when crustal thickness exceeded 70 km and palaeoelevation surpassed 5 km, forming a plateau comparable to the Tibetan Plateau. After ~128 Ma, thickness and elevation decreased to 30–40 km and <3 km by 125–110 Ma. These shifts parallel sedimentary, structural and geophysical evidence. We interpret this evolution as two stages: initial thickening from North China–Yangtze collision, followed by extensional collapse and lithospheric thinning likely driven by Paleo-Pacific plate rollback. The North China Craton underwent two distinct crustal stages, characterized by thickening due to Mesozoic collision, followed by extensional collapse and lithospheric thinning likely driven by PaleoPacific plate rollback, according to a crustal thickness reconstruction using Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios as well as εNd isotopic data of granitoids."

 Plant functional diversity is a key biodiversity indicator of ecosystem dynamics. Several studies have shown that spectral data from Earth observation satellites will enable us to map functional diversity over large areas. However, most studies only consider snapshots of such data in time, and our knowledge of the temporal variation of functional diversity across the World’s biomes remains sparse. Here, we use hyperspectral remote sensing and deep learning to explore multi-seasonal functional diversity patterns on a global scale. We show that functional diversity can be highly dynamic over time. These dynamics are biome-specific, driven by seasonal cycles and wet-dry periods. Our findings highlight that the role of functional diversity in shaping ecosystem dynamics can be unraveled only by incorporating seasonality into functional diversity mapping. Such a multi-temporal approach will enhance the robustness of functional diversity assessments and deepen our understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental change.

Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries ( ), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced any hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person’s resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g. droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g. hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat. These results may help us anticipate public concern in a warming world and suggest promising avenues for future research."

We report growth rates for 14 experiments between −5.1 °C and −8.3 °C and observe strong variations depending on the cloud characteristics. Comparing our growth rates to laboratory data, we found similar temperature-dependent trends, but the laboratory rates are higher. These data fill the gap in quantitative in situ observation of ice crystal growth, helping to validate models and laboratory experiments. 
 Ice crystals are essential in the evolution of mixed-phase clouds, as ice crystals can quickly grow to large sizes by vapor diffusion and thereby trigger precipitation formation. Vapor diffusional growth rates of ice crystals were quantitatively studied in the laboratory for several decades, forming the basis of various ice crystal growth models. Since field measurements generally only provide snapshots that lack information on ice crystal age or changes induced by cloud processes, significant gaps remain in quantitative field observations, impeding the validation of laboratory experiments and models.Our study addresses this gap through innovative glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments in persistent low-level stratus clouds in the CLOUDLAB project.  The controllability and repeatability of our seeding experiments facilitates the quantification of diffusional ice crystal growth rates in natural clouds via in situ measurements. We report growth rates of 0.17–0.81 µm s−1 (major axis of pristine ice crystals) from 14 seeding experiments between −5.1 and −8.3 °C. We also observe how microphysical characteristics induce strong variations in the growth rates, e.g., reduced growth rates in seeding-induced regions of high ice crystal number concentrations. For better comparison to laboratory and non-seeded clouds, we developed two filtering methods to isolate growth conditions less affected by the experimental setup. The comparison shows that the temperature-dependent growth rate variations align with laboratory data, whereas absolute laboratory values are higher. Our findings provide valuable insights into the vapor diffusional growth of ice crystals in natural clouds and connect in situ observations with laboratory and modeling studies."

Jones;Thomas Röckmann,Amazon rainforest ecosystem exchange of CO2 and H2O through turbulent understory ejections,"Understory ejections are distinct turbulent features emerging in prime tall-forest ecosystems. We share a method to isolate understory ejections based on H2O–CO2 anomaly quadrants. From these, we calculate the flux contributions of understory ejections and all flux quadrants. In addition, we show that a distinctly depleted isotopic composition can be found in the ejected water vapour. Finally, we explored the role of clouds as a potential trigger for understory ejections. 
 We investigate the role of short-term variability in the mean ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapour. Specifically, we focus on quantifying how the intermittent turbulent exchange at the forest–atmosphere interface  –  characterised by sweeps, ejections, and outward/inward interactions  –  contributes to the mean exchange. To this end, we analyse observations of high-resolution (isotopic) flux measurements taken at 25 m above the forest canopy at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) during the dry season. We identify short-term turbulent eddies that eject carbon dioxide and water vapour from the understory (0–15 m) into the atmosphere. The H2O ejected from the understory is shown to be depleted in deuterium (2H) by 10 ‰ compared to H2O originating from the top canopy. We show that this matches the depleted water isotopic compositions found in understory leaf and soil samples. The diurnal cycle of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 is presented as a function of the sweeping and ejection motions and understory flux contributions. Understory contributions average 1.4 % of NEE, but they can reach up to 20 %. In exploring the connection between intermittent canopy turbulence and cloud passages, we found a weak relationship (r=0.027) between cloud passages and ejections, without a predominant influence of large clouds. These findings deepen our understanding of the gas exchange of the Amazon rainforest, which may ultimately allow decision-makers to incorporate policies that can prevent the region's transition from a carbon sink to a source."

 In this work, glutamic acid (Glu) was selected as a model amino acid (AA) to investigate its complexation with Fe(III) and Fe(II), focusing on its impact on the Fenton reaction and the photolysis of Fe(III) in the cloud aqueous phase. Glu was found to enhance the rate constant for the reaction of Fe(II)–Glu with H2O2 to 1.54 ± 0.13 × 104 M−1 s−1, which is significantly higher than that of classic Fenton reactions (∼ 50–70 M−1 s−1). In contrast, the photolysis quantum yield of the Fe(III)–Glu complex was determined to be 0.037 under solar-simulated irradiation, largely lower than Fe(III)–hydroxy complexes (0.216). In the overall process (Fenton or Fe(III) photolysis), it was found that •OH formation decreased in the presence of Glu. Additionally, the fate of Glu in the presence of Fe(III) was investigated as well as the oxidation process (driven by •OH and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction), which led to the formation of short-chain carboxylic acids and ammonium under simulated solar light. Interestingly, these two processes generated different primary short-chain carboxylic acids, indicating distinct mechanisms.

Cooper;Pavlos Kollias,Vertical wind and drop size distribution retrieval with the CloudCube G-band Doppler radar,"Current knowledge of the link between clouds and climate is limited by a lack of observations of the drop size distribution (DSD) within clouds, especially for the smallest drops. We demonstrate a method of retrieving DSDs down to small drop sizes using observations of drizzling marine layer clouds captured by the CloudCube millimeter-wave Doppler radar. We compare the shape of the observed spectra to theoretical expectations of radar echoes to solve for DSDs at each time step and elevation. 
 Macrophysical properties of clouds are influenced by underlying microphysical processes. In practice, there is often an observational gap in bridging the two. For example, our current understanding of aerosol–cloud interaction and cloud–climate feedback is hindered by a lack of robust measurements of the distribution of drop sizes within clouds, especially for the smallest drop sizes. Doppler radar measurements have proven useful in estimating rainfall drop size distributions (DSDs) but face an intermediate challenge of requiring a correction for the presence of vertical air motion. Recent advances in millimeter-wave technology have made radar measurements at increasingly smaller wavelengths possible, allowing for analysis of particle-size-dependent scattering effects to derive estimates of vertical winds and thereby DSDs. This work demonstrates a method of deriving range-resolved DSDs using Doppler spectra at 238 GHz measured by the CloudCube ground-based G-band atmospheric Doppler radar. The observations utilized are of marine boundary layer clouds during March and April 2023 in La Jolla, CA, USA, taken as part of CloudCube's participation in the Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) campaign. This method first identifies notches in the velocity spectra and compares them to the theoretical notch velocities predicted by size-dependent backscattering and terminal velocity models to estimate the range-dependent vertical wind. After removing the vertical wind, binned DSDs are retrieved from the zero-wind spectrum. Bulk properties of the precipitation are then derived, including the number concentration, liquid water content, characteristic drop size, and precipitation rate. For the case study presented here, calculated bulk properties are found to be relatively invariant to the forward-model assumptions made in the estimation of the full DSD retrieval. Validation of this method on larger volumes of data would make such retrievals useful tools in assessing physical models of drizzle."

The data can be useful to ecologists, microbiologists, and policymakers regarding microbial distribution, evolution, and biohazard assessment for glacier microbiome under global climate change. 
 Glaciers cover 10 % of Earth's land area and are a pool of carbon and nitrogen for downstream ecosystems. Microbes, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and other microeukaryotes, are the primary inhabitants of glacier ecosystems and are key drivers of carbon and nitrogen transformation. Among them, prokaryotes (including bacteria and archaea) are the most diverse and abundant.

The dataset comprises 2039 amplicon sequencing data points, 999 cultured bacterial genomes, and 208 metagenomes, covering ice, snow, and cryoconite habitats. The dataset contains 64 510 prokaryotic amplicon sequencing phylotypes, with a higher diversity in the Tibetan glaciers than in the Antarctic and Arctic glaciers, which were respectively enriched with Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Alphaproteobacteria. The dataset also contains 62 595 715 unique genes and 4501 prokaryotic genomes, a 35.5 % expansion from previous publications. Genes were annotated for those associated with carbohydrate-active enzymes, nitrogen cycling, methane cycling, antimicrobial resistance, and microbial virulence, revealing the dynamic microbial functions in glacial habitats. This comprehensive dataset provides standardized prokaryotic diversity, taxonomy, community structure, and genetic functions of glacial microbiomes. The data can be leveraged to elucidate ecological principles governing the distribution of prokaryotes, to gain insights into the key functional genes for supraglacial microbiomes, to build mechanistic models, and to identify any potential biohazards for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding climate change.

To fill this gap, we developed a four-decade seamless global daily 5 km SM product using multi-source datasets and deep learning models. This product has long-term coverage, spatial and temporal integrity, and high accuracy, making it a valuable resource for applications like SM trend analysis, drought monitoring, and assessment of vegetation responses. 
 Soil moisture (SM) data records longer than 30 years are critical for climate change research and various applications. However, only a few such long-term global SM datasets exist, and they often suffer from large biases, low spatial resolution, or spatiotemporal incompleteness. Here, we generated a consistent and seamless global surface SM product (0–5 cm) spanning 1982–2021 using a deep learning (DL) model. The model was trained with the GLASS-MODIS SM product and was designed to integrate four decades of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived albedo and land surface temperature, the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) SM, and terrain and soil texture datasets as input features. Considering the temporal autocorrelation of SM, we explored two types of DL models that are adept at processing sequential data, including three long short-term memory (LSTM)-based models, i.e., the basic LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and attention-based LSTM (AtLSTM), and a transformer model. We also compared the performance of the DL models with the tree-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, known for its high efficiency and accuracy. Our results show that all four DL models outperformed the benchmark XGBoost model, with the AtLSTM model achieving the highest accuracy on the test set, particularly at high SM levels (>0.4m3m-3). These results suggest that under some challenging conditions, utilizing temporal information and adding an attention module can effectively enhance the estimation accuracy of SM. Subsequent analysis of attention weights revealed that the AtLSTM model could automatically learn the necessary temporal information from adjacent positions in the sequence, which is critical for accurate SM estimation. The best-performing AtLSTM model was then adopted to produce a four-decade seamless global SM dataset at 5 km spatial resolution, denoted as the GLASS-AVHRR SM product. Validation of the GLASS-AVHRR SM product using 45 independent International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) stations prior to 2000 yielded a median correlation coefficient (R) of 0.73 and an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.041 m3 m−3. When validated against SM datasets from three post-2000 field-scale COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) networks, the median R values ranged from 0.63 to 0.79, and the median ubRMSE values ranged from 0.044 to 0.065 m3 m−3.  Further validation across 22 upscaled 9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) core validation sites indicated that it could well capture the temporal variations in measured SM and remained unaffected by the large wet biases present in the input ERA5-Land SM product. Moreover, characterized by complete spatial coverage and low biases, this four-decade, 5 km GLASS-AVHRR SM product exhibited high spatial and temporal consistency with the 1 km GLASS-MODIS SM product and contained much richer spatial details than both the long-term ERA5-Land SM product (0.1°) and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative combined SM product (0.25°).

The deep CNN method showed a 70 % enhancement in subsidence prediction, with the study area experiencing over 38 cm of subsidence between 2014 and 2020. 
 Land subsidence, whether gradual or sudden, poses a significant global threat to infrastructure and the environment. This study introduces a hybrid approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) to estimate land subsidence in areas where PSInSAR data are unreliable or sparse. The proposed method trains a deep CNN using subsidence driving forces and PSInSAR data to learn spatial patterns and predict subsidence values. Our evaluation demonstrates that the CNN effectively mitigates discontinuities in PSInSAR results, producing a continuous and reliable subsidence surface. The model's performance was assessed using training, validation, and testing datasets, achieving root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 3.99, 8.47, and 9 mm, respectively. In contrast, traditional interpolation methods such as kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation yielded RMSE values of 61.60, 66.21, and 61.76 mm, respectively, on the test dataset. Additionally, the coefficients of determination (R2) for CNN, kriging, IDW, and RBF were 0.98, −0.06, −0.22, and −0.06, respectively.

This study integrates an intermediate-complexity snow-physics scheme into a sea ice model designed for climate applications. We show that modeling the temporal changes in properties such as the density and thermal conductivity of the snow layers leads to a more accurate representation of heat transfer between the underlying sea ice and the atmosphere. 
 Snow plays a crucial role in the formation and sustainability of sea ice. Due to its thermal properties, snow acts as an insulating layer, shielding the ice from the air above. This insulation reduces the heat transfer between the sea ice and the atmosphere. Due to its reflective properties, the snow cover also strongly contributes to albedo over ice-covered regions, which gives it a significant role in the Earth's climate system.Current state-of-art climate models use overly simple representations of the snow cover overlaying the sea ice. The snow cover is often represented with a one-layer scheme, assuming a constant density, no wet or dry metamorphism, or that no liquid water is stored in the snow. Here we implemented an intermediate-complexity snow-physics scheme (ISBA-Explicit Snow) into a sea ice model (SI3), which serves as the sea ice component for upcoming versions of the CNRM-CM climate model. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that a snow model with such a level of complexity has been incorporated into a sea ice model designed for global to regional applications. We validated our model by comparing 1D simulations with data from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) but also simulations from another advanced snow-on-sea ice model (SnowModel-LG), as well as simulations with the previous SI3 snow scheme.Our model simulates realistic snow thicknesses, densities, and temperatures, aligning well with SHEBA observations and SnowModel-LG outputs, while capturing their temporal variability. We show that the thickness, density, and thermal conductivity of the snowpack are significantly affected by the choices made in parameterization for calculating snowfall density and wind-induced snow compaction and by the choice of the atmospheric forcing. Unlike the previous SI3 snow scheme that assumed constant density and thermal conductivity, our model realistically simulates the evolution of these properties, resulting in more accurate temperatures at the snow–ice interface. Ultimately, our study shows that modeling the temporal changes in the density and thermal conductivity of the snow layers leads to more realistic upper sea ice temperatures and therefore to a more accurate representation of heat transfer between the underlying sea ice and the atmosphere."

To understand how climate change will impact FT, we conducted field monitoring in the Pekerebetsu River basin, Hokkaido, Japan, and calibrated a numerical model to predict FT changes. Field measurements show that erosion and deposition of colluvium depends on local snow cover, because snow insulates the ground when present and greatly reduces FT cycles. We then generalize our results using a calibrated soil temperature equation and climate model scenarios to predict how FT may change under future climate. When snow cover is ignored, FT is predicted to decrease in the study area due to future warming. However, when insulating effects of snow cover are included, the area is predicted to have little change in FT in some places, and potentially large FT increases in other locations. The impact of decreased snow cover tends to be greater than that of increased temperature."

Over 3,000 residential buildings are situated around the 7 km2 ${\mathrm{k}\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ forest, with many homes only 50 m away from the forest edge. We conducted high‐fidelity fire‐atmosphere simulations with the finest grid spacing of 4 m.

Fire‐weather conditions for the 2022/2023 New Zealand fire season were selected based on the Fire Weather Index (FWI). Data from previous fire field campaigns were obtained to represent a low‐intensity fire heat forcing. The results reveal a pulsing behavior in downwind heat transport when the forest canopy is included. Furthermore, the presence of the WUI is associated with extended downwind fire heat transport compared to WF and flat terrain scenarios. This study is the first to simulate atmospheric flows near fires in a WUI setting with such high fidelity. The findings highlight the critical role of WUI features in shaping fire‐atmosphere dynamics, though further research is required to disentangle the contributions of individual WUI components to these effects."

Further diagnostic analysis suggests that the enhanced planetary waves (PWs) may have developed from the broken PWs during the USLM. Simultaneously, the mesosphere of 30°–40°N contains additional wave sources associated with the baroclinic/barotropic instability. These enhanced PWs eventually cause the wind reversal.

This examination utilizes an updraft selection algorithm and statistical analysis of convective updraft characteristics previously developed based on observations of TC rainband convective updrafts. The selected updrafts are collectively analyzed by their spatial frequency, radius, azimuthal location (relative to the environmental 200–850 hPa wind shear and environmental 850 hPa mean flow), structural characteristics, and secondary circulation (radial/vertical) flow pattern. The observed updrafts compare favorably with the simulated updrafts. A wavenumber‐1 asymmetry is found, showing that convective updrafts in the downshear quadrants of the TC are more frequent. The radial flow of updraft circulations aligns with the prevailing vortex‐scale radial flow, which is governed by the environmental shear or low‐level mean flow‐induced asymmetry. Convective‐scale circulations are hypothesized to be significantly influenced by vortex‐scale radial flow at the updraft base and top altitudes. The bottom‐up decay of aging convective updrafts, caused by increased low‐level downdrafts, affects the base altitude and the subsequent radial flow of the updraft circulation. The findings presented in this study support previous literature regarding observed convective‐scale patterns of organized rainband convection in a mature TC."

Using the wet‐bulb globe temperature, we reveal summer CHHEs exhibited consistently increasing trends across the China Land Monsoon (CLM) region during 1961–2022, significantly in the northeast and southwest. The 13‐year sliding correlations indicate that since 2000, the British Okhotsk Corridor (BOC)‐Silk Road Pattern (SRP) nexus shifted from a strong to weak state, which influenced CHHEs variability. During the weak BOC‐SRP nexus period, an anomalous high‐pressure system dominated northern China, especially northeastern CLM, and was intensified by negative potential vorticity anomalies through subsidence and diabatic heating. Simultaneously, abundant moisture transport from the western Pacific into northeastern CLM reinforced hot and humid conditions, jointly increasing CHHEs. Over southwestern CLM, the high‐pressure system strengthened anomalous easterlies, which together with negative vorticity advection increased moisture divergence. Additionally, meridional temperature advection promoted warm air accumulation in the lower troposphere, further increasing CHHEs. Finally, the weak BOC‐SRP nexus is modulated by North Atlantic tripole sea surface temperature anomalies by Rossby wave energy divergence, as confirmed by Community Earth System Model simulations.

Numerical modeling of these storms is an important component for understanding the physical processes that cause significant impacts and for predicting their effects ahead of time. Initial and boundary conditions are an essential component to limited‐area modeling; variability in these conditions can significantly alter the simulations. While previous modeling studies have investigated sensitivities in model physics, there has been limited exploration of the impact of different initial condition sources; differences within these sources can include horizontal and vertical resolution, data assimilation schemes, and domain. This study aims at identifying the sources of variability from the initialized atmospheric fields within four different sets of initial conditions and their impact on the prediction of winter precipitation processes. The key finding was that relative humidity across different initial and boundary conditions produced the most uncertainty on the model simulation, while variability in temperature or synoptic conditions had a minor role. To explain the precipitation differences seen during the simulations, vertical profiles of relative humidity and temperature were connected to microphysical hydrometeor species tracked within the model. The findings suggested that relative humidity differences are heavily linked to precipitation accumulation discrepancies and were the main source of variability from the initial conditions. These results call for the development of more accurate relative humidity profiles for model initial and boundary conditions."

The concurrence of different types of droughts and high temperatures, commonly termed compound drought and hot events (CDHEs), including compound meteorological drought‐hot events (CMDHEs), compound agricultural drought‐hot events (CADHEs), and compound hydrological drought‐hot events (CHDHEs), has received increasing attention due to their larger impacts than single events. Although different CDHEs have been evaluated separately, the linkages among them have seldom been quantified. Using monthly hydroclimatic variables, we evaluated spatial variations and temporal linkages of different CDHEs from 1952 to 2021. High frequencies of different CDHEs are observed in regions such as northeastern South America, central Africa, and southeastern China. The strong synchronous linkages among CDHEs, defined as the likelihood of simultaneous CADHEs/CHDHEs conditional on CMDHEs, are observed in low‐latitude regions, which are related to drought propagations. Additionally, cascading linkages, defined as the empirical likelihood of subsequent CADHEs/CHDHEs conditional on CMDHEs, are also modulated by temperature persistence. For different climate types, the strongest linkages are observed in equatorial climates, while the weakest linkage is found in snow climates. These findings provide critical insights for developing cross‐sectoral mitigation strategies to reduce CDHE‐related risks and enhance predictive capabilities for such compound events by considering their temporal linkages under global warming."

Due to their persistent nature, these quasi‐stationary waves (QSWs) provide a unique opportunity to improve subseasonal forecasts of extreme events. Here, we evaluate the skill of the ECMWF dynamical subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) forecast model to forecast QSWs in Northern Hemisphere winter. The model shows spatially varying prediction skill, with the North Pacific region showing the highest skill across all lead times studied (7–35 days). We find very large interannual and intraseasonal variability in the subseasonal skill of this North Pacific region. The interannual variability is statistically consistent across different S2S models, indicating that physical conditions varying from year to year influence the prediction skill. Further investigation shows improvements in the S2S skill under certain phases of the Madden‐Julian oscillation (MJO), under La Niña ocean conditions, during the westerly phase of the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO), and following the onset of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). These identified conditions may be windows of opportunity for better S2S QSW forecast skill.

Within urban contexts, the most marginalized groups are also the most affected by premature deaths and non‐communicable diseases, whose first preventable cause is nutrition. Here we analyze the potential of soil‐based urban agriculture (UA) in providing fresh and nutritious food to urban populations. Using the megacity of São Paulo, Brazil, as a case study, we identify spaces for UA considering natural and context‐related factors and select crops according to the gap between the current diet of the population and a reference balanced diet.

The results show that the average hectare of urban garden in São Paulo could provide healthy food to more than 600 people, while theoretical city‐scale implementations reach 13%–21% of the city's population. This demonstrates UA's high potential for significant fresh and nutritious food production but also the trade‐offs that emerge when upscaling its implementation.

The ABM simulates 38,447 farmers using the RANAS behavioral framework, based on household surveys and observed data. Model results confirm the hypothesized feedback: increased water from CDs led to an 11.9% rise in cotton and 36.1% in wheat areas, boosting incomes and increasing adoption of drip and borewell irrigation, particularly near CDs. While drip irrigation systems improve water efficiency and post‐monsoon groundwater levels, the saved water enables further wheat expansion—triggering a second supply demand feedback loop. These changes are spatially concentrated near CDs, exacerbating within‐catchment disparities. Overall, about 54% of the additional recharge is used for irrigation expansion, lowering groundwater levels by 1.0 m and reducing the net benefit of recharge interventions.

This study quantified the hydrological impacts of LUCC in China from 2001 to 2020 using high‐resolution data sets and an atmospheric moisture tracking model. Our findings revealed that LUCC had led to increased evapotranspiration (ET; 1.71 mm/yr) and precipitation (P; 1.24 mm/yr), while decreasing water availability (WA) (P − ET; −0.46 mm/yr). Specifically, forest expansion in the Eastern Monsoon Region and grassland restoration in the Tibetan Plateau and Northwestern Arid Region were the main factors contributing to higher ET.

We quantify the role of utility‐scale solar zoning ordinances on power sector decarbonization across the Great Lakes region (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) by integrating 2,474 unique rural zoning ordinances (covering over 90% of county subdivisions in each state) into a power system planning model. Our analysis focuses on deploying utility‐scale PV on agricultural lands, where most existing solar installations in our region are located. Relative to a hypothetical counterfactual without zoning ordinances, existing zoning ordinances cause an 18% decline in utility‐scale PV investment (by 8 GW) and cost (by $4.8 billion), primarily due to “silent” ordinances that implicitly block solar development by failing to address its land‐use. Investment shifts from PV to energy storage (900 MW), wind (300 MW), and natural gas plants (3 GW).

 Strain engineering is an effective approach to enhancing the activity of catalysts by tuning the electrical and geometric configurations. However, the impact of strain dimension on the sulfur redox kinetics and polysulfide adsorption configuration has yet been deciphered. Herein, we employ a biaxial-strained dichalcogenide catalyst with highly curved basal planes to activate the reserve metal atoms and realize efficient lithium-sulfur batteries. The high-dimensional strain enhances the exposure of Mo sites, thereby shifting the polysulfide adsorption mechanism from weak Li-S/Se bonding to strong S*-Mo bonding. Moreover, biaxial strain upshifts both d and p band centers, fostering the interfacial charge transfer and catalytic activity. Based on this mechanism, we obtain apparent correlations between biaxial strain and apparent activation energy for sulfur species conversion. This d-p hybridization dominated catalytic mechanism leads to obvious enhancement in capacity retention and rate performance. We showcase a 6 Ah-level multilayer pouch cell with a specific energy of 396 Wh kg–1 (based on masses of all components). Strain engineering is effective in modulating catalyst activity.

Here, the authors show that MDMs persist long-term in the brain after TBI and acquire a disease- and age-associated signature enriched in human TBI and AD brains. 
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an environmental risk factor for dementia and long-term neurological deficits, posing a significant public health challenge. TBI-induced neuroinflammation involves both brain-resident microglia and peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Previous research has shown that MDMs contribute to the development of long-term memory deficits, yet their long-term behavior following brain infiltration remains unclear. To address this, our study uses two complementary fate-mapping mouse lines, CCR2-creERT2 and Ms4a3-cre, for precise and lasting tracking of MDMs in vivo. Here we show that MDMs persist in the brain for at least 8 months post-TBI in both male and female mice. MDMs retain phagocytic activity for at least 30 days post-TBI, remain transcriptionally distinct from microglia, and display a gene expression profile associated with aging and disease. Moreover, we identify a core transcriptomic signature of MDMs shared across various mouse models and brain perturbations, which is also enriched in the brain myeloid cells of male subjects with TBI and Alzheimer’s disease patients. These findings enhance our understanding of MDMs' dynamics after TBI and inform future targeted myeloid-based therapies.

Here, the authors report transport signatures consistent with Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at both zero and finite magnetic fields. 
 AB-stacked bilayer graphene has emerged as a fascinating yet simple platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena of correlated electrons. Under large electric displacement fields and near low-density van-Hove singularities, it exhibits a phase with features consistent with Wigner crystallization, including negative dR/dT and nonlinear bias behavior. However, direct evidence for the emergence of an electron crystal at zero magnetic field remains elusive. Here, we explore low-frequency noise consistent with depinning and sliding of a Wigner crystal or solid. At large magnetic fields, we observe enhanced noise at low bias current and a frequency-dependent response characteristic of depinning and sliding, consistent with earlier scanning tunnelling microscopy studies confirming Wigner crystallization in the fractional quantum Hall regime. At zero magnetic field, we detect pronounced AC noise whose peak frequency increases linearly with applied DC current—indicative of collective electron motion. These transport signatures pave the way toward confirming an anomalous Hall crystal. Graphene systems have the potential to host Wigner crystal states at zero magnetic field. Here, the authors report transport signatures consistent with Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at both zero and finite magnetic fields."

 Organic electro-optic materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters. Their integration with other silicon photonic processes, nanofabrication complexities, and durability remains to be developed. While the required poling step in electro-optic polymers limits their potential and large-scale utilization, devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals suffer from slow bandwidth.

This study develops and tests HCS-3DX, a next-generation system for HCS analysis in 3D imaging and image evaluation. HCS-3DX is based on three main components: an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven micromanipulator for 3D-oid selection, an HCS foil multiwell plate for optimised imaging, and image-based AI software for single-cell data analysis. We validated HCS-3DX directly on 3D tumour models, including tumour-stroma co-cultures. Our data demonstrate that HCS-3DX achieves a resolution that overcomes the limitations of current systems and reliably and effectively performs 3D HCS at the single-cell level.

Here the authors introduce iodine anions into electrolytes to form interphases that adapt to morphology at the interface, lifting the dependence on high pressure. 
 All-solid-state lithium metal (Li°) batteries (ASSLMBs) are a promising next-generation energy storage technology due to their use of non-flammable solid electrolytes for enhanced safety and the potential for higher energy density. However, void formation and evolution at the interface between anode and solid electrolyte remains a major challenge, leading to accelerated performance degradation. Departing from traditional interfacial design strategies, here we introduce dynamically adaptive interphases, formed by controllable migration of pre-installed anions in solid electrolytes, to operate ASSLMBs stably under low external pressure. The interphases adapt to the Li° anode volume changes, maintaining close physical contact between the Li° anode and ‘rigid’ solid electrolyte under low or zero external pressure. The dynamically adaptive interphase enables Li° full cells to deliver excellent rate performance and 90.7% of capacity retention after 2,400 cycles at a current density of 1.25 mA cm−2. Notably, pouch cells with zero external pressure are assembled with 74.4% of capacity retention after 300 cycles. The present work resolves the critical issue of the continuous solid–solid contact loss between Li° anodes and high-modulus solid electrolytes, advancing the practical deployment of ASSLMBs as high-energy, sustainable electrochemical storage systems.

Here the authors present photoluminescent composites that combine subambient cooling with aesthetic colour, hydrophobicity and durability. 
 Passive radiative cooling offers a sustainable solution to reduce carbon emissions in space cooling by simultaneously reflecting sunlight and emitting thermal radiation. However, the super-white property of conventional passive radiative cooling materials poses challenges for large-scale urban applications by conflicting with aesthetic requirements and neglecting impacts on urban microclimate and pedestrian thermal and visual comfort. Here inspired by the biological photoadaptation of coral, we present photoluminescence-based aesthetic composites as innovative urban skins that harness the enhanced light conversion of rare-earth-doped phosphors while decoupling from light-scattering-based whiteness, providing cool colours with improved urban compatibility. These composites demonstrate effective spectral reflectance of over 100% and peak reflectance up to 141% in their emission regions, despite a moderate overall solar reflectance (90.2–93.2%). With vivid yet angle-insensitive green, yellow and red appearances, the composites achieve subambient temperature reductions of 2.2–3.7 °C compared with ambient air and 6.1–7.9 °C relative to their non-photoluminescent counterparts. Moreover, their moderate whiteness alleviates excessive thermal and visual stress induced by trapping of sunlight in urban environments. Featuring excellent durability, compatibility and stability, these composites offer a scalable solution for energy-efficient and aesthetically pleasing radiative cooling in architecture, textiles and beyond, advancing passive radiative cooling technologies towards diverse real-world implementations.

 Rainfall is the main trigger for debris flows in torrent catchments. A systematic analysis of the critical rainfall for debris-flow initiation in Austria is lacking. This study quantifies and compares rainfall events that historically triggered debris flows and fluvial floods in Austria and assesses the expected impact of climate change on the frequency and spatial extent of such events. We derive critical rainfall conditions using hourly rainfall estimates based on radar-rain gauge data for more than 3600 torrent events between 2003 and 2022. Past and future return periods are estimated based on an ensemble of regional climate projections covering three emission scenarios until 2100. We find that the regional variations of the critical rainfall patterns are greater than the differences between the types of processes. A general dependence of triggering rainfall on the antecedent rainfall cannot be confirmed. In a warming climate, both the probability of occurrence and the affected area in Austria are projected to increase for both process types and across all emission scenarios. However, these changes are unevenly distributed throughout Austria. The results indicate that regional-scale predictions can improve mountain risk management in a changing climate, while risk management for individual torrents will benefit from process-based understanding.

 The contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff variation have been examined in multiple individual catchments, but upstream-downstream interaction relationships remain underexplored. Here, we propose a three-tiered attribution framework to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, underlying drivers, and upstream-downstream relationships of runoff variations in the Yellow River Basin (1952–2021). The results indicate that the longitudinal cumulative effects of climatic (ranging from −8.6% upstream to 7.1% downstream relative to the whole basin) and anthropogenic disturbance (15.2%-92.9%) factors lead to higher risks of runoff variations in downstream regions, with more pronounced seasonal fluctuations (particularly in reservoir-regulated reaches). Glaciers, lakes, and reservoirs’ storage capacities cause lagged effects of climate change and human activities on runoff variations, while simultaneously serving as critical drivers for inter-basin water resource regulation. Integrating comprehensive understanding of multi-scale hydrological variability drivers and spatial interaction mechanisms is essential for advancing adaptive river basin management and sustainable water resources allocation.

 The European North-West shelf seas experienced a marine heatwave of unprecedented magnitude in June 2023. Quantifying the likelihood of reoccurrence of similar events is vital for mitigating impacts on marine ecosystems and human activities. Assessing the probability of such events is complicated by climate change-driven changes in the baseline conditions and the short length of the observational record with respect to modes of climate variability. Here, by employing a large ensemble of initialised climate model simulations, we show that the probability of June 2023-like events occurring is approximately 10% in any given year of the present-day climate. Moreover, there has been accelerating growth in the risk of occurrence over the last 30 years. The unprecedented nature of the record-breaking June 2023 event placed European marine heatwaves firmly in the public consciousness. However, the climate change trajectory means that whilst this event was unprecedented, such events should not be unexpected.

 Satellite-based remote sensing offers unprecedented opportunities for monitoring coastal dynamics at large spatiotemporal scales through proxies such as shoreline positions. Recent advances in computational tools and the accessibility of publicly available satellite imagery have made it feasible to derive these metrics efficiently using user-defined parameters (e.g., band combinations, segmentation algorithms, and preprocessing steps). This abundance of data and tools, coupled with increasing computational power, suggests that global-scale monitoring of shoreline change is within reach. However, efforts to develop continental-to-global shoreline change datasets remain limited, partly due to challenges associated with varying environmental conditions and the lack of standardized algorithms. Yet, quantitative relationships between errors in the satellite-derived observations and environmental conditions remain unexplored. Also, the large body of available methods for satellite-derived waterline (SDW) extraction has merely been inter-compared. In this study, we built on previous works to develop a customizable open-access SDW extraction Python toolkit. We assess the influence of spectral band combination and segmentation method on the accuracy of waterline and shoreline positions derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat optical imagery, comparing 20 SDW extraction methods in total. By evaluating the performances of these extraction methods across eight sandy coast sites using in-situ beach elevation profiles and FES2022 tide model outputs, we highlight the systematic gap between SDW performances obtained at microtidal and meso- to macrotidal environments. We found that SDW/SDS accuracy at microtidal sites is slightly influenced by the choice of band combination, while the accuracy at meso- to macrotidal sites is rather impacted by the choice of thresholding method. We also validated related satellite-derived metrics, such as long-term trends, interannual variability, and seasonal cycles of shoreline change, as well as beach slopes, and found that there are generally well captured by the top-performing SDW methods, with errors in long-term trend, interannual variability and seasonal cycle amplitude estimations around 0.8 m/yr, 2 m, and 2.5 m, respectively. Finally, we address the issue related with low signal-to-noise ratio in SDS time series, emphasizing the necessity to quantify and mitigate noise by aggregating data over time, and propose empirical laws quantifying errors in shoreline position time series as a function of the inverse beach slope and the tidal excursion, meaning tidal range normalized by the beach slope. These results provide a critical framework for first order estimation of the accuracy of satellite-derived shoreline positions derived at sites lacking validation data, and bring insightful materials to discuss methodological challenges related to large-scale, automated shoreline monitoring, highlighting strengths and limitations of Sentinel-2- and Landsat-derived observations, beyond the sole coastal monitoring field."

 Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) are essential land variables for environmental monitoring and climate modeling. High resolution (≤30 m) gap-free LAI/FAPAR products are in high demand, but frequent cloud contaminations in optical data cause substantial data gaps. To address the ill-posed nature of land surface variable inversion by leveraging time-series information instead of traditional pixel-based inversions, this study presents a temporal deep learning model that jointly estimates gap-free, 20 m/5-day LAI/FAPAR from integrated Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2 sequential observations, denoted as High-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) LS20 LAI/FAPAR products, part of the Hi-GLASS level 3 product suite. A hybrid Bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism that synergizes multiple satellite observations effectively under different cloud cover conditions was trained on representative samples derived from GLASS LAI/FAPAR and 30 m land cover data, accounting for site heterogeneity. The algorithm was directly validated against 4046 in-situ measurements from 29 validation sites, achieving an R2 of 0.79 for LAI and 0.86 for FAPAR, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.0 for LAI and 0.155 for FAPAR. Intercomparisons with existing high and coarse resolution products showed superior continuity and accuracy. To implement the model, we constructed Landsat and Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data (LSARD) and generated the first 20 m gap-free LAI/FAPAR product over China from 2018 to 2023 (www.glasss.hku.hk). We also provide a web tool on Google Colab that can calculate LAI/FAPAR for any region of interest. Unlike methods that rely solely on clear-sky pixels from a single sensor, our approach enables spatiotemporally continuous and physically consistent LAI/FAPAR estimates from multiple sensors."

 Wildfires are recognized as essential climate variables (ECVs) due to their widespread impacts on ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, and the global carbon cycle. Accurate and scalable burned area mapping is therefore critical. However, conventional indices such as the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) are prone to commission errors, often misclassifying unburned vegetation, clouds, shadows, or snow as burned. This study introduces the Automated Temporal Burn Index (ATBI), which leverages the co-occurring spectral signature of fire (NIR↓ and SWIR↑) through a multiplicative formulation. The differenced ATBI (dATBI) measures pre–post fire changes, while the multi-temporal variant (dATBItm) incorporates a fixed pre-fire image with multiple post-fire scenes to capture fire progression and suppress transient noise. This study evaluated dATBI and dATBItm across 50 wildfire events worldwide using Landsat imagery in Google Earth Engine, benchmarking against dNBR and its multi-temporal version (dNBRtm). Validation with Random Forest reference classifications showed that dATBI achieved substantially higher precision (∼0.92 vs. 0.73), higher F1 scores (∼0.94 vs. 0.84), and slightly better separability (M = 1.38 vs. 1.29) than dNBR, while maintaining similar recall. ROC analysis confirmed superior discrimination, with dATBI consistently reducing false positives at low false positive rates. Threshold analysis revealed that dATBI is far less sensitive to class break adjustments than dNBR, enabling more consistent severity mapping across ecosystems. The multi-temporal dATBItm further improved robustness, accurately reconstructing cumulative burn scars across boreal, tropical, Mediterranean, and savanna ecosystems while suppressing cloud, shadow, and snow artifacts. Finally, sensitivity tests demonstrated that SREM-corrected reflectance yielded cleaner dATBI outputs than standard LaSRC products, underscoring the importance of preprocessing. Overall, dATBI and dATBItm provide reliable alternatives to dNBR for operational burned area monitoring. Their robustness to commission error, threshold variability, and atmospheric noise makes them suitable for integration into large-scale wildfire assessment and climate resilience strategies."

 Geoportals have become essential tools for accessing and analyzing geospatial data, facilitating open spatial data sharing and online geo-information management. They typically follow interaction logic similar to common GIS systems and use a layered visualization structure. However, these designs can make geoportals less accessible to non-expert users, who may find complex functionalities overwhelming and struggle with overlapping data layers that obscure spatial relationships.To address these challenges, we propose a step towards a barrier-free GeoQA Portal enabling natural language interaction with geospatial data using a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework. User queries are decomposed into individual subtasks and handled by distinct LLM agents. Our portal can process complex spatial queries and extract geographic data relevant to user interests. Additionally, task plans are presented to users, improving transparency and engagement. The portal supports both default and user-provided data, flexibly addressing diverse user needs. We enhance accessibility via semantic search using word vector similarity, allowing users to retrieve relevant data even if terms or spellings are imperfect. Through case studies, system evaluation, and user testing, we demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in meeting the geospatial data access and analysis needs of non-expert users. The results highlight how our portal bridges the gap between complex GIS workflows and public data accessibility, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly solution for future geoportal development."

 Dongguan, a global manufacturing hub and megacity in the central Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, faces challenges in balancing air quality improvement with economic growth. The dynamic changes in PM2.5 and their coordination with ozone provide a crucial basis for air quality policy-making, and are applicable to other fast-developing cities worldwide. This study analyzed trends in PM2.5 composition, sources, and interactions with ozone from 2018 to 2023. While PM2.5 decreased significantly (3.76 μg m−3 yr−1) along with its inorganic components (SO42−, NO3− and NH4+, ranging from −0.57 to −0.34 μg m−3 yr−1), secondary organic aerosol (SOA) conversely increased (+0.18 μg m−3 yr−1).

 This study examines hailstorm hazards and losses in the Netherlands by combining high-resolution radar-based maximum expected hail size (MEHS) data, weather station observations, and reanalysis data with a unique agricultural asset-level insurance loss dataset. We analyse hail climatology to identify the spatial and temporal characteristics of hail events and their impacts on agricultural buildings. Using correlation and regression methods, we assess optimal MEHS thresholds and spatial scales for aggregated damage analysis. The findings indicate that a 1.5 cm MEHS threshold with a one-digit postal code level of aggregation provides the strongest correlation with reported losses. In addition, we utilise random forest models to evaluate the predictive power of underlying meteorological variables linked to convective systems, thus identifying potential proxy variables for hailstorm hazard and associated losses. The random forest evaluation shows that models that use ERA5 data have good overall performance. These models consistently prioritise convective-related variables such as convective inhibition (CIN) and convective available potential energy (CAPE), in addition to the less frequent variables such as (dewpoint) temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, using the entire time series of the period of interest, we can first predict hail days and then use a model to identify days with hail large enough to cause significant damage.

We used publicly available high-resolution satellite-derived estimates of NDVI and population, baseline disease rates from the Global Burden of Disease study, and a hazard ratio of the association between NDVI and all-cause mortality from an epidemiological meta-analysis.

Despite modest global average changes in NDVI from 2014–2018 to 2019–2023, NDVI has changed by over ±20% in individual cities. Median regional changes were largest in South-eastern Asia (−0.022), Sub-Saharan Africa (−0.010) and Eastern Asia (+0.014) and most stable in arid climates (<0.000).

This review provides a detailed analysis of the atmospheric chemistry of Hg in both the lower and the upper atmosphere, together with a synthesis of the latest kinetic, thermochemical, photochemical, and isotopic fractionation data. 
 Mercury is a volatile heavy element with no known biological function. It is present in trace amounts (on average, ∼ 80 ppb) but is not geochemically well blended in the Earth's crust. As a result, it occurs in extremely high concentrations (up to a few percent) in certain locations. It is found along tectonic plate faults in deposits of sulfide ores (cinnabar), and it has been extensively mobilized during the Anthropocene. Mercury is currently one of the most targeted global pollutants, with methylmercury compounds being particularly neurotoxic. Over 5000 t of mercury is released into the atmosphere annually through primary emissions and secondary re-emissions. Much of the re-emitted mercury resulting from exchanges with surface reservoirs is related to (legacy) human activities, such as direct releases. Understanding the dynamics of the global Hg cycle is critical for assessing the impact of emission reductions under the UN Minamata Convention, which became legally binding in 2017.

 A beam-aware columnar vertical profile (BA-CVP) methodology that incorporates data of the national German operational radar network with the aim of augmenting vertically pointing cloud radars is introduced. The method uses polarimetric radar data collected in plan position indicator (PPI) scans of multiple operational radars and considers the contributions of each operational radar in a beam-aware manner. The results of the method are paired with measurements of a vertically pointing cloud radar located in range of the operational radars and compared to measurements of dedicated scanning radars collected in range–height indicator (RHI) scans for two different case studies. The combination of side-looking operational radars in the BA-CVP format with a vertically pointing cloud radar allows the simultaneous exploitation of polarimetric multi-frequency observations including radar variables like the differential reflectivity, the dual-wavelength ratio, Doppler fall-speed and linear depolarization ratio measurements to study the microphysical properties of hydrometeors while not having to rely on the availability of dedicated scanning radars. The extracted BA-CVPs based on operational data deliver good results with respect to resolving finer details in radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity when compared to measurements of dedicated radars. Usage of differential phase measurements is discussed as marker for high hydrometeor attenuation affecting the measurements of radars far from the point of interest.

Radars under test included the two magnetron-based radars CHILL and SPLASH (its mobile version) from CSU and EPFL's new solid-state radar StXPol.For the CHILL and SPLASH calibration measurements in Colorado, a mobile lifting platform was employed that elevated the target simulator instrument to approximately 15 m above ground. The creation of virtual targets with polarimetric signatures allowed for a direct calibration of polarimetric variables. While the SPLASH radar exhibited good Zdr and sufficient Zh accuracy, remarkable precision and stability were found in CHILL's reflectivity data time series, where the reflectivity bias compared to the virtual target was less than 0.2 dB over a 1 h time series.Calibration issues that arise with solid-state radar systems were investigated with experiments conducted with the EPFL StXPol radar. This pulse compression system transmits a linear frequency-modulated long pulse as well as a non-modulated short pulse for observations at close ranges. The two pulses are separated in frequency by 50 MHz, and consequently calibration targets were generated independently for the two channels. Excellent stability and accuracy were found for Zdr in both channels. While Zh stability was also very high, a large reflectivity bias in both the long and the short pulse channel was detected.For the first time, the article introduces and analyzes a weather radar calibration procedure that is based on electronically generated radar targets. Experimental data suggest that precise absolute and differential calibrations can be achieved if data are obtained in an environment free from multipaths and if the generated targets are precisely located in the center of the radar's range gate. Experimental shortcomings associated with limited sampling resolution of the radar scan over the targets are also investigated."

We compiled a global database of soil microbial communities and potential driving factors, such as climate, soil and vegetation. Our database included soil bacterial and fungal diversity indices and compositions. Researchers can examine which ecosystems and locations have high bacterial and fungal diversities and where the dominant bacterial and fungal compositions exist. 
 Few scholars have compiled databases of soil microbial communities and associated climate, soil and vegetation factors at the global scale. However, many studies involving high-throughput sequencing of soil bacteria and fungi have been published in the past decade. In this study, we constructed a global database of the soil microbial communities and the associated climate, soil and vegetation factors, with sites on each of the seven continents and eleven ecosystem types. There were 8490 sets of soil bacterial and fungal community data for the different treatments and study sites in the database. Soil bacterial and fungal diversities were highly variable across various ecosystems. There was a highly significant (R2 = 0.4037, P < 0.001) linear regression relationship between the fungal and bacterial Shannon indices. Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the most species-rich bacterial and fungal phyla, respectively, in most ecosystems. The median relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were 29.30 % and 57.49 %, respectively. The information (e.g., site names and ecosystem types) in the database enabled researchers to investigate where the most abundant bacterial or fungal phylum was located and whether the ecosystem type affected bacterial and fungal diversities and compositions at the global scale. We anticipated that this database could be further improved by adding more detailed information, such as bacterial and fungal compositions at the class, order, family, and genus levels. The database was available via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16195889 (Chen et al., 2025)."

This can be described by the conductivity curve that accounts for water filling up small spaces, sticking to grains in films, and water vapour diffusion. This paper introduces a relatively simple model for this curve that needs one fewer parameter than most others. It works well for most soils, but some need the extra parameter. The paper also presents a computer program to determine the parameter values of this and other models. 
 Several current models for the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity curve consider the conductivity of the domains of capillary water in water-filled pores and adsorbed water in films on soil grains, as well as an equivalent conductivity for water vapour diffusion. These models rely on unrealistic configuration of the domains. A junction model is introduced that sidesteps this problem by assigning all liquid water to films (dry range) or to capillaries (wet range). Combined with a sigmoidal junction model for the soil water retention curve, it has up to six fitting parameters, one fewer than the other multi-domain models. Tests on data for 13 soils show that the junction model and an additive model (that adds all domain conductivities) often produce good fits. Models with six or more parameters may be overparameterized for many soils, giving the more parsimonious junction model an advantage, but for some soils, the extra parameter of the additive model is needed to achieve a good fit. This paper and a user manual document a Fortran code (KRIAfitter) that uses the shuffled complex evolution algorithm to fit the junction, additive, and four other conductivity models for any combination of fixed and fitting parameters or their log transforms. KRIAfitter either maps the root mean square error in the entire parameter space in order to then constrain the parameter space around the likely global minimum or generates many fits and uses those to calculate statistics for individual parameters, as well as the covariance and correlation matrices."

Here, we analyze the global alignment of principal horizontal tectonic stresses, fault traces, and river flow directions to infer whether and how deep subsurface stresses control geomorphic features. We find that fault trace orientations are consistent with predictions from Anderson's fault theory. River directions largely align with fault traces and partly with stresses. The degree of alignment depends on fault regime, the source of stress, and river order. Extensional faulting is best predicted by stresses from lithospheric structure variations, while compressive faulting is best predicted by stresses from mantle flow. We propose a metric to quantify the relative influence of mantle flow or lithospheric heterogeneity on surface features, which provides a proxy for lithospheric strength."

Beyond climate sensitivity differences, regional climate feedbacks—like Arctic sea‐ice loss—drive model uncertainty of the climate response. By applying emergent constraints based on the observed global warming trend and a metric related to Arctic sea ice loss, we reduce uncertainty in projected air temperature and precipitation changes over high‐latitude land areas. Based on an imperfect model test, such projections outperform projections constrained using only the global warming trend or unconstrained projections. Compared to unconstrained projections, our approach reduces uncertainty by 22%–47% for temperature changes and 10%–51% for precipitation changes across different IPCC regions in the mid to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century under a middle‐of‐the‐road scenario."

This energy—in principle—could be a source for submarine melting, which scales with near‐terminus water temperature and velocity. Because near‐terminus currents are challenging to observe or predict, submarine melt remains a key uncertainty in projecting tidewater glacier retreat and sea level rise. Here, we study one submarine calving event at Xeitl Sít’ (LeConte Glacier), Alaska, to explore the effect of calving on ice melt, using a suite of autonomously deployed instruments beneath, around, and downstream of the calving iceberg. Our measurements captured flows exceeding 5 m/s and demonstrate how potential energy converts to kinetic energy EK $\left({E}_{K}\right)$. While most energy decays quickly (through turbulence, mixing, and radiated waves), near‐terminus EK ${E}_{K}$ remains elevated, nearly doubling predicted melt rates for hours after the event. Calving‐induced currents could thus be an important overlooked energy source for submarine melt and glacier retreat."

In this work, we present self‐consistent simulations of positive leader propagation, which include coupled treatment of electrodynamics and plasma physics. The unstable positive leader spontaneously undergoes channel cutoff and creates the conditions for the emission of dart leaders, that is, it accumulates a packet of negative charge at the intersection between cutoff and conducting channel segments. A residual conductivity in the cutoff section facilitates the conversion of the electric field enhancement into a traveling wave, which retraces and reionizes the channel.

Populations of neurons that rapidly respond to noxious stimuli or tissue damage have been identified in the spinal cord and several nuclei in the brain2–4.

Hunger, thirst or predator cues suppressed sustained pain, regardless of the injury type, by inhibiting parabrachial Y1R neurons via the release of NPY.

 In renewing tissues, mutations conferring selective advantage may result in clonal expansions1–4. In contrast to somatic tissues, mutations driving clonal expansions in spermatogonia (CES) are also transmitted to the next generation. This results in an effective increase of de novo mutation rate for CES drivers5–8. CES was originally discovered through extreme recurrence of de novo mutations causing Apert syndrome5. Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation. Our analysis of 54,715 trios ascertained for rare conditions9–13, 6,065 control trios12,14–19 and population variation from 807,162 mostly healthy individuals20 identifies genes manifesting rates of de novo mutations inconsistent with plausible models of disease ascertainment. We propose 23 genes hypermutable at loss-of-function (LoF) sites as candidate CES drivers. An extra 17 genes feature hypermutable missense mutations at individual positions, suggesting CES acting through gain of function. CES increases the average mutation rate roughly 17-fold for LoF genes in both control trios and sperm and roughly 500-fold for pooled gain-of-function sites in sperm21. Positive selection in the male germline elevates the prevalence of genetic disorders and increases polymorphism levels, masking the effect of negative selection in human populations. Despite the excess of mutations in disease cohorts for 19 LoF CES driver candidates, only 9 show clear evidence of disease causality22, suggesting that CES may lead to false-positive disease associations.

 Are widespread stereotypes accurate1–3 or socially distorted4–6? This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7–9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality.

Here we report a full-featured 2D NOR flash memory chip realized by an atomic device to chip (ATOM2CHIP) technology, which combines a superior 2D electronic device as a memory core and a powerful CMOS platform to support complex instruction control. The ATOM2CHIP blueprint includes a full-stack on-chip process and a cross-platform system design, providing a complete framework to bridge the gap from emerging device concept to an applicable chip. The full-stack on-chip process is a specially designed flow that incorporates planar integration, three-dimensional (3D) architecture and chip packaging, contributing to a high yield of 94.34% based on a full-chip test. The cross-platform system design handles both the 2D circuit design and the 2D-CMOS modules compatibility verification design, contributing to a highly complex, instruction-driven, full-featured chip with 8-bit commands and 32-bit parallelism. These results demonstrate an efficient system integration strategy that showcases the advantages of the 2D electronic system.

 As we age, many tissues become colonized by microscopic clones carrying somatic driver mutations1–7. Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited due to the challenge of detecting mutations in small clones. Here we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)8, a duplex sequencing method with an error rate lower than five errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted capture. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity simultaneously profiles large numbers of clones, providing accurate mutation rates, signatures and driver frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 blood samples from a twin cohort, we report an extremely rich selection landscape, with 46 genes under positive selection in oral epithelium, more than 62,000 driver mutations and evidence of negative selection in essential genes. High-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites are obtained for many genes: a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition or selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing provides a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.

 The amount of biological sequencing data available in public repositories is growing rapidly, forming a critical resource for biomedicine.

We present MetaGraph, a methodological framework that enables us to scalably index large sets of DNA, RNA or protein sequences using annotated de Bruijn graphs. Integrating data from seven public sources7–13, we make 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino acid residues across all clades of life—including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, animals and humans—full-text searchable. We demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective full-text search in large sequence repositories (67 petabase pairs (Pbp) of raw sequence) at an on-demand cost of around US$100 for small queries up to 1 megabase pairs (Mbp) and down to US$0.74 per queried Mbp for large queries. We show that the highly compressed representation of all public biological sequences could fit on a few consumer hard drives (total cost of around US$2,500), making it cost-effective to use and readily transportable for further analysis. We explore several practical use cases to mine existing archives for interesting associations, demonstrating the use of our indexes for integrative analyses, and illustrating that such capabilities are poised to catalyse advancements in biomedical research.

 Mutations that occur in the cell lineages of sperm or eggs can be transmitted to offspring. In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders1–3. Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq4 to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq5 of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways. Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.

 Even with the rapid development of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy conversion from fossil or synthetic fuels remains a challenge because, for example, combustion engines in long-range aircraft will still be needed in the upcoming decades1. Increasing their operating temperatures (1,050–1,150 °C (refs. 2–4)) is one option. This requires replacing single-crystalline Ni-based superalloys in the hottest sections of turbines by refractory-element-based materials, which exhibit much higher solidus temperatures beyond 2,000 °C (refs. 5–7). Here we introduce a single-phase Cr-36.1Mo-3Si (at.%) alloy that meets, for the first time, to our knowledge, the most important critical requirements for refractory-element-based materials: (1) relevant resistance against pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at elevated temperatures, minimum up to 1,100 °C, and (2) sufficient compression ductility at room temperature. Although strength and creep resistance in such alloys were already superior to Ni-based superalloys in several cases, oxidation/corrosion resistance, mandatory to withstand the combustion atmosphere, and ductility/toughness, needed for damage tolerance and device setting, still pose barriers for the development or application of refractory-element-based candidate materials. Any previous successful attempts to address the otherwise catastrophic oxidation of Mo and nitridation of Cr during oxidation suffered from a loss in ductility at ambient temperatures. A single-phase chromium–molybdenum–silicon alloy is described that exhibits compression ductility at room temperature as well as resistance to oxidation, pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at temperatures up to at least 1,100 °C."

 The ancient South Pole–Aitken impact basin provides a key data point for our understanding of the evolution of the Moon, as it formed during the earliest pre-Nectarian epoch of lunar history1, excavated more deeply than any other known impact basin2,3 and is found on the lunar far side, about which less is known than the well-explored near side. Here we show that the tapering of the basin outline and the more gradual topographic and crustal thickness transition towards the south support a southward impact trajectory, opposite of that commonly assumed. A broad thorium-rich and iron-rich ejecta deposit southwest of the basin is consistent with partial excavation of late-stage magma ocean liquids. These observations indicate that thorium-rich magma ocean liquids persisted only beneath the southwestern half of the basin at the time of impact, matching predictions for the transition from a global magma ocean to a local enrichment of potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in the near-side Procellarum KREEP Terrane. These results have important implications for the upcoming human exploration of the lunar south pole by Artemis, as proposed landing sites are now recognized to sit on the downrange rim and thorium-rich impact ejecta of the basin.

 Men are at higher risk of several cancer types than women1. For bladder cancer the risk is four times higher for reasons that are not clear2. Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer3. As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10, CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo—natural saturation mutagenesis—that can be extended to other human tissues. Sex bias and association with smoking history identified in the landscape of driver mutations and clonal expansions in normal human bladder tissue may explain the higher bladder cancer risk in men and smokers."

 Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of precision metrology1–6, operating near a standard quantum limit set by quantum noise4,7. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit8–15; however, there are practical difficulties in terms of scalability and measurement resolution requirements16,17. Here we adapt the holonomic quantum gate concept18 to develop a new Rabi-type ‘global-phase spectroscopy’ that uses the detuning-sensitive global Aharonov–Anandan phase19. With this approach, we can demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy on an optical clock transition that achieves directly measured 2.4(7) dB metrological gain and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. To this end, we introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light–atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-cancelling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily because of the global nature of entangling interaction and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits20–22.

 During DNA replication, the replisome must remove barriers and roadblocks including the transcription machinery1,2. Transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when there are collisions between the replisome and transcription machinery, and are increasingly recognized as an important source of mammalian genome instability3. How cells facilitate replisome bypass at sites of TRCs is incompletely understood. Here we show that the CUL3–KCTD10 E3 ligase senses TRCs and promotes remodelling of the RNA polymerase complex to allow replisome bypass. We found that the substrate adaptor KCTD10 interacts with the replisome and the transcription machinery and regulates both in unstressed conditions. These bivalent interactions allow KCTD10 to detect co-directional TRCs and facilitate higher-order assembly of KCTD10 complexes that recruit CUL3 to induce the ubiquitination and removal of the RNA polymerase factor TCEA2. In the absence of KCTD10, there is increased retention of TCEA2 and the RNA polymerase complex, causing an accumulation of TRCs and increased DNA damage. Our results demonstrate how replication can proceed through transcriptionally active regions, utilizing a unique bridging function of the CUL3–KCTD10 complex. These findings provide a framework for how the coordination between transcription and replication may contribute to the maintenance of genome stability.

 Nonlinear optics1 plays a central role in many photonic technologies, both classical2–5 and quantum6–8. However, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is typically determined during design and fixed during fabrication9, restricting the use of nonlinear optics to scenarios in which this inflexibility is tolerable. Here we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of χ(2) nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced χ(2) (refs. 10–16), and the programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrate spectral, spatial and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching grating structures1 in two dimensions. The programmability of the device makes it possible to perform inverse design of grating structures in situ, as well as real-time feedback to compensate for fluctuations in operating and environmental conditions. Our work shows that we can break from the conventional one-device–one-function paradigm, potentially expanding the applications of nonlinear optics to situations in which fast device reconfigurability is desirable—such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources7,17–19, all-optical signal processing20, optical computation21 and adaptive structured light for sensing22–24.

 Cognitive processes underlying behaviour are linked to specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the neocortex1–6. These patterns arise from synchronous synaptic activity7 and are often analysed as oscillations, but may also display aperiodic dynamics that are not well detected. Here we develop a novel analytical method decomposing patterned activity into discrete network events and use this approach to track gamma activity (30–80 Hz) in the mouse visual cortex (V1). We find that the gamma event rate varies with arousal and individual events can cluster in brief oscillatory bouts but also occur in isolation. Individual events synchronize neural firing across layers and promote enhanced visual encoding. V1 gamma events are evoked by patterned input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and suppressed by optogenetic modulation of the dLGN, suggesting that they support thalamocortical integration of visual information. In behaving mice, the gamma event rate increases steadily before visually cued behavioural responses, predicting trial-by-trial performance. Suppressing V1 gamma events impairs visual detection performance, whereas evoking them elicits a behavioural response. This relationship between gamma events and behaviour is sensory modality specific and rapidly modulated by changes in task objectives. Gamma events thus support a flexible encoding of visual information according to behavioural context. Using a new analytical method for tracking gamma band events in mouse visual cortex, flexible encoding of visual information according to behavioural context is shown."

Here, the authors report the development of a boron-free material based on a shear-stiffening polytitanosiloxane network through a metal-ion-mediated hydrogen bond enhancement strategy. 
 Shear stiffening gel (SSG) with prominent rate-dependent mechanical properties is promising for impact protection, but conventional boron-based SSG suffers from toxicity and corrosion arising from boric acid. Here, we design a boron-free supramolecular dynamic reversible network of polytitanosiloxane (PTS) based on the metal-ion-mediated hydrogen bonding enhancement strategy. Different oxidation states of Ti atoms in the network influence the charge distribution of the adjacent hydroxyl groups (Ti-OH). The electrostatic potential of the H-bond donor and acceptor could be effectively modulated by the Ti4+ and Ti3+ cations, thereby enhancing the H-bond strength. The resulting PTS SSG exhibits exceptional shear stiffening (~2800 times, 0.1–100 Hz), negligible corrosion, and low cytotoxicity (Grade 1). The PTS SSG is further explored for impact protection materials and flexible mechanical sensors in practice. The hydrogen bonding enhancement strategy also paves the way for developing dynamic reversible networks to fabricate next-generation smart materials.

 Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous risk loci associated with prostate cancer, yet unraveling their functional significance remains elusive. Leveraging our high-throughput SNPs-seq method, we pinpointed rs4519489 within the multi-ancestry GWAS-discovered 2p25 locus as a potential functional SNP due to its significant allelic differences in protein binding. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of rs4519489 and its associated gene, NOL10, employing diverse cohort data and experimental models. Clinical findings reveal a synergistic effect between rs4519489 genotype and NOL10 expression on prostate cancer prognosis and severity. Through unbiased proteomics screening, we reveal that the risk allele A of rs4519489 exhibits enhanced binding to USF1, an oncogenic transcription factor (TF) implicated in prostate cancer progression and prognosis, resulting in elevated NOL10 expression. Furthermore, we elucidate that NOL10 regulates cell cycle pathways, fostering prostate cancer progression. The concurrent expression of NOL10 and USF1 correlates with aggressive prostate cancer characteristics and poorer prognosis. Collectively, our study offers a robust strategy for functional SNP screening and TF identification through high-throughput SNPs-seq and unbiased proteomics, highlighting the rs4519489-USF1-NOL10 regulatory axis as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

Here, the authors report that chloroplast cysteine synthase complex regulates stomatal closure by integrating different stress signals via dynamically supplying cysteine for ABA biosynthesis. 
 Global warming intensifies drought and high light stress periods, causing severe water loss and decreased crop yield. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is the dominant signal governing stomatal closure and water loss. Here, we uncover three signaling axes triggered by soil dehydration and high light stress converging on the dynamic assembly of the cysteine-synthase-complex in chloroplasts (pCSC). We show that pCSC assembly triggers ABA biosynthesis and stomatal closure in response to the soil-drying signals, sulfate (axis 1) and CLE25 (axis 2), and the high light-induced oxylipin OPDA (axis 3). Loss of the pCSC increases sensitivity to soil-drying and impairs high light-induced stomatal closure. Our findings uncover that the dynamic assembly of the pCSC acts as a sensor hub, integrating local and long-distance stress signals to promote stomatal closure by supplying cysteine for ABA biosynthesis in guard cells. We applied this knowledge to generate a soil-drying resilient plant showing no growth penalty. Cysteine supply is crucial for ABA biosynthesis in plants.

 Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.

 Ferroelectric crystals have emerged as promising candidates for exotic optoelectronic platforms. However, the wide bandgaps of transparent ferroelectric crystals restrict their ultraviolet optical activity, hindering broadband photoelectric conversion. Herein, a hierarchical defect engineering strategy is proposed for ferroelectric oxides to achieve full-spectrum optical absorption and boost broadband self-powered photodetection. Based on the transparent calcium barium niobate crystal, red Ce:CSBN is designed through the cooperative isovalent substitution of Sr2+ and aliovalent substitution of Ce3+. Furthermore, a black Ce:CSBN crystal is fabricated via thermal reduction, which demonstrated ultra-broadband absorption from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared range. This extended absorption capability is attributed to the judiciously modulated oxygen vacancies. Consequently, self-powered photodetection is realized in the 250–5000 nm range with a high responsivity of >1 mA/W, representing the widest responsive range among all-known ferroelectric detectors. More impressively, a reversible red-black transition is achieved by controlling oxygen vacancy concentration.

 During the Last Glacial Maximum, changes in the thickness of the Patagonian Ice Sheet modified southern Andean topography. However, the resulting atmospheric feedbacks remain poorly constrained. Using an atmosphere–land coupled model, we isolated the climate response to prescribed ice-sheet thicknesses. Our results indicate that a thicker ice sheet generates a decrease in low level zonal winds, a westward shift in precipitation, a temperature increase along the western margin of Eastern Patagonia, and an increase in storm activity over Patagonia.

 Vegetables are central to sustainable food systems and healthy diets, yet climate adaptation research in agriculture has largely focused on staple crops, with less emphasis on vegetable farming systems. We conducted a systematic review of 60 studies to map adaptation responses in vegetable farming systems across Africa and explore how these responses address climate risks. Most adaptation efforts are concentrated in rural areas of Western and Eastern Africa, and primarily address water-related hazards, including drought, flooding, and erratic precipitation. Technological responses dominated, followed by behavioural responses and ecosystem-based while institutional options were relatively underreported. Urban agriculture, despite its importance for employment, income and food and nutrition security, remains underexplored.

Calcium-rich soils exhibited greater bacterial network complexity, which associated with enhanced soil functions. Within calcium-rich soils, rock and soil calcium were primary drivers of increased carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage and bacterial network complexity. The microcosm experiment confirmed that calcium-rich rock addition stimulated soil carbon and nitrogen cycling and enhanced bacterial network complexity, even in calcium-rich soils. These findings indicate calcium-rich parent materials can play a pivotal role in improving soil ecosystem services.

10.1016/j.rse.2025.115062,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇研究论文主要关注喜马拉雅地区冰川湖泊的冰层厚度变化，利用遥感技术（SDGSAT-1和CryoSat-2卫星数据）来监测和估算冰川湖泊的冰层厚度。研究发现，自2010年以来，该地区的冰层厚度显著减少，尤其是在喜马拉雅东部地区。冰层减少的主要原因是气温上升和冰川加速融化。虽然论文使用了遥感技术，但其重点在于冰川湖泊的冰层变化，而非大气环境遥感，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['Lake ice thickness', 'Glacial lakes', 'CryoSat-2', 'SDGSAT-1', 'Remote sensing', 'Himalaya']",Meimei Zhang;Fang Chen;Weigui Guan;Hang Zhao,Rapid thinning of lake ice for Himalayan glacial lakes since 2010,"•SAM2 is effective at frozen water detection, with an F1 score exceeding 76.67 %. •The maximum mean ice thickness for 2010–2024 is 2.5 m. •The lake ice thickness decreased by up to 0.08 m/yr in Eastern Himalaya. •The lower ice is driven by the rising temperature and glacier ablation. 
 Lake ice, a significant indicator of global warming, plays a crucial role in regulating regional hydroclimate and maintaining lake ecosystem balance, in particular for the fragile high-mountain environment in Asia. However, the spatiotemporal variability of ice thickness in glacial lakes remains elusive due to limited and inconsistent observations, as well as the lack of a comprehensive glacial lake ice model that effectively couples ice layer dynamics with multiple physical fields, such as atmosphere and lake water. Although efforts have been made in applying lake ice model based on climate model outputs, the estimation of lake ice thickness largely overlooks the actual frozen lake conditions and remains constrained to highly glaciated regions. Therefore, a systematical method for automatically extracting ice-covered area and estimating the ice thickness in glacial lakes is critically needed. Here we employed SDGSAT-1 MII images to meticulously delineate ice coverage regions, and harnessed CryoSat-2 waveforms to derive ice thickness in glacial lakes across Himalaya. Then we proposed a novel lake ice model that was cross-validated by altimetric measurements, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.25 m for the whole Himalaya, to give a reliable estimation of ice thickness for 64 Himalayan glacial lakes large than 1 km2. The maximum mean ice thickness during 2010–2024 is 2.5 m, observed in Western Himalaya. Approximately 80 % of lakes are experiencing statistically significant reductions in ice thickness. The fastest decrease in lake ice thickness occurs in the Eastern Himalaya (up to 0.08 m/yr), and the thinning rates in the Western and Central Himalayas are comparatively lower, with the maximum values of 0.04 m/yr and 0.07 m/yr, respectively. Further investigations show that the associated lower ice is primarily driven by the notably rising temperature and accelerated glacier ablation. This research enhances the interpretations of SDGSAT-1 imagery signal from frozen glacial lakes, offering new possibilities for broader applications of SDGSAT-1 in cryospheric studies."

 Climate change is projected to intensify water stress in many ecosystems and poses threats to their stability, which can be quantified through ecosystem resistance and resilience. Relevant studies mostly focused on multi-year or annual droughts, and in spatially homogeneous or species-specific ecosystems. However, resilience and resistance within complex ecosystems, where different plants exhibit different adaptations and recovery behaviours, are less understood. Using productivity data from satellite-derived GOSIF (Global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 Solar-Induced Fluorescence) and flux towers, we examined vegetation responses to short-term (<1 year) water stress events from 2000 to 2018 along the North Australia Tropical Transect, which spans a 1600 mm rainfall gradient and transitions from seasonal mesic to non-seasonal arid ecosystems. We define resistance as productivity maintained during stress relative to a multi-year average baseline, and resilience as the extent to which productivity recovered one year after stress relative to the same baseline. Our results show that ecosystem resistance to water stress was lowest in semi-arid regions but higher in both arid and mesic regions, while ecosystem resilience showed the opposite pattern. These spatial patterns occurred regardless of seasonality and were mainly associated with dominant vegetation type. Woody savanna-dominated mesic regions exhibited highest resistance (0.82 ± 0.13, p < 0.001) and lowest resilience (0.26 ± 0.19, p < 0.001), shrublands in arid areas had intermediate values of both resistance (0.81 ± 0.14, p < 0.001) and resilience (0.27 ± 0.22, p < 0.001), while the grasslands in semi-arid regions had low resistance (0.78 ± 0.15, p < 0.001) and high resilience (0.38 ± 0.24, p < 0.001). The highest likelihood (>75.0 %) of full recovery (i.e., exceeding baseline after one year) occurred during the wet season in mesic regions, likely due to energy limitation, while arid regions showed a lower likelihood (57.0 %). This study provides a remote sensing framework for quantifying ecosystem resistance and resilience under water stress."

 Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) plays a critical role in coastal zone management, navigation safety, and marine environmental monitoring. However, conventional SDB methods are constrained by limited depth penetration and reduced accuracy, largely driven by water optical properties, environmental variability, and sensor limitations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel bathymetric mapping framework that integrates wave-based indirect depth inversion from photon-counting LiDAR data with multi-source remote sensing data. Specifically, a novel Progressive Adaptive Window for Local Period (PAWLP) algorithm is developed to derive water depth from ICESat-2 surface waves. By dynamically adjusting the analysis window to local wave variations, PAWLP enhances inversion robustness based on linear wave theory. In addition, we construct a multi-source SDB random forest inversion model by fusing multispectral imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), tidal height, and tidal velocity. To further improve model generalizability and reduce scene-specific noise, a temporal sample transfer strategy is applied. In this study, the proposed methods are validated using in situ bathymetry data from the U.S. Virgin Islands (clear waters) and from Bar Harbor (turbid waters). Results show that PAWLP adaptively captures local wave characteristics to retrieve water depth, achieving an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.56 m and weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 10.01 %, with reductions of approximately 17.89 % in RMSE and 19.46 % in WMAPE compared to the fixed-period method. The proposed multi-source bathymetric inversion framework further improves prediction accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 1.64 m in clear waters and 2.32 m in turbid areas, outperforming traditional methods across diverse conditions. The integration of SAR data and tidal features substantially enhances prediction stability, particularly under optically complex waters. Overall, this study highlights the potential of wave-based indirect depth inversion to extend the effective depth range for SDB. By integrating ICESat-2 bathymetric measurements with multi-source remote sensing data and temporal sample transfer strategy, our method enhances mapping accuracy and spatial coverage, mitigates optical saturation effects, and provides a scalable solution for reliable bathymetric mapping across diverse coastal environments."

 Rice blast (RB), a devastating fungal disease, causes severe yield losses worldwide and demands accurate severity quantification for effective management. Remote sensing has been demonstrated useful in disease monitoring and offers a scalable solution, but the phenology challenges the robustness of the model built for spectroscopic severity quantification. Since the variations induced by phenology are closely confounded with the infection progression, it is crucial to identify the specific plant traits that explain the inconsistency in disease severity (DS) estimation while mitigating the phenological influence. To address this issue, this study proposed a novel approach by extending the PROSPECT+SAIL model to account for the optical effects induced in RB-infected rice plants. By introducing DS into PROSPECT simulations based on spectral mixture analysis and lesion optical measurements, the use of RB-extended PROSPECT decreased the leaf simulation errors by up to 36.3 % in the crucial spectral regions for RB monitoring. Subsequently, such an extension enabled the generation of synthetic datasets for disentangling phenological versus RB-induced physiological effects. The sensitivity and disentanglement analysis revealed that leaf chlorophyll content was the primary factor that compromises the relationship between DS and the rice blast index (RIBInir), which was designed for RB severity quantification. After correcting for these effects by normalizing RIBInir with an optimized chlorophyll-sensitive vegetation index (nRIBInir), estimation accuracies significantly improved with an increment of R2 from 0.67 to 0.79, and rRMSE decreased by 9 %, particularly for vegetative samples with mild infection (R2 increased by 0.51). Consequently, the proposed nRIBInir overcame the underestimation of severe infection areas in both severity quantification and spatial mapping. The adapted nRIBInir for drone and satellite sensors also exhibited great performance in DS estimation. Our findings suggest that RB-extended PROSAIL simulations facilitate mitigating the phenological influence with reliable validations and mechanistic interpretation. Moreover, the adaptation flexibility and robustness of nRIBInir ensured its potential in practical applications including resistance breeding, disease tracking, and precision fungicide management at various scales."

 Accurate field-level rice yield prediction for an unseen year is valuable for optimizing precision farming practices and strengthening national food security frameworks. Although many studies have used vegetation indices or gross primary productivity (GPP) to predict crop yield, few have systematically evaluated their differences in predictive performance and stability using time series satellite imagery across the entire growing season. Simultaneously, little research has focused on field-level prediction for unseen years over large regions. To address these issues, we conducted an in-depth comparison between the Sentinel-2-derived normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) and high-resolution GPP generated via a modified two-leaf light use efficiency model in their correlations with rice yield. The optimal time window for yield prediction was identified using original and harmonic fitted GPP data at 10-day intervals. Additionally, cross-year GPP correction (CGC) was proposed as an efficient approach for model transfer to unseen years and compared with that of the adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA), an emerging data-driven domain transfer learning algorithm. Specifically, these methods were assessed with an extensive field-level rice yield dataset from eastern and northeastern China spanning 2019–2022.We found that GPP outperformed NDRE in predicting rice yield (individual monthly: ∆r2 = 0.04–0.29, cumulative monthly: ∆r2 = 0.22–0.41), with greater stability and reliability. Furthermore, the harmonic fitted GPP could improve the yield prediction accuracy. Additionally, the CGC method improved interannual prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.55–0.73) for the two regions, showing better predictive performance than the ADDA model (R2 = 0.54–0.62). The proposed method relied only on a limited amount of ground-truth yield samples and exhibited robust performance in years characterized by pronounced interannual yield variability (2019) or extreme weather conditions (2022). This research has great potential for implementing rice yield prediction over large regions with publicly available imagery and limited ground-truth yield data, particularly for smallholder farming systems in the context of precision crop management and food security assessment."

 The FireCCILT11 global burned area (BA) product, developed under the ESA Climate Change Initiative, spans nearly four decades (1982–2018) and is the longest nearly continuous global fire record currently available. Despite its growing use in high-profile studies, its performance has not been comprehensively evaluated. Moreover, while two earlier studies identified severe instrumental artifacts in the FireCCILT11 dataset, the supporting evidence in those studies was primarily circumstantial. Here, we directly assess FireCCILT11 BA using a suite of national fire history datasets and independently derived satellite-based BA products across eight countries. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in both the accuracy and consistency of FireCCILT11, particularly before 2001. FireCCILT11 frequently diverges from national records in terms of annual BA totals, exhibits poor spatial agreement at the pixel level, and suffers from high omission and commission errors. A pixelation effect further compromises its spatial resolution and usability. These findings suggest that FireCCILT11 is generally unsuitable for long-term fire regime analyses, especially in regions or periods not represented in its training data. We highlight the ongoing need for a robust, AVHRR-based global BA product and propose best practices for the development and evaluation of long-term BA datasets."

 Limited by existing imaging sensors, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures images with high spectral resolution but low spatial resolution. Many methods have been proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of HSIs, either by using an auxiliary image or by deeply exploiting the single input. This paper introduces an Iterative Guiding Network (IGN) that uses an iteratively updated internal high-resolution HSI to guide the super-resolution (SR) process, rather than an external image. The iterative SR process gradually learns the features. Meanwhile, a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module is designed to fuse features at different scales, and Feature Injection Modules (FIMs) with two innovative components are designed to bridge the gap between the input image and the reference image, making deep use of the information both images convey. Contrary to the intuition that internal images do not bring auxiliary information, experimental data and performance analysis demonstrate that this approach improves reconstruction results. For the classical airborne PAVIA Center dataset, our method achieves the highest PSNR of 37.0356 dB at 2×scaling and 29.5972 dB at 4×scaling, surpassing the best existing competitor by +0.5490 dB and +0.0497 dB, respectively.

 Evaluating long-term building reconstruction is essential to strengthen resilience to earthquakes. Field investigations provide detailed and accurate information for building assessments, but are often labour intensive, costly, and time consuming, particularly when considering the regional-scale impact of earthquakes. In contrast, satellite Remote Sensing (RS) techniques provide frequent data across vast areas, making them ideal for regional-scale post-earthquake assessments, which can complement field surveys. Despite this, most RS studies have relied on manual change detection of satellite data before and after the event, limiting their potential for automated assessment and reducing their support for field investigations. In this study, we developed a novel RS method designed to assist field investigations of post-earthquake building reconstruction on a regional scale. The method automatically identifies target buildings for field teams to investigate, locating collapsed structures or buildings that have changed due to post-earthquake reconstruction efforts. We applied Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) for the first time to evaluate post-earthquake building reconstruction. The proposed method involves a two-stage analysis: first, a grid-level assessment on a regional scale to detect areas with reconstruction activities following an earthquake, and then a detailed building-level analysis to identify individual buildings that have undergone changes as part of the reconstruction process within these areas. The method was used to assess building reconstruction efforts in Nepal after the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. For the MT-InSAR analysis, we acquired two stacks of 3-m-resolution SAR images, one before and one after the earthquake. The grid-level analysis detected multiple urban areas with significant changes, which were then subjected to a building-level analysis. This analysis pinpointed the locations of affected buildings and determined the extent of changes related to reconstruction activities. A comparison of the building-level results with field observations confirmed that the method successfully identified buildings that have undergone changes. These changes included buildings that were left in a collapsed state, demolished, under construction, or fully reconstructed. The MT-InSAR-based approach introduced in this study has the potential to serve as a valuable tool to guide future field surveys related to post-earthquake reconstruction, significantly reducing the time and effort needed for such assessment."

 Estimates of fractional cover (fCover) across given land surfaces are used to assess, and often model, vegetation composition and diversity, which are crucial for understanding the health and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Remote sensing provides a useful means for scaling local, plot-measured fCover estimates to regional scales. Leveraging a recently synthesized and harmonized plot database, this study generated wall-to-wall maps of fCover for six Alaskan-Arctic plant functional types (PFT), including non-vascular plants, forbs, graminoids, and deciduous and evergreen shrubs, using 20-m satellite data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ArcticDEM) using a machine learning regression approach, specifically the random forest (RF) algorithm, which is well-suited for handling nonlinear relationships and high-dimensional satellite datasets. This study additionally addressed the spatio-temporal inconsistencies e.g., sampling scale, plot size, and collection year in plot measured fCover by adopting a multivariate outlier detection approach—Cook’s distance—to identify high-quality plots for model training and validation. Our approach achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.59–0.93, root mean squared errors = 0.02–0.10 for all PFTs) between plot-observed and satellite-derived fCover when using high-quality plot samples.

 Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) contains a significant fraction of carbonaceous materials, which include organic- (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). These species significantly influence the global radiation balance and have negative health impacts. Although South Africa is an important emitter of carbonaceous aerosols, very little OC and EC studies have been published in the peer reviewed public domain. Therefore, the aim of this paper was augmenting the sparse OC and EC data for South Africa through a detailed assessment of an extensive dataset collected daily for 24 h over a period of 14 months at the regional background site, Welgegund. In total. 587 datasets were collected, which is the most comprehensive OC and EC dataset collected for this region. Seasonal OC and EC concentration patterns indicated significant contributions from open biomass burning in the months with highest fire frequencies, as well as contributions from household combustion during winter. In addition to these sources, the important influence of the industrial hub in the South African interior on OC and EC levels were also indicated. Meteorological conditions also contributed to increased OC and EC during the colder months. Since fire occurrences and population density decreased from east to west, OC and EC data associated with air masses mainly passing over eastern and western defined regions were compared. Although the differences were not as large as expected, statistical differences could be confirmed with air masses passing over the eastern region corresponding to higher OC and EC concentrations. Contextualization of OC and EC concentrations revealed OC and EC levels determined in this study were similar or slightly elevated compared to concentrations reported for other background sites. Furthermore, EC correlated well with equivalent black carbon (eBC), indicating that EC at this site can be used as a proxy for eBC at regional background sites."

 Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is identified as key sources of skill in winter subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts because of their surface impacts lasting up to 30–60 days through stratosphere troposphere coupling, despite their typical prediction being limited about 10 days. A better understanding of the predictability of the SSW itself, thus, is fundamental. Most of the previous studies investigate the predictability of SSW events using linear approaches, which are insufficient given the inherently chaotic and nonlinear nature of SSWs. In the study, we apply a nonlinear method—Backward Searching for the Initial Condition (BaSIC)—to quantify the local predictability limit the 2021 SSW event, which caused cold extremes across East Asia and North America. Using ERA5 reanalysis and the S2S reforecasts data, BaSIC estimates the maximum prediction lead time of this 2021 SSW event to be 17 days. To explore sensitive region of forecast uncertainty, we identify regions of fastest error growth via error tracking in S2S systems using BaSIC method. Forecast errors during the SSW event are small across the polar stratosphere after initiation but grow gradually over two weeks, accelerating rapidly over central Eurasia (30°-60°E) and spreading across the continent. This points to central Eurasia at high altitudes as a critical region for SSW forecast error development."

The East Asian trough and the Indo-Burma trough are also pronounced. The activities of the East Asian Winter Monsoon system are stronger than that of purely extreme cold events (ECEs)  over mid-and high latitudes, whereas weaker over mid-and low latitudes. This dynamic facilitates cold air intrusion and significant moisture transport, resulting in high frequency ECPEs. •Compared to M2, besides Siberia, M1 and M3 have additional cold air sources and a shared water vapor channel from the tropical Indian Ocean. Weaker convergences between southerlies and northerlies results in a lower frequency of ECPEs for M1 and M3. 
 Based on CN05.1 and ERA5 datasets, K-means clustering identified three atmospheric circulation patterns during extreme cold-precipitation compound events (ECPEs) in southern China from December to February (DJF) during 1979 to 2022. The second mode (M2) occurs most frequently and has the most spacious impact, which featured a mid-high latitudes one-ridge-one-trough pattern at 500 hPa, with persistent cold air from prolonged maintenance blocking ridge over Lake Baikal. Concurrently, the western northward-shifted western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and an active Bay of Bengal Trough enhanced southerly moisture transport from the tropical Pacific Ocean and tropical Indian Ocean, respectively, facilitating precipitation. This saddle-type circulation weakened mid-low latitudes cold air intrusion further to south but enhanced moisture transportation and upper-level divergence, triggering the development during ECPEs in southern China. Comparative analysis revealed that purely extreme cold events (ECEs) demonstrated significant correlation with intensified East Asian winter monsoons, characterized by a persistently extended East Asian trough and prolonged maintenance of the Lake Baikal ridge without active circulation anomalies over mid-low latitudes. This synoptic configuration facilitated enhanced southward penetration of cold air masses, resulting in more pronounced temperature drops across southern China compared with ECPEs. And southern China is located at the entrance of the upper-level jet, and during ECPEs, the jet core of the upper-level shifts more westward with stronger horizontal wind shear and divergence than during ECEs. This configuration facilitates ascent, thereby leading to extreme precipitation over the region. In addition, the first mode (M1) and the third mode (M3) are further studied by comparing with M2, as they have different sources of cold air and water vapor channel from the tropical Indian Ocean through the Indochina Peninsula to southern China. Therefore, M1 and M3 lead to less frequent ECPEs than M2."

However, no drifting snow model has presented this process so far. We established a drifting snow model considering particle fragmentation and investigated the effects of snow particle fragmentation on drifting and blowing snow. Our results show that fragmentation intensifies the sublimation of blowing snow and changes the airborne particle size distribution, which should not be ignored in current blowing snow models. 
 Fragmentation of snow particles  –  wherein freshly deposited dendritic crystals are rapidly transformed into smaller, rounded grains through collisions with the surface and other particles during drifting and blowing snow  –  plays a critical role in governing snowpack evolution and transport dynamics. However, existing models of drifting and blowing snow often neglect the effects of snow particle fragmentation, introducing uncertainties in the prediction of flow dynamics and sublimation rates. In this study, we incorporate a snow particle fragmentation model into a well-developed blowing snow model to quantitatively investigate the influence of fragmentation under varying wind conditions. Our results reveal that fragmentation within the saltation layer generates smaller particles, leading to an increase in mass flux and subsequently enhancing sublimation rates in drifting and blowing snow.  The effects of fragmentation on sublimation are more pronounced for suspension particles than for saltation particles, particularly when the friction velocity is less than 0.3 m s−1. This work highlights the critical role of collision-induced fragmentation, wherein dendritic crystals are shattered into smaller particles during transportation. This quantitative assessment of fragmentation impact on snow sublimation underscores its importance for improving the physical representation of drifting and blowing snow in snow transport models and for potential applications in snow hydrology and climate modeling."

Older pesticides, banned decades ago, are still found due to their release from soils, especially in summer. While levels of many have declined over time, some show new emissions from local or distant sources. Newer pesticides peaked during application seasons but declined after bans, though traces lingered. These findings highlight the lasting impacts of pesticide use and the importance of regulations. 
 This study investigated 48 current-use pesticides (CUPs) and 30 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in ambient air at a rural-agricultural site in the Czech Republic, with biweekly sampling over three and 10 years, respectively. Despite being banned decades ago, OCPs persist in the atmosphere, with revolatilisation from surfaces apparent in summer. Temporal trend analysis revealed decreasing atmospheric concentrations for several OCPs, which indicate long-term diminishing reservoirs in environmental compartments, especially soil. For β- and γ-HCH, o,p′- and p,p′-DDE, o,p′-DDD, o,p′- and p,p′-DDT, α-chlordane, and mirex, levelling off is observed, which points to recently enhanced secondary sources in the region or beyond, related to reversal of the direction of air-surface exchange in response to historic atmospheric depositions or recent mobilisation from ground compartments, such as water bodies, the cryosphere, or soils heated by wildfires.CUP concentrations peaked during application seasons, with multi-annual trends either insignificant or declining. For compounds like chlorpyrifos and fenpropimorph, declining trends aligned with regulatory bans, though their presence in the atmosphere was evident one-year after the bans, suggesting persistence."

This information is key for improving the understanding of these clouds, as they do contain ice and liquid water simultaneously, making them relevant for the precipitation budget and radiative balance of the Earth's atmosphere. The retrieval is based on elevation scans of polarimetric cloud radars and can therefore be flexibly applied. 
 To date, there remains a noticeable gap in reliable techniques for retrieving the shape and orientation of ice particles from observational data. This paper introduces a method using ground-based scanning polarimetric Doppler cloud radar to retrieve the shape and orientation of multiple hydrometeor types within deep mixed-phase clouds. Building on the strong performance of an existing method, which is effective in retrieving the shape and orientation of pristine ice particles in stratiform clouds, we extended this technique by analyzing the entire Doppler spectrum. The previously developed main-peak approach focuses only on the part of the Doppler spectrum with the highest signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve the shape and orientation of the dominant hydrometeor types within stratiform clouds. With the extended technique, referred to as the spectrally resolved approach, the section of the Doppler spectrum containing valid data points exceeding the noise level is analyzed by dividing it into five equally spaced parts. This allows us to retrieve up to five distinct velocity-segregated hydrometeor types. The technique utilizes range–height indicator (RHI) scans (ranging from 30 to 90° elevation) of the Doppler spectra of differential reflectivity (ZDR) and correlation coefficient (RHV) from a polarimetric Ka-band cloud radar. The potential of the improved approach is presented by means of two case studies. The first case demonstrates the effectiveness of the spectrally resolved approach, and in the second case secondary ice production is investigated. These findings contribute to a profound understanding of hydrometeor characteristics, shedding light on dynamic cloud processes, especially in the context of precipitation and ice particle formation."

 Palaeoclimate data hold the unique promise of providing a long-term perspective on climate change and as such can serve as an important benchmark for climate models. However, palaeoclimate data have generally been archived with insufficient standardisation and metadata to allow for transparent and consistent uncertainty assessment in an automated way. Thanks to improved computation capacity, transient palaeoclimate simulations are now possible, calling for data products containing multi-parameter time series rather than information on a single parameter for a single time slice. To confront transient simulations that span the last glacial-interglacial cycle with palaeoclimate data, we have compiled a multi-parameter marine palaeoclimate data synthesis that contains time series spanning 0 to 130,000 years ago. In 2020 Jonkers et al. (2020) published the first version of the PALMOD 130k marine palaeoclimate data synthesis and described our data synthesis strategy and the contents and format of the data product in detail. Here we present a major update of the data product that markedly increases both the spatial and temporal coverage. Version 2 of the synthesis contains 2,286 time series of eight palaeoclimate parameters from 475 individual sites, each associated with rich metadata, age–depth model ensembles, and information to refine and update the chronologies. Version 2 contains 468 time series of benthic foraminifera δ18O; 357 of benthic foraminifera δ13C; 423 of near sea surface temperature; 482 and 273 of planktonic foraminifera δ18O and δ13C; and 128, 111 and 44 of carbonate, organic carbon and biogenic silica content, respectively. Compared to version 1, all radiocarbon ages have been recalibrated and the age-depth models updated. In addition, near sea surface temperature estimates based on planktonic foraminifera Mg/Ca and on UK37' have been recalculated using a single calibration thus ensuring global comparability and comprehensive assessment of their uncertainty.

Green;Hugo Dominguez,A bound-constrained formulation for complex solution  phase minimization,"Our research focuses on improving the way we predict mineral assemblage. Current methods, while accurate, are slowed by complex calculations. We developed a new approach that simplifies these calculations and speeds them up significantly using a technique called the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. This breakthrough reduces computation time by more than five times, potentially unlocking new horizons in modeling reactive magmatic systems. 
 Prediction of mineral phase assemblages is essential to better understand the dynamics of the solid Earth, such as metamorphic processes, magmatism and the formation of mineral ore deposits. While recently developed thermodynamic databases allow the prediction of stable phase mineral assemblages for an increasing range of pressure, temperature and compositional spaces, the increasing complexity of these databases results in a significant increase of computational cost,  hindering our ability to perform realistic models of reactive fluid/magma transport. Presently, prediction of stable phase equilibrium in complex systems is therefore largely limited by how efficiently single phase minimization can be performed, as more than 75 % of the total computational time is generally dedicated to individual solution phase minimization. This limitation becomes critical for non-ideal solution phase models that involve both  a large number of chemical components, and mixing on a large number of sites, resulting in many inequality constraints of the form 0≤xlM≤1, where xlM is the fraction of element l mixing on site M.Here, we present a general reformulation of complex non-ideal solution phases from the thermodynamic database of Holland et al. (2018), which comprises equations of state for multiple mineral solid solutions appearing in magmatic systems, as well as multicomponent silicate melt and aqueous fluid phases. Using a nullspace approach, non-linear inequality constraints governing the site fractions are transformed into equality constraints, and the resulting problem is turned into an bound-constrained optimization problem, subsequently optimized using efficient gradient-based methods. To test our formulation, we apply it to several equations of state for solution phases known for their complexity and compare the results of our approach against classical optimization algorithms supporting inequality constraints.We find that the the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm yields by far the best performance and stability with respect to the other investigated methods, improving the minimization time of individual solution phase by a factor ≥10. We estimate that our new approach can improve the computational time of stable phase equilibrium by a factor ≥5, thus potentially allowing to model realistic reactive fluid/magmatic systems by directly integrating  phase equilibrium calculations in multiphase thermomechanical codes."

Recent observations link their formation to sublimating CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐ice blocks that slide downslope in early spring. Here we combine laboratory experiments in which we release CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐ice blocks on sandy slopes under Martian atmospheric pressure with observations of linear dune gullies on Russell crater mega dune to test this hypothesis. We show that, on steep slopes (> ${ >} $22.5° in our experiments) sublimating CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐ice blocks slide down‐slope, creating straight, shallow channels with indistinct levees. On more gentle slopes (< ${< } $22.5° in our experiments), sublimating CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐ice blocks burrow themself into the sand and slowly migrate downslope by excavating their surroundings by explosive gas‐driven sediment transport. The burrowing movement helps explain the formation of unique characteristics of linear dune gullies; high levees, deep channels, channel sinuosity, and pit‐shaped channel endings."

This study investigates the underlying causes of this acceleration by comparing high‐resolution (HR) and low‐resolution (LR) ensembles of multi‐year prediction simulations and historical climate simulations. The findings demonstrate that HR outperforms LR in predicting this acceleration, although they perform comparable prediction skill caused by external forcings. As the acceleration was driven by internal dynamics rather than external climate forcings, improved prediction skill in HR is attributed to its enhanced ability to capture internal variability. Further analysis reveals a strong link between GoM sea‐level variability and a dipole‐like wind stress curl anomaly straddling the region around Cuba, generating Ekman pumping and suction, and triggering remote changes in GoM sea‐level rise through Rossby wave propagation. HR effectively captures this process likely due to its improved prediction of the multi‐year Atlantic Meridional Mode."

Previous studies indicate that climate modes primarily affect thermohaline conditions above 1,000 m, but their direct influence on the abyssal ocean remains uncertain. We utilized observations and reanalysis data to identify an inherent correlation between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and potential temperature at depths of 2,000–4,500 dbar in the Eastern Philippine Sea. During its positive (negative) phases, PDO induces warm (cold) anomalies in abyssal water, exhibiting a distinct first baroclinic mode throughout the water column. The heaving process (the vertically adiabatic migration of isopycnals), primarily driven by the divergence of abyssal circulation linked to PDO, emerges as the dominant mechanism influencing the deep‐water potential temperature variability. This study reveals that climate modes can rapidly modulate abyssal variability below the depth of 2,000 m."

Previously reported evidence for this tsunami includes hundreds of coral boulders that came to rest hundreds of meters inland on Anegada, British Virgin Islands. New U‐series dates on these coral boulders provide limiting dates for the tsunami. The narrowest limits were by dating interior bands of a coral that retains the hemispherical form of a living coral colony, and which include adjustments for the number of annual density band couplets between the dated samples and the boulder exteriors. By those limits, the tsunami dates between 1381 and 1391 CE, and likely occurred during summer or fall. The tsunami is important as the only reported sign that the eastern Puerto Rico Trench has produced a great earthquake.

The Northeast, South, and North China blocks show consistently high QC values, while significantly lower values are observed in Xinjiang, Tibetan Plateau, and North–South Seismic Belt, consistent with theoretical expectations that low values are observed in active regions.

Unrest was triggerless, uncorrelated with rainfall or seismic events. We favor internal driving processes with two possible scenarios: (a) dynamic hydrothermal alteration leading to permeability changes, shallow gas storage and pressurization, followed by opening of degassing pathways; or (b) a minor, undetected deep magmatic intrusion causing volatile exsolution and pore pressure increases within the hydrothermal system. Lack of post‐unrest subsidence suggests persistence of hydrothermal high‐pressure conditions at the summit and associated hazards.

We investigate the impact of ice composition on the under‐ice water column using fully resolved two‐dimensional numerical simulations of the water that account for light attenuation by both ice and water. Increasing the amount of opaque white ice (relative to that of transparent black ice) decreases thermal forcing of the water and delays Rayleigh‐Taylor instabilities and convective mixing. Other key environmental factors include the attenuation length scale of light and initial stratification of the water column. We determine whether and when (a) the water column first becomes unstable and (b) RDC is initiated. Notably, RDC is delayed by a period of growth of a gravitationally unstable layer.

The simulations reproduce, with good fidelity, the observed local characteristics when the conditions match the observed local plasma conditions. The wave energy conversion is predominantly positive at mid‐altitudes, indicating a transfer of wave to electron energy. This conversion rate increases significantly at low‐altitudes (in the inertial Alfvén wave regime) and is accompanied by the formation of highly field‐aligned electron beams peaking at several hundred eV in energy, with a directionality that is opposite to the current sense. This low‐altitude energization results in the dissipation of the majority of the wave Poynting flux and would lead to substantial soft electron precipitation."

Here, we quantify changes in the length scale of seasonal precipitation correlations using daily values from 19,786 precipitation gauges from 1950 to 2019 across the contiguous United States. Annual precipitation correlation distance (PCD) is shorter in the western than eastern U.S., and shorter in summer than winter. In summer, PCD significantly decreased by 0.37 km/yr over the 70‐year study period in the Northwest, Northern Rockies and Plains, and Upper Midwest regions. Declines were smaller in other seasons, and PCD had spatially variable climate dependencies. Decreases in PCD suggest an increase in seasonal precipitation spatial variability and a shift toward more convective dominating precipitation, and could challenge precipitation interpolation exercises in sparsely gauged areas."

 The rapid transformation of the ocean–atmosphere–cryosphere system during the last deglaciation holds clues that may be useful to understand climate change during this century and beyond. Within this context, sea-level change connects the climate system components, but the limited temporal resolution and spatial distribution of relative sea-level records has hindered progress towards closing the ice sheet–sea-level budget since the Last Glacial Maximum. Here we present a relative sea-level record, compiled using radiocarbon-dated basal peat, from the Mississippi Delta stretching back to ~10,000 years ago and combine it with the best available relative sea-level data worldwide for the final episode of the last deglaciation (9,000–7,000 years ago). Geophysical modelling shows that these precise data constraints favour approximately 14 m of ice melt in North America through this interval, 4–10 m greater than previously estimated, and at least three times greater than the Antarctic contribution. Our results call for a major revision of the deglacial ice history with implications for, among others, collapse of the saddle connecting two ice domes over Hudson Bay, the associated abrupt cooling ~8,200 years ago and the sensitivity of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to freshwater forcing.

Stereodivergent synthesis is accomplished via NHC-mediated proton shuttling, which usually furnishes enantio-complementary α-(U)AAs and peptides with >90% ee (de). Mechanistic studies establish that N,N’-diisopropylcarbodiimide activates α-(U)AAs to form oxazolone intermediates, which undergo NHC-mediated conversion to acyl azolium species. Divergent nucleophilic pathways are governed by chiral matching between catalyst and substrate, as evidenced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing π-π interactions and steric effects as stereoselectivity determinants. The methodology’s utility is also demonstrated in solid-phase peptide synthesis, achieving direct chirality transfer from racemic precursors to peptides with minimal epimerization. This work provides a catalytic platform for stereocontrolled α-(U)AA and peptide synthesis, with implications for chemical biology and peptide therapeutic development. Chiral α-amino acids, essential to biological systems and drug design, drive demand for precise synthetic methods to access unnatural variants (UAAs) and stereochemically defined peptides. We report an N-heterocyclic-carbene-catalyzed strategy enabling enantioselective synthesis of α-(U)AA esters and peptides."

 The modification of aromatic rings to heteroaromatic rings is a widely employed strategy in medicinal chemistry, often used to modulate lipophilicity and improve metabolic stability. However, achieving a one-step, generalizable transformation of aromatic rings into diverse heteroaromatic rings—termed “heteroaromatic swapping”—remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods, such as skeletal editing and transition-metal-catalyzed aromatic ring exchange, are limited in substrate scope and efficiency. Here, we present an efficient strategy for heteroaromatic swapping via a Claisen/retro-Claisen mechanism, utilizing heteroaryl esters and aromatic ketones. This approach enables the selective exchange of aromatic rings with heteroaromatic rings across a broad substrate range, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques. Notably, it achieves high-yield conversions of bioactive aromatic ketones into their heteroaromatic counterparts. This method expands the molecular editing toolkit, offering a practical and versatile platform for synthesizing bioactive compounds with enhanced physicochemical properties.

 Gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie tissue regeneration have been largely studied at the level of transcription. Here, proximity labeling methods identify increased presence of the RNA helicase and P-body marker Ddx61 in adult zebrafish cardiomyocytes induced to divide by injury or mitogens. Ddx61 molecules form complex condensates in cardiomyocytes during cardiogenic settings in zebrafish, developing mice, and cultured human cells. ddx61 mutations disrupt cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration indices in adult zebrafish, and DDX6 knockdown reduces proliferation of cultured human cardiomyocytes. During heart regeneration, Ddx61 associates with and is required to restrain expression of mRNA encoding Chordin, a secreted BMP inhibitor that impedes regeneration if present at high levels.

Here, the authors show that histone H3.3 coordinates BMAL1 activity along with cBAF/PBAF remodelers. Circadian disruption promotes remodeler reorganization and fragile H3.3 nucleosome accumulation, enhancing chromatin accessibility. 
 Circadian rhythms in gene expression are coincident with 24 hr dynamics in the recruitment of the core-clock transcription factor heterodimer CLOCK-BMAL1 to chromatin. In the liver, circadian chromatin is characterized by rhythmic histone modifications and the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z. However, other histone variants and remodelers that work in conjunction with CLOCK-BMAL1 on variant chromatin remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that H3.3 variant histone deposition peaks during the daytime in liver chromatin and that CLOCK-BMAL1 is recruited to H3.3 nucleosomes. Moreover, H3.3:CLOCK-BMAL1 associates with PBAF and BRG1/cBAF complexes - members of the SWI/SNF remodeler family - only during the active phase of the circadian cycle. In clock-disrupted Per1−/−; Per2−/− livers, we observe a depletion in ARID2, the central cog in the molecular assembly of the PBAF complex, accompanied by an increase in H3.3 incorporation. Remarkably, a disassembly of PBAF complex and the concurrent reduction in BRG1 triggers a remodeler reorganization in Per knockout livers, where BRM/cBAF now targets BMAL1 at readily-accessible genomic sites. An abundance of fragile, acetylated H3.3 nucleosomes and a remodeler reorganization provide a mechanistic basis for BMAL1 activity in the absence of PER-mediated negative feedback.

 Sedimentary volcanism, whereby material is brought to the surface by fluid overpressure, has been proposed to explain some of the periglacial landforms, including pitted cones, in the Northern Plains of Mars. However, in the absence of convincing mineralogical evidence, the origin for these deposits has never been conclusively determined. Here we conduct a remote sensing-based mineralogical survey to identify hydrated minerals within the Thumbprint Terrains and neighbouring Vastitas Borealis Formation. We detect several occurrences of hydrated silica along with sulfate salts in candidate mud volcano-like morphologies which likely formed during the Early Amazonian period, supporting the sedimentary volcanism origin. Buoyancy-driven analytical modelling suggests the hydrated silica and sulfate salts are sourced from reservoirs at depths of several 10 s and 100 s of metres, respectively below the Thumbprint Terrains and Vastitas Borealis Formation. The exposed sulfates may have been derived from ancient buried evaporite deposits suggesting, at least locally, a salt-rich aqueous origin for the Vastitas Borealis Formation, and would be consistent with the presence of a past northern ocean on Mars.

 The record-breaking 2022–24 Amazon-drought, which extended into the Orinoco and Cerrado regions, was characterized by severe-dry conditions during the dry-to-wet transition-season of the 2023–24 hydrological years (September-November/2023). This situation was not driven by a moisture-deficit from either remote sources or the region itself, although oceanic moisture sources exhibited negative anomalies. It was caused by the prevailing atmospheric stability, which inhibited convection and therefore precipitation in this region, and by extremely high temperatures having as its main driver the transition from 2022–23 La Niña to 2023–24 El Niño, which amplified the anomalies in the variables. Although atmospheric moisture was anomalously high, it was insufficient to compensate for the high temperatures, which led to reduced relative humidity values and enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. Moisture that did not precipitate in the region was transported to areas where there was sufficient instability for convection, resulting in high precipitation and floods in the Uruguay/Brazilian-South-Atlantic-Marginal river basins in September-October/2023. The temperature anomaly over the target region had two sources: a local one contributing to warming and an external one contributing to cooling. The results show the importance of adiabatic warming due to subsidence in the region itself and outside the region.

 The Yellow River Delta (YRD) has experienced severe subsidence due to anthropogenic activities. However, no study has resolved continuous deformation and investigate its mechanism across a three-decade timeframe from InSAR perspective since the early 1990s. This study proposes a Trend-Adaptive Functional Modeling and Connection method (TAFMC) for multi-sensor InSAR time series integration, with features of adaptability, robustness, and efficiency. It enables the identification of continuous deformation trends previously obscured by data gaps, thereby directly supporting the discovery of decadal deformation evolution. Second, six InSAR sensors were integrated to retrospect to the ground deformation in YRD from 1992 to 2024. The connected InSAR time series indicates three decades of subsidence, caused by deep groundwater extraction, reached up to 220 cm in Guangrao County. But the subsidence has been effectively controlled from >10 cm/yr during 1992–2021 to ∼5 cm/yr after 2021. Since 2015, an inland migration of a coastal subsidence funnel occurred due to the brine industry. Multiple small-scale subsidence funnels with rates exceeding 15 cm/yr emerged, linked to shrimp aquaculture around 2023. These findings provide comprehensive insights for the interaction between anthropogenic activities and the YRD subsidence on a decadal scale, and offer a methodological framework applicable to InSAR multi-decadal analysis in other delta regions."

 Change detection in high-resolution remote sensing images is pivotal for applications such as urban development, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, the current deep-learning-based methods that primarily rely on cropped samples exhibit significant limitations in effectively modeling ultra-long-range contextual information, particularly in the context of large-scale land-use and land-cover changes in high-resolution remote sensing images. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hyper-neighborhood Context-aware Transformer Network (HCTNet), which synergizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer frameworks to enhance ultra-long-range contextual modeling while maintaining the capability to extract fine-grained details. HCTNet incorporates three core components: the Hyper-neighborhood Context Branch (HCB) for aggregating extensive contextual information, the Hyper-neighborhood Context-aware Position Embedding (HCPE) for adaptive integration of neighborhood information, and the Hyper-neighborhood Context Transformer (HCT) for fusing local multi-scale features with broad contextual insights. These innovations enable HCTNet to effectively capture both large-scale scene changes and the intricate details of these changes. Comprehensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, namely HRSCD and WHU-CD, along with a newly constructed dataset, the China Wide Scope Change Detection (CWSCD), demonstrate the superior performance of HCTNet, achieving F1 scores of 93.41% on WHU-CD, 68.12% on HRSCD, and 72.01% on CWSCD dataset."

 We characterize seasonal and diurnal spatiotemporal features of extreme rainfall in a 45,000 km2 area within the tropical Andes of northern South America. We validate radar-based quantitative precipitation estimates for extreme rainfall using in-situ observations, finding a strong spatiotemporal coherence between the datasets through methods based on correlations, timing, and probability mass functions. We then explore the seasonal and diurnal cycles of extreme rainfall, focusing on the local atmospheric environments associated with these extremes. Results show that rainfall extremes in the region (percentile 99.5) exhibit intensities of more than 27 times the average, while the strongest events may reach intensities of up to 85 times the average. Moreover, our findings reveal a consistent timing of extreme precipitation events, occurring between 15:00 and 22:00 LST, accounting at this time range for more than 3% of all seasonal rainfall accumulation. We show that the traditional approach of analyzing seasonal 10-year average rainfall might leave out the high spatiotemporal variability of extreme events. By focusing on a specific threshold and the most intense rainfall events, we identify two main spatiotemporal patterns of extreme rainfall based on the magnitude and the ratio between maxima and mean rain rate. Moreover, these patterns are driven by the interplay of regional atmospheric mechanisms and orographic features. This research improves our understanding about the spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall extremes and their relationship with atmospheric and orographic factors.

 Climate change has the potential to significantly alter the characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs). Understanding how representative extreme TCs with distinct meteorological structures and hydrological impacts respond to warming is critical for improving risk assessment. Super Typhoon Usagi (2013) represents a rare case, maintaining unusually high intensity at landfall while coinciding with an astronomical high tide—a combination infrequently observed in the climatological record—which led to severe compound flooding in coastal cities. However, how such exceptional TC characteristics respond to climate change remains unclear. In this study, we apply a high-resolution (5 km) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation within the Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW) framework, in which reanalysis-based initial and boundary conditions are perturbed by multi-variable warming signals from CMIP6 GCMs, to assess how climate change may alter the characteristics of Super Typhoon Usagi (2013). Our results indicate that the accumulated precipitation increases by up to 100 mm under future warming scenarios, along with an increase in peak intensity, range from 5 hPa (LESS_WARM) to 10 hPa (MORE_WARM)). Hourly precipitation is projected to rise by 6.5 %–26.4 %, exceed the temperature-induced CC scaling (4.2 %–20.3 %). Increased latent heat flux (30–90 W m−2) under warmer (0.6–2.9 K) and wetter (1.5–4.0 g kg−1) climate conditions enhances TC intensification. Warming also affects the dynamic structure of TCs, enhancing vertical velocity (2–4 Pa s−1) and tangential wind (5–10 m s−1), expanding the inflow and outflow regions contributing to a stronger TC. The unexpected increase in precipitation is driven by both thermodynamic and dynamic factors. This case study provides insights into the potential responses of landfalling TCs—particularly those linked to compound flooding—in the Western Pacific Ocean (WNP) under future climate change."

However, investigation of EP spatiotemporal variations over the Arctic remains challenging, and their primary drivers are still poorly understood. Performance estimation of three state-of-the-art reanalysis products (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA-5), and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2)) against gauge-based precipitation observations reveals that MERRA-2 outperforms other reanalysis for Arctic EP changes. Based on MERRA-2 data, both annual EP amount and occurrence days averaged over the Arctic show statistically significant positive trends during 1980–2022 (3.37 ± 1.03 mm dec−1 and 0.42 ± 0.17 d dec−1, respectively), with the most pronounced increase in the autumn. Spatial heterogeneity in annual and seasonal EP trends is found across the Arctic, with the largest positive annual trends of 30 mm dec−1 over the Bering Sea and the Denmark Strait. The significant EP increase is closely associated with intensified atmospheric rivers (ARs) and widespread decline in sea ice concentration (SIC). Specially, SIC and ARs are responsible for 12% and 50% of Arctic EP inter-annual variance, respectively, while ARs directly contribute 28.3% of the total annual EP amounts. These findings explain the mechanistic controls on Arctic EP, providing critical insights for projecting polar weather and climate extremes and their impacts on the Arctic environment."

This fine-scale heterogeneity plays a key role in carbon dynamics yet capturing it—particularly in relation to green leaf phenology (GLP)—is challenging with traditional remote sensing methods. To address this, we developed a smartphone-based methodology and community-science project called the PeatPic Project. We gathered over 3700 photographs from 27 sites across 10 countries in 2021 and 2022, representing different peatland types (bog, fen, and swamp), at 1–2 week intervals. We calculated GLP metrics, such as the data of the start of the season and end of the season, based on the red-blue-green bands from these photographs. We found that GLP metrics varied significantly across peatland types and dominant vegetation communities. Notably, peak greenness at bog sites occurring approximately 10 days later in the year compared to fen sites. Furthermore, variables relation to peatland/vegetation type and energy balance were key predictors of peatland GLP. The PeatPic Project’s readily available methodology offers low-cost opportunities for further research into peatland phenology, enabling the calculation of additional phenological indices and integration with other data types. By refining our understanding of peatland GLP, we can improve predictive C modelling and better assess the impacts of future changes on these important ecosystems."

Both production- and consumer-level efforts can mitigate Nr loads and inputs. However, only independent evaluations of these efforts have been performed thus far, and the lack of comprehensive evaluations has hindered further reductions in Nr loads and inputs. Therefore, in this study, we applied the food nitrogen footprint to a subtropical island in Japan and evaluated both direct (on-island) and indirect (overseas-related, imported food/feed production) Nr loads and inputs within the food system. The following scenarios were developed: shifting diets toward grains and legumes in imported food, halving food loss and using the remainder as concentrate feed, and replacing chemical fertilizers with cattle manure produced on the island. Altering the composition of imported food, reducing food loss by half, and utilizing the remaining portion as feed effectively reduced the indirect Nr load, while using cattle manure reduced the direct Nr load. Implementing these measures in combination reduced the direct and indirect Nr loads by 15.4% and 30.9% and the direct and indirect Nr inputs by 19.8% and 18.8%, respectively. Therefore, it is essential to implement consumer and production efforts simultaneously rather than independently to optimize the global nitrogen cycle."

Utilizing spectral clustering method to classify the daily heatwave circulation over East Asia (EA) from 1979 to 2022, this study identifies three distinct heatwave hotspots in eastern China (P1; 22%), Mongolia (P2; 47%), and northwestern EA (P3; 31%), each of which has its own unique upper-level trough and ridge structures. The formation of heatwave hotspots is associated with the tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies, which are characterized by the westward extension and enhancement of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (P1), a strong ridge over Mongolia (P2), and anomalous anticyclones over northwestern and northeast EA (P3). These anomalous anticyclones lead to decreased cloud cover and atmospheric descent, influenced by specific quasi-barotropic teleconnection wave patterns in the mid-latitudes. The quantitative attribution results from the climate feedback response analysis indicate that the cloud, water vapor, and atmospheric dynamics constitute significant heat-generating mechanisms. Cloud changes provide the largest positive contribution (P1: 7.8 K, P2: 1.6 K, and P3: 1.9 K) to the formation of all three types of heatwaves through the shortwave radiation effect. Changes in atmospheric dynamics result in temperature increases of 2.7 K, 0.5 K, and 0.9 K in P1, P2, and P3, respectively. Atmospheric dynamics of P1 are primarily attributed to adiabatic warming, while both adiabatic and horizontal advection positively influence P2 and P3. Moreover, surface processes generally have compensatory cooling effects on the overall temperature anomalies associated with heatwaves. The findings of this study yield valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of extreme heat events in EA, offering scientific support for disaster prevention and mitigation."

We apply our framework in New Bern, NC, USA, where we project changes in nitrogen removal ecosystem services provided by wetlands and undeveloped open spaces during heavy rainfall events under current sea levels and with 0.15–1.5 m (0.5–5 ft) of SLR. These landscapes currently provide $90 000 USD worth of nitrogen removal ecosystem services annually. Areas currently designated for conservation are especially valuable, contributing 53% of annual services despite making up only 13% of New Bern’s total land area (107 km2). We show that these Conservation designations are expected to lose over 60% of their wetlands with 0.90 m (3 ft) of SLR, reducing New Bern’s expected annual benefit by 56%. Wetland migration to higher elevations is inhibited largely by existing urban development, though we locate potential wetland migration corridors that extend into Developed and Urban Transition FLU designations.

Here, by examining the multi-model projections under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios, we show that achieving carbon neutrality by the 2050s shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 1-1.9 can reduce global population exposure (PE) to hot temperature extremes—defined as person-days exceeding the 30 year return value of annual maximum daily maximum temperature—by 98%, compared to the scenario of continued regional rivalry in carbon emissions (SSP3-7.0). It is also up to 7% more effective than achieving carbon neutrality by the 2070s (SSP1-2.6), with this additional benefit driven primarily by significant reductions in urban PE, 4–9 times greater than those in rural PE.

This study investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of UHI across 31 major Chinese cities from 2000 to 2020, using the local climate zone (LCZ) framework, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer-derived land surface temperature (LST), and machine learning models. Existing research has found significant differences in the level of UHI variation among different cities, but few studies attributing it from the perspective of urban morphology changes. We quantify urbanization processes through nine LCZ-derived indicators and assess their influence on daytime and nighttime UHI in summer. Results show that UHI intensity increased in 80.6% of cities during the day and in 77.4% at night, with over half experiencing statistically significant intensification (p < 0.05). Daytime UHI was stronger in southern cities (mean: 3.12 ∘C), while nighttime UHI was more prominent in northern regions (mean: 1.86 ∘C). Urban expansion (UE) and vegetation reduction were identified as the primary contributors to UHI intensification, with random forest and Shapley Additive exPlans analyses indicating that UE accounted for up to 28.3% of UHI variance. Functional transformation of urban areas showed mixed thermal effects, with stronger nighttime impact. High-rise (LCZ4) and mid-rise (LCZ5) building expansions were particularly linked to elevated LST. Moreover, three land use indices exhibited significant correlations with UHI trends, especially in cities with significant UHI growth.

Previously, such assessments were mainly conducted through simple statistical analyses and water resource models, which apply minimal observational data on socioeconomic factors. Here, we present a data-driven method to evaluate water scarcity, and reveal the interplaying mechanisms between its key driving factors. We selected Beijing as a case study for its complex human–water system representative of other megacities. We collected annual parameters from government’s statistics and yearbooks during 2000–2021 and designed a system dynamics (SD) framework to characterize the key human–water coupling components. The framework was then used to project water demand and supply changes under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (2024–2050) using meteorological forcing from CMIP6. Results show that the SD framework performs reasonably in reproducing historical water supply and demand variability, showing continuously mitigated water scarcity severity due to government efforts to constrain agricultural and industrial water demand. Future projections indicate that water scarcity severity will be gradually mitigated until 2030, particularly under SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 scenarios. After 2030, water scarcity is intensified across all scenarios except for SSP5. This is associated with increased (decreased) sectoral water demand, together with reduced (increased) total water supply under each scenario. Sensitivity analyses, by keeping key parameters constant, highlight the distinct roles of climatological and socioeconomic factors in shaping the timing and variability of water scarcity, and offer valuable policy implications. The SD framework in this study has unique strength in simulating the temporal evolutions of sectoral water demands and their complex interactions, and thus can improve the realism of water demand estimation, which is essential for water resource modeling and assessment studies."

The results also strongly suggest that improvement and harmonization of the representation of land use in these models would serve the community in their future development efforts. 
 This study analyzes ozone (O3) dry deposition fluxes and velocities (Vd) from 12 regional-scale simulations that were performed over North America and Europe in Phase 4 of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII4). AQMEII4 collected grid-aggregated and land-use-specific (LU-specific) O3 Vd and effective conductances and fluxes for the four major dry deposition pathways. Consistent with recent findings in the AQMEII4 point model intercomparison study, analysis of the grid-aggregated fields shows that grid models with a similar Vd can exhibit significant differences in the absolute and relative contributions of the different depositional pathways. Analysis of LU-specific Vd and effective conductances reveals a general increase in model spread compared to grid-aggregated values. This indicates that an analysis of only grid-aggregated deposition diagnostics can mask process-specific differences that exist between schemes. An analysis of AQMEII4 LU distributions across models revealed substantial differences in the spatial patterns and abundance of certain LU categories over both domains, especially for non-forest partially vegetated categories such as agricultural areas, shrubland, and grassland. We demonstrate that these differences can significantly contribute to or even drive differences in LU-specific dry deposition fluxes which can increase the variability in model predictions of ozone. Two recommendations for future deposition-focused modeling studies emerging from the AQMEII4 analyses presented here are to (1) routinely generate diagnostic outputs to advance a process-based understanding of modeled deposition and support impact analyses and (2) recognize the importance of documenting and analyzing the representation of LU across models and work towards harmonizing this aspect when using air quality grid models and model ensembles for deposition analyses."

The effect of aerosol ionic strength (IS) on HMS formation was quantified; it first rises with increasing IS and then peaks at 4 mol kg−1 before declining. Given the IS range of marine (2–6) and urban (6–20 mol kg−1) aerosols and the clearly negative correlation between humidity and IS, moderate IS levels in humid conditions may notably boost ambient HMS formation. 
 Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) has emerged as a critical organosulfur species in ambient aerosols, yet the impact of aerosol properties, particularly ionic strength (IS), on the formation of HMS remains uncertain. Here, HMS levels in wintertime in urban Nanjing, China, were quantified at 0.30 ± 0.10 µg m−3, where the contribution of in-cloud formation probably carries minor significance, due to the barrier resulting from stable stratification. Elevated HMS concentrations were recorded during a Nanjing haze event, resulting from enhanced HMS formation rates, which can be largely attributed to reduced ISs on hazy days, as IS-dependent enhancement of HMS formation increased with decreasing IS within the continental IS range (6–20 mol kg−1). This arises from the fact that elevated IS can boost HMS formation rate constants but also hinder the solubility of HMS precursor (SO2) and its further dissociation. Consequently, the IS-dependent enhancement initially rose with increasing IS, peaking at 4 mol kg−1, before declining. Additionally, for the first time, particulate HMS levels in marine atmospheres (Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea) were quantified, at 0.05 ± 0.01 µg m−3. Lower ISs (2.0–6.0 mol kg−1) observed for marine aerosols exhibited more pronounced enhancements in HMS formation; this can render the aerosol-phase HMS formation a process comparable to that in cloud/fog droplets in marine environments. Furthermore, the study highlights the significant impact of ambient humidity on aerosol IS (R = −0.89), suggesting the integration of ionic strength in chemical models to better represent particulate sulfur chemistry, particularly in humid environments."

We establish a computational strategy to rapidly predict acid-catalyzed hydrolysis kinetics of organic hydroperoxides, an aerosol constituent with high abundance. The kinetic parameters can be integrated into atmospheric models to improve simulations of the global hydrogen peroxide budget and secondary organic aerosol production. 
 Organic hydroperoxides (ROOHs) are key components of atmospheric aerosols. Determining the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants (kA) of ROOHs is crucial for assessing their atmospheric fate and environmental impacts. However, available kA values are limited due to the difficulty in obtaining authentic ROOH standards. Herein, we addressed this limitation by developing a computational strategy and probing the structure–activity relationship of kA values. We screened the protonated water cluster (H+(H2O)n) model, a critical prerequisite for density functional theory (DFT) calculations of kA, by comparing experimental kA values of four ROOHs with DFT-calculated values using H+(H2O)n (n=1, 2, 3, 4) models. Results show that the H+(H2O)2 model reliably predicts kA values with DFT method. Further investigation of 53 additional ROOHs including 45 model compounds and 8 atmospherically relevant species reveals that substituents at the Cα (the carbon atom directly bonded to the -OOH group) site, including -NH2, -N(CH3)2, –OH, –OCH3, –CH = CH2, –SH, and –PH2, can facilitate acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Notably, the –NH2 and –N(CH3)2 substituents exhibit stronger facilitating effect than the well-documented -OH and –OCH3 substituents.

In situ observation remains the best alternative for accurate characterization of trends and extremes in these shallow environments. This paper presents the coastal temperature dataset of the ReefTEMPS monitoring network, which spreads over multiple Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) in the western and central South Pacific. 
 While the rise in global ocean temperature continues its course, reaching 1.45±0.12 °C above pre-industrial level according to the World Meteorological Organization in 2023, marine heatwave frequencies and intensities increase. Consequently, coral reef ecosystems, which are among the most vulnerable environments, are strongly impacted by dystrophic events and corals experiencing increasing frequencies of bleaching events. That has devastating consequences for the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) that strongly rely on these ecosystems. In situ observation remains the best alternative for providing accurate characterization of long-term trends and extremes in these shallow environments.  This paper presents the coastal temperature dataset of the ReefTEMPS monitoring network (Varillon et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.17882/55128; Liao et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.17882/82291) in which moored stations are implemented over a number of PICTs over a wide region in the western and central South Pacific from New Caledonia to French Polynesia. These in situ temperature time series are unique in several ways: in the length of some historical stations dating back to 1958 for the oldest, thus providing more than 65 years of daily data; in the number of countries sampled (16 PICTs); and in the variety of coral ecosystems monitored (from atolls to high islands and from barrier reefs' external slopes to shallow and narrow lagoons). Measurement devices have evolved over the years to provide increasingly precise and frequent observations, so the ReefTEMPS network was endorsed as a French National Observation Service in 2020, a label ensuring quality-controlled and open-access data of long-term observations. All stations are publicly available in ASCII or formatted NetCDF files either in the ReefTEMPS dedicated information system, which also allows for a quick visualization of time series, or on the SEANOE marine data platform. All links and accesses to these temperature time series are provided herein. The longevity of these temperature time series allows for diagnosing long-term trends, highlighting the influence of multiple processes on temperature dynamics (e.g. internal waves, cyclones, seasonal, and climate modes) and documenting the time evolution of extreme events.

This research presents HYdroclimatic PERformance-enhanced Precipitation (HYPER-P), a dataset combining satellite, ground, and reanalysis data to estimate precipitation at a 1 km scale from 2000 to 2022. HYPER-P improves accuracy, especially in areas with few rain gauges. This dataset supports scientists and decision-makers in understanding and managing water resources more effectively. 
 Accurate precipitation estimates are essential for a wide range of applications, including climate research (Pendergrass et al., 2017), water resource management (Camici et al., 2024; Fischer and Knutti, 2016; Kucera et al., 2013), agriculture (Beck et al., 2021; Ru et al., 2022), and natural hazard assessment (Serrano et al.,5 2010,Maggioni and Massari, 2018, Peiro et al., 2024; Smith et al., 2023). However, developing high-quality, long-term daily datasets at fine spatial resolutions remains challenging due to the inherent variability and heterogeneity of precipitation patterns. This study introduces the HYdroclimatic PERformance-enhanced Precipitation (HYPER-P, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15025514, Filippucci et al., 2024b) product, covering Europe and part of the Mediterranean basin from 2007 to 2022 at a 1 km daily resolution. HYPER-P is derived by downscaling and merging multiple data sources, including remote sensing products from Top-Down (TD) and Bottom-Up (BU) approaches, reanalysis datasets, and gridded in situ observations. The downscaling leverages on CHELSA climatology data (Karger et al., 2017), while the merging is obtained through a weighted average approach informed by Triple Collocation Analysis.Four merged products were developed based on multiple combinations of satellite products, observation and reanalysis datasets. The evaluation of these products was conducted through high-resolution validation in three Mediterranean regions with dense observational networks and coarse-resolution validation across Europe and a portion of North Africa. Results indicate that the combination of TD and BU satellite approaches enhance precipitation estimates, with merged products outperforming the parent datasets, especially in regions with sparse gauge coverage. The inclusion of ERA5-Land (Hersbach et al., 2020; Muñoz Sabater, 2019) further improves accuracy over areas characterized by complex topography. The merging of satellite products, particularly the one including ERA5-Land, shows overall strong performance, although challenges remain in validating precipitation estimates where ground observations are limited.

They naturally occur in steep creeks and are a threat to local communities. Scientists have turned to numerical models to better understand how they behave. We investigate the accuracy of a numerical model that relies on modelling the debris flow as a mixture of a granular phase and a fluid phase. We focus on a demonstration of the capacity of the model to reliably represent the behaviour of the flow at different scales. 
 This paper investigates the accuracy of a solid–fluid model using the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) software DualSPHysics v5.2 coupled with ProjectChrono for viscous debris flow modelling. It focuses on different validation steps of the method, both for pure fluid and a mixture of fluid and boulders, to build the reliability of the model in order to prepare for the simulation of a simplified debris flow. First, velocity profiles, the free-surface shape and the velocity of surges of a viscous fluid are validated against well-documented experimental data. This is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the few validations of the SPH approach for very viscous flows near the creeping threshold (Re ≈ 1). Second, the influence on the macroscopic viscosity of the introduction of granular elements in a viscous fluid is studied against a semiempirical formula. Finally, the method is applied to simplified 2D debris flow surges with field-like features. Surges modelled in this paper are composed of a viscous Newtonian fluid and polydisperse boulders. The flow of surges of different concentrations is studied, and Froude numbers of real field measurements are retrieved. Such complex models are shown to be relevant to the study of debris flow dynamics."

Unlike other models, it uses measurable plant traits such as height, leaf thinness, and root structure as inputs, rather than hard-to-measure physiological species data. This allows the simulation of many species. The model tracks daily changes in above- and below-ground biomass, plant height, and soil water. 
 Temperate semi-natural grassland plant communities are expected to shift under global change, mainly due to land use and climate change. However, the interaction of different drivers on diversity and the influence of diversity on the provision of ecosystem services are not fully understood. To synthesize the knowledge of grassland dynamics and to be able to predict community shifts under different land-use and climate change scenarios, we developed the GrasslandTraitSim.jl model. In contrast to previously published grassland models, we link morphological plant traits to species-specific processes via transfer functions, thus avoiding a large number of species-specific parameters that are difficult to measure and calibrate. This allows any number of species to be simulated based on a list of commonly measured traits: specific leaf area, maximum height, leaf nitrogen per leaf mass, leaf biomass per plant biomass, above-ground biomass per plant biomass, root surface area per below-ground biomass, and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization rate. For each species, the dynamics of the above- and below-ground biomass and its height are simulated with a daily time step. While the soil water content is simulated dynamically, the nutrient dynamics are kept simple, assuming that the nutrient availability depends on total soil nitrogen, yearly fertilization with nitrogen and the total plant biomass. We present a model description – which is complemented by online documentation with tutorials, flow charts, and interactive graphics – and calibrate and validate the model with two different datasets. We show that the model replicates the seasonal dynamics of productivity for experimental sites of the grass species Lolium perenne across Europe satisfactorily well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate the productivity and functional composition of grassland sites with different numbers of mowing events and grazing intensity in three regions in Germany. Therefore, the GrasslandTraitSim.jl model is presented as a useful tool for predicting the plant biomass production and plant functional composition of temperate grasslands in response to management under climate change."

 The smash software is a differentiable and regionalizable framework enabling modular high-resolution hydrological modeling and data assimilation, from catchment to regional and country scales, for water research and operational applications. smash combines various process-based conceptual operators for vertical and lateral flows, which can be hybridized with a descriptor-to-parameter neural network for regionalization. smash features an efficient, differentiable Fortran solver using Tapenade to automatically derive the adjoint model that supports CPU forward–inverse parallel computing and spatially distributed optimization of large parameter vectors thanks to an accurate cost gradient, interfaced in Python using f90wrap. This article presents smash algorithms and their open-source code, documentation, and tutorials. It highlights foundational research, benchmarking on state-of-the-art datasets, and readiness for scientific and operational use. To ensure reproducibility, open-source datasets are used to demonstrate the main functionalities of smash, including parallel computation performances and the application of multiple spatially distributed conceptual model structures over a large catchment sample. These functionalities include uniform or spatially distributed calibration and regionalization by learning the relation between descriptors and parameters. The provided Python tool allows application to any other catchment from globally available datasets. Using CAMELS, as per recent articles, a median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE)>0.8 is obtained in local spatially distributed calibration for daily Génie Rural (GR)-like and  variable infiltration capacity (VIC)-like model structures at dx=1′30′′ (∼3 km) and KGE>0.6 in spatiotemporal validation in a regionalization context. The regionalization of a high-resolution hourly GR-like model structure at dx=500 m over a difficult Mediterranean flash-flood-prone case results in a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)>0.6 in spatiotemporal validation. The proposed differentiable and regionalizable spatially distributed modeling framework is designed for gradient-based variational data assimilation, applicable to initial state (not shown) and parameter estimation at multiple timescales, and is intended for collaborative research and operational applications. Additionally, smash supports the implementation of other differentiable hydrological and hydraulic models, as well as hybrid physics–AI models, further enhancing its versatility and applicability."

Comparing the accuracy of the DP3 model to that of previous models and the Null model (average observed date of leaf coloring) suggests that leaf coloring data are noisy, which is why observation protocols and methods should be revised. 
 Leaf senescence ends the growing season of deciduous trees, affecting the amount of atmospheric CO2 sequestered by forests. Therefore, some climate models integrate projected leaf senescence dates to simulate the carbon cycle. Here, we developed a process-oriented model of leaf senescence (the “DP3 model”) by testing 34 formulations of the leaf development process based on the latest findings on the regulation of leaf aging and senescence. The period between leaf unfolding and leaf senescence was separated into the subsequent young, mature, and old leaf phases, with particular reactions to leaf aging and cold stress, photoperiod stress, and dry stress. The DP3 model simulates daily rates of aging and stress to predict dates of transition from young to mature to old leaf, senescence induction dates, and leaf senescence dates. This allows new hypotheses regarding the regulation of leaf senescence to be tested. For example, the DP3 model predicted an earlier onset of senescence in warmer conditions, likely due to earlier leaf unfolding (aging) and increased cold and dry stress in spring, together with longer-lasting senescence, likely due to the later accumulation of photoperiod stress relative to leaf development and decreased cold stress in summer and fall, which can be validated through experiments and in situ observations. The DP3 model and compared previous models were equally accurate but less accurate than the Null model (average senescence date observed in the calibration sample). This lower accuracy of the DP3 and compared models is likely due to noise in the visually observed leaf senescence data, which blurs the signal of the leaf senescence process, and to incorrect model formulations. The model errors were similarly affected by climate conditions and location among compared models (including the Null model) and varied mostly due to the leaf senescence data. Noisy leaf senescence data likely force the models to resort to the mean observation, impeding inferences from accuracy-based model comparisons about the leaf senescence process. This calls for revised observation protocols and methods that measure rather than estimate different senescence stages, such as senescence induction and 50 % of the leaves having changed color, e.g., based on greenness, involving digital cameras and automated image assessment."

Kaus,A dilatant visco-elasto-viscoplasticity model with globally continuous tensile cap: stable two-field mixed formulation,"We present a simple plasticity model that can be used for robust modeling of strain localization in both shear and tensile failure regimes. The new model overcomes the difficulty related to combining these regimes and enables for particularly simple and reliable numerical implementation, which delivers regularized solutions that are insensitive to mesh resolution. We describe algorithmic details and demonstrate the applications to a number of relevant strain localization problems. 
 Rocks break if shear stresses exceed their strength. It is therefore important for typical geoscientific applications to take shear failure mechanism and the subsequent development of mode-II shear bands or faults into account. Many existing codes incorporate non-associated Drucker-Prager or Mohr-Coulomb plasticity models to simulate this behavior. Yet, when effective mean stress becomes extensional, for example when fluid pressure becomes large, the dominant failure mode changes to a mode-I (opening) mode, which initiates plastic volumetric deformation. It is rather difficult to represent both failure modes in numerical models in a self-consistent manner, while also accounting for the nonlinear visco-elastic host rock rheology, which varies from being nearly incompressible in the mantle to being compressible in surface-near regions. Here, we present a simple plasticity model that is designed to overcome these difficulties. We employ a combination of a linearized Drucker-Prager shear failure envelope with a circular tensile cap function in way that ensures continuity and smoothness of both yield surface and flow potential in the entire stress space. A Perzyna-type viscoplastic regularization ensures that the resulting localization zones are mesh-insensitive. To deal with the near incompressibility condition, a mixed two-field finite element formulation is employed. The local nonlinear iterations at the integration-point level are used to determine the stress increments. The global Newton-Raphson iterations are applied to solve the discretized momentum and continuity residual equations. The presented plasticity model is implemented in an open-source 2D unstructured finite element code GeoTech2D. The results of several typical test cases that range from crustal scale deformation to the propagation of fluid-induced tensile failure zones demonstrate rapid convergence. The robustness of the solution scheme is enhanced by the adaptive time stepping algorithm."

Here, the authors report a method for digital fabrication of slippery objects with solid-liquid composite interfaces and geometric design freedom. 
 The primary challenge in creating controllable liquid-based materials lies in managing the structural complexities and multiscale interfaces that govern solid, liquid, and gas phase interactions. Current fabrication methods for liquid-infused surfaces lack topological flexibility, limiting them to planar and simple-patterned structures. Conversely, digitally fabricating slippery architectural materials marks a significant shift towards scalable microprinting of complex, topologically slippery designs. This paper introduces a method for digitally fabricating slippery objects with solid–liquid composite interfaces and geometric design freedom. The slippery architecture has been demonstrated through digital printing of photopolymerization-induced multiphase materials and photoinduced grafting, enabling precise control over structural topologies and slippery properties of infused liquids. This versatile platform facilitates the fabrication of structures at multiple scales, enhancing liquid manipulation, droplet evaporation, and biomedical microfluidic chip design. These methods advance beyond conventional techniques, showcasing the potential of architected slippery surfaces with controlled structural scales. Control of liquid-based materials is important for developing materials based on these, but topological flexibility is limited.

Here, we present a Digital Colony Picker (DCP), an AI-powered platform for automated, high-throughput screening and export of microbial clones based on growth and metabolic phenotypes at single-cell resolution, without agar or physical contact. Using a microfluidic chip comprising 16,000 addressable picoliter-scale microchambers, individual cells are compartmentalized, dynamically monitored by AI-driven image analysis, and selectively exported via laser-induced bubble technique. Applied to Zymomonas mobilis, DCP enabled en masse screening and identified a mutant with 19.7% increased lactate production and 77.0% enhanced growth under 30 g/L lactate stress. This phenotype was linked to overexpression of ZMOp39x027, a canonical outer membrane autotransporter that promotes lactate transport and cell proliferation under stress.

Here, the authors elucidate the molecular basis of ATG16L1 interactions with FIP200 and ATG8 family proteins, showing that the interaction of ATG16L1 with FIP200 is indispensable for the effective autophagic flux. 
 Macroautophagy maintains cellular and organismal homeostasis, and entails de novo synthesis of double-membrane autophagosome. The effective formation of autophagosome requires the recruitment of the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L1 complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure by relevant ATG16L1-binding autophagic factors including FIP200. However, the molecular mechanism governing the specific interaction of ATG16L1 with FIP200 remains elusive. Here, we uncover that ATG16L1 contains a FIP200-interacting region (FIR), which not only can directly bind FIP200 Claw domain, but also can serve as an atypical ATG8-interacting motif to selectively recognize mammalian ATG8 family proteins (ATG8s). We determine the high-resolution crystal structures of ATG16L1 FIR in complex with FIP200 Claw and GABARAPL1, respectively, and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the interactions of ATG16L1 with FIP200 and ATG8s. To distinguish the precise contribution of FIP200 from ATG8s for binding to ATG16L1 FIR in autophagy, we develop a ATG16L1 mutant that can exclusively interact with ATG8s but not FIP200. Finally, using relevant cell-based functional assays, we demonstrate that the interaction of ATG16L1 with FIP200 is indispensable for the effective autophagic flux. In conclusion, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interactions of ATG16L1 with FIP200 and ATG8s, and are valuable for further understanding the function of ATG16L1 in autophagy. ATG16L1 is a key autophagic protein.

Here, the authors report the powdery mildew resistance locus derived from wild emmer wheat is conferred by the combined effect of two complementary nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat genes. 
 Powdery mildew is a devastating disease that affects wheat yield and quality globally. Here, we identify a powdery mildew resistance locus MlIW39 from wild emmer wheat through map-based cloning, mutagenesis, and stable genetic transformation. Unlike many other cloned Pm genes, the MlIW39-mediated resistance is conferred by the combined effect of two complementary nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes, encoding a canonical coiled-coil (CC) type NLR protein (MlIW39-R1) and an atypical NLR protein (MlIW39-R2) with an unknown domain (CC-like), respectively. Overexpression of the NLR pair induces cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, whereas MlIW39-R1 or MlIW39-R2 alone does not. The MlIW39-R1 and MlIW39-R2 proteins physically interact with each other. MlIW39-R1 and MlIW39-R2 likely originate independently and become neighborly located during evolution. Our findings shed light on the significance of NLR pairs in plant immunity and can facilitate wheat disease-resistance breeding using the developed MlIW39 introgression lines and functional marker.

Authors show that LARGE1 processively polymerizes matriglycan of defined length on prodystroglycan. 
 Matriglycan is a linear glycan (xylose-β1,3-glucuronate)n, which binds proteins in the extracellular matrix that contain laminin-globular domains and Lassa Fever Virus. It is indispensable for neuromuscular function. Matriglycan of insufficient length can cause muscular dystrophy with abnormal brain and eye development. LARGE1 (Like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1) uniquely synthesizes matriglycan on dystroglycan. The mechanism of matriglycan synthesis is not obvious from cryo-EM reconstructions of LARGE1. However, by reconstituting activity in vitro on recombinant prodystroglycan we show that the presence of the dystroglycan N-terminal domain (DGN), phosphorylated core M3, and a xylose-glucuronate primer are necessary for matriglycan polymerization by LARGE1. By introducing active site mutations, we demonstrate that LARGE1 processively polymerizes matriglycan on prodystroglycan, with its length regulated by the dystroglycan prodomain, DGN. Our enzymatic analysis of LARGE1 uncovers the mechanism of matriglycan synthesis on dystroglycan, which can form the basis for therapeutic strategies to treat matriglycan-deficient neuromuscular disorders and arenaviral infections.

Here, Weber and colleagues identify cellular mechanisms and candidate genes that shape vertebral proportion. 
 Limbs and vertebrae elongate by endochondral ossification, but local growth control is highly modular such that not all bones are the same length. Compared to limbs, which have a different evolutionary and developmental origin, far less is known about how individual vertebrae establish proportion. Using the jerboa and mouse tail skeletons, we find that cell number is a common driver of limb and vertebral proportion in both species. However, chondrocyte hypertrophy, which is a major driver of proportion in all mammal limbs, is limited to the extreme disproportionate growth of jerboa mid-tail vertebrae. The genes associated with differential growth in the vertebral skeleton overlap significantly, but not substantially, with genes associated with limb proportion. Among shared candidates, loss of Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 3 in mice causes disproportionate elongation of the proximal and mid-tail vertebrae, in addition to the proximal limb. Our findings therefore, reveal cellular processes that tune the growth of individual vertebrae while also identifying natriuretic peptide signaling among genetic control mechanisms that shape the entire skeleton. Vertebra lengths differ from the neck to the tail tip and differ between species, evidenced by extreme differences in mouse and jerboa tails.

Here the authors show that this effect will weaken with future glacier retreat, leading to a recoupling of temperatures from the 2030s onwards. 
 Recent studies have argued that air temperatures over many mountain glaciers are decoupled from their surroundings, leading to a local cooling which could slow down melting. Here we use a compilation of on-glacier meteorological observations to assess the extent to which this relationship changes under warming. Statistical modelling of the potential temperature decoupling of the world’s mountain glaciers indicates that currently glacier boundary layers warm ~0.83 °C on average for every degree of ambient temperature rise. Future projections under shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) climate scenarios SSP 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5 indicate that decoupling, and thus relative cooling over glaciers, is maximized during the 2020s and 2030s, before widespread glacier retreat acts to recouple above-glacier air temperatures with its surroundings. This nonlinear feedback will lead to an increased sensitivity to warming from midcentury, with glaciers losing their capacity to affect the local climate and cool themselves. It has been argued that air temperatures over mountain glaciers are decoupled from surrounding warming, which could slow down melting. Here the authors show that this effect will weaken with future glacier retreat, leading to a recoupling of temperatures from the 2030s onwards."

The authors show that the timing of emissions reductions drives the uncertainties during the twenty-first century, but geophysical uncertainties become more important with time, especially under optimistic scenarios. 
 Uncertainty in future CO2 emissions and the geophysical response to emissions drives variability in future sea-level rise. However, the relative contributions of emissions and geophysical dynamics (for example, Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) tipping points) to future sea-level projections are not well understood. Here we disentangle their relative importance by propagating an ensemble of CO2 emissions trajectories through a calibrated carbon cycle–climate–sea-level model chain. Without negative emissions, the CO2 emissions trajectory, particularly the timing of when emissions are reduced, becomes the primary driver of sea-level variability between 2065 and 2075. Accelerated AIS melting greatly influences the sensitivity of global mean sea-level rise to time-averaged and integrated temperature changes. The most important geophysical uncertainties associated with the risk of exceeding sea-level thresholds are the threshold corresponding to accelerated AIS melting and equilibrium climate sensitivity. Our results highlight the need for both adaptation and rapid decarbonization to manage the risks posed by SLR. Unclear emissions and ice-sheet processes drive uncertainties in future sea-level rise.

 Spectral nudging (SN) is an effective numerical technique that prevents the background field from deviating excessively from the boundary conditions in regional climate modeling. This study investigates the effectiveness of SN in convection-permitting model simulations of three typical events of warm-season extreme precipitation in South Korea. The case studies show that SN improves extreme precipitation simulations by keeping synoptic circulations more consistent with observations. Trajectory analysis also shows that SN influences the moisture transport and local ascent that trigger extreme precipitation. However, the extent of the improvement depends on the synoptic condition and the domain size. The influence of SN generally increases with increasing domain size, especially for events driven by the developing upper-level trough with strong baroclinic instability compared to those influenced by surface processes. SN is also found to be more effective in events whose dominant wave scales fall between the domain size and the cut-off wavelength used for SN. Based on a series of sensitivity experiments, it is proposed that the most effective configuration for simulating extreme precipitation events is to apply SN to a domain approximately 3000 km wide."

 Global warming is transforming High Arctic ecosystems, yet the effects of northward vegetation expansion on soil microbial functions remain unclear. A four-year field experiment in northern Greenland was conducted to study these impacts. We investigate how plant litter affects the active layer and thawing permafrost soils by transplanting the latter from deeper soil layers and supplementing active layer soils with Arctic shrub litter. Litter amendment altered the soils’ functional potential, including the enrichment of genes linked to ion and lipid transport, metabolism and secondary metabolite production, ultimately enhancing microbial growth and respiration. Significant alterations were observed in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling genes, marked by an enhancement of CAZymes related to the breakdown of specific C substrates such as cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, murein and chitin. Litter amendment also shifted the microbial N-cycling potential towards increased N mineralization and assimilation of organic and inorganic N, suggesting an increased incorporation of N into microbial biomass. Without litter amendment, few C- and N-metabolism pathways changed, mainly affecting auxiliary activities and lignin breakdown due to permafrost thawing. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring High Arctic vegetation expansion, as it may impact C degradation and greenhouse gas emissions more than permafrost thaw alone.

 The impact of rapid climate change on civilizations is of global concern. The Western Zhou (1045–771 BC) was ancient China’s third dynasty and one of the most powerful empires of its time. After a 274-year reign, the dynasty collapsed, accompanied by significant population migration. Various factors have been proposed to explain its fall, while the role of climate change has been largely ignored. Here we present well-dated, high-resolution stalagmite records from Northeast and Southeast China, along with other paleoclimatic and archaeological evidence, to demonstrate the critical role of the 2.8 ka climatic event in the dynasty’s collapse and subsequent migration. Our results indicate a “north dry–south wet” dipolar pattern in the Chinese monsoon region during this event. The drought and cold severely affected the Western Zhou core areas and exacerbated invasions by northern nomads, contributing to its collapse. The resulting environmental stresses and conflicts likely triggered substantial southward migration.

 Ecosystem structure and biophysical processes mediate biological responses to climate changes, but few studies have examined impacts of this dynamic among upper trophic levels. We investigated ecosystem differences in how diverse seabird populations across the northern hemisphere have responded to changes in regional mixed layer temperature and water column stratification. Using 138 time series of breeding productivity over the past half-century, we show that seabird reproductive productivity has declined in the Arctic and North Atlantic but not in the Pacific during a period of ubiquitous mixed layer warming and regionally-variable stratification trends. Models of breeding productivity and ocean drivers show that seabird responses to climate change vary by ecosystem. Additionally, ecosystems in which seabirds exhibit detectibly declining productivity tend to have lower overall diet diversity across seabird species. These findings emphasize the importance of ecosystem processes and structure in determining the vulnerability of marine predators to climate change.

 Urban functional zones (UFZs) are well-planned spatial units characterized by distinct socioeconomic activities and composite land uses, such as residential areas, industrial zones, and blue-green spaces. Fine-grained UFZ mapping has played an increasingly crucial role in supporting targeted urban renewal and transformation of development mode in megacities, facilitating spatial structure optimization to enhance urban livability and sustainability. Prior UFZ mapping methods that focus on two-dimensional (2D) features of point of interest and multi-spectral imagery, pay little attention to three-dimensional (3D) features of building height and digital surface model, mostly with the absence or underutilization of emerging nighttime light imagery. Given the availability of high-quality day-night spectral signatures provided by the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) in a single sensor observing mode, it has become possible to effectively perform UFZ mapping with day-night feature enhancement. In this study, we proposed a progressive and cross-scale deep fusion architecture for generating UFZ maps at the block scale, enhancing spectral and spatial information through sequential refinement—from feature representation and relationship extraction to context modeling. To verify the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method, experiments were conducted in two Chinese megacities with distinct UFZ landscapes. Results demonstrated that the medium-resolution SDGSAT-1 imagery could be used as a reliable data source for deriving day-night features, enabling the generation of fine-grained UFZ maps when combined with 2D—3D features from other geospatial big data. Cross-method comparisons also showed that this approach could significantly improve both semantic segmentation and topological interpretation across different UFZ types. Notably, our method could not only achieve acceptable levels of mapping performance (overall accuracy > 0.91 and average F1-score > 0.91), but also realize the accurate extraction of purer UFZ blocks with a small sample size (training-testing ratio = 1:4), further indicating considerable potential in large-scale UFZ mapping.

 In seasonally cold ecosystems, ecological processes and biotic communities are strongly influenced by winter conditions. Climate change is affecting these conditions, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, as temperatures during the cold season continue to warm and alter patterns of frozen ground and snow cover. Yet, the current understanding of the ecological impacts of these changes is limited. A fundamental first step in addressing this knowledge gap is to quantify winter conditions with ecologically meaningful indices across large areas and at spatiotemporal resolutions relevant to on-the-ground management. Here, our goal was to combine Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (L8S2) data to derive three 30-m indices of winter conditions (winter habitat indices or WHIs): snow season length, percentage of days of frozen ground without snow, and snow cover variability, for the contiguous United States. We assessed the accuracy of the L8S2 WHIs using a nationwide network of meteorological stations and examined their error rates by land cover type, elevation, and the number of cloud-free observations available for each index calculation. Last, we compared the spatial patterns and errors in the L8S2 WHIs with those in WHIs derived from coarse-resolution MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery (500 m). We found that all three L8S2 WHIs accurately characterized winter conditions on the ground. They also had very similar accuracy and spatial patterns as the MODIS WHIs, despite having a lower imaging frequency and the lack of extensively validated snow cover products akin to those from MODIS. The accuracies of the WHIs were generally highest in mountainous areas of the western US and in vegetated areas, and they were lowest in parts of the midwestern and eastern US where cloud-free observations were less frequent, and in developed and barren areas. Having more cloud-free observations improved the accuracy of the WHIs, especially snow season length. Owing to their higher resolution, the L8S2 WHIs detected far more spatial detail than those from MODIS, particularly in topographically complex regions where winter conditions are highly heterogeneous over short distances. Our results demonstrate that 30-m WHIs derived from L8S2 data accurately capture winter conditions across the contiguous US, with accuracies that rival those from MODIS. Thus, the L8S2 WHIs offer exciting opportunities for ecological applications at a 30-m resolution across large spatial scales."

 Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are widespread environmental contaminants used primarily as flame retardants and plasticizers, yet their fate remains poorly understood. This study comprehensively examined OPEs in indoor and outdoor air in urban environments, focusing on concentrations, seasonal patterns, and health risks. Seventeen OPEs, including aryl, alkyl, and chlorinated types, were analyzed in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the gas phase over a year-long sampling campaign. Outdoor gas phase OPE concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 2.68 ng/m3, while particulate concentrations varied from 0.07 to 0.49 ng/m3. Indoor gas phase concentrations were higher, ranging from 0.13 to 7.84 ng/m3, and particulate concentrations from 0.08 to 1.26 ng/m3. Chlorinated OPEs dominated the gas phase, whereas alkyl OPEs were more prevalent in the particulate phase. Seasonal variations revealed elevated OPE levels in spring and summer, attributed primarily to increased volatilization and marine-derived air masses, whereas winter concentrations were the lowest and occasionally linked to long-range transport from northeastern China. Diurnal measurements indicated that indoor gas phase OPE concentrations were higher during daytime, coinciding with increased human activities and elevated indoor temperatures. Principal component analysis suggested local industrial emissions and regional transport from Southeast Asia and Northeast China as key sources. Estimated daily intake (EDI) values for children exceeded those for adults, indicating greater vulnerability. However, hazard quotient (HQ) values for both groups remained below unity, implying low non-carcinogenic inhalation risk. These findings highlight the importance of continued monitoring and source control of OPEs, especially in indoor environments where human exposure is most pronounced."

 BackgroundKala Sanghian Drain, Punjab, India, receives the chemicals from the leather industries, motor bearings industries, electroplating industries, and textile industries situated on its side. This drain becomes a source of physiological disturbance, such as skin diseases, respiratory problems, peripheral neuropathy, and neurotic symptoms in the community living near it.

 Microplastics (MPs) are a significant environmental pollutant, and the indoor environment serves as both a source and a medium for human exposure to these particles. The influence of different MP shapes on health risks, particularly concerning intestinal absorption, remains poorly understood. This study investigated MPs in indoor dustfall, with an emphasis on shape-dependent characteristics and risks. Dustfall samples from urban residences were analyzed using density separation, microscopy, and micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μ-FTIR). Our findings showed that the dustfall MPs consisted of fragmented, fibrous, and spherical shapes, with fragmented MPs accounting for 31 % of the total. Due to their larger specific surface area (SSA), fragmented MPs exhibited a higher absorption capacity. A health risk model for human intestinal absorption of MPs in indoor dustfall was developed, revealing that fragmented MPs contributed the highest absorption rate (0.0289), followed by spherical MPs (0.0136) and fibers (0.0088). Indoor surveys further indicated that practices such as choosing low-emission wall materials, increasing ventilation, and using air purifiers can reduce indoor MP levels.

 This study investigates the interdecadal variability of the leading mode of summer persistent extreme precipitation (PEP) over Southwest China (SWC) and its associated mechanisms using observational diagnostics and numerical simulations. The leading mode of summer SWC PEP exhibits a north-south dipole pattern, with a shift from a north-negative–south-positive pattern to a north-positive–south-negative pattern around 2003. An anomalous cyclone over Northeast to North China and an anticyclone over southern China in the lower troposphere trigger the PEP pattern by inducing moisture convergence (divergence) over northern (southern) SWC. Meanwhile, the Rossby wave train along the subtropical westerly jet over Eurasia provides favorable dynamic conditions for the dipole pattern. The moisture budget diagnostics indicate the importance of the interaction between dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the formation of north-south difference in SWC PEP variability. Such atmospheric circulation anomalies are closely related to southern European soil moisture, Barents-Kara Sea (BKS) sea ice concentration (SIC) and thermal feedback over the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). On one hand, reduced summer soil moisture over southern Europe enhances the meridional temperature gradient and atmospheric baroclinicity to its north, intensifying synoptic-scale transient eddy activity. The resulting transient eddy forcing favors the development of a quasi-barotropic positive geopotential height anomaly over Europe, which subsequently favors the formation of the eastward-propagating wave train that modulates the anomalous circulation associated with SWC PEP. On the other hand, the summer BKS SIC reduction weakens the meridional temperature gradient over the mid-to-high latitude Eurasia, inducing local anomalous easterlies and promoting the formation of the above-mentioned European positive geopotential height anomaly and Rossby wave train. In addition, the thermal feedback over the eastern TP triggered by the Rossby wave train, reinforces the anomalous atmospheric pattern that favors the dipole PEP over SWC."

 The Three-North Region is pivotal to desertification control in China. Based on the CN05.1 gridded dataset and ERA5 reanalysis data, this study analyzes the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of temperature, extreme temperature events, and land-atmosphere coupling strength in the Three-North Region from 1961 to 2022. Results show since 1961, the Three-North Region of China has experienced a significant warming trend, with an average temperature increase rate of approximately 0.28 °C per decade, notably higher than the contemporaneous global average of around 0.15 °C per decade. The frequency of extreme high-temperature events has markedly increased, leading to a continuous narrowing of the diurnal temperature range. Notably, the land-atmosphere coupling strength, as indicated by the π index, has exhibited a persistent upward trend, which are closely associated with regional warming and the occurrence of extreme heat events. These changes in climate are closely linked to anomalies in atmospheric circulation patterns, which have intensified low-level moisture flux divergence, reduced surface latent heat fluxes, and enhanced sensible heat fluxes. The land-atmosphere interaction has triggered a strong local positive feedback mechanism, further amplifying regional warming and the frequency of extreme temperature events. Overall, land-atmosphere coupling has emerged as a critical driver of climate warming and the intensification of extreme heat events in the Three-North Region, warranting heightened attention in future research. Our findings may provide new perspectives for assessing extreme weather risks in the Three-North Region. The increasingly significant role of enhanced land-atmosphere coupling strength in intensifying extreme weather events also provides valuable insights for other regions."

Artekha,Some generalizations of the tornado model,"•Generation begins when a supercooled cloud-air mixture near the vortex axis descends. •Overheated near-surface air masses rise due to super adiabatic temperature gradient. •An analytical model is applicable to the initial stage of the tornado formation. •Tornado models describe all stages of tornado development from a rotating convection. •Criteria for temperature and velocity profile may help tornado occurrence forecasts. 
 A possible mechanism of tornado generation is associated with the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability. The supercooled cloud-air mixture near the axis starts to descend and, due to the super adiabatic temperature gradient, the overheated near-surface air mass rises. The complete system of equations for full model includes equations for the stream function, for the azimuthal velocity component, and for the change in density. The refined model considers rotating convection within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The simplest model uses a separate equation for the stream function and can be applied to the initial stage of vortex generation. Within the framework of the simplest model, an analytical solution is combined from 8 linear dependencies by height. Rotation increases due to the conservation of angular momentum. Within the framework of the refined model, some unidirectional differential rotation arises, but it depends on boundary conditions (can be local). The full model studies the tornado development as rotating convection from the very beginning to the quasi-stationary stage. Velocity components increase in a coordinated manner. Two cases are considered: a single whirlwind and a two-eyed tornado. Radial flows converge towards the central part of the tornado near the earth surface, and there is an outflow from the “wall” to the axis and to the periphery near the top of the tornado. The maximum vertical velocity component is achieved at a certain radial distance at a certain height. The maximum azimuthal velocity component is achieved in the tornado “wall”. Tornado generation criteria are discussed."

 The Megacity of Jakarta and its surrounding regions have been currently more vulnerable to severe floods due to extreme rainfall. In this study, the contributions of multiple drivers of regional climate phenomena to extreme rainfall seasonally are examined using a single index of 80 percentile of seasonal maximum of daily rainfall during each event and climatology based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Climate Extreme Index (CEI). The multi-drivers investigated in this study include cold surges (CS), cross-equatorial northerly surges (CENS), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). We used daily rainfall datasets of 7 meteorological stations representing varying topography from lowland on the coast to mountain areas during 1985–2021 (37 years). Results show that the climatology of rainfall is significantly associated with CEI during CENS in the wet season Dec-to-Feb (DJF) (r = 0.8). Meanwhile, in the dry season Jun-to-Aug (JJA), the rainfall is more related to CEI during the negative IOD and La Niña (r = 0.9). Over the lowland, the rainfall intensity ≥ CEI during CENS has a stronger variation in DJF than in any other season. The second peak of CEI is notably found over the transitional area between lowlands and mountains (Dramaga Station) during Mar-to-May (MAM), JJA, and Sep-to-Nov (SON). This implies the important role of the transitional region in changes of extreme rainfall which has not been exposed previously. The large-scale drivers have induced extreme rainfall intensity in DJF for most stations. In MAM, JJA, and SON, the contribution of CEI is the largest in areas over the south near the mountainous regions."

This article presents a method coupling an offline ice nucleus counter to an electron microscope to obtain information, not only about INP number concentrations but also about physico-chemical properties (e.g., size and chemical composition) relevant to ice nucleation on single particles. The method was evaluated on the basis of a case study at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch. 
 To understand and predict the formation of clouds and precipitation and their influence on our climate, it is crucial to know the characteristics and abundance of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the atmosphere. As the ice-nucleating efficiency is a result of individual particle properties, detailed knowledge of these properties is essential. Here, an offline method for the comprehensive single-particle analysis of ambient INPs that benefits from the combination of two instruments already used for ice nucleation measurements is presented, focusing on the methodological description of the coupling, whereby strengths and weaknesses of the method are discussed.First, the aerosol is sampled on silicon wafers. INPs are then activated at different temperature and humidity conditions in the deposition nucleation and condensation freezing mode using a static diffusion chamber. The positions of grown ice crystals are defined by a coordinate system, which allows for recovery and detailed analysis of the individual INPs by a scanning electron microscope. Based on their physico-chemical properties (elemental composition and morphology) the INPs can be classified into categories. In combination with the size information, a size-resolved distribution of the INP classes can be determined. Such results are useful for evaluating INP-type-specific parametrizations, e.g., for use in atmospheric modeling and in closure studies.A case study from the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland shows that the targeted INP analysis as obtained by this method is able to identify the main INP classes in reliable proportions. Most of the deposition-nucleation-mode and condensation-freezing-mode INPs activated at −30 °C, indicating a geogenic mineral origin (mainly aluminosilicates / Al-rich particles but also carbonates and silica). Other major contributors were carbonaceous particles, consisting of both smaller soot particles and larger biological particles and mixed particles (mostly Al / C mixed particles). The INPs had projected area diameters ranging from 300 nm–35 µm, with a distinct maximum at 1–2 µm. Mineral particles were present throughout the entire size range, while mixed particles were identified in higher abundances at sizes of 3 µm and above. Minor contributions were seen from sulfates and metal oxides, the latter with an increased proportion in the size range below 500 nm. During a Saharan dust event, a significant increase in mineral particles in the INP composition was detected."

The simulated cloud hydrometeors distributions varied significantly depending on model initial conditions, typhoon structures, and microphysics schemes. Results in this study demonstrate the potential for using PRO observation to evaluate the performance of different microphysics schemes in numerical models. 
 A novel radio occultation (RO) technique, polarimetric RO (PRO), has recently been developed to measure differential polarimetric phase shift together with traditional RO products such as bending angle and refractivity. PRO observations have been shown to be associated with the vertical structure of cloud hydrometeors. With this unique measurement capability, the PRO soundings could potentially be used to evaluate model microphysics parameterization. This study compared PRO observations with WRF simulations of three typhoon cases in 2019 and 2021, initialized with ERA5 and NCEP FNL global analysis, respectively, with five microphysics parameterizations (Purdue Lin, WSM6, Goddard, Thompson, and Morrison). There is notable variability in the distribution of the model's hydrometeors, which could be affected by the initial conditions, microphysics parameterization schemes, typhoon locations, circulation, and rainbands. The results in this study show that WRF simulations using the Goddard, Thompson, and Morrison schemes generally place the peak differential phase at the altitudes close to those observed by PAZ PRO. Among them, the Goddard microphysics scheme performs best in typhoon track prediction and the simulation of maximum differential phase shift when compared with PRO observations.

To improve understanding of the climate effects of radiative forcing associated with aviation‐induced cirrus clouds, we use the Community Earth System Model CESM1.2.2 to perform simulations with stylized longwave and shortwave forcing agents in different latitude bands. We find that for the same concentration, longwave absorbers in the sub‐tropics have the largest magnitude of instantaneous radiative forcing but these absorbers in the polar regions show the largest impact on global temperature. In contrast, shortwave scatterers in the low latitudes have the largest magnitude of effective and instantaneous radiative forcing, but the global temperature response is not highly sensitive to the latitude of forcing.

These ensembles often require aggregation to summarize information based on specific criteria or conditions. However, previous research using global change scenario ensembles has largely overlooked how the choice of aggregation method influences the interpretation of results. To address this gap, we leverage a large ensemble data set designed to capture broad energy system dynamics generated using the Global Change Analysis Model. We first explore how energy‐related uncertainties are propagated to both global and regional water‐energy‐food sectors. We then conduct a rank correlation analysis across seven ensemble aggregation measures and demonstrate the need to consider multiple measures in global change scenarios. Our results suggest that global water and food sector outcomes in the 21st century vary widely depending on different scenario assumptions. The global energy productivity is projected to improve by the end of the century across all scenarios. Moreover, regions facing water scarcity challenges in 2100 do not always overlap with those facing extreme energy and food sector outcomes. Although rank correlations across seven aggregation measures are relatively stable across sectors, we identify cases where relying on a single measure leads to losing critical information in the full ensemble. Reliance on a single aggregation measure can distort the interpretation of global change scenario outcomes. Instead, adopting multiple ensemble aggregation measures provides a more holistic understanding of global change scenario ensembles."

However, it is unclear whether measuring soil lead is an effective way to screen for risk at the community or neighborhood level, nor if soil lead is a significant predictor of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) beyond other socioeconomic and physical environment covariates.

We present city‐scale soil lead and IEUBK risk maps for Chicago. Furthermore, while median household income remains the strongest single predictor of EBLL prevalence in our models, we provide evidence that soil lead independently contributes significant predictive power.

However, current studies tend to examine individual metals in isolation and rely on traditional linear regression models, which may not adequately reflect the complex, non‐linear and interactive effects of mixed metal exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between maternal mixed urinary HM exposure levels during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants using advanced machine learning methods. This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Guilin, from 2022 to 2023. A total of 489 pregnant women were enrolled. First‐trimester urine samples were collected to quantify HM concentrations using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through structured questionnaires. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression analysis revealed a significant cumulative effect of mixed metal exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes, with distinct dose‐response relationships. The risk of PTB and LBW increased monotonically with higher exposure levels; the adjusted odds ratios were elevated as metal mixture concentrations increased from the 25th to the 75th percentile. In contrast, the association with SGA exhibited a non‐monotonic pattern—higher risk at lower exposure levels and a marked decline in risk at higher concentrations. Inorganic arsenic was identified as the primary toxic component in univariate models. Multivariate response modeling demonstrated the joint influence of metal mixtures on adverse outcomes (AUC = 0.697), with no significant statistical interactions between individual metals, as indicated by parallel dose‐response curves (p > 0.05)."

 Enzymes are the molecular machines of life, and a key property that governs their function is substrate specificity—the ability of an enzyme to recognize and selectively act on particular substrates. This specificity originates from the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the enzyme active site and complicated transition state of the reaction1,2. Many enzymes can promiscuously catalyze reactions or act on substrates beyond those for which they were originally evolved1,3-5. However, millions of known enzymes still lack reliable substrate specificity information, impeding their practical applications and comprehensive understanding of the biocatalytic diversity in nature. Herein, we developed a cross-attention-empowered SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network architecture named EZSpecificity for predicting enzyme substrate specificity, which was trained on a comprehensive tailor-made database of enzyme-substrate interactions at sequence and structural levels. EZSpecificity outperformed the existing machine learning models for enzyme substrate specificity prediction, as demonstrated by both an unknown substrate and enzyme database and seven proof-of-concept protein families. Experimental validation with eight halogenases and 78 substrates revealed that EZSpecificity achieved a 91.7% accuracy in identifying the single potential reactive substrate, significantly higher than that of the state-of-the-art model ESP (58.3%).

 Given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the COVID-19 pandemic, constitutes a major environmental challenge faced by billions of people worldwide, we investigated whether paternal pre-conceptual SARS-CoV-2 infection has impacts on sperm RNA content, and intergenerational (F1) and transgenerational (F2) effects on offspring phenotypes. Using an established mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (P21) preclinical model, we infected adult male mice with the virus, or performed a mock control infection, and bred them with naïve female mice four weeks later, when males were no longer infectious. Here we show that offspring of infected sires display increased anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, the F1 offspring have significant transcriptomic changes in their hippocampus. Various sperm small noncoding RNAs, including PIWI-interacting RNAs, transfer-derived RNAs and microRNAs, are differentially altered by prior paternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Microinjection of RNA from the sperm of SARS-CoV-2 infected males into fertilized oocytes leads to a phenotype resembling that of the naturally born F1 offspring, supporting the interpretation that sperm RNAs are contributing to the outcomes of our paternal SARS-CoV-2 model.

 The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) of vegetation canopies is a crucial variable for understanding the ecosystem carbon cycle and assessing vegetation responses to climate change. Light absorption of the vegetation canopy is mainly determined by canopy structure and leaf optical properties. Traditional remote sensing methods typically estimate fAPAR from reflectance signals using radiative transfer models or empirical relationships with vegetation indices (VIs) and fAPAR. However, reflectance-based estimates often show moderate accuracy due to the complex relationship between reflected and absorbed fluxes. Airborne LiDAR provides direct information on canopy structural attributes relevant to radiation interception, such as fractional vegetation cover (fCover), which has been used to estimate fAPAR. However, the shortcomings of LiDAR in capturing the role of leaf optical properties introduce some uncertainty in fAPAR estimation. Combining reflectance with LiDAR data offers a promising pathway for improving fAPAR estimation. In this study, we adapted a physically-based model (fAPARRL) to integrate reflectance and LiDAR observations for fAPAR estimation. This model is grounded in spectral invariant theory and represents fAPAR as a function of visible and near-infrared reflectance and a LiDAR-derived canopy structural parameter. The model was evaluated against both VI- and LiDAR-based methods using NEON field datasets and synthetic datasets generated by the one-dimensional SCOPE and three-dimensional LESS radiative transfer models. Across these datasets, the combination of LiDAR and reflectance through the fAPARRL model consistently outperformed VI- and LiDAR-based approaches, with respective maximum improvements in R2 of 0.47 and 0.09. Sensitivity analyses on the simulated datasets further indicated that fAPARRL exhibited higher robustness to variations in chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI) than other conventional methods. The proposed fAPARRL model effectively integrates reflectance and LiDAR data through a physically-based scheme, offering improved accuracy and robustness for large-scale fAPAR estimation and ecosystem monitoring."

 In current super-resolution (SR) research, blind SR models capable of handling multiple degradations have attracted significant attention. Inspired by variational autoencoders (VAEs) that model data distributions through latent representations, this paper proposes a VAE framework for unsupervised remote sensing image (RSI) SR. VAEs excel at learning rich latent representations, modeling probabilistic distributions of input data and unsupervised learning, making them inherently well-suited to real-world blind SR scenarios. The proposed framework consists of an encoder that maps low-resolution (LR) images into a latent space and a decoder that reconstructs super-resolved images from the latent representations. To enhance latent modeling, an alternating optimization strategy is implemented for training the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, a comprehensive loss function and a latent coding regularization strategy are designed to constrain latent representations while maintaining image domain consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that on synthetic data, our method achieves favorable performance in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. It also demonstrates competitively performance compared to supervised methods, particularly in 4× and 8× SR tasks. Additionally, evaluations on Jilin-1 satellite RSIs further validate the effectiveness of our approach."

 In temperate regions, farm roadway networks exist on grassland farms to provide an efficient means to move dairy and beef animals between grazed paddocks and farmyards. During their movement, excreta is deposited on the roadway surface, resulting in phosphorus (P) enriched roadway runoff during rainfall events, which could impact water quality. Although national roadway networks have been mapped using deep learning approaches, internal farm roadway network mapping remains a knowledge gap. The objectives of this study were to develop an integrated workflow tailored to agricultural roadway mapping and runoff risk assessment through training a deep learning model to automatically detect and map internal farm roadways using high-resolution aerial imagery and further evaluating roadway sections that have the potential to generate roadway runoff with associated risk of water pollution. Three (3) model architectures (U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLab V3+) were tested and the best performing model was PSPNet with ResNet-50 backbone. The selected model demonstrated an overall performance of 0.79, 0.86, 0.82, 0.69 and 0.90 for precision, recall, F1 score IoU and overall accuracy, respectively.

 This study addresses the issues of why monsoon gyres (MGs) tend to appear over the western North Pacific in mid-summer and how tropical cyclone (TC) activity characterizes the MGs in terms of monthly and synoptic scales. On a monthly scale, a low-level anomalous cyclonic circulation to the south of Japan is well correlated with enhanced tropical convection to the southeast in active MG years, indicating a signature of the Rossby wave response to convective heating. The monthly mean features of MGs can be interpreted as a superposition of the climatological monsoon trough and the low-level cyclonic circulation anomaly due to the Rossby wave response. In addition, TCs tend to occur in the southern and eastern periphery of the MG in active MG years, suggesting a possible interaction between the MG and TCs. On a synoptic scale, the outer circulations of individual TCs accompany the moisture conveyor belt (MCB) and have the potential to induce MGs. Furthermore, the replacement of the outer circulation due to multiple TCs occurs repeatedly through the development of the MCB. Such replacement contributes to prolonging the life span of MGs, although the outer circulation of a single TC hardly maintains an MG for more than a week. It is found that synoptic-scale MGs are the collective manifestation of individual TCs and their outer circulations, while the characteristics of the Rossby wave response to TC-related heating become increasingly evident in MGs on longer timescales. These multiple-time-scale features are the essence of the MG."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108550,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注中国地表和高空风速的变化趋势。它利用地面气象站和无线电探空仪的观测数据，分析了中国不同地区地表风速和高空风速的变化情况。研究发现地表风速普遍下降，而高空风速在冬季呈现上升趋势，且高空风速的年际变化较大。虽然风速变化与大气环境有一定关联（例如，影响污染物的扩散），但该研究本身并不直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析，而是侧重于气候学和气象学的角度，分析风速的时空变化特征。,"['Wind speed', 'Surface observations', 'Radiosonde observations', 'Upper-air wind speed', 'Climatology', 'Meteorology']",Hairong Li;Song Yang;Cesar Azorin-Molina;Qinghong Zhao;Wentian Qiu;Xi Chen;Kaiqiang Deng,Uncovering seasonal wind speed changes across China using surface and upper-air observations,"•Surface and radiosonde observations are utilized to assess wind speed changes across China •Surface wind speed across China shows a widespread and consistent decline •Upper-air wind speed exhibits increasing trends over northern China during winter •Upper-air wind speed over China shows substantial interannual variability 
 Wind speed is a critical factor influencing hydrological cycles, aviation safety, and renewable energy production. While previous studies have extensively assessed changes in wind speed across China, most have focused on wind speed at ten meters (WS10), with limited attention given to upper-air wind speed (UWS). This study reveals considerable differences in changes and variability of both WS10 and UWS across China, utilizing surface and radiosonde observations. The results indicate a widespread and consistent decline in WS10 throughout China, followed by a recovery trend in many regions since the early 2000s, aligning with findings from prior research. In contrast, UWS does not exhibit consistent seasonal trends across the seasons. During winter, most regions of China have experienced increasing UWS trends, particularly in northern areas. However, in summer, UWS trends shift significantly toward negative values, especially at higher pressure levels. Vertically, coherent trends between the lower and upper troposphere are primarily observed in winter and summer, likely influenced by the strong westerly jet stream and East Asian monsoon circulation, respectively. Instead of following the long-term trends observed in WS10, UWS displays considerable interannual variations. These findings underscore the importance of considering vertical, regional, and seasonal dimensions when assessing wind changes and variability in China."

 An intense thunderstorm accompanied by lightning strikes claimed the lives of more than 11 people in Jaipur, Rajasthan, on 11th July 2021. This study investigates the influence of different Initial Conditions (ICs) on the simulation of this lightning event using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Various datasets Global Forecast System GFS (0.25° x 0.25°), Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)/ (FINAL) GDAS-FNL (0.25° x 0.25°), FNL (1° x 1°), and ERA5 (0.25° x 0.25°) were used as to assess their impact on model performance. The objectives of this study are to analyses the synoptic conditions associated with the thunderstorm and lightning event, evaluate the sensitivity of lightning simulations to different initial condition, and understand how these conditions influence the spatial and temporal distribution of lightning. The study also aims to assess how ICs affect the accuracy and predictability of lightning simulation. A comprehensive examination of meteorological factors during the onset of the monsoon season highlights the conditions that triggered this severe lightning event. Results show that between 1400 and 1600 UTC, when the event occurred, simulations using ERA5 outperformed FNL, GDAS-FNL, and GFS. ERA5 yielded the highest accuracy (0.67), along with improved scores for Probability of Detection (POD = 0.85), Critical Success Index (CSI = 0.53), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS = 0.36). The simulated lightning flash counts from ERA5 closely aligned with lightning observations over Rajasthan. Furthermore, the study evaluates the strengths and limitations of each ICs in representing key meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and lightning activity. Overall, the findings suggest that the ERA5 dataset provides the most reliable input for simulating precipitation and lightning over the region."

However, the height of the level separating the branches is dependent on the reanalysis considered. Thus, using the appropriate separation levels in model inter-comparisons could reduce the spread between models regarding climatology and trends in the circulation. 
 The wave-driven Brewer–Dobson circulation plays a crucial role in determining the transport of trace gases and aerosols in the stratosphere. We examine the structure of the circulation based on reanalysis data (ERA5, ERA-Interim, MERRA2, and JRA55) and the Transformed Eulerian Mean and downward control framework, aiming for a dynamical separation of different circulation branches in terms of outflow generated by wave driving. The results show the existence of different circulation regimes, with a deep circulation branch mainly driven by planetary waves with wavenumbers 1–3, and a shallow circulation branch mainly driven by smaller-scale waves with wavenumbers greater than 3. We propose a definition of the separation level between shallow and deep branches as the lowest level where outflow from planetary waves is larger than outflow from smaller-scale waves. We show that this level occurs at approximately 22 km (43 hPa) with a weak annual cycle. This climatological structure is robust in various reanalyses. The variability of the circulation in the deep branch above the separation level is mainly related to planetary waves, while the variability in the shallow branch is related to both smaller-scale and planetary waves. Trends in the circulation over the period 1980–2017 show an upward shift of the deep branch related to planetary waves and a downward shift of the shallow branch related to both planetary and smaller-scale waves. The height of the separation level shows no significant trend. Taking into account differences in wave driving between the branches of the circulation could explain the spread in model inter-comparisons."

Previous studies investigated wind noise trends at quarter day resolution and urban acoustic background variations on hourly to weekly scales. Cyclic variations at sub‐hourly resolution over local distances remain unaddressed. We show that topography‐driven micrometeorology impacts diurnal background noise levels below 10 Hz. Anthropogenic noise occurs over daily and weekly cycles, with inputs from traffic, ventilation systems, and power lines. These noise patterns vary at stations spaced less than a kilometer apart. We observe these phenomena by using a circular spectrogram to visualize frequency trends over a periodic temporal scale. This study demonstrates that infrasound microbarometer deployments can highlight localized wind patterns and time scales of human activity.

Reconstructions based on SOCATv2024 estimate substantially less ocean carbon uptake compared to those based on SOCATv2023, with a global mean difference of 0.25–0.27 PgCyr−1 over 2018–2022. We find that flux differences are due primarily to large changes in the Southern Ocean where data from 63 cruises was added for SOCATv2024.

SSEs have been observed at many subduction zones, some dynamically triggered by stress changes due to the passage of seismic waves. However, there are limited observations of SSEs induced by post‐seismic deformation. Here, we report a significant increase in the recurrence rate of SSEs in the shallow portion of the Nicoya megathrust following the 2012 Mw 7.6 earthquake. These shallow SSEs occurred immediately updip of the large afterslip zone and their recurrence rate returned to pre‐earthquake level 1.5 years after the earthquake. In contrast, deeper SSE recurrence rate remained unchanged. Coulomb Failure Stress modeling indicates the shallow SSE area experienced substantial stress perturbation during afterslip, while the deeper megathrust did not.

Data scarcity has hindered the quantification of PF occurrence and the identification of its drivers across diverse ecoregions. We address this gap by analyzing high‐frequency, multi‐depth soil moisture data across 17 ecoregions in the USA, using ∼1,500 sensors at 40 sites. We discovered that PF is widespread, with sites experiencing PF in up to 60% of rainfall events ≥2 mm. Multiple approaches consistently show that PF is more likely to occur with increased peak rainfall intensity, finer textured material, low soil moisture variability, humid climate, and higher net primary productivity. This suggests that PF patterns could shift with projected climate changes, increasing uncertainty in predictions of groundwater recharge, water quality, and streamflow generation."

Using satellite and model results, we show a weak negative correlation between surface eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and chlorophyll concentration nearshore, and a significant positive correlation offshore. EKE‐based composite analysis of phytoplankton carbon and nitrate NO3 $\left(\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{3}}\right)$ budgets highlights the spatial variability of eddy impacts. In the nearshore band (0–100 km), eddy‐induced horizontal advection reduces NO3 $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{3}}$ and biological production. In the 100–300 km band, eddy‐induced horizontal advection and vertical mixing increase NO3 $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{3}}$ in the surface mixed layer, boosting local productivity. Beyond 300 km, horizontal eddy advection directly exports phytoplankton offshore, increasing its local concentrations. These results clarify how mesoscale processes modulate primary production across different regions of the CCS and offer critical insight into potential ecosystem responses to future climate change."

The mechanism underlying the reactivation of positive leaders is yet unclear. Using the synchronous measurement of optical observation, discharge voltage, and current, a novel phenomenon related to the reactivation of positive leaders is reported in laboratory. It is disclosed that separate luminous structures, which lead to positive leader steps, can form ahead of decayed leaders. The single positive leader branch can be reactivated by a separate luminous structure accompanied by a steep‐rising current pulse superimposed on zero background current. When positive leaders show decayed branches during their development, separate luminous structures can reactivate decayed branches and result in alternating and competitive development among branches. This process is accompanied by a sudden elongation in length. The reactivation scenario reported here in laboratory helps to interpret that in natural lightning."

 Different decaying rates of El Niño events display significant distinct impacts on the Hadley circulation (HC), and the influences of rapid decay (RD) El Niño events on the HC is much greater than that of slow decay events. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art models can adequately capture the HC anomalies associated with RD El Niño events. This study evaluates 27 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 models of their ability to reproduce the HC anomalies during RD El Niño events. Based on the performance of spatial characteristics of the simulated HC anomalies during RD El Niño events, the models are categorized into Type I (with better performance) and Type II (with less satisfactory performance), and the physical causes underlying their performance differences are examined. Type I models reasonably capture the observed HC anomalies associated with RD events, while Type II models underestimate HC anomalies and exhibit evident structural deviations. By comparing sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and circulation anomalies across different regions, we find that Type II models exhibit cold SSTA biases in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP), which lead to reversed meridional SST gradients compared to observations and cause evident deviations in the spatial structure of HC anomalies. These results identify the anomalous SST distribution in the IPWP during RD El Niño events as an important factor limiting the performance of Type II models in reproducing RD El Niño events-related HC variations, and provide a reference for improving the simulation of tropical air–sea interactions during RD El Niño events."

 Changes in Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) significantly affect mid- to low-latitude climates, yet research regarding its effect on Eurasian climate change in early spring remains insufficient. Based on reanalysis datasets and model simulations, this study reveals a significant weakening in the relationship between the dipole pattern with opposite SIC anomalies in the northern (76°–82°N, 20°–50°E) and southern (70°–76°N, 47°–67°E) regions over the Barents Sea during late autumn and the dipole mode of surface air temperature (SAT) with opposite anomalies in the southern (15°–45°N, 35°–100°E) and northern (50°–75°N, 15°–180°E) regions over Eurasia during early spring around the 2000s. This change is attributed to different spatial patterns of SIC interannual anomalies in two subperiods. During Period 1 (1978/1979–1999/2000), the dipole SIC anomalous pattern may persist from November toward the following March, which modulates the SAT in situ by affecting turbulent heat flux and longwave radiation, which further strengthening eastward-propagating wave trains originating from the North Atlantic and inducing the dipole SAT pattern in Eurasia in the following March. In contrast, during Period 2 (2000/2001–2021/2022), consistent interannual SIC anomalies over the Barents Sea in late autumn weakened this relationship due to less pronounced wave trains propagating from the Barents Sea to Eurasia. The findings of this paper reveal that different patterns of Arctic SIC can lead to varying characteristics in the Eurasian climate, suggesting the complex relationship between Arctic and Eurasian climates."

 This study investigated the characteristics of summer storm cells over Taiwan, focusing on the tracking error statistics generated by the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking algorithm (SCIT). The primary objective is to understand the quantitative details of the currently lacking statistical features of storm cells and develop storm-based nowcasting techniques to improve early warning capability. Radar data from Wu-Fen Shan and Chi-Gu, collected from May to August over 8 years (2011–2018), were analysed. The study classified the statistics into synoptic and weak synoptic days to examine the influence of prevailing weather systems, and also analysed the characteristics of northern and southern Taiwan using different radars. The durations of summer storm cells detected by the SCIT algorithm in Taiwan mostly are within an hour. The main differences in statistical features under different conditions depend on the distribution location of storm cells. Complex terrain significantly contributes to storm cell deceleration. Storm cells exhibit larger tracking errors when detected by radars with longer scanning intervals or under conditions of higher movement speeds. Based on error statistics from different groups, two nowcasting techniques: the Potential Track Area for Storm (PTAS) and the Probability of Storm Tracking (PoST), were developed. PTAS assists forecasters in visualizing error regions for tracking forecasts, maintaining a 0.7 Probability of Detection (POD) score in 1 h forecasts, especially effective during typhoon circulations. PoST, complementary to PTAS, quantifies the probability values of each region threatened by storm cells. These products can be quickly updated with radar scans during real-time application, providing decision-makers with effective and timely warning information to enhance public safety during severe weather events."

This study developed an improved GRACE-derived GWSA dataset (igGWSA) over global land with full consideration of diverse non-groundwater components. Validation against in situ observations and model simulations demonstrated the high reliability of the dataset. 
 Accurate quantification of global groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) is imperative for global water security and socio-economic sustainability. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite has emerged as a prevailing methodology for estimating GWSA. However, oversimplification of non-groundwater components potentially compromised its accuracy in most previous studies. Here we present an improved GRACE-derived GWSA dataset at the global scale, namely igGWSA, with full consideration of non-groundwater components including glaciers, snow, permafrost, lakes, reservoirs, surface runoff, profile soil moisture (PSM), and plant canopy water based on current new datasets. In particular, PSM was generated based on Catchment Land Surface Model and random forest algorithm. igGWSA demonstrated strong agreement with well-observed groundwater level and model-simulated GWSA in five globally recognized hotspots of groundwater depletion. Compared to igGWSA with full consideration, simplified estimation would lead to misinterpretations of groundwater storage variations in glacier-covered regions, giant lakes, and deep-soil areas, highlighting the necessity of comprehensively accounting for non-groundwater components in estimating GWSA, especially under a changing environment. igGWSA dataset is publicly available on Zenodo through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16871689 (Wang et al., 2025)."

McCallum,GraphFlow v1.0: approximating groundwater contaminant  transport with graph-based methods – an application to  fault scenario selection,"To facilitate the exploration of alternative hydrogeological scenarios, we propose approximating costly physical simulations of contaminant transport by means of more affordable shortest-distance computations. This enables us to accept or reject scenarios within a predefined confidence interval. In particular, this can allow us to estimate the probability of a fault acting as a preferential path or a barrier. 
 Groundwater contaminant transport problems remain challenging with respect to their computing requirements. This often limits the exploration of the conceptual uncertainty that is mainly related to large-scale geological features – such as faults, fractures, and stratigraphic variations – and limited characterization. Here, to facilitate geological conceptual uncertainty exploration, we develop further the use of graph representation for geological models to approximate groundwater flow and transport. We consider a faulted multi-heterogeneous-layer medium to test our approach. The existing rank correlation between the shortest path distribution from a contaminant source to the model domain outlet and the cumulative mass distribution at the outlet enables us to perform scenario selection. The scenario selection approach relies on a metric combining the Jaccard dissimilarity and the Wasserstein distance to compare binary images. Among a set combining eight alternative scenarios, where three faults can act as either a flow barrier or a preferential path, we show that the use of graph approximations allows us to retain or reject scenarios with confidence, as well as to estimate the individual probability of a fault to act as a barrier or a path. This methodology framework opens up possibilities to explore more thoroughly conceptual geological uncertainty for processes affected by flow and transport."

This new tool has the potential to become a general statistics tool. The integrated FZStats v1.0 toolbox in this study includes all three models mentioned above, providing new methodological support for understanding and addressing spatial statistical issues. 
 Focal and zonal statistics are fundamental tools in geographic information systems (GISs) for characterizing spatial patterns, yet they have traditionally addressed spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) and spatial positional dependence (SPD) in isolation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce FZStats v1.0, a Python 3/QT5–based toolbox that not only integrates conventional focal and zonal statistics, but also implements a novel focal–zonal mixed statistics approach capable of jointly capturing both SSH and SPD. First, we formally develop the focal–zonal mixed statistics model to address stratified heterogeneity, spatial dependence, and their interactions within a unified framework – filling a key methodological gap left by traditional approaches that cannot accommodate their co-occurrence in real-world spatial data. Second, FZStats v1.0 provides a user-friendly graphical interface for flexible configuration of neighborhood window shapes (e.g., rectangular, circular, elliptical), sizes, and statistical operations (e.g., mean, percentiles). It also supports multiprocessing and batch operations, enabling scalable computation across diverse spatial analysis tasks. Third, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the new method through a geothermal anomaly detection case study. Across multiple years, seasons, representative target sizes, and local window radii, the focal–zonal mixed statistics consistently outperforms both focal and zonal statistics, demonstrating its superior capability in enhancing anomaly signals under complex spatial conditions. In summary, FZStats v1.0 is not only a theoretically grounded and methodologically novel tool, but also a highly adaptable and practical solution for spatial data analysis in diverse application domains."

It includes updated turbulent length scales and eddy diffusivity coefficients that account for atmospheric stability, along with explicit representation of urban vegetation, such as street trees and green spaces. The model runs offline with low computational demands, making it suitable for standalone use, integration with climate projections, and long-term simulations to evaluate emission scenarios and adaptation strategies. Validation against data from the Urban-PLUMBER project at a suburban site in Preston (Melbourne, Australia) demonstrates that MLUCM BEP + BEM reliably reproduces shortwave (SWup) and longwave (LWup) radiation, as well as latent (Qle), sensible (Qh), and momentum (Qtau) fluxes. Its overall performance is on par with, and in several cases surpasses, that of other established urban models with particularly notable improvements in the simulation of momentum flux (Qtau). Some refinements are still needed, particularly in modelling tree-soil moisture dynamics to reduce surface energy budget imbalances. Thanks to its flexibility and efficiency, MLUCM BEP + BEM is well-suited for assessing urban overheating, building energy demand, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as green roofs, cool materials, and photovoltaic systems under various future climate scenarios."

Analysis demonstrates that these extra stripes originate concurrently with their conventional counterparts and evolve following the drift echo hypothesis.

We interpret the extra stripes as indication of non‐m=1 $m=1$ components in the electric field perturbations, in contrast to the traditional m=1 $m=1$ mode that drives the conventional stripes.

Data yield the first estimates of year‐round Pacific‐to‐Arctic nitrate flux (10.4 ± 1.6 kmol/s) based on in situ measurements (rather than inferred values); suggest that, due to flow increase, the nitrate flux has most likely increased over the last three decades; and indicate the nitrate‐salinity relationship used by others to predict Bering Strait nitrate breaks down in winter, making in situ measurements essential to constrain the changing Pacific nutrient inflow to the Arctic."

 Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Influenza A viruses (IAV) induce Z-form nucleic acid Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1)-initiated cell death1-8. ZBP1 is activated by Z-RNA1,7,9, and the Z-RNAs which trigger ZBP1 during HSV-1 and IAV infections were assumed to be of viral origin1. However, we show here that host cell-encoded Z-RNAs are major and sufficient ZBP1 activating ligands following infection by these two human pathogens. The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3’ extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3’ processing of nascent pre-mRNAs10-15. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT13,15, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery."

 The origin and composition of Earth’s silica-rich continental crust, particularly the lower crust, remain uncertain. Stable continental crust, including cratons and crust older than 200 million years, is marked by enrichment of radiogenic heat-producing elements (U, Th and K) in the upper crust and depletion in the lower crust. Because the lower crust probably consists of >50% aluminous metasedimentary and evolved metaigneous rocks—both initially enriched in U and Th—continental differentiation requires a mechanism to transfer these elements upwards. Here, in our analysis of partially melted metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks, we show that ultrahigh temperatures (>900 °C) are essential to stratify heat production and stabilize crust. Removal of small fractions of ultrahigh-temperature melt generated by fluid-absent melting can produce the observed lower-crustal depletions in U and Th. By contrast, lower-temperature melting fails to drive differentiation owing to the resilience of monazite to dissolution in granitic melts. Our findings establish ultrahigh-temperature melting as an important criterion for the formation of stable continents, providing a direct link between the formation of cratons and ultrahigh-temperature metamorphic terrains and the supercontinent cycle. This insight constrains the tectonic settings responsible for crustal differentiation. Stabilization of continental crust requires temperatures of over 900 °C, establishing a link between ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism and craton formation, according to a study of U and Th concentrations in metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks."

Here, the authors report the melt blending of multiple immiscible polymers to achieve high dielectric permittivity while retaining low dielectric loss tangent. 
 There is increasing need for higher performance dielectric polymers for devices in power conversion systems for renewable energy generation and electric vehicles. In particular, materials with higher dielectric permittivity, lower loss and the ability to operate at higher temperatures. We have developed a counter intuitive method to achieve this, the melt blending of multiple immiscible polymers, in an approach that mimics high entropy materials design. We demonstrate that using this approach we can significantly exceed the rule-of-mixtures for the dielectric constant (>250%), whilst surprisingly retaining a low loss tangent. The materials show increased thermal stability up to 150 °C, which opens up the possibility of the wider application of dielectric polymers. We provide a consistent model to describe the behaviour based on the use of polymers with different glass transition temperatures to frustrate the de-blending of the immiscible polymers during melt processing. This produces highly amorphous and disordered polymer blends with increased inter-chain spacing (free volume) and increased rotational freedom of the polar groups in polar nano regions. This approach has wide applicability to other polar polymer blends and is scalable.

 Reprogramming gene expression at the translational level drives intestinal tumorigenesis. Codon decoding during translation elongation relies on tRNA modifications, while their pathological relevance in colorectal cancer remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that AlkB homolog 8 (ALKBH8), a uridine 34 (U34) tRNA methyltransferase, is a direct target of Wnt/β-catenin and is upregulated in colorectal cancer. Genetic ablation of ALKBH8 inhibits the development of intestinal tumors in Apcmin/+, azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS), and xenograft models. Loss of ALKBH8 induces ribosome pausing at adenine-ending codons, impairing the translation elongation of mRNAs enriched with these codons. Specifically, ALKBH8 regulates the translation of KRAS proto-oncogene in a codon-dependent manner. Rescue experiments demonstrate that the methyltransferase activity of ALKBH8 is required for its translation-promoting function. Together, our findings reveal ALKBH8-dependent mRNA translation as a critical mediator of intestinal tumorigenesis, underscoring its potential as a promising target for colorectal cancer therapy.

 In recent decades, Europe has warmed rapidly while a prominent ‘warming hole’ has muted changes in eastern North America. Paradoxically, the pattern coincides with cooling in the North Atlantic, even though ocean cooling is commonly expected to chill Europe, not North America. The regional departures from global trends and expectations may have informative precedents in millennial-scale climate anomalies during the Holocene. Here, circum-Atlantic records reveal that counter-intuitive European warming developed amid rapid cooling of the North Atlantic and North America from 5.8-4.8 ka and after 2.2 ka. The anomalies track rapid reductions in the flow of North Atlantic Deep Water southwest of Iceland and appear in independent but highly correlated records of mean sea-surface temperatures, continental temperatures, and hydroclimate changes from both sides of the Atlantic.

 Multilayer ceramic capacitors are pivotal components in pulse power systems due to their ultra-high power density. However, given the demanding service conditions in aerospace and oil drilling applications, the need to enhance high-temperature energy storage remains particularly urgent. In this work, we employ a strain modulation strategy by enhancing configuration entropy within bismuth sodium titanate-based ceramics. This approach enhances relaxor behavior, suppresses electron migration, and improves structural stability and breakdown strength at elevated temperatures. Notably, the resulting multilayer ceramic capacitors exhibit a substantial recoverable energy density of 19.0 J cm−3 and an impressive efficiency of 90% under an electric field of 1320 kV cm−1. Furthermore, these capacitors sustain a high energy density above 11.0 J cm−3 even at 200 °C. This extraordinary high-temperature energy storage performance surpasses those of recently reported multilayer ceramic capacitors.

Here, authors show that behavioral changes during Pavlovian learning explain DA activity regardless of reward prediction or valence, supporting an adaptive gain model of DA function. 
 The reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis posits that phasic dopamine (DA) activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encodes the difference between expected and actual rewards to drive reinforcement learning. However, emerging evidence suggests DA may instead regulate behavioral performance. Here, we used force sensors to measure subtle movements in head-fixed mice during a Pavlovian stimulus-reward task, while recording and manipulating VTA DA activity. We identified distinct DA neuron populations tuned to forward and backward force exertion. They are active during both spontaneous and conditioned behaviors, independent of learning or reward predictability. Variations in force and licking fully account for DA dynamics traditionally attributed to RPE, including variations in firing rates related to reward magnitude, probability, and omission. Optogenetic manipulations further confirmed that DA modulates force exertion and behavioral transitions in real time, without affecting learning. Our findings challenge the RPE hypothesis and instead suggest that VTA DA neurons dynamically adjust the gain of motivated behaviors, controlling their latency, direction, and intensity during performance.

 The development of efficient synthetic methods to access optically pure helical chiral molecules is a central challenge in organic chemistry due to their unique photophysical properties and potential applications in chiral photonic devices. Conventional strategies often struggle to simultaneously install multiple chiral elements with high fidelity and are typically limited to synthesizing a single scaffold at a time.

This process achieves simultaneous kinetic resolution and homologation, but also intriguing regioselectivity at the cases of un-symmetric ketones. Furthermore, the synthesized helical compounds exhibit significant chiroptical activity, with their circularly polarized absorption dissymmetry factors (gabs) showing a strong dependence on the position and steric nature of aryl substituents, and some derivatives also display circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

 Climate scepticism remains an important barrier to public engagement with accurate climate information, because sceptics often actively avoid information that contains climate science facts. There still lacks a scalable, repeatable intervention to boost sceptics’ engagement with climate information. Here we show that generative artificial intelligence can enhance engagement with climate science among sceptical audiences by subtly modifying headlines to reduce anticipated disagreement, regret and negative emotions, without compromising factual integrity. Headlines of climate science articles modified by an open-source large language model led to more bookmarks and more upvotes, and these effects were strongest among the most sceptical participants.

These results show that generative artificial intelligence can alter the information diet sceptics consume and holds promise for advancing public understanding of science when responsibly deployed by well-intentioned actors.

 El Niño significantly impacts the global Hadley circulation (HC), however, the modulation of different decay rates of El Niño on the HC is overlooked. Our research reveals that rapid decay (RD) events cause the global HC to exhibit an equatorially asymmetric configuration, in contrast to the quasi-symmetric structure seen during slow decay (SD) events. This is primarily driven by HC anomalies in the central-eastern Pacific, influenced by anomalous sea surface temperatures that impact the conversion of atmospheric perturbation potential energy to kinetic energy. The structure of regional HC anomalies in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) exhibits contrasting patterns within different events. During RD (SD) events, the intensified (weakened) regional HC over the IPWP results in increased (decreased) terrestrial precipitation over its coastal countries. Therefore, our findings have important implications for understanding and predicting regional climate impacts associated with different El Niño decay patterns."

 Nitrogen (N) cycling has been reshaped during the Anthropocene epoch, yet the global change pattern of sedimentary N stable isotope (δ15N) remains unclear. Previous research has mainly focused on changes of sedimentary δ15N in remote areas or during the Holocene epoch, yet the differentiation of sedimentary δ15N between remote areas and disturbed regions and the onset of the differentiation time are neglected in the Anthropocene epoch. Here we synthesized published records of well-dated δ15N abundance in sedimentary sequences from 173 sites globally, including natural and disturbed areas, and proposed a conceptual diagram to descript the global change patterns of sedimentary δ15N in past 300 years. Sedimentary δ15N in disturbed sites enriched, with two breakpoints in 1910s and 1950s. The other one, δ15N trend in natural sites mostly depleted, with a breakpoint in 1920s. The timeline aligns with unprecedented anthropic perturbations to the global N cycle, such as the invention and application of the Haber-Bosch process. The divergence of δ15N change pattern between disturbed and natural areas can be attributed to either direct human activities or indirect consequences. Taken together, we propose that the 1910s − 1930s can be considered the precursor of the Anthropocene due to the application of artificial N fixation and its consequent biogeochemical effect. We emphasize that the Haber-Bosch process could be the important event before the impact of human activities on Earth history is reflected in global stratigraphy.

 Urban air pollution in megacities like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad frequently exceeds World Health Organization guidelines, driven by vehicular and industrial emissions, posing significant health risks to vulnerable populations. From November 2022 to February 2023, the average concentration of major air pollutants including particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ground level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), volatile organic carbon (VOC), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), ammonia (NH3) in ambient air were recorded using a calibrated Aeroqual Series 500 sampler at high-traffic sites across these cities. This study tested the hypothesis that phyllospheric microbes inhabiting leaf surfaces of roadside plants adapts to high pollution levels and may serve as bio-indicators of urban air quality. A total of 287 bacterial isolates from 42 plant species were collected across eight sampling locations and genetically characterized based on conserved repetitive DNA sequences dispersed throughout the bacterial genome-using Rep-PCR (BOX, ERIC, REP primers) to assess microbial diversity and conserved repetitive DNA sequences. Results showed high genetic polymorphism (94.7–98.0 %) and distinct clustering (8–38 clusters per city) patterns, with REP-PCR showing the highest discriminatory power (Simpson's Index: 0.938–0.976). Certain plants species such as Ficus benjamina, Phoenix dactylifera, and Euphorbia milii hosted the most diverse microbial communities, particularly in heavily polluted areas such as Lahore, where strains exhibited up to 62 bands. Principal component analysis (PCA) further confirmed that genetic linkages were influenced by pollution stress, with REP and BOX primers accounting for the maximum variance. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a strong positive correlation (p < 0.05) between all air pollutants except O3 at all sites. These findings suggest a correlation between phyllosphere microbial diversity and the intensity of air pollution, with pollution-tolerant plants supporting stress-adapted microbes.

 Accurate wind speed forecasting is crucial for optimizing the efficiency of wind energy generation. To improve the accuracy of wind speed forecasting at 100 m height in northwest China, hybrid approaches integrating machine learning techniques with multimodel ensemble methods (MME) were explored and evaluated against traditional MME methods. This study utilized data from 54 wind farms and five global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, covering the period from February 2021 to January 2022. The six forecasting methods were categorized into two groups: (1) traditional ensemble methods, including equally weighted mean (EWM), unequally weighted mean (UWM), and single farm-based UWM (SFUWM); and (2) machine learning-based ensemble methods, including linear regression (LR), Lasso regression, and random forest (RF). The results showed that machine learning-based MME methods outperformed traditional methods in accurately capturing both climatological patterns and diurnal variations of wind speed. Specifically, the RF and Lasso LR methods achieved notable performance enhancements, with mean RMSE reductions of 0.57 m s−1 (24.9 %) and 0.56 m s−1 (24.6 %), respectively, relative to the ECMWF-IFS baseline. In addition, traditional MME methods demonstrated limited effectiveness, primarily improving forecasts for weak wind speeds (0–6 m s−1) while adversely affecting strong wind speed predictions. In contrast, machine learning-based MME methods exhibited comprehensive improvements across all wind speed categories with substantially greater enhancement magnitudes. Further error decomposition analysis revealed that improvements achieved by MME methods were generally co-contributed by reductions in the bias component (BIAS) and sequence component (SEQU), while partially offset by distribution component (DIST). Specifically, BIAS reduction plays a more substantial role in total RMSE reduction for machine learning-based MME methods (75.9 % ∼ 85.9 %) than for traditional MME methods (3.3 % ∼ 22.5 %), leading to the superior100-m wind speed forecasting performance of machine learning-based MME methods. This study demonstrates the potential of MME forecasting in improving 100-m wind speed predictions, which provides a valuable reference for wind farm operations and wind energy applications."

 Convection initiation (CI) mechanisms of an extreme rainstorm (ER) event that occurred in June 2021 in Hotan, Xinjiang, Northwest China, are investigated using the observational data of automatic weather stations, Fengyun-4 A satellite data, reanalysis data, and simulation data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The results show that continuous CI sites occurred near a boundary layer convergence line (BLCL), which was generated due to the merger of a cold pool and a low-level easterly jet (LLEJ). Most of the initiated convective cells developed rapidly and gradually merged with other convective systems, resulting in a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that was responsible for the heavy precipitation in the ER event. Diagnostic analysis of vertical momentum budget along the Lagrangian backward trajectory of air parcels within a convective cell initiated near the BLCL indicates that the dynamic acceleration (ad) was responsible for the vertical acceleration of the air parcels during the rapid-ascending stage of the CI. Further decomposition of ad reveals that the Extension term played a decisive role, while the Twisting term provided negative contributions and the Curvature term was negligibly small.

 Recent studies suggest that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can influence Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) forecasts, though this relationship remains inadequately examined, especially in boreal summer. Here, we address this gap using multiple dynamical models to systematically evaluate MJO forecast skill across seasons, initial phases, and amplitudes. Results show distinct seasonal dependencies. In boreal winter, MJO forecasts are more skillful during La Niña. This is primarily attributed to improved prediction of phase-2 MJO, which is more intense during La Niña. The phase-2 MJO propagates too fast and encounters an exaggerated Maritime Continent barrier during El Niño, reducing forecast accuracy. The superior prediction of initially strong MJO events during La Niña further boosts forecasts skill. Conversely, during boreal summer, El Niño yields better MJO forecasts than La Niña, stemming from models' ability to accurately capture the eastward-propagating, wavenumber-1 structure of the MJO in phases 3–4 under El Niño. During La Niña, however, westward-propagating disturbances dominate in these phases, which models consistently fail to reproduce, thus lowering forecast skill. Furthermore, in La Niña summers, forecast skill declines with increasing MJO amplitude, especially when initialized from phases 1–3. While models adeptly predict the stationary pattern of low-amplitude MJO, they struggle with the continuous eastward propagation of high-amplitude MJO, partly due to the exaggerated representation of dry, westward-moving signals from the central-eastern Pacific. This work enhances understanding of MJO–ENSO interaction dynamics and has practical implications for subseasonal forecasting."

 This study investigates the lifecycle dynamics of a multicell hailstorm event that occurred over Konya, Türkiye on 8 June 2022, using high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The analysis integrates synoptic-scale diagnostics, mesoscale storm structure, cloud microphysics, radar-model comparisons, and wavelet-based spectral techniques to comprehensively characterize the storm's development, maturation, and dissipation. WRF simulations at multiple vertical and horizontal levels capture the atmospheric environment conducive to severe convection, including strong low-level warm advection, mid-level moisture surges, and upper-level divergence associated with a jet streak. Simulated convective evolution reveals a clear three-stage lifecycle: initiation at ∼13:10 UTC with the development of vertically compact but intense convective towers; a mature phase between 14:30 and 14:50 UTC characterized by organized multicell structures, overshooting tops, and deep convective updrafts; and a dissipation phase after 16:30 UTC marked by weakening updrafts, fragmented cloud fields, and diminished hydrometeor content. Validation against radar MAX and Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL) products shows strong agreement with WRF-simulated maximum reflectivity and Integrated Liquid Water Content (ILWC), especially during the mature phase. A continuous wavelet transform (CWT) applied to both model-derived reflectivity and ILWC time series reveals a dominant periodicity of approximately 75 min during the mature stage. This primary timescale is accompanied by shorter convective pulses of 20–30 min, likely linked to successive updraft regeneration and hydrometeor accumulation cycles. The strong coherence between dBZ and ILWC wavelet signals confirms the tight coupling between dynamic and thermodynamic storm processes. The integration of dynamical, thermodynamical, and spectral diagnostics provides a robust framework to quantify and classify the convective lifecycle of a multicellular hailstorm. Complementary spatiotemporal wavelet entropy diagnostics revealed the degree of temporal complexity, with moderate entropy during initiation, elevated values during the mature stage, and declining irregularity during dissipation, thereby providing a structural perspective on storm organization. These findings highlight the capacity of high-resolution models not only to simulate severe storm evolution, but also to uncover embedded temporal rhythms using wavelet-based methods, a.k.a. the heartbeat of multicell convection."

Few studies have quantified the full fertilizing potential of human excreta across national contexts, or under a range of diverse food systems. This study provides the first systematic assessment of the potential contribution of N in human excreta to current cropland fertilization in a wide range of countries, covering 80% of the global population. Using food supply and demographic data, we estimate N in human excreta for each country and compare it to current cropland total N inputs, including synthetic fertilizers, manure, biological fixation, and atmospheric deposition. Assuming a 100% recovery rate of human excreta to estimate an upper-bound potential, under the current situation, we find that human excreta (37 MtN at the global scale) could provide 15%–30% of current cropland N inputs in most countries, 30%–50% in sub-Saharan Africa, and over 50% in major agricultural importers (e.g. Japan, Korea, Algeria). In contrast, large agricultural exporters with high external inputs, such as Argentina or the United States, show lower potential (5%–10%). For the whole world, the rate is 20%. For most countries, N excreted by humans is also of the same order of magnitude as (and often superior to) livestock manure currently applied to croplands. In addition to an analysis of the current situation, we assess how improved food system efficiency-via more vegetarian diets, reduced losses and increased manure recycling thanks to better coupling of husbandry and crop cultivation-could affect the potential contribution. Under deeply transformative agro-ecological scenarios, the global contribution of human excreta to N fertilization could exceed 30%. This work focuses on maximum potentials; future research should focus on realistic recovery rates ( 100%) and adjust our results accordingly."

However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the interplay between HWP carbon flows, traditional forest product market developments, and climate policy developments incentivizing bioenergy and carbon sequestration in forestry at global scales. Information on the extent to which future policy and market developments can impact global carbon fluxes in wood product pools is needed for guiding policy design and quantifying longer-term tradeoffs between carbon stock preservation in forests and increased carbon sequestration in wood products. This study builds on projections from a forest model inter-comparison analysis of three global forest sector models to estimate the potential carbon pool in HWPs across various socioeconomic scenarios and levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) policy ambition. Further, we assess the extent to which the use of bioenergy, paired with carbon capture and storage, can enhance this forest carbon sink. In scenarios with higher levels of global timber production, even in scenarios with fossil-fueled economic growth, we see an increase in carbon stored in wood products used for housing materials, lumber, pulp, and paper products. However, climate policy stringency reduces the HWP sink, shifting C sequestration to forests and allocating harvests to bioenergy systems. The use of carbon capture and storage substantially increases the global HWP carbon sink. The results of this study highlight how economic and policy factors could impact the role of global forests in climate mitigation through carbon storage in long-lived wood products and bioenergy carbon capture and storage pools, providing new insight to policy-makers, forest managers, and forest product manufacturers on viable pathways to support the co-production of timber and carbon sinks."

As future droughts are expected to become more frequent and severe, accurately predicting the unprecedentedly low water storage levels and water shortages in advance is crucial. Herein, we developed a new approach to predict terrestrial water storage (TWS) during droughts, based on monthly changes in TWS (ΔTWS) and meteorological variables from 2003 to 2023. The model was trained during non-drought months and assessed during the four droughts when TWS values are well below the range of training data. The ΔTWS-based model excels in predicting drought-month TWS even only using precipitation and incoming solar radiation, with average correlation (R) over 0.9 and RMSE below 50 mm. The model also showed superior skills for predicting drought TWS months lead-time, with the 3-month prediction achieved high performance (R > 0.8, RMSE < 80 mm). We further examined TWS predictions during the large-scale 2023 drought and found that the predicted TWS showed high spatial agreement with observed TWS, with all 1-, 2-, and 3-month lead-times reaching average R values over 0.9. Then we evaluated water deficits in the driest months (September—December) in 2023. The model predicted the affected regions with reasonable accuracy, achieving an average of 72% even at 3-month lead-time. We also analyzed how uncertainty in meteorological inputs affects model performance, revealing higher input uncertainty reduced the model performance. This study presents a reliable approach for estimating and predicting low water storage during severe large-scale droughts, enabling early warnings of water deficits across the Amazon. This study could be generalized to other regions, supporting proactive water resource management, water security policies, ecosystem protection and climate adaptation strategies."

Despite extensive scientific study and significant attention given to these two phenomena due to their potential influence on Earth’s changing climate, a physical link between them has yet to be established. Here, by examining atmospheric circulation in response to shifts in major climate variability modes before and after these dramatic changes, we showed that a combination of large-scale circulation patterns drove both the decline in Antarctic sea ice and the increase in Ross Sea DSW salinity. After the mid-2010s, climate-driven atmospheric circulation generated anomalous northerly winds across much of the high-latitude Southern Ocean. However, the Ross Sea sector uniquely experienced strengthened southerly flow of cold continental air. Consequently, this process led to enhanced sea ice loss around Antarctica through warmer air advection from the north, yet simultaneously, expanded the Ross Sea polynyas, enhancing sea ice formation and contributing to increased Ross Sea DSW salinity. Our findings, therefore, establish a robust linkage between these two Southern Ocean transitions, highlighting their interdependence driven by large-scale climate modes."

With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events driven by climate change, understanding the cascading nature of drought and flood events has become crucial for effective disaster risk management. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how these drought-flood interactions work and translate to economic losses. This study addresses this gap by identifying CDFEs and flood-only events (FEs) across Central Europe and linking them to their flood impacts from the modelled Historical Analysis of Natural Hazards in Europe database. CDFEs are associated with significantly higher maximum daily mean streamflow (58.51 m3 s−1 vs 38.20 m3 s−1), deeper mean water depths (1.90 m vs 1.88 m), and greater economic losses (€33.09 million km−2 vs €29.75 million km−2) compared to FEs.

To address this gap, this study conducted a comparative assessment of flood exposure in China using five population datasets and five flood hazard datasets. Furthermore, it explored the absolute and relative impacts of data uncertainties on 100 year return period flood exposure and discussed the underlying causes. Results exhibit substantial variations in flood exposure when different data combinations are employed. Specifically, there is a significant difference of 333 million individuals within the exposure range, with the highest estimate being 2.82 times the lowest one. Overall, the exposure variation was primarily from differences in flood hazards rather than population patterns, but their relative importance differed spatially depending on factors of slope, altitude, and artificial surface coverage. Despite the differences, all 25 data combinations revealed a disproportional larger share of population in floodplains, which was 2.28–3.49 times the share of floodplains.

Using a cointegration modeling approach, we analyze data from 2006–2023 to uncover long-run equilibria and short-run forecasting power between farmland prices, agribusiness stock prices, and commodity prices in Brazil. We found that farmland prices not only co-move with commodity and stock prices but also Granger-cause financial valuations of agribusiness firms, suggesting that land is increasingly treated as a forward-looking financial indicator rather than a productive asset. The financialization of land markets, as evidenced by these dynamics, can complicate Brazil’s efforts to achieve sustainability goals if proper governance is not in place. To avoid risks of shareholder capitalism—i.e. maximize profits for its investors as primary goal at the expense of ecological or social aspects—, companies might incorporate environmental metrics into how they manage investments and by regulatory frameworks can require financial disclosures that clearly show ecological risks.

 The radioactive noble gas radon (222Rn) is a suitable tracer for atmospheric transport and mixing processes that can be used to evaluate and calibrate atmospheric transport models or to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the so-called radon tracer method (RTM). However, these applications require reliable estimates of the 222Rn fluxes from the soil. This study evaluates two process-based 222Rn flux maps in central Europe in 2021 using the flux results from a 1-year 222Rn inversion. The maps are based on different soil moisture reanalysis products (GLDAS-Noah and ERA5-Land), which are used to describe the diffusive 222Rn transport in the soil. The 222Rn inversion was conducted using the CarboScope-Regional inversion system and observational data from 17 atmospheric sites in central Europe in 2021. We observe that, in particular, the ERA5-Land-based 222Rn flux map underestimates the data-driven fluxes from the inversion. Our inversion yields ca. 20 % (GLDAS-Noah) to almost 100 % (ERA5-Land) larger 222Rn fluxes than the respective process-based prior fluxes within a domain covering Germany. Also, the temporal variability seems to be underestimated by the process-based flux maps. Using a flat (uniform) prior inversion, we found a significant anti-correlation of −0.6 (and −0.8) between the posterior 222Rn flux and the GLDAS-Noah (and ERA5-Land) soil moisture time series, indicating that soil moisture is an important driver for the temporal variability in the 222Rn fluxes. To investigate the robustness of our flux estimates, we run the inversion with three different transport models (STILT, FLEXPART, NAME). The respective annual mean flux results agree within ca. 10 %."

 The Mediterranean Sea is experiencing rapid environmental changes, underscoring the urgent need for high-quality, long-term datasets to quantify trends and assess impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Over the past few years, a lot of work has been done to improve and ensure data quality in the western Mediterranean Sea (WMED), but reliable dissolved oxygen (O2) data remain scarce. This is a critical gap as oxygen is a key indicator of marine ecosystem health and plays a central role in carbon and nutrient cycling. To address this gap, we compiled and rigorously quality-controlled a new regional-scale WMED dataset of O2 data from sensors mounted on conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) probes: CTD-O2WMED. This product includes over 1000 previously unpublished high-resolution vertical profiles of CTD-O2 measurements mostly collected within Italian cruises between 2004 and 2023. The quality control (QC) process involved sensor post-calibration against discrete Winkler measurements, primary screening, and a secondary check based on crossover analysis with reference datasets.  Combined, this ensures the consistency of the final corrected CTD-O2WMED across both space and time. CTD-O2WMED provides a robust observational foundation for assessing trends of dissolved oxygen variability, mainly associated with climate change, anomalies related to deoxygenation processes, and contributes to advancing our understanding of ventilation processes in the WMED.

Small streams emerge alongside lakes when ice in the ground melts away, potentially accelerating thawing and biogeochemical activity in a positive feedback cycle. This study provides a comprehensive dataset on these little-studied streams, including thermally and hydrologically important variables essential for improving numerical models. 
 Permafrost thaw affects the global carbon cycle and can significantly alter landscape morphology and associated processes of mass and energy transfer. An understudied aspect of affected permafrost landscapes are ubiquitous rivers connecting thermokarst lakes. These ubiquitous features of Arctic landscapes exhibit particularly high variability in water and energy transfer, and thus provide an excellent field laboratory for analyzing how expected changes in meteorological forcing under climate change affect permafrost dynamics and carbon exchange within the land- and limnoscape. This paper presents a database from 2012 through 2022 for one such small stream connecting two thermokarst lakes. First, two main stream cross sections were instrumented with multiple thermistor chains to record temperature evolution from the surface to different soil depths. The cross sections covered different topography and vegetation cover. One was located near the upper, and one in between the two thermokarst lakes. The main focus was set on the cross section midway between the two lakes due to the absence of a thermal imprint from the lake. Air, water, and ground temperatures, as well as river water parameters, and soil properties of the surrounding environment were measured as time series or single tests during annual field campaigns. The data are organized in three main categories: atmosphere, water and ground, and are complemented by a GIS including a digital surface model and an ortho-mosaic photo of the entire river valley to facilitate the search for measurements of interest. The database comes with a complete set of scripts to process any of the data, which are provided in CSV or other easily accessible standard file formats. Ultimately, the data can be used to develop models and validate numerical codes for improving the representation of permafrost processes in land surface and climate models where climate change induces significant changes in heat and mass transfer. All data and processing scripts are available through an online repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14619854; Pohl et al. (2025))."

Kay;Penny Rowe,A novel model hierarchy isolates the limited effect of supercooled liquid cloud optics on infrared radiation,"We developed a novel methodology for assessing whether a new physics parameterization should be added to a climate model based on its effect across a hierarchy of model dynamical constraints. Our study used this model hierarchy to evaluate the effect of a new cloud radiation parameterization on longwave radiation and determined that the parameterization should be added to climate radiation models, but its effect is not large enough to be a priority. 
 Clouds exert strong influences on surface energy budgets and climate projections. Yet, cloud physics are complex and often incompletely represented in models. For example, supercooled liquid cloud optics parameterizations are rarely incorporated into the radiative transfer models used for climate projections. Prior work has shown that incorporating these optics in longwave radiation calculations increases Arctic downwelling longwave fluxes by as much as 1.7 W m−2. Here we examine whether implementing supercooled liquid water optics in climate models for longwave radiation impacts global radiative fluxes and climate. We use a novel methodology that uses a hierarchy of dynamical constraints on the sequence of atmospheric states. In the model experiments with stronger dynamical constraints, we find that the supercooled liquid water optics increase Arctic downwelling longwave by 2.17–3.24 W m−2. In contrast, these optics increased Arctic downwelling longwave radiation by 0.36–0.68 W m−2 with dynamically unconstrained model experiments. While the optics impact was greater within the dynamically constrained models than in dynamically unconstrained models, the dynamically constrained models are also more idealized than the unconstrained models. In summary, we found a signal from supercooled liquid water optics; the influence of these optics for longwave radiation is small compared to the modeled longwave radiation variability. More broadly, this work demonstrates a novel framework for assessing the climate importance of a physics change."

However, a recent study uncovered omnipresent spurious pressure waves around simulated ShCu clouds by three compressible community LES models, suggesting a potentially common issue. These waves degrade the simulation of pressure‐related variables and lead to unclosed turbulence flux budgets. An analytic theory is proposed to explain pressure wave generation by latent heating. Specifically, the solution to the linearized pressure equation with a diabatic source contains a singularity condition when the time rate of heating equals the time interval of a sound wave propagating through a cloud. The former is tied to the model time step in most bulk microphysics schemes that adopt saturation adjustment to parameterize cloud water condensation. The theory suggests that wave stabilization requires more frequent microphysics updates than is currently done, and is supported by LES results."

We present new paleomagnetic and geochronologic data from Permian volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the ALB. Characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions from Early (∼282 Ma), Middle (∼268 Ma), and Late Permian (∼255 Ma) rocks pass fold, reversals, and conglomerate tests, confirming their primary origin. These results yield the first reliable Permian paleopoles for the ALB. The data indicate minor movement during the Early–Middle Permian, followed by rapid northward drift and ∼53.8° counterclockwise rotation in the Middle‐Late Permian. Comparison with surrounding blocks suggests the ALB was tectonically linked to North China but independent of Tarim. A significant paleolatitudinal gap between North China–ALB and Siberian–South Mongolia blocks during the Late Carboniferous–Middle Permian implies a wide mid‐eastern PAO, which closed during the Late Permian.

The model reproduces the basic observed features of the event, including its recorded ground motions and its inferred slow rupture speed.

Our spatiotemporal water storage maps reveal ∼40 Gt of accumulation by Katrina and a coastally localized ∼15 Gt by Laura, with coastal regions retaining up to 80% of precipitation but draining several days faster than inland areas. Despite differing magnitudes, both storms exhibited similar precipitation‐to‐TWS conversion patterns, implying consistent scaling of hydrological responses across intensities.

 Earth’s bulk composition has elemental and isotopic characteristics that cannot be fully reconciled with a mixture of known primitive meteorite compositions1–3. One potential explanation for this is that the proto-Earth accreted materials with isotopic signatures distinct from those accreted after the Moon-forming giant impact. Here we report high-precision mass-independent potassium isotopic measurements from thermal ionization mass spectrometry of terrestrial rocks from various ancient and modern sources in the crust and mantle that we argue are consistent with this explanation. Specifically, we found that some mafic Archaean rocks derived from the Hadean–Eoarchaean mantle (including samples from Isua, Nuvvuagittuq and the Kaapvaal Craton) and certain modern ocean island basalts (from La Réunion Island and Kama’ehuakanaloa volcano, Hawaii) exhibit an average 40K deficit of 65 parts per million compared to all other terrestrial samples analysed. The deficit distinguishes these samples from the bulk silicate Earth and any known meteorite group and cannot result from magmatic processes. Therefore, we propose this 40K deficit represents primitive proto-Earth mantle domains that largely escaped mantle mixing after the giant impact and exist in the present-day deep mantle, contributing to some modern hotspot volcanism. Some mafic rocks have a ⁴⁰K/³⁹K ratio lower than all other terrestrial samples, according to isotopic composition analyses, suggesting parts of Earth’s mantle have retained their composition prior to the Moon-forming impact to the present day."

 China’s cropland soil has faced acidification since the latter half of the twentieth century; however, the temporal and spatial variations of this are poorly known. Here we analyse cropland soil acidification using 7,024 regional surveys and a machine learning model to project spatiotemporal variations in cropland topsoil pH across China from 1985 to 2040. Our results reveal a turning point in China’s agricultural soil chemistry: consistent acidification from the 1980s ceased as a whole around 2013 (with a cumulative pH decline of ~0.25 units during 1985–2013), correlating strongly with changes in nitrogen fertilizer application patterns consequent to agricultural policy reforms. Regional heterogeneity was observed, with paddy fields exhibiting pH recovery post-2013 while values in dryland soils remained largely static since 2000. These findings underscore the critical role of agricultural policy and nitrogen fertilizer management in shaping soil health dynamics. This Article offers guidance for sustainable agriculture in China while providing insights applicable to global farming practices.

Here, the authors assess fragmentomics analysis methods and their application to commercial targeted sequencing panels. 
 Fragmentomics based analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has recently emerged as a method to infer epigenetic and transcriptional data. Many of these reports analyze whole genome sequencing (WGS) which is not readily available clinically. Targeted exon panels are used for clinical cfDNA variant calling. In this report, we conduct an investigation of multiple published fragmentomics methods for WGS, but on cancer exon panels. We find that strategies utilizing normalized depth metrics, as well as all exons present on the panel, generally allow for better prediction of cancer phenotypes across a range of tumor fractions, though other metrics work particularly well in specific applications. Additionally, genes from commercial clinical targeted sequencing panels could be similarly employed for cancer phenotyping with a minimal decrease in performance despite their smaller genomic coverage. These results suggest that fragmentomics-based analysis of cfDNA can utilize targeted sequencing panels and does not necessarily require additional WGS. cfDNA fragmentomics is a potential clinically applicable method for identifying cancer.

Here, Boulay et al. present a machine-learning classifier that uses protein language models to assign functions to bacteriophage proteins more accurately than existing approaches. 
 Bacteriophages, viruses infecting bacteria, are estimated to outnumber their cellular hosts by 10-fold, acting as key players in all microbial ecosystems. Under evolutionary pressure by their host, they evolve rapidly and encode a large diversity of protein sequences. Consequently, the majority of functions carried by phage proteins remain elusive. Current tools to comprehensively identify phage protein functions from their sequence either lack sensitivity (those relying on homology for instance) or specificity (assigning a single coarse grain function to a protein). Here, we introduce Empathi, a protein-embedding-based classifier that assigns functions in a hierarchical manner. New categories were specifically elaborated for phage protein functions and organized such that molecular-level functions are respected in each category, making them well suited for training machine learning classifiers based on protein embeddings. Empathi outperforms homology-based methods on a dataset of cultured phage genomes, tripling the number of annotated homologous groups. On the EnVhogDB database, the most recent and extensive database of metagenomically-sourced phage proteins, Empathi doubled the annotated fraction of protein families from 16% to 33%. Having a more global view of the repertoire of functions a phage possesses will assuredly help to understand them and their interactions with bacteria better.

 Developing monovalent anion-selective membranes (MAPMs) faces challenges, including the trade-off between flux and selectivity, membrane stability, and cost-effective fabrication. Overcoming these requires advanced material design and scalable techniques. Here, we introduce in situ interfacial polymerization (ISIP) to prepare MAPMs. Base membranes are synthesized via superacid polymerization and modified with anion channels and -NH2 groups. During ISIP, trimesoyl chloride reacts with surface -NH2 groups, forming a partially crosslinked structure with -COOH groups to regulate ion transport via electrostatic interactions. This results in low membrane resistance (4.7 Ω cm2) and selective transport of weakly hydrated ions (Cl−, Br−, NO3−), while strongly hydrated ions (SO42−, F−) face higher barriers. MAPMs demonstrate high performance, achieving a limiting current density (>90 mA cm−2), Cl− flux (1.98 mol m−2 h−1 at 5 mA cm−2), and selectivity (244 for Cl−/SO42−), confirming effective hydration dynamics control and balanced performance.

 Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering has been studied for decades as a recognition technique due to its high sensitivity and discriminative power, particularly in biological applications. Inspired by nanopore sequencing technology, we developed a plasmonic device capable of operating in a flow-through configuration to detect individual molecules passing through plasmonic hotspots. This device is a permeable plasmonic film, through which single molecules are sequentially delivered via electrophoresis, while Raman spectra are recorded in real-time. A very effective light-matter coupling, combined with the ultrasmall size of plasmonic spots, enabled access to angstrom spatial and microsecond temporal scales compatible with polymer sequencing. We successfully slowed the translocation process and captured Raman spectra of the four nucleotides at a time resolution down to 20 μs under our experimental conditions. We achieved a discrimination accuracy of 89% at the single-molecule level.

 Maximizing steady-state turnover rates is a central goal in electrocatalysis research, but improving one reaction step often impedes others. Navigating these trade-offs requires methods that systematically reveal how a single parameter change affects all key steps of a reaction mechanism. Here, we use electrochemical mass spectrometry to determine the potential-dependent rates of each principal step in propane oxidation on Pt and directly relate them to the steady-state turnover rate. Our analysis reveals that low steady-state activity arises from a mismatch between the optimal potentials for adsorption, conversion, and *CO oxidation. By applying alternating potentials to individually optimize adsorption and oxidation, we overcome this limitation and achieve rates exceeding those under constant-potential operation.

 Forests with high ecological integrity are fundamental for biodiversity conservation and provide integral ecosystem services. These forests have natural or near-natural ecosystem structure, function, and composition. Anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, overexploitation of natural resources, and land use changes are leading to the degradation or loss of high-integrity forests. As a result, assessing forest integrity over large areas is increasingly important for a range of conservation initiatives. In this study, we used remote sensing-derived forest structural and functioning metrics alongside a high-quality reference state to calculate ecological dissimilarity as a proxy for ecological integrity. We examined stand-level integrity and focused on forest structural attributes such as canopy height, cover, complexity, and biomass, as well as the Dynamic Habitat Indices, which summarize annual energy availability relevant for biodiversity. We further refined our reference states by using coarsened exact matching to ensure our comparisons were drawn from suitable protected analogs. We applied these methods to Vancouver Island, Canada, where we assessed the distance, in structural and functional space, to matched high-integrity forests found in the island’s oldest and largest protected area. We also assessed how individual and cumulative anthropogenic pressure affect the ecological integrity of forests on the island. We found that mean forest structural dissimilarity increased from 0.79 to 1.61 under high levels of anthropogenic pressure (ANOVA; p < 0.001), while functional dissimilarity was not impacted by any anthropogenic pressure (ANOVA; p > 0.05). This indicates that anthropogenic pressures were observed to directly influence forest canopy characteristics, and less so energy availability. For individual pressures, we found that built environments, harvesting, and population density influenced structural dissimilarity (ANOVA; p < 0.05), while roads did not influence structural dissimilarity (ANOVA; p > 0.05). These methods for identifying high-integrity forests can be used to identify areas to be prioritized for protection or restoration, which in turn progresses towards the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework’s goal of 30 % of all ecosystems protected, while focusing on high-integrity ecosystems."

 Coastal wetland patterns in China have undergone dramatic changes in recent years due to the invasion and subsequent management of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). The ecological benefits of clearing S. alterniflora still lack sufficient exploration. SAR data can provide complete time series observations covering the full phenological cycle of salt marsh vegetation, thereby offering a valuable data source for accurate wetland monitoring. However, the similarity in backscatter values among salt marsh vegetation types poses a challenge for wetland classification. To address this issue, we propose a layer-wise classification framework based on local optimal spatiotemporal features fusion (LOSF_LC). We selected the Yellow River Delta wetland (YRD) and Jiuduansha wetland (JDS), which differ in geographical location and have been severely invaded by S. alterniflora, as the study areas. Using 443 Sentinel-1 images, we generated 10-m resolution wetland maps from 2017 to 2024. Classification experiments using LightGBM, XGBoost, and RF demonstrated that LOSF_LC improved OA by 1.64%–3.44% compared to RFE. Under the optimal scheme, the OA reached 96.07% and 96.30% for the YRD and JDS, respectively. In addition, long-term mapping results revealed that the removal of S. alterniflora has achieved significant restoration outcomes, with native salt marsh species regaining habitat and Phragmites australis becoming the dominant type. Nonetheless, the reduction in salt marsh vegetation and land areas highlights emerging risks for wetland ecosystems. The proposed method provides a new technical reference for accurate SAR-based wetland mapping."

 The near-surface thermal stability (Ts-Ta), defined as the difference between land surface temperature (Ts) and air temperature (Ta), is a critical regulator of surface–atmosphere energy exchange. Conditions are thermally unstable when Ts-Ta ≥ 0, promoting turbulent mixing, and stable when Ts-Ta < 0, suppressing turbulence. Although Arctic amplification is expected to reduce albedo and enhance unstable conditions, analysis of high-quality hourly observations (2002–2024) from the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) reveals a counterintuitive large-scale shift toward more frequent stable conditions across southern and western Alaska, even as the North Slope experiences opposing trends. This net stabilization is driven primarily by a widespread decline in solar radiation, which has outweighed the warming effect of albedo reduction. Partial correlation analysis reveals that the influence of albedo is not direct but mediated through its coupling with other surface energy balance components, whereas solar radiation exerts a strong and direct driving role. Annually, Alaska's Ts-Ta averages −0.58 ± 2.40 °C, ranging from 1.13 ± 2.31 °C in summer to −2.04 ± 1.29 °C in winter. Unstable conditions occur 30.2 ± 26.9 % of the time on average—varying seasonally from 4.0 ± 9.5 % in winter to 61.6 ± 13.6 % in summer. Spatially, the frequency of unstable conditions declined significantly in southern regions (e.g., Northeast Gulf: −5.5 % per decade, p < 0.05), contrasting with an increase on the North Slope (+3.2 % per decade, p < 0.1), underscoring a stark divide between interior and coastal regions in response to Arctic warming. This enhanced stabilization can suppress vertical mixing and alter surface energy exchange, with profound implications for regional climate feedbacks. Our findings resolve the apparent paradox of stabilization under Arctic amplification and emphasize the necessity of accurately representing competing forcings and their complex interaction in climate models."

 Accurate assessment of drought propagation time (PT) and probability (PB) from meteorological to soil moisture drought is crucial for mitigating natural and socio-economic losses. However, inconsistencies among datasets and drought indices (DIs) hinder reliable early warning. Here, we evaluated multiple meteorological and soil moisture datasets against in-situ observations to establish a benchmark. Four DIs—SPI, SPEI, PA, and MI—were employed to estimate PT and PB using maximum correlation coefficient and Copula function. We further quantified uncertainties arising from datasets and DIs and proposed a framework for selecting optimal DIs under varying dataset scenarios. The results show that: (i) Benchmark-based PT ranges from 3.10 months (for SPEI) to 5.37 months (for MI) and PB increases with the regional humidity. (ii) ERA5-Land exhibits the highest spatial consistency, matching benchmark PT in 48.47 % (MI) to 61.62 % (SPEI) of pixels, with no significant monthly bias. In contrast, MERRA-2 yields prolonged PT in over 80 % of pixels and shows substantial overestimations (4–10 months) in humid regions. For PB, more than 80 % of pixels from ERA5-Land, GLDAS-2, and MERRA-2 show significant overestimations. (iii) On average, 67.63 % of pixels display greater PT uncertainty from dataset differences than from DI differences, and 68.77 % show higher PB uncertainty from datasets.

Nevertheless, ECMWF demonstrates a well-balanced performance in precipitation forecasting. •Operational Advantages: CMA-SH9 achieves highest accuracy in spring heavy rainfall positioning. CMA-MESO best captures convective initiation for cold air-involved SWV/frontal systems despite higher false alarms. •Practical Implications: Findings directly inform forecast model selection for different weather regimes in this high-risk region, with mesoscale models proving critical for nowcasting extreme events. 
 This study systematically evaluates the performance of five operational numerical models (CMA-GFS, ECMWF, NCEP-GFS, CMA-MESO, and CMA-SH9) during the 2021 flood season in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Combining traditional verification metrics ( Threat Score score, false alarm ratio, missing ratio) with subjective synoptic evaluation by forecasters, we assess model performance across seasons, months, and weather types, with particular focus on 22 severe rainfall events. Key findings include: 1) ECMWF demonstrates superior performance for light-to-moderate precipitation, while CMA-MESO and CMA-SH9 show better skill in heavy rainfall prediction, with assimilation systems significantly improving short-term (≤12 h) forecasts; 2) compared to its global counterpart, CMA-MESO demonstrates notably reduced surface temperature errors through its upgraded land data assimilation system.; 3) CMA-SH9 and CMA-MESO outperform ECMWF in positioning spring heavy rainfall events and capturing convective-scale features, though CMA-MESO's higher false alarm rates reduce its objective scores; 4) for frontal systems and southwest vortex events with cold air involvement, CMA-MESO provides the most accurate convective initiation locations and echo patterns."

 On July 18, 2023, an altitude-triggered lightning flash, consisting of thirteen leader/return stroke (LR) sequences, was successfully induced. X-ray emissions were detected during seven of these LRs. This study comprehensively analyzes the differences in optical radiation, VHF radiation, and interstroke intervals between LRs that were accompanied by detectable X-rays and those that were not, with the aim of exploring the underlying mechanism of X-ray production in lightning. For the first time, experimental observations confirm that leader branches may impede the emission of X-rays, likely due to a reduction in the potential difference at the leader tip. Additionally, a significant temporal synchronization and notable intensity correlation were observed between X-ray emissions and VHF radiation, both of which exhibit a strong positive correlation with the intensity of the electric field at the leader tip. In the studied lightning event, detectable X-ray emissions occurred only when the interstroke interval exceeded approximately 20 ms. More importantly, our results demonstrate that longer interstroke intervals promote the generation of higher-energy X-ray emissions. Both the total X-ray energy and the mean photon energy showed a positive correlation with the interstroke interval, with Spearman correlation coefficients of ρ = 0.685 and ρ = 0.595, respectively. This enhanced X-ray emission is attributed to the stronger electric field developed at the leader tip during longer interstroke intervals. Collectively, these findings provide strong support for the leader tip high-field runaway electron mechanism as the origin of lightning X-rays."

 Understanding the chemical composition and sources of organic aerosol (OA) in the Arctic is critical given its importance for particle climate-relevant properties. This study presents a year-long analysis (May 2019–June 2020) of PM1 filter samples collected in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. A multi-instrumental approach is employed to characterize the comprehensive chemical composition of PM1, with a specific focus on its water-soluble organic fraction depicted combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-NMR) and high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-AMS), which provide complementary insights into the nature and structure of the organic aerosol classes characterizing the bulk OA mixture. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment identifies consistent OA sources from the H-NMR and AMS datasets, showing a pronounced seasonality in their relative contributions to total OA mass. Winter–spring aerosol is dominated by long-range transport of Eurasian anthropogenic pollution (up to 70 %), while summer is characterized by biogenic aerosols from marine sources (up to 44 %), including sulfur compounds, amines, and fatty acids. Occasional summertime high OA loadings are associated with wildfire aerosols enriched in levoglucosan and humic-like substances (HULIS; averagely 27 %–28 %). Eventually, about 28 %–40 % of the OA mass is attributed to an unresolved mixture of extremely oxidized compounds of difficult specific source attribution.

 The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is a valuable tool for monitoring global soil freeze–thaw dynamics, particularly in high-latitude environments where these processes are important for understanding ecosystem and carbon cycle dynamics. This paper introduces the updated SMOS Level-3 (L3) Soil Freeze–Thaw (FT) product and details its threshold-based classification algorithm, which utilizes L-band passive microwave measurements to detect soil freeze–thaw transitions; this is possible due to the difference in dielectric properties between frozen and thawed soils at this frequency band. The algorithm applies gridded brightness temperature data from the SMOS satellite, augmented with ancillary datasets of air temperature and snow cover, to generate global estimates of the freeze–thaw state. A recent update to the algorithm includes improved noise reduction through temporal filtering. Validation results against in situ soil moisture and temperature measurements and comparisons to ERA5-Land reanalysis data demonstrate the ability of the product to detect the day of first freezing, an important metric for better understanding greenhouse gas fluxes and ecosystem dynamics, with improved accuracy. However, limitations remain, particularly in regions affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) and during spring melt periods, when wet snow hinders soil thaw detection.

This study explored the coupling of ensemble data assimilation with an AI weather prediction model, ClimaX, which succeeded in employing weather forecasts stably by applying techniques conventionally used for physical models. 
 Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited, partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models and marked the first successful implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model, ClimaX, demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models, such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation."

Using object-oriented programming, GEOSPACE modularizes SPAC processes, focusing on infiltration, evapotranspiration, and root water uptake. The 1D deployment integrates plant transpiration, soil evaporation, and root growth, providing a flexible and validated framework for ecohydrological modeling and applications. 
 The soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) system is a complex and interconnected network of physical phenomena, encompassing heat transfer, evapotranspiration, precipitation, water absorption, soil water flow, substance transport, and gas exchange. These processes govern the exchange of energy and water within the SPAC system. Modeling the SPAC system involves multiple disciplines, including hydrology, ecology, and computational science, making a physically based approach inherently interdisciplinary for capturing the complexity of the system.The present study introduces the Soil–Plant–Atmosphere Continuum Estimator in GEOframe (GEOSPACE), a new ecohydrological modeling framework, in particular its one-dimensional development, GEOSPACE-1D. GEOSPACE leverages and extends selected components from the GEOframe modeling system, while also integrating newly developed modules, to comprehensively simulate water transport dynamics in the SPAC system. The framework of GEOSPACE-1D is a tool designed to facilitate robust, reliable, and transparent simulations of SPAC interactions. It embraces the principles of open-source software and modular design, aiming to promote open, reusable, and reproducible research practices. Instead of relying on a single monolithic model, we propose a component-based modeling approach,  where each component addresses a specific aspect of the system. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is adopted as the foundational framework for this approach, providing flexibility and adaptability to accommodate the ever-changing nature of the SPAC system. This compartmentalization serves two critical purposes: validating individual processes against analytical solutions and facilitating the integration of novel processes into the system.The paper emphasizes the significance of modeling the coupling between infiltration and evapotranspiration through two “virtual” simulations based on real-world input data from the “Spike II” experiment to explore the interplay between plant transpiration, soil evaporation, and soil moisture dynamics, highlighting the need to account for these interactions in SPAC models. Overall, GEOSPACE-1D represents an approach to SPAC modeling providing a flexible and extensible framework for studying complex interactions within the Earth's critical zone. It is worth recalling that the fundamental premise of GEOSPACE-1D is not to create a single soil–plant–atmosphere model but to establish a system that allows the creation of a series of soil–plant–atmosphere models adapted to the specific needs of the user's case study."

 Ozone (O3) pollution poses an escalating threat to rice production and food security in China, with concentrations projected to rise under future climate scenarios. Accurately quantifying O3 impacts on rice is thus crucial for informed agricultural planning. This study is the first to utilise free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) observations specific to rice for calibrating a crop model (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator with crops, JULES-crop) and assessing the impacts of O3. FACE experiments, which involve growing crops under natural field conditions while exposing them to elevated O3 levels, provide an ideal approach for studying the effects of O3 on crops. Utilising data from the only O3-FACE facility dedicated to rice, we calibrated physiological and O3-response parameters in JULES-crop and evaluated the model against additional independent FACE observations. The calibration establishes this as the first crop model refined with ideal open-air field observations, significantly enhancing its capability to simulate rice growth processes and O3-induced yield losses and surpassing the performance of simulations based on the default parameters in JULES-crop. With this newly calibrated model, JULES-crop is now equipped to assess the impacts of O3 on agriculture, offering a valuable tool to inform mitigation strategies."

 The study of microplastic transport and fate in estuaries poses significant challenges due to the complex, dynamic nature of these ecosystems and the diverse characteristics of microplastics. Process-based numerical models have become indispensable for studying microplastics, complementing observational data by offering insights into transport processes and dispersion trends that are difficult to capture through in situ measurements alone. Effective model implementations require an accurate representation of the hydrodynamic conditions, relevant transport processes, particle properties, and their dynamic behaviour and interactions with other environmental components. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the different process-based modelling approaches used to study the transport of microplastics in estuaries, including Eulerian analytical 2DV models, Eulerian numerical models, Lagrangian numerical models, and population balance equation models.  We detail each approach and analyse previous applications, examining key aspects such as parameterizations, input data, model set-ups, and validation methods.

Here, we document modifications to reduce discrepancies between the implementations, calculate the disagreements between the methods, and quantify Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAPv2.2022) reconstruction errors with PyESPER. While the PyESPER routine based on neural networks (PyESPER_NN) faithfully reproduces the corresponding MATLAB routine estimates of properties that do not require anthropogenic carbon change information, PyESPER_LIR and – to a lesser extent – PyESPER_NN estimates for total pH and dissolved inorganic carbon do not exactly reproduce the MATLAB routine estimates due to differences in interpolation and extrapolation methods between the programming languages. While the MATLAB and Python LIR-based estimates are not identical, we show that they are similarly skilled at reproducing the GLODAPv2.2022 data product and are thus comparable.

Terai;Julio Bacmeister;Peter Bogenschutz;George N. Kiladis,Remote Influence of Andean Convection on Amazonian Rainfall and Its Mechanisms,"Models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 produce too much precipitation over the Andes but too little over the Amazon or the Wet Andes‐Dry Amazon (WADA) bias pattern. Unlike the conventional view that convection parameterization and land model deficiencies can contribute to Amazonian rainfall biases, we approach this long‐standing biased model behavior through the lens of Andean convection. Using Community Earth System Model v1.1 and focusing on the wet season, our mechanism‐denial experiments demonstrate that Andean convection notably reduces precipitation over the Amazon during austral summer. The Andean forced Amazonian response operates on weather timescale. The reduction of Amazonian rainfall is detectable within a few hours after initial Andean forcing. The precipitation response is primarily driven by variations in the moisture budget and is moderated by changes in convective available potential energy over the Amazon. Changes in the total advection of moisture over the Amazon are dominated by the vertical advection term and can be attributed to discrepancies in the dynamic omega field. In the experiments, the Andean east flank region is scrutinized where the vertical velocity and moisture fields play an intermediary role for the Andean driven WADA connection. The Andean forcing induces descending anomalies on the Andean east flank. The disturbances of wind and geopotential fields over the Andean east flank propagate eastward via Kelvin waves. Over the Amazon, descending anomalies and advective drying lead to reduction of mid‐to‐high level cloud, increase of shortwave cloud forcing and surface net radiation, and enhancement of themodynamic stability and rainfall reduction."

Muñoz,Subseasonal Prediction of the Rainy Season and the Midsummer Drought in Mesoamerica,"The seasonal cycle of rainfall in Mesoamerica exhibits complex features such as the Midsummer Drought (MSD) that greatly influence local agriculture and motivate diagnosing the potential of its subseasonal prediction. This study evaluates state‐of‐the‐art S2S forecast systems for their representation of the rainy season through their climatology and forecast skill. These models reasonably capture the main features of the rainy season, such as onset and retreat dates, as well as the MSD characteristics. However, they overestimate the MSD duration by 5–10 days. Forecast skill for weekly precipitation is low beyond week 2, whereas rainy season onset and retreat remain predictable past 25 days, especially for the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts and United Kingdom Met Office forecasts. MSD onset forecasts are more skillful than MSD end forecasts, suggesting different modulating processes for each date. Because of the significant influence of the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the variability of MSD, we evaluate its effects on predictability and forecast skill. La Niña increases precipitation and enhances predictability and prediction skill of precipitation from June to September, whereas El Niño reduces mean rainfall and forecasts are more skillful during the MSD‐periods. These results highlight ENSO's role in subseasonal forecasting and suggest that ENSO phase information could help improve decision‐making in planning sowing dates and regional water resource management."

Mayta,MJO Energy Budget Residuals in CMIP6: A Focus on Vertical Resolution,"This study investigates the influence of model‐output vertical resolution on the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO)‐related moist static energy (MSE) budget. Using reanalysis data at varying vertical resolutions (raw levels, six standard layers of CMIP6 daily output, fine upper‐tropospheric, and fine lower‐tropospheric), we demonstrate that limiting vertical levels to six leads to substantial budget residuals, mirroring those in CMIP6 daily output. Notably, enhanced upper‐tropospheric resolution captures moist processes more accurately compared with high resolution in the lower troposphere. These budget residuals, which amplify with rainfall anomalies, stem from overestimated vertical MSE advection driven by an unrealistically strong vertical gradient in mean‐state dry static energy (DSE) in the upper troposphere. Sensitivity tests further indicate that including an additional 150 hPa level in the six standard layers substantially reduces the background DSE bias and budget residuals. In CMIP6 models, unrealistic mean DSE gradients also appear in daily output rather than in finer‐resolution monthly output, leading to overestimated vertical MSE advection. These findings suggest that limited vertical resolution in CMIP6 daily output partially contributes to the observed MSE budget residuals."

To disentangle these multiple influences, we used a preexisting process‐based ecophysiological model (MAIDENiso) to simulate tree growth changes during 1956–2010 in arid and semi‐arid regions of China. Results revealed that simulated tree growth was more dependent on climate trends than on atmospheric CO2 concentration. Mechanistic analysis showed that the regulation of stomatal conductance under water stress positively affected tree growth in the arid region, but had an opposite pattern in the semi‐arid region. Intrinsic water‐use efficiency (iWUE, measured from tree‐ring δ13C) has increased by 29% and 44% since 1900 CE in the arid and semi‐arid regions, respectively, but did not stimulate radial tree growth. This suggests that there will possibly be a continued increase (decrease) of radial forest growth in arid (semi‐arid) areas of northern China if the current climate trends remain in the next decades."

Zhao,Decadal Change in Cold Wave Intensity Over China: Cold Air Trajectories and Physical Processes,"Severe cold wave (CW) events have continued to be witnessed in recent decades, raising concerns about their changing characteristic under climate change. This study investigated decadal variability of CWs over China, focusing on intensity changes and thermodynamic processes. While CW frequency declined under global warming, its intensity has significantly increased during 2001–2021 compared with 1977–2000, with a marked cooling center over Inner Mongolia. Using Lagrangian trajectory analysis and clustering, we identified four major cold air pathways, with the common Northeast China–Inner Mongolia cluster contributing most to recent intensification. Although air masses were initially warmer in the later period, they underwent greater net cooling along this cluster. Compared with 1977–2000, median air parcel in 2001–2021 was ∼2.0 K colder during days −5 to −2, due to stronger diabatic (∼1.0 K) and adiabatic (∼0.9 K) cooling. This was compounded by ∼1.9 K weaker warming from days −2 to 0, driven by reduced adiabatic warming (∼0.7 K) and continued diabatic cooling (∼0.7 K). Adiabatic and diabatic processes contributed comparably (∼50%) to the enhanced cooling. Intensified CWs were associated with a stronger and more persistent Ural ridge, which extended into the Arctic, promoting deeper descent and stronger ascent motions. The deeper descent brought air masses downward to higher pressure levels, enabling more diabatic cooling and limiting later adiabatic warming while enhanced ascent increased adiabatic cooling. Additionally, a poleward shift in air trajectories further amplified diabatic cooling efficiency. The findings highlight northward‐shifted cold air pathways and thermodynamic processes that enhance CWs under a warming climate."

Canada is yet to implement a scale to characterize the severity of ARs and there has been little research into the specific features of ARs that cause extreme flooding, especially for regions outside of the US. Using ERA5 data and the Global AR Database (Guan, 2022, https://doi.org/10.25346/S6/YO15ON), we studied the effects of a range of AR characteristics on extreme precipitation and streamflow in the Alouette watershed, which includes an important reservoir. For this watershed, the majority of extreme‐event producing ARs (X‐ARs) approach the BC coast from compass directions of between 210 and 220°. ARs that approach from a more westerly direction can cause extreme events with an IVT as low as 400 kg m−1 s−1 compared to over 800 kg m−1 s−1 for ARs from a more southerly direction. IVT, the presence of rain‐on‐snow events, and high preceding soil moisture conditions strongly correlate with the production of extreme streamflow in the Alouette watershed. For the Alouette watershed, we recommend that the AR scale used in the US (Ralph, Rutz, et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1175/bams‐d‐18‐0023.1), be enhanced to better represent the severity of ARs in this watershed by including the surface air temperature, angle of approach, and antecedent conditions in the hazard calculation. A similar analysis should be applied to other high‐impact watersheds where accurate prediction of AR impacts is critical."

Hence, there is an urgent need to test these adaptation strategies. This study quantifies the performance of adaptation strategies for mitigating extreme heat in China under the future urbanization and climate conditions using a numerical model. Results are validated using observation data from 839 national meteorological stations in China. Simulation results show that implementing all three adaptation measures will decrease the heat exposure rate by 9.4% by enhancing ground reflection and lowering urban temperature. The contribution of enhancing the albedo of the building walls to reducing exposure is 1.5 times that of using roof planting. These adaptation strategies can reduce urban heat storage, but they may exacerbate urban water vapor accumulation. Most risks are concentrated on the southeast side of the Heihe‐Tengchong Line. The urban geographical locations and population will influence the cooling effect of adaptation strategies. The cool walls have greater cooling effects in southern cities, whereas green roofs are more effective in northern regions. Applying cool walls strategy in densely populated areas of urban buildings can achieve the best cooling effects. When deploying adaptation strategies, not only the cooling capacity but also the climate and development conditions of different cities are necessary to be considered."

 Non-aromatic heterocycles and carbocycles form the skeleton of countless bioactive and functional molecules1,2. Of note, four-membered saturated cyclic molecules such as azetidines, thietanes and cyclobutanes have garnered increasing attention in medicinal chemistry3-7. These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species."

Despite an ideal bandgap supporting a theoretical PCE over 33%, TPSCs still lag in performance and stability, partly due to suboptimal hole transport layers and poor buried interface that hinder hole extraction. Here, we report (E)-(2-(4',5'-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-[2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid at the buried interface, using a molecular film to optimize hole transport layers in inverted TPSCs. This molecular film forms a homogeneous interfacial layer with well-matched energy level alignment, significantly enhancing hole extraction. Moreover, this approach creates a superwetting underlayer that guides the growth of uniform, high-quality Sn-based perovskite films with reduced defect density and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resulting inverted small-area TPSCs demonstrate a record PCE of 17.89% (certified 17.71% under reverse scanning mode). Furthermore, the encapsulated device maintains over 95% of the initial PCE after 1344 h of ambient shelf storage and over 94% after 1550 h of continuous operation under 1-sun illumination.

Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories. Emotional experience evokes signalling in astrocytes, which form an ensemble that is reinforced by secondary astrocytic state changes resulting from repeated experience, leading to memory stabilization."

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) viruses globally impact wild and domestic birds, and have caused severe infections in mammals, including humans, underscoring their pandemic potential1–5. The antigenic evolution of the A(H5) haemagglutinin (HA) poses challenges for pandemic preparedness and vaccine design6. Here the global antigenic evolution of the A(H5) HA was captured in a high-resolution antigenic map. The map was used to design immunogenic and antigenically central vaccine HA antigens, eliciting antibody responses that broadly cover the A(H5) antigenic space. In ferrets, a central antigen protected as well as homologous vaccines against heterologous infection with two antigenically distinct viruses. This work showcases the rational design of subtype-wide influenza A(H5) pre-pandemic vaccines and demonstrates the value of antigenic maps for the evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responses through antibody profiles.

 Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut1–3. However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations4,5. We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.

 Predicting complex disease risks on the basis of individual genomic profiles is an advancing field in human genetics1,2. However, most genetic studies have focused on populations of European ancestry, creating a global imbalance in precision medicine and underscoring the need for genomic research in non-European groups3,4. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative recruited more than half a million Taiwanese residents, providing a large dataset of genetic profiles and electronic medical record data for people with Han Chinese ancestry. Using extensive phenotypic data, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses across the medical phenome with individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations. These analyses identified population-specific genetic risk variants and new findings for various complex traits. We developed polygenic risk scores, demonstrating strong predictive performance for conditions such as cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers and infectious diseases. We observed consistent findings in an independent dataset, Taiwan Biobank, and among people of East Asian ancestry in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 10.3% of the overall health variation in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort.

 Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail1. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water2,3, in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered4,5. The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes6–9. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM)10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m−1, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores. Scanning dielectric microscopy of nanocapillaries filled with water reveals that interfacial and strongly confined water exhibits a large in-plane dielectric constant and an in-plane conductivity approaching superionic values. "

 Quantifying physical mechanisms driving sea-level change—including global mean sea level (GMSL) and regional-to-local components (that is, sea-level budget)—is essential for reliable future projections and effective coastal management1,2. Although previous research has attempted to resolve China’s sea-level budget from the 1950s3,4, these studies capture short timescales and lack the long-term context necessary to fully assess modern sea-level rise in southeastern China5—one of the world’s most densely populated regions with immense socioeconomic importance6. Here we show that GMSL followed three distinct stages from 11,700 years before present (BP) to the modern day: (1) rapid early Holocene rise driven by the deglacial melt of land ice; (2) 4,000 years of stability from around 4200 BP to the mid-nineteenth century when regional processes dominated sea-level change; and (3) accelerating rise from the mid-nineteenth century. Our results arise from spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data to produce site-specific sea-level budget estimates with uncertainty quantification. It is extremely likely (P ≥ 0.95) that the GMSL rise rate since 1900 (1.51 ± 0.16 mm year−1, 1σ) has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia. Moreover, our analysis indicates that at least 94% of rapid modern urban subsidence is attributable to anthropogenic activities, with localized subsidence rates often exceeding GMSL rise. Such concurrent acceleration of global sea-level rise and rapid localized subsidence has not been observed in our Holocene geological record. Spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data suggest that the modern global mean sea-level rise rate since 1900 has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia, breaking the long-term stability observed in southeastern China."

 Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces3,4. Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering5–11.

 Compartmentalization of eukaryotic genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin is of critical biological significance1–3. Previous studies have suggested a self-templating pathway involving the reading and writing of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation by SUV39H as the core mechanism for heterochromatin reassembly during cell division1,3. In fission yeast, the mammalian SUV39H homologue Clr4 forms a complex containing ubiquitin ligase Cul4, which catalyses H3K14 mono-ubiquitination (H3K14ub) to promote heterochromatin formation. However, whether heterochromatin reassembly in dividing mammalian cells involves a similar pathway is unknown. Here we identified G2E3 as an H3K14ub-specific, pericentromeric heterochromatin-localized E3 ligase. G2E3-catalysed H3K14ub potentiates histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by SUV39H and is specifically required for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9me3 in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Mechanistically, we found that G2E3 is highly expressed in G2/M phase and associates with mitotic chromosomes in an RNA-dependent manner to catalyse H3K14ub, which is essential for the subsequent sequential recruitment of SUV39H and HP1. The SUV39H chromodomain is a reader of dual H3K9me3 and H3K14ub modifications and SUV39H associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin primarily through its H3K14ub-binding activity. Notably, loss of G2E3 severely impairs pericentromeric heterochromatin organization and results in the aberrant accumulation of SUV39H and H3K9me3 in numerous euchromatin regions and widespread transcriptional repression. Thus, our findings revealed the H3K14ub-dependent SUV39H compartmentalization as a unified mechanism of pericentromeric heterochromatin formation, which is essential for proper euchromatin compartmentalization and transcriptional regulation. G2E3-catalysed H3K14 mono-ubiquitination is crucial for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9 trimethylation in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which is essential for proper euchromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in mammalian cells."

 Spectroscopy is a pivotal tool for determining the physical structures and chemical compositions of materials and environments, and it is commonly used across diverse scientific fields1–16. Conventionally, spectroscopic techniques rely on narrow slits or gratings, which impose a trade-off between spectral resolution and optical transmittance17–22, thus precluding measurements with simultaneous high sensitivity and high efficiency. Here we introduce RAFAEL, a sub-ångström ultra-high-transmittance snapshot spectroscopic technique, which targets this trade-off with integrated and reconfigurable photonics based on lithium niobate. Its design comprises bulk lithium niobate as an interference mask with a pixel-wise electrically tunable spectral response and delivers picometre-scale modulation with a high optical transmittance. Our approach achieves 88-Hz snapshot spectroscopy with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.5 Å at 400–1,000 nm (R = 12,000), spatial resolution of 2,048 × 2,048 and 73.2% total optical transmittance. Compared with state-of-the-art spectroscopic imagers23–34, RAFAEL offers double the total transmittance and a nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in spectral resolving power, as verified by extensive experiments. In particular, RAFAEL captured sub-ångström spectra, including all atomic absorption peaks, of up to 5,600 stars in a single snapshot, indicating ×100–10,000 improvement in observational efficiency compared with world-class astronomical spectrometers17–21.

 Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3–7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8–10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes. Our findings suggest the potential for a similar response to climate change by woody aboveground biomass in moist tropical forests globally, which could culminate in a long-term switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

 During the Late Triassic epoch (237–201 million years ago), the terrestrial ecosystems of Pangaea underwent drastic changes1,2 that led to the rise and diversification of mammaliaforms3, crocodylomorphs4 and dinosaurs5.

Littman,Niche-specific dermal macrophage loss promotes skin capillary ageing,"Capillary-associated macrophages are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. 
 All mammalian organs depend on resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair and facilitate tissue-specific functions1–3. Functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through a combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment4,5. Declines in macrophage abundance and function have been linked to age-associated pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegeneration6–8. However, the mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within ageing tissues remain largely unclear. Here we show that capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behaviour in vivo, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in live mice to non-invasively image the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined vascular niche that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost at a rate exceeding capillary loss, resulting in macrophage-deficient vascular niches in both mice and humans. CAM phagocytic activity was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-deficient niches selectively vulnerable under homeostatic and injury conditions. Our study demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is less precisely regulated than previously suggested9–11. Specifically, neighbouring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize to compensate for macrophage loss without injury or increased growth factors, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). These limitations in macrophage renewal may represent early and targetable contributors to tissue ageing. Capillary-associated macrophages are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice."

Leakey,New fossils reveal the hand of <i>Paranthropus boisei</i>,"Analyses of newly discovered hand and foot bones of a Paranthropus boisei specimen provide insight into possible tool use and other palaeobiology characteristics among Plio-Pleistocene hominin species. 
 When Mary Leakey discovered the OH 5 cranium of Paranthropus boisei alongside Oldowan stone artefacts, it was declared “the oldest yet discovered maker of stone tools”1. Whether Paranthropus made and used tools has been debated ever since2–4, largely because there are no known hand bones that can be definitively attributed to this genus. Here we report fossil hand and foot bones unambiguously associated with craniodental material of P. boisei. KNM-ER 101000 demonstrates that P. boisei shared key manipulative and bipedal adaptations with the genus Homo. Moreover, the hand morphology of KNM-ER 101000 converges on that of gorillas in ways that are consistent with manual food processing and would have facilitated powerful grasping, such as that used in climbing. These fossils suggest that P. boisei was capable of tool making and use in some capacity while also supporting the proposed dichotomy of distinct dietary adaptations between Paranthropus and Homo. In addition to offering insights into the poorly known postcranial functional anatomy of Paranthropus, this discovery illuminates broader patterns of hominin hand evolution and tool use. Analyses of newly discovered hand and foot bones of a Paranthropus boisei specimen provide insight into possible tool use and other palaeobiology characteristics among Plio-Pleistocene hominin species."

 Unravelling the genetic basis of the remarkable phenotypic diversity observed in natural populations remains a central challenge in biology1–4. Despite major advances5–19, no species has yet been characterized with a truly comprehensive atlas of genetic variation. Here we present an extensive genomic and phenotypic resource for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on near telomere-to-telomere assemblies of 1,086 natural isolates. Leveraging these high-contiguity assemblies, we generated a highly complete species-wide structural variant atlas, gene-based pangenome and graph pangenome. By incorporating the full spectrum of genetic variation captured across the species, we conducted genome-wide association studies across 8,391 molecular and organismal traits19–22. The inclusion of structural variants and small insertion–deletion mutations improved heritability estimates by an average of 14.3% compared with analyses based only on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Structural variants were more frequently associated with traits and exhibited greater pleiotropy than other variant types. Notably, the genetic architecture of molecular and organismal traits differed markedly. Together, this work provides a unique dataset that illuminates how diverse forms of genetic variation shape phenotypic diversity and lays the groundwork for integrative, genome-scale studies in other eukaryotic systems.

 The site-specific encoding of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides a powerful tool for expanding the functional repertoire of proteins1–4. Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by the low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. Here we reveal poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter5 to actively import easily synthesizable isopeptide-linked tripeptides that are processed into ncAAs within the cell. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal6 and crosslinker7 moieties, post-translational modifications8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that engineering of uptake systems is a powerful strategy for programmable import of chemically diverse building blocks.

Rabinowitz,Spatial metabolic gradients in the liver and small intestine,"Mapping of spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine identifies fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism. 
 The properties of mammalian cells depend on their location within organs. Gene expression in the liver varies between periportal and pericentral hepatocytes1–3, and in the intestine from crypts to villus tips4,5. A key element of tissue spatial organization is probably metabolic, but direct assessments of spatial metabolism remain limited. Here we map spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine. We develop an integrated experimental–computational workflow using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), isotope tracing and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (>90%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in the liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their isotope labelling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also localized periportally, consistent with a high periportal energy demand. In the intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, aligning with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than in the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Thus, we both provide foundational knowledge regarding intestine and liver metabolic organization and identify fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism. Mapping of spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine identifies fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism."

 Most stony corals are obligate symbionts that are dependent on nutrients provided by the photosynthetic activity of dinoflagellates residing within specialized cells1. Disruption of this symbiotic consortium leads to coral bleaching and, ultimately, mortality2. However, a few coral species exhibit facultative symbiosis, allowing them to survive extended periods of bleaching3,4. Despite this resilience, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the genomic and cellular basis of facultative symbiosis in Oculina patagonica, a thermotolerant Mediterranean coral5,6. We sequenced and annotated a chromosome-scale genome of O. patagonica and built cell atlases for this species and two obligate symbiotic corals. Comparative genomic analysis revealed karyotypic and syntenic conservation across all scleractinians, with species-specific gene expansions primarily driven by tandem duplications. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of symbiotic and naturally aposymbiotic wild specimens identified an increase in phagocytic immune cells and a metabolic shift in gastrodermal gene expression from growth-related functions to quiescent, epithelial-like states. Cross-species comparison of host cells uncovered Oculina-specific metabolic and signalling adaptations indicative of an opportunistic, dual-feeding strategy that decouples survival from symbiotic state.

Additionally, RPN2 recognizes an alternating K11-K48-linkage through a conserved motif similar to the K48-specific T1 binding site of RPN1.

 Cancer immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DC) pulsed ex vivo with tumour antigens is considered safe, but its clinical efficacy is generally modest. Here we engineer DC progenitors (DCP), which can replenish conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1) in mice, to constitutively express IL-12 together with a non-signalling chimeric receptor, termed extracellular vesicle-internalizing receptor (EVIR). By binding to a bait molecule (GD2 disialoganglioside) expressed on cancer cells and their EVs, the EVIR enforces EV internalization by cDC1 to promote their cross-dressing with preformed, tumour-derived MHCI-peptide complexes. Upon systemic deployment to mice, the engineered DCPs cause only mild and transient elevation of liver enzymes, acquire tumour-derived material, engage tumour-specific T cells, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an immunotherapy-resistant melanoma model comprising both GD2-positive and -negative cancer cells, without the need for ex vivo antigen pulsing. These results indicate that EVIR-engineered DCPs may avert the positive selection of antigen-negative cancer cells, potentially addressing a critical limitation of immunotherapies targeting defined tumour antigens.

They reveal the key role of δTubulin and ε-Tubulin in this transition during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. 
 Axoneme assembly constitutes a pivotal process in male gametogenesis of Plasmodium. Plasmodium possesses a unique nuclear envelope-anchored basal body that templates axoneme assembly, distinct from the basal body that templates the axoneme of cilia or flagella to protrude from the cell surface. In the canonical basal body, the microtubule (MT) triplet extends and forms the axonemal MT doublet. However, this characteristic MT triplet has not been detected in Plasmodium. Indeed, the MT organization and the mechanism underlying the axonemal MT doublet assembly remain elusive in Plasmodium. Here we utilize high-resolution imaging methods including iterative ultrastructure expansion microscopy (iU-ExM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to resolve the native MT organization in the basal body of male gametes from the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii. The parasite exhibits an MT singlet-to-doublet transition, distinct from the canonical MT triplet-to-doublet transition. Furthermore, we reveal that δ-Tubulin and ε-Tubulin are expressed in male gametocytes and regulate axoneme formation during male gametogenesis. δ-Tubulin is localized at the proximal end of the MT B-tubule and modulates B-tubule assembly of MT doublet. Our work provides the native architecture of MT singlet-to-doublet transition and reveals the key role of δ-Tubulin and ε-Tubulin in MT singlet-to-doublet transition in the basal body of Plasmodium.

 Spatial biology pursues the analysis of cells in their native microenvironment, often with regard to morphology and gene- or protein expression. The spatial analysis of lipid and metabolic profiles by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) can add another layer of molecular information. A seamless integration of MSI data with other (multimodal) methods at a single-cell level is often hampered by insufficient co-registration and resolution. Here, we introduce a MALDI-MSI based method that integrates in-source bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, allowing for a coupled (sub-)cellular investigation of the same sample in both modalities. Presented examples from cell culture and tissue analysis include the visualization of intracellular lipid distributions in macrophages during phagocytosis, and the heterogeneity of lipid profiles of tumor infiltrating neutrophils correlated to their individual microenvironments. The achieved combination of lipid profiling with morphological features and protein expression on the single-cell level constitutes a powerful method for cell biology.

 Muscle genetic defects can lead to impaired movement, respiratory failure, and other severe symptoms. The development of curative therapies is challenging due to the need for the delivery of gene-editing tools into skeletal muscle cells throughout the body. Here, we use muscular fusogens (Myomaker and Myomerger) to engineer muscle-specific virus-like particles (MuVLPs) for the systemic delivery of gene-editing tools. We demonstrate that MuVLPs can be loaded with diverse payloads, including EGFP, Cre and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs), and can be delivered into skeletal muscle cells via targeted membrane fusion. Systemic administration of MuVLPs carrying Cas9 RNPs enables skeletal muscle-specific gene editing, which excised the exon containing a premature terminator codon mutation in a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This treatment restores dystrophin expression in various skeletal muscle tissues, including the diaphragm, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and triceps. As a result, the treated mice exhibit a significantly increased capacity for exercise and endurance. This study established a platform for precise gene editing in skeletal muscle tissues.

 Millennial-scale deoxygenation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the Atlantic Southern Ocean during past interglacials was linked to West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) melt-driven suppression of dense water formation along the Antarctic margin. However, the circum-Antarctic extent of these ‘AABW stagnation events’ and drivers of WAIS retreat remain unclear. Here, we identify recurring bottom water O2 minima in the central Pacific Southern Ocean during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (424–374 ka ago) that are synchronous with their Atlantic Southern Ocean counterparts. As they (partially) align with Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) warming above present-day levels and/or a reorganization of deep-ocean circulation, we postulate recurring and synchronized Pacific-Atlantic AABW perturbation events during MIS11 through WAIS retreat and enhanced exposure to ocean heat (i.e., CDW) from below. This indicates a significant contribution of WAIS meltwater to sea-level high-stands during MIS11 and, by analogy, to sea-level rise due to ocean warming in the future.

 Nuclear laser spectroscopy at the 10−12 precision level (Nature 633.8028 (2024): 63–70) determined the fractional change in the nuclear quadrupole moment of 229Th upon excitation, ΔQ0/Q0 = 1.791(2)%.

Using a semi-classical prolate-spheroid model, we quantify the transition frequency’s sensitivity to fine-structure constant variations as K = 5900(2300), with uncertainty dominated by the measured charge-radius change Δ〈r2〉. This supports the predicted higher α-sensitivity of nuclear clocks over atomic clocks, important for new-physics searches. We find ΔQ0 strongly dependent on nuclear volume, challenging the constant-volume approximation. The deviation between measured and predicted ΔQ0/Q0 underlines the need for improved modeling and measurement of additional nuclear parameters.

 Multi-material 3D printing concerns the use of two or more 3D printable materials within a single printed part. The result is a composite that benefits from the combined properties of the individual 3D printed materials. Typically, a distinct differentiation between material properties can only be achieved using multiple feedstocks and advanced engineering solutions. In this work, we create multi-material 3D printed photopolymer parts from a single monomer mixture through simple adjustments in printing temperature and light intensity. We achieve this by employing a liquid crystalline (LC) monomer that forms a highly stable LC phase in conjunction with a trifunctional thiol crosslinker. A drastic change in mechanical and optical properties was achieved depending on the presence of an LC phase during polymerization. The proof of principle from bulk experiments could be translated fully into 3D printing, achieving pixel-to-pixel resolution of the material properties solely guided by changing the printing parameters temperature and light intensity. The versatility of produced multi-material composite parts is demonstrated in shape memory applications and methods for chemical data storage and encryption. 3D printing can be used to manufacture composite materials, but to modify material properties multiple feedstocks are required.

 Chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl/BrPAHs) are emerging organic pollutants that pose severe risks to both the natural environment and public health.

Emission hotspots, in terms of total estimated Cl/BrPAH emissions, were concentrated in Oceania, East Asia and Latin America, collectively accounting for over 66% of the global total emissions. Iron ore sintering was identified as the largest industrial source (86.1% of total emissions). These findings can facilitate policy-making and the development of mitigation strategies for Cl/BrPAH emissions, and eventually contribute to greener industries.

 Enforcement of national and international laws banning illegal tropical timber trade hinges on independent origin verification, such as with genetic or chemical wood properties. This is of particular concern in Central Africa, where illegal trade prevails. However, tracing methods have not yet consistently achieved high accuracy (>90%) at small spatial scales (<100 km). Where high precision is required but individual methods fall short, combining methods may improve results, because drivers of wood properties differ. Here, we assessed the individual and combined identification potential of three methods (genetics with 238 plastid Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, 3 stable isotopes, and 41 elemental concentrations). The combined approach achieved unprecedented accuracy in Central Africa, identifying 94% of samples within 100 km of their origin, outperforming individual methods (50–80%), and verifying real origin for 88%. These findings show that method complementarity boosts tracing accuracy and spatial precision, crucial for high-value timbers or high-risk regions.

 On September 8, 2023, an Mw 6.8 earthquake struck the High Atlas Mountains southwest of Marrakesh, Morocco, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Beyond its devastating near-field effects, the earthquake also triggered unexpected far-field deformation anomalies in Oulad Berhil, approximately 50 km from the epicenter—challenging conventional seismic impact models that typically emphasize near-field responses. This study combines satellite radar time-series analysis, fault slip modeling, and Coulomb stress change (ΔCFS) calculations to investigate the mechanisms responsible for these anomalous post-seismic deformations. Prior to the earthquake, Oulad Berhil experienced persistent subsidence (∼4 cm/year), attributed to long-term groundwater over-extraction. However, deformation rates accelerated markedly following the earthquake, indicating a significant perturbation to the region’s pre-existing subsidence regime. ΔCFS modeling reveals considerable stress loading (up to 0.5 bar) on a shallow fault beneath Oulad Berhil, likely inducing aseismic slip at depths of 2–7 km, with a maximum slip of 0.345 m—equivalent to an Mw 5.6 event. In parallel, intensified groundwater withdrawal associated with post-seismic reconstruction may have contributed to the deformation, evidenced by abrupt changes of vegetation index. While the relative contributions of stress transfer and groundwater extraction remain uncertain due to data limitations, both mechanisms warrant careful monitoring. These findings demonstrate that moderate-magnitude earthquakes can destabilize distant regions through far-field fault reactivation and anthropogenic interactions, underscoring the importance of incorporating far-field stress effects into seismic hazard assessments, especially in areas experiencing active subsidence or groundwater exploitation."

 Nitrogen (N) is crucial for crop and ecosystem health in agricultural settings. Traditional remote sensing (RS) methods, using regression models and indices like NDVI, face challenges in transferability across time and space. This study aims to enhance in-season N concentration assessment by integrating RS data with a hybrid approach, combining the PROSPECT-PRO and 4SAIL models to create PROSAIL-PRO. This Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) excels in parsing leaf protein, crucial for accurate crop N content estimation. PROSAIL-PRO forms the basis for a robust learning database, guiding the training of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models—Bayesian-based machine learning known for precision and insights into uncertainties. The Gezira irrigation scheme in Sudan serves as a case study. Using Sentinel-2 bands, this research informs agricultural resource management and assesses crop health in the scheme. Fertilizer application data and yield records drawn from three farms within the Gezira scheme to form the basis for validation. Wheat, the primary crop in this context, experienced varying fertilizer application scenarios across these farms during the 2021-22 cropping season resulting in varying yields. Similar results were found in the crop N content and biomass estimation. GPR models, trained on PROSAIL-PRO, effectively predict above ground N content and biomass. Validation against field records shows promising outcomes, with GPR models exhibiting an RMSE of 7.9 kg/ha for N content and 0.54 tonnes/ha for yield estimation. Moreover, the model’s spatiotemporal scalability was assessed, showing an RMSE of 1.01 tonnes/ha at the Nimra level and 1.6 tonnes/ha at the farm level, highlighting the applicability of this approach to larger areas. A significant correlation (0.7) was found between estimated N concentration and actual recorded yield at the field level, further corroborated by an 0.83 correlation at the Nimra level. These results emphasize the robustness of this hybrid modeling approach, particularly in linking nitrogen dynamics to primary productivity, as evidenced by stronger correlations between NPP and nitrogen content than between N content and fAPAR. This study therefore highlights the benefits of adoption hybrid modeling, based on PROSAIL-PRO, in global agricultural monitoring. The synergy found between remote sensing, radiative transfer modeling, and real-world dynamics promises a sustainable future for agriculture applications."

 Urban metropolises in low-lying coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to inundation due to localized ground subsidence and relative sea level rise (RSLR), amplified by climate change. Thus, vertical land movement (VLM) is a pivotal factor in projecting RSLR, especially at regional and local scales over short to medium timeframes. However, VLM is difficult to calculate due to the scarcity of long-term dense instrumental records (e.g., GPS, tide gauges). Consequently, RSLR projections often neglect local VLM, introducing significant uncertainties in coastal hazard assessments and mitigation strategies, particularly in regions experiencing rapid SLR rates, like the South Korean coastal region. To address this, the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data (2017–2023; n = 402) were analyzed using advanced PS-InSAR technique to model land subsidence in South Korea’s low-lying coastal regions. The updated RSLR projections indicate that the integration of localized subsidence with the geocentric sea-level rise presents a more immediate and severe threat to low-lying coastal regions under IPCC AR6 low and high emissions scenarios. The land use/land cover (LULC) exposure analysis to land subsidence reveals that subsidence significantly exacerbates the vulnerability of coastal built-up and wetland regions to RSLR. The calculated coastal vertical resilience (CVR) shows that most of the persistent scatterer points (PSPs) lose elevation relative to SLR, and more than 90 % of PSPs located along the low-elevated (MSL < 5 m) coastal region of South Korea are vulnerable. The findings highlight the importance of high-resolution localized VLM to address coastal deterioration and safeguard the infrastructure of the major metropolitan coastal cities from the impacts of future coastal inundation."

 Trace metal elements in atmospheric particulate matter (PM) have significant adverse health effects. However, emissions of some metals, such as copper (Cu), are not yet consistently reported to the EMEP program by European countries under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), as their reporting is only encouraged but not mandatory. Other unregulated metals such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), are not considered at all. In this study, we improved the current European Cu inventory by correcting and adjusting existing data and completing the inventory through gap-filling. In addition, we developed the first European anthropogenic inventories for Fe and Mn, considering key anthropogenic sources such as brake wear, road abrasion, engine lubricant combustion, fuel combustion, waste incineration and rail wear. These emissions were geographically distributed based on the spatialization of PM10 emissions proposed in the reference inventories. For Cu, our new inventory shows that the heterogeneity of emissions between different countries is greatly reduced; for Fe and Mn, the inventory confirms the importance of abrasion processes in the rail and road traffic sectors, as well as that of combustion processes. To evaluate the emission inventory, the Fe/Cu and Mn/Cu ratios in the emissions were directly compared to ambient measurements. The results indicate an underestimation of Fe and Mn emissions compared to Cu, potentially due to the omission of certain emission sources, such as industrial activities or resuspension by traffic, or to contributions from natural sources such as desert mineral dust. We also compared our inventory with existing national and global inventories. This comparison suggests an underestimation of emissions from industrial activities in our inventory but also a potential misrepresentation of road traffic (or railway) sources in other inventories. Further work, including simulations using a chemistry and transport model, and comparison with extended concentration data, is needed to better assess and improve the accuracy of these inventories."

 Droughts pose significant threats to both natural ecosystems and human society. Understanding how meteorological droughts evolve into agricultural droughts is critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. We used Enhanced Convergent Cross Mapping (ECCM) alongside Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) models with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to identify and analyse nonlinear drought propagation pathways of China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) over 1981–2022. We quantified causal relationships and key influencing factors, focusing specifically on drought propagation counts (DPCs) and the drought propagation intensity index (DIP). Our findings showed that: (1) Approximately 73 % of monitoring stations exhibited higher maximum Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) than ECCM values, with the strongest correlations and causalities observed in the western regions (PCC: 0.48–0.79; ECCM: 0.36–0.77), and the weakest in eastern areas (PCC: 0.06–0.33; ECCM: 0–0.25). Higher quantiles (8–10) showed stronger agreement between maximum PCC (MPCC) and maximum ECCM (MECCM), while lower quantiles (<3) indicated more complex drought propagation dynamics with a strong linear fit between MPCC and MECCM (R2 = 0.87); (2) Based on ECCM, propagation times ranged from 3 to 4 months in northern/southern Xinjiang and eastern Pakistan to 1–2 months in eastern Xinjiang and western Pakistan, whereas PCC-based methods extended this range to 5 months in some regions. Southwestern Pakistan and northwestern Xinjiang exhibited the highest propagation rates (77.95 %), whereas eastern regions showed weaker transitions (5.64 %); (3) XAI-based interpretations of ANN, DNN, and FFNN models identified maximum temperature and soil moisture as the most significant predictors, achieving high predictive accuracies for DPCs (R2 > 0.74) and DIP (R2 > 0.68). Interactions among the climate variables explained regional nonlinearities in drought propagation. These findings offered valuable insights for drought management in arid and semiarid regions."

We quantify each system’s mixing and measurement noise effects, which impact the achievable resolution of isotope continuous records. Our findings reveal specific configurations and procedures to enhance measurement accuracy, providing a framework to optimise water isotope analysis. 
 The continuous flow analysis technique coupled with cavity ring-down spectrometry (CFA-CRDS) provides a method for high-resolution water isotope analysis of ice cores, which is essential for paleoclimatic reconstructions of local temperatures and regional atmospheric circulation. Compared to the traditional discrete method, CFA-CRDS significantly reduces analysis time. However, the effective resolution at which the isotopic signal can be retrieved from continuous measurements is influenced by system-induced mixing, which smooths the isotopic signal, and by measurement noise, which can further limit the resolution of the continuous record, introducing random fluctuations into the instrument's signal output. This study compares three CFA-CRDS systems developed at Ca' Foscari University (Venice), the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (Paris), and the Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement (Grenoble) for firn core analysis. Continuous results are compared with discrete data to highlight the strengths and limitations of each system. A spectral analysis is also performed to quantify the impact of internal mixing on signal integrity and to determine the frequency limits imposed by measurement noise. These findings establish the effective resolution limits for retrieving isotopic signals from firn cores. Finally, we discuss critical system configurations and procedural optimisations that enhance the accuracy and resolution of water isotope analysis in ice cores."

Current global maps are too coarse for farming, flood, or fire applications. By combining multiple satellite data with ground observations and advanced models, we created accurate maps for every available observation date since 2016. These maps enable new opportunities for water management, agriculture, and environmental protection. 
 Satellite-driven soil moisture monitoring systems currently available fail to meet the spatial resolution requirement for a wide range of applications. This limitation is particularly critical for agricultural water management, assessing risks associated with extreme events, and hydrological modeling. This work aims to address the spatial limitations of satellite soil moisture remote sensing by developing GSSM-10, a global 10-meter resolution surface soil moisture dataset, using multi-sensor datasets integrated within an ensemble machine learning framework. These datasets encompass diverse data types—active microwave, multispectral, thermal infrared, and land elevation—offering a robust and comprehensive approach to estimating surface soil moisture (SSM). The ensemble model incorporates TabNet, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The model was trained on ground-truth data collected from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The ensemble model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an R² of 0.8344, a bias of –0.0001, an RMSE of 0.0433 m³/m³, and an ubRMSE of 0.0433 m³/m³ in 5-fold cross-validation. When evaluated on a held-out test set, the model achieved similar levels of accuracy, with an R² of 0.8591, a bias of –0.0002 m³/m³, and an RMSE/ubRMSE of 0.0401 m³/m³. An interactive web platform has been developed for data access, visualization, and download, enabling broad adoption by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. By providing globally consistent, high-resolution SM estimates, GSSM-10 represents a significant advancement in satellite-based soil moisture monitoring for environmental and agricultural applications."

We rely on the known parameterizations, but our approach to solving the problem differs, allowing the algorithm to be incorporated into biogeochemical global ocean models with relative ease. New analytical and numerical solutions have confirmed that feedback between the degradation rate and sinking velocity significantly alters particulate matter fluxes. 
 Gravitational sinking of particulate organic matter (POM) is a key mechanism of the vertical transport of carbon in the deep ocean and its subsequent sequestration. The size spectrum of these particles is formed in the euphotic layer by primary production and various mechanisms, including food web consumption. The masses of the particles, as they descend, change under aggregation, fragmentation, and bacterial decomposition. These processes depend on the water temperature and oxygen concentration, particle sinking velocity, ages of the organic particles, ballasting and other factors. In this work, we developed a simple Eulerian–Lagrangian approach to solving equations for sinking particulate matter when the effects of the sizes and ages of the particles, temperature and oxygen concentration on their dynamics and degradation processes are considered. The model considers feedback between the degradation rate and the particle sinking velocity. We rely on known parameterizations, but our Eulerian–Lagrangian approach for solving the problem differs, which enables the algorithm to be incorporated into biogeochemical global ocean models with relative ease. Two novel analytical solutions of a system of one-dimensional Euler equations for the POM concentration and Lagrange equations for the particle mass and position were obtained for constant and age-dependent degradation rates. The feedback between the degradation rate and sinking velocity leads to significant differences in the vertical profiles of the POM concentration and sinking flux, in contrast to the solutions obtained at a constant sinking velocity, where the concentration and flux profiles of the POM are similar. The calculation results are compared with the available measurement data for the POM and POM flux for the latitude bands of 20–30° N in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and 50–60° S in the Southern Ocean. The dependence of the degradation rate on temperature significantly affected the profiles of the POM concentration and sinking flux by enhancing the degradation of sinking particles in the ocean's upper layer and suppressing it in the deep layer of the ocean. In all cases considered, the influence of the oxygen concentration was insignificant compared to that of the distribution of temperature with depth."

In net‐negative emission scenarios, where more CO2 is extracted from the atmosphere than emitted, we expect global cooling. Little is known about how the ocean will release heat and carbon under such a scenario. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity and show results of an idealized climate change scenario that, following global warming forced by an atmospheric CO2 increase of 1% per year until CO2 doubling, features subsequent sustained net‐negative emissions. After several hundred years of net‐negative emissions and gradual global cooling, abrupt discharge of heat from the ocean leads to a global mean surface temperature increase of several tenths of degrees that lasts for more than a century. This ocean heat “burp” originates from heat that has previously accumulated under global warming in the deep Southern Ocean, and emerges to the ocean surface via deep convection. Little CO2 is released along with the heat which is largely due to particularities of sea water carbon chemistry. As the ocean heat loss causes an atmospheric temperature increase independent of atmospheric CO2 concentrations or emissions, it presents a mechanism that introduces a breakdown of the quasi‐linear relationship of cumulative CO2 emissions and global surface warming, a metric that underpins political decision‐making. We call for assessing the robustness of how models forced with net‐negative CO2 emissions simulate durability of ocean storage of heat and CO2, and pathways of loss to the atmosphere."

These landscapes release large quantities of stored carbon into the atmosphere and threaten infrastructure. As thermokarst develops, freshly exposed permafrost enters the freeze‐thaw cycle, altering sediment properties. While freezing and thawing have been shown to reduce sediment strength and increase mobility, their effects under thermokarst conditions remain unexamined. To address this gap, we performed classical friction mechanics (slide‐hold‐slide and velocity stepping) experiments on fine‐grained sediments to examine the effects of a single freeze‐thaw cycle on the steady‐state and transient rheology under near‐surface pressures. Additionally, we applied Rate‐and‐State Friction laws to model transient localized deformation, revealing altered behavior in the rate‐dependent response and frictional healing potential following freeze‐thaw. Our results suggest that freeze‐thaw decreases the shear strength of fine‐grained sediments and increases mobilization potential in ways currently unaccounted for in future thermokarst development predictions and cold regions land surface hazards."

This increase is driven primarily by a ML shoaling, and secondarily by a reduction of chlorophyll in summer. The latter exerts a pronounced impact on Qpen, resulting from higher sensitivity of Qpen to seasonal chlorophyll reduction in mid‐latitude oceans due to the shoaling of the summertime ML. Furthermore, the enhanced Qpen reduces the magnitude of SST tendency by 25.3% in summer, thereby weakening summertime month‐to‐month SST tendency in these regions.

The platform relies on in situ activation via borane coordination and exploits a copper catalytic redox system that generates amine-ligated boryl radicals, which undergo β-scission across the C(sp³)–N bond to release alkyl radicals. These intermediates engage in copper-catalyzed cross-couplings with a broad array of C-, N-, O-, and S-based nucleophiles. The method tolerates diverse amine classes, enables modular functionalization, and supports late-stage editing of complex drug scaffolds.

 Photonic neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising approach toward energy-efficient artificial neural networks (ANN). Nanolasers, in particular, have become attractive candidates due to their ultra-low power consumption and intrinsic nonlinear characteristics. In this work, we propose a photonic neuromorphic computing architecture based on symmetry-protected robust zero modes at the center of the optical spectrum in coupled semiconductor nanolaser arrays. We experimentally demonstrate that even a small set of coupled nanolasers inherently provides non-convex classification capabilities, enabling it to solve non-trivial classification tasks. As a benchmark, we show that a 2 × 2 nanolaser array, acting as a hidden nonlinear layer with recurrent coupling is able to solve the XNOR logical gate. Our results further highlight the computation capabilities of such nanolaser array by showing robust classification performance even under challenging conditions, such as the classification of highly compressed handwritten digits with significantly overlapping feature boundaries. These findings suggest that symmetry or topologically protected modes in nanolaser arrays can leverage robust optical connections to tackle complex problems without the need of scaling up the number of neurons.

 Earth experienced state-specific climate-carbon cycle feedbacks during the Late Cenozoic Ice Age (LCIA). Whether similar feedbacks existed in the penultimate icehouse, the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), remains uncertain. Here, we present phase relationships between eccentricity-paced climate cycles and carbonate carbon isotope across ~337–300 Ma. Up to 307 Ma, low-latitude continental carbon reservoirs expanded during eccentricity-forced coolings, resembling the Oligocene and Miocene climate-carbon cycle dynamics. After 307 Ma, this relationship reversed, analogous to the Plio-Pleistocene dynamics. We attribute this reversal to the increasing importance of high-latitude biome dynamics, comparable to what occurred at 6 Ma in the LCIA. Paralleling LPIA (335–301 Ma) and LCIA (past 34 Myr) records using this event reveals quasi-synchronization in the interaction of astronomical forcing, carbon cycling and glacial events from onset to apex of two icehouses. We propose that, despite different boundary conditions, extraterrestrial forcing shaped the evolutionary trajectory of Phanerozoic vegetated icehouses.

 Cartilage-targeted gene therapy is promising for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment, though its potency critically depends on the effectiveness of delivery vectors. Here, we modularly develop a series of non-pathogenic, virus-inspired lipopeptide-based nanoparticles (VPN) tailored to deliver nucleic acids to cartilage.

To address the tradeoff between penetration and retention within articular cartilage, si-VPN-2 is further formulated into ROS-responsive nano-in-gel system, which turns out to alleviate cartilage degeneration in surgical ACTL mice, and further synergizes with methylprednisolone to implement superior joint protection in PTOA mice.

Combining human brain imaging with neural network modelling in a probabilistic reversal learning task, we identify a unique role for the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) in arbitrating between RL strategies. While both dorsal PFC and the striatum support rule switching, the former does so when subjects predominantly adopt model-based strategy, and the latter model-free. The lateral and medial subdivisions of MD likewise engage these modes, each with distinct PFC connectivity. Notably, prefrontal transthalamic processing increases during the shift from stable rule use to model-based updating, with model-free updates at intermediate levels. Our CogLinks model shows that model-free strategies emerge when prefrontal-thalamic mechanisms for context inference fail, resulting in a slower overwriting of prefrontal strategy representations - a phenomenon we empirically validate with fMRI decoding analysis. These findings reveal how prefrontal transthalamic pathways implement flexible RL-based cognition. The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is central to flexible decision-making. Here, the authors identify MD’s unique roles in arbitrating between different reinforcement learning strategies through prefrontal-striatal brain circuits."

ZnFs bound to LC domain hydrogels and suppressed LC domain polymer formation. Moreover, ZnFs preferentially recognize LC domains in the polymeric state.

 The escalating demand for long-term high-temperature microwave-absorbing materials (HTMAMs) in high-speed aerospace stealth is hindered by limitations such as magnetic loss degradation or oxidation risks. Herein, we introduce rare earth zirconate ceramics that exhibit air stability up to 1600 °C. Abundant oxygen vacancies significantly enhance permittivity and thus microwave-absorbing performance through activated thermionic migration at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the thermionic-facilitated permittivity can be meticulously modulated by electron delocalization, with the extent governed by lattice disorder. We demonstrate this concept through a dual-layer Er2Zr2O7/Gd2Zr2O7 structure to further optimize impedance matching, achieving an ultra-wide bandwidth (8.27 GHz) and strong absorption (−64.61 dB) at ultrathin thicknesses under 1.2 mm at 600 °C mainly by macroscopic interfacial resonance, alongside an ultralow thermal conductivity (1.61 W•m-1•K-1). This work presents an innovative approach to design high-performance and anti-oxidative HTMAMs through thermionic migration tuned by electron delocalization, advancing structural-functional integrated materials for extreme environments.

 Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is defined by the expansion of a lineage of genetically identical cells in blood. Genetic lesions that confer a fitness advantage, such as leukemogenic point mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), are frequent mediators of CH. However, recent analyses of both single cell-derived colonies of hematopoietic cells and population sequencing cohorts have revealed CH frequently occurs in the absence of known driver genetic lesions. To characterize CH without known driver genetic lesions, we use 51,399 deeply sequenced whole genomes from the NHLBI TOPMed sequencing initiative to perform simultaneous germline and somatic mutation analyses among individuals without leukemogenic point mutations (LPM), which we term CH-LPMneg. We quantify CH by estimating the total mutation burden. Because estimating somatic mutation burden without a paired-tissue sample is challenging, we develop a novel statistical method, the Genomic and Epigenomic informed Mutation (GEM) rate, that uses external genomic and epigenomic data sources to distinguish artifactual signals from true somatic mutations. We perform a genome-wide association study of GEM to discover the germline determinants of CH-LPMneg. We identify seven genes associated with CH-LPMneg (TCL1A, TERT, SMC4, NRIP1, PRDM16, MSRA, SCARB1).Functional analyses of SMC4 and NRIP1 implicated altered hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and proliferation as the primary mediator of mutation burden in blood. We then perform comprehensive multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses, finding that the expression levels of 404 genes are associated with GEM. Finally, we perform phenotypic association meta-analyses across four cohorts, finding that GEM is associated with increased white blood cell count, but is not significantly associated with incident stroke or coronary disease events. Overall, we develop GEM for quantifying mutation burden from WGS and use GEM to discover the genetic, genomic, and phenotypic correlates of CH-LPMneg.

 Prevailing strategies for commuting efficiency focus predominantly on land-use and transportation policies, whereas research on the environmental benefits of housing reallocation strategies to mitigate excess commuting remains critically underexplored. Here this study proposes an information-enabled housing exchange framework and quantifies the potential reduction of commuting-related carbon emissions it can achieve. Leveraging housing and travel survey data from Beijing (n = 2,032), Munich (n = 3,131) and Singapore (n = 7,418), at the household level, our analysis reveals that commuting distances could be reduced by approximately 10.49%–12.70%, corresponding to CO2 emissions reductions of 11.33%, 12.09% and 13.42%, respectively. Crucially, strategic relocation of the households with the 5% highest carbon reduction potential could yield more than 50% of total achievable emissions reduction. These results demonstrate that enhancing housing market efficiency through information transparency can generate substantial environmental co-benefits. The integration of conventional policies with this approach would enable a viable pathway to sustainable urban development. Little is known about the environmental benefits of housing reallocation.

 Karst vegetation ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change. However, relative to the other vegetation ecosystems, the adaptability of the vulnerable vegetation in the karst ecosystem to drought events remains unclear, especially in quantifying the contribution of different factors, including forest age, canopy height, terrain slope, precipitation, and human population. Here, we developed an evaluation framework based on a vegetation response intensity (RI), which includes drought stress windows and delayed vegetation response windows to detect vegetation adaptability to drought stress. Results show that the vegetation adaptability in global karst areas shows an increasing trend (-0.06 yr-1, p < 0.01), but shows significant differences. Although vegetation in all karst regions shows weak adaptability to short-term sudden droughts, vegetation adaptability in Europe (RI = 0.05) and North America (RI = 0.10) is significantly stronger than that in southwest China (RI = 0.23) for long-term drought. Notably, although the ecological restoration process can rapidly increase greenery in sensitive and fragile karst areas, the artificially restored vegetation with a lower age lacks adaptability to drought events in the short term. The adaptability of vegetation in karst areas to drought is mainly influenced by forest age (improved: 16.67%), slope (degraded: 18.87%), precipitation (degraded: 32.27%), and population (degraded: 31.22%) disturbance.

 Investigating semantic change detection (SCD) is critical for tracking the evolution of urban and rural conversion. However, existing methods applied to SCD face two pivotal challenges: (1) modeling of semantic correlations among bi-temporal features is insufficient, leading to substantial pseudo-changes induced by seasonal and temporal differences; and (2) change information lacks effective enhancement, causing incomplete and missed detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose a change prior-guided network, namely CPGNet, which employs a multi-branch paradigm that integrates supplemental changed information to accurately identify diverse types of land cover changes in very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. Initially, a Siamese network is introduced to simultaneously extract robust semantic representations from bi-temporal images. Next, a semantic correlation module is designed to capture and process the interconnections present in bi-temporal features, thereby alleviating pseudo-changes resulting from season variance and time disparities. We then incorporate an auxiliary CD branch to capture changed prior information. Finally, a multi-view change feature fusion module based on Bayesian theory is developed to enhance salient changed features to improve the under-detection of changed areas, particularly for changed objects with small sizes and complex shapes. We applied the proposed method to the semantic change detection dataset (SECOND), JiLin-1 (JL-1) dataset, and Xiamen (XM) dataset, and compared the results to ten typical SCD methods. Our method yielded superior accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 5.97%–40.54%, 9.28%–65.98%, and 0.99%–13.77% in SeK value on the JL-1, XM, and SECOND datasets, respectively.

 To address biodiversity loss and restore ecosystem services, it is important to monitor ecosystem degradation and recovery. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) provide high-resolution data for site-specific monitoring. During degradation or recovery in peatlands, vegetation composition is a crucial indicator of ecosystem condition. In this study, UAS multispectral images, vegetation indices, and digital surface models (DSM) were used to classify peatland vegetation and land cover types. The classes included hummock and lawn Sphagnum, cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum, evergreen dwarf shrubs, bare peat and water. Previous research has focused on categorizing peatland vegetation, with Random Forest (RF) being the most widely used machine learning algorithms. This study aims to evaluate the classification performance of different ensemble machine learning algorithms, including RF, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). Classifications were performed using both default and optimized hyperparameters. Optuna was applied to improve classifier performance by systematically exploring a wide range of hyperparameter values. Additionally, Shapley Additive Expansions (SHAP) feature importance was utilized to improve the explainability of the classification algorithms and pinpoint the critical features that drive classification outcomes. The results indicate that hyperparameter optimization improved overall accuracy from 81 to 86% (default) to 86–87% (optimized). Despite their similar performance, RF showed better differentiation of lawn Sphagnum with both default and optimized hyperparameter settings, while CatBoost had the better accuracies to characterize Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and hummock Sphagnum. DSM and Red edge were found to be the influential features according to the SHAP results. These findings emphasize the value of hyperparameter optimization and feature importance analysis in improving classification accuracy and feature interpretability for peatland vegetation classes."

 Tree branch angles and their distributions (BADs) are key structural traits influencing light interception, resource allocation, and canopy architecture. However, measuring them accurately remains challenging. We present BASeg, a novel method based on instance segmentation to automatically quantify branch angles and BADs from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. BASeg segments individual branches using Voronoi partitioning, fits branch diameters via non-linear least squares, downsamples branch point clouds of varying diameter to different resolutions, and skeletonizes branches using the Laplacian algorithm. Branch angles are then calculated through a cluster-based nearest neighbor graph. We validated BASeg using leaf-off TLS data from six sycamore trees and using simulated data from nine trees (aspen, birch, and maple), spanning various sizes. Additionally, we evaluated its sensitivity to TLS scanning protocols—scanning angular resolution, scanning distance between different locations, and number of scan positions—using 107 field-measured angles from two large beech trees. BASeg achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.96° (14.64 %) and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.89 for branch angle estimation. For estimating BADs, BASeg achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 2.2 to 381.1 (25.2 % to 69.3 %), outperforming TreeQSM, Laplacian, TreeGraph, L1-tree, and WOODSKE. Neither scanning distance (10–20 m) nor the number of scan positions (3–6) affected the accuracy of branch angles or BADs traits, while scanning angular resolution (0.01°–0.04°) did impact these traits. This study offers an effective approach for quantifying BADs and improves the understanding of fine-scale tree architecture within TLS frameworks."

 The lifting condensation level (LCL) is a key parameter in estimating the convective cloud base height (CBH) and plays a crucial role in various meteorological processes. Under typical atmospheric conditions, the CBH coincides with or is positioned above the LCL. This study investigates the occurrence of clouds forming below the LCL over Ahmedabad, a semi-arid region in Western India, during 2022–2024. An analytical LCL formulation, derived from surface temperature and relative humidity, showed minimal bias compared to established empirical formulas when validated against radiosonde data. Convective clouds near the LCL are most frequent during the monsoon season. However, during the post-monsoon and winter months, anomalous cloud formations below the LCL were observed, with a mean CBH of 1044 ± 135 m, predominantly between 0600 and 1200 UTC. These low-level clouds were associated with a strong thermal inversion below the LCL, occurring under surface temperatures ranging from 24 °C to 37 °C and relative humidity levels between 17 % and 49 %. The surface sensible heat flux during these clouds' occurrence was lower than that observed for clouds forming near the LCL but comparable to clear-sky conditions. Conversely, the surface latent heat flux was higher than in clear-sky conditions but lower than in cases where clouds formed near the LCL, averaging 147 ± 74 W/m2. These findings highlight the role of thermodynamic stability and surface heat fluxes in modulating cloud formation processes in semi-arid environments. Improved understanding of clouds forming below the LCL is essential for enhancing weather prediction models and refining convective parameterization schemes in numerical weather and climate models, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions where cloud development significantly influences regional climate variability."

 This study evaluates how well five Regional Climate Model (RCM) projections at resolutions from 44 km to 3 km reproduce wet and dry spells compared with observations at six locations in Scania, southern Sweden. Future changes in general and extreme wet and dry signals were also analyzed under RCP8.5 to the end of the 21st century. Convection-permitting climate models (CPMs), operating at resolutions fine enough to explicitly resolve convective processes (< 4 km), are widely recognized to simulate precipitation characteristics more accurately than coarser models. Our results confirm that CPM AROME (3 km), outperforms coarser RCMs in representing both wet and dry spells. Future projections across all resolutions indicate increases in wet spells to the end of the century, with average daily precipitation increasing by 8–12 %. The number of wet events, their average depth, and duration also projected to increase to varying degrees. For dry spells, the annual number of dry days shows a slight increase (0–3 %). The number of dry events is projected to decrease while both the average duration and the annual maximum consecutive dry days increase. Extreme value analysis shows that extreme precipitation intensities at various accumulating durations increase over 5- to 50-year return periods, as implied by the Wet Climate Factor (WCF). The Dry Climate Factor (DCF) indicates shorter annual maximum consecutive dry days in the near future, but prolonged at the end of the century by 3–9 %. These findings corroborate with previous research and improve understanding of systematic biases across RCMs resolutions. They further suggest that CPMs offer improved reliability in projecting future variability in wet and dry conditions, with important implications for regional climate services."

 Design precipitation estimates are crucial for hydrological modeling, flood risk assessment, and infrastructure planning. Traditional methods rely either on relatively sparse rain-gauge data or on areal but less reliable radar-derived precipitation data. We propose an innovative approach to improving the estimates by merging two design precipitation fields: (i) from adjusted high-resolution radar-derived intensities and (ii) from long-term ombrographic measurements. The proposed approach is demonstrated through application to Czechia on 1-h, 6-h, and 24-h design precipitation totals. Leave-one-out cross-validation identifies Empirical Bayesian Kriging of the ratios between ombrograph- and adjusted radar-derived design totals as the most effective merging method. The combined estimates offer enhanced spatial accuracy, better reflecting real spatial gradients of extreme precipitation. The resulting design precipitation fields reflect substantial spatial variability at shorter durations due to convective precipitation, whereas the highest 24-h design totals are concentrated in mountainous regions, consistent with large-scale circulation patterns driving prolonged stratiform rainfall. A comparison with previously developed datasets confirms the reliability of the new estimates, emphasizing the relevance of radar adjustments and regional frequency analysis. Moreover, the merging procedure increases underestimated radar-based short-term design totals, which highlights a key advantage of the proposed approach. The enhanced spatial resolution and reliability of the resulting design precipitation estimates enable more robust flood risk management, infrastructure design, and adaptation planning, particularly in this region with such diverse precipitation regimes."

 Using the Self-Organizing Map method, tornadoes associated with the Northeast China cold vortex (NCCV) are classified into three categories, each predominantly distributed in different regions. Tornadoes in Cluster 1 (C1) primarily occur in Northeast China, while those in Cluster 2 (C2) are concentrated from North China to northern Jiangnan. This study investigates characteristics of C1 and C2 tornadoes under the NCCV and its influences. Results indicate during the warm seasons from 2007 to 2020, the frequencies of C1 and C2 tornadoes exhibit declining trends regardless of NCCV presence. The NCCV induces weaker positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) anomalies and lower negative lifting condensation level (LCL) anomalies, especially for C1 tornadoes. That is, the CAPE threshold is more readily reached for C1 tornadoes when the NCCV occurs. Meanwhile, low-level moisture anomalies are not essential for either tornado type under the NCCV. When vertical wind shear or storm-relative helicity is unfavorable under the NCCV, negative LCL anomalies become crucial for C1 tornadoes, while positive CAPE and negative LCL anomalies favor C2 tornadoes. Further analysis reveals NCCV-related positive potential vorticity anomalies trigger cyclonic circulation anomalies, enhancing C1 tornado occurrence. Cyclonic circulation anomalies associated with the NCCV converge with anticyclonic circulation anomalies near southern China, promoting C2 tornado occurrence. Dry intrusions are crucial for C2 tornadoes.

 Hail forms within deep convective storms through the nucleation of ice particles, the accretion of supercooled water droplets, and repeated growth cycles sustained by strong updrafts, with its occurrence producing widespread impacts on agriculture, transportation, aviation, and critical infrastructure. Understanding the structure of hailstones and the nature of embedded insoluble particles, particularly in the hail embryo, is crucial for revealing hail formation mechanisms and ice nucleation pathways. This study analyzes a large, plate-shaped hailstone collected in Yantai, Shandong Province on October 1, 2021. Hail slicing reveals a layered structure composed of five opaque and four transparent layers, indicating multiple cycles of dry and wet growth in a supercooled water-rich environment. The hail embryo, typically less than 5 mm in diameter, contains abundant insoluble particles. Single-particle analysis using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) shows that the embryo primarily contains mineral dust and bioprotein aerosols. Notably, pollen-like particles are identified, likely linked to the autumn sampling season. To further characterize the particle population, statistical analysis of 8375 insoluble particles is performed using k-means clustering based on elemental composition. Four major types are identified: mineral, bioprotein, organic, and mixed. Mineral and mixed particles exhibit larger sizes and more compact shapes, while bioprotein and organic particles are smaller and more irregular. The backward trajectory analysis indicates that insoluble particles may originate from both long-range transport, especially dust carried from arid regions of northwest China, and from local emission sources. The combined morphological and compositional findings improve understanding of hail microphysics and offer valuable insight for hail forecasting, disaster mitigation, and climate research."

 The prediction of tropical cyclones (TCs) on a subseasonal scale is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and improving risk mitigation strategies. However, the sub-seasonal forecasting of TCs continues to pose significant challenges. This study analyzes TC forecasts at one to eight weeks lead, using the dynamic sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction system developed by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP-CAS). The IAP-CAS model captures the spatiotemporal pattern, landfalling TC, and translation speed climatology. Currently, the model is skillful in capturing the annual cycle accurately across most basins and lead weeks. But, skillful only in the Northwest Pacific during the first week to predict the TCs anomalies deviation from the seasonal cycle. However, there is a potential room for improvement in skill over most of the basins and lead weeks. The skill can be further enhanced significantly with a lag-ensemble and post-processing calibration technique. The interannual variations of accumulated cyclone energy is skillfully predicted across Northern Hemisphere basins, except the North Indian Ocean. The model also captures the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) influence on TC, with an eastward propagation of enhanced genesis up to 3rd week. Furthermore, the model demonstrates enhanced proficiency when the combined impact of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-MJO TC relationship is effectively resolved. The biases in the dynamic genesis potential index (DGPI) effectively explain the biases of TCs forecast error across most basins and lead times. These findings provide valuable insight for model improvement and advancement on the sub-seasonal scale."

 Low-level wind shear poses a threat to the safety of aircraft during take-off and landing, while its precise detection remaining a critical challenge in meteorological monitoring. To solve this problem, this study proposes a method for the identification of low-level wind shear and shear line based on coherent Doppler wind lidar. The method integrates a ramp detecting algorithm and a dual filtering mechanism for wind shear identification, subsequently applying spatial clustering analysis to reconstruct low-altitude wind shear lines. An airport field experiment demonstrates effective detection of shear lines induced by gust fronts and convective weather systems. An urban field campaign verifies the practicality in detecting shear lines of complex underlying surface, achieving a maximum forecast of approximately 25 min through spatial distribution and wind field analysis. This study provides technical support to improve the extreme weather warning capability and ensure the safety of low-altitude flights."

They are formed and maintained by strong and persistent katabatic winds that push the ice away from the coast. Satellite data, in-situ meteorological observations and Reanalysis datasets all indicate a decline in sea ice concentration (SIC) over the Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP) from 2013 to 2022, consistent with the occurrence of an increasing trend of strong katabatic wind events (SKWEs). On the interannual timescale, significant correlations between the TNBP area and the duration of SKWEs were observed in austral summer, autumn and winter, and also in April and October during 2003–2022. Sea ice volume budget analysis shows that SKWEs drive rapid sea-ice removal through advection and divergence, whereas thermodynamic processes dominate sea ice formation on an annual basis. The increase in SKWEs was associated with a deepened and southwestward-displaced Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and an enhanced pressure gradient between the interior plateau and the coast, both potentially linked to a more positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM). These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of long-term polynya variability, with implications for regional sea-ice changes and AABW."

Under ongoing climate change, the frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of such events are projected to increase, with disproportionately severe impacts on ecologically sensitive and conservation-priority areas. Despite this growing risk, existing vulnerability assessment frameworks for PHAS have primarily focused on long-term, gradual climatic shifts, largely overlooking the episodic and often catastrophic nature of EWEs. Here, we propose a structured methodological framework to assess the vulnerability of PHAS to extreme climatic events, based on the three IPCC vulnerability components including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (ExP-SeN-AdC). The framework introduces the Extreme Event Vulnerability Index (EVI), an integrative metric designed to quantify vulnerability of PHAS to EWEs in a transparent, standardized, and scalable manner. The framework follows an eight-step process: (1) defining the assessment scope; (2) selecting ecologically meaningful indicators; (3) evaluating data availability and acquiring data; (4) constructing component indices for ExP-SeN-AdC; (5) computing the composite vulnerability metric; (6) evaluating uncertainties through validation and sensitivity analysis; (7) communicating and refining results through stakeholder engagement; and (8) formulating science-based conservation and adaptation recommendations. Finally, we demonstrate application of the proposed framework through a case study on Atlantic Salt Meadow habitats (Glauco-Puccinellietalia Maritimae) located within Dublin Bay’s Natura 2000 sites, encompassing a mosaic of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protected Areas (SPAs) under the EU Habitat Directive. The framework and its methodological approach lay the foundation for the vulnerability analysis and mapping, advancing adaptation planning, and guiding targeted interventions and conservation efforts, and the development of forward-looking conservation policies in the face of escalating extreme climatic threats."

While many studies assess the realized impacts of hurricane strikes, less attention has been paid to the economic consequences of anticipatory responses. Using 25 years of weekly refinery crude oil input data and 36 h hurricane forecast information, we estimate the effect of projected storm strength and strike location on regional refinery oil input. We find that stronger forecasted hurricanes targeting larger refinery subregions significantly reduce oil input, with impacts lasting several weeks. We also identify substantial economic losses that occur even when storms do not ultimately make landfall, highlighting the cost of forecast-driven disruption. For example, our estimates show that under a category 4 hurricane that is forecast to threaten 31% of Gulf Coast capacity, there would be a reduction of 18 million barrels in refinery throughput and an operating profit loss of $770 million."

While early forecasting approaches focused almost exclusively on near-surface variables (e.g. sea surface temperature) or upper-ocean layers (0–100 m), some follow-up efforts integrated subsurface information using ocean heat content analyses relative to the 26 °C isotherm, yielding modest enhancement for the most intense storms. By contrast, our convolutional neural network–random forest (RF) framework explicitly exploits the three‐dimensional structure of ocean anomalies from the surface down to 500 m—indirectly capturing heat redistribution, salinity‐driven stratification, and mixed‐layer dynamics across depths. We demonstrate that the layered information within 40–500 m accounts for 44.91 ± 0.24% of total variable importance in the RF model and supports 72-h lead‐time severe‐hurricane forecasts with a precision of 73.04 ± 7.95%. This substantially extends ocean-heat-content‐only approaches by: 1) avoiding a hard threshold, 2) providing the first quantification of layer-specific subsurface contributions to severity forecasting through a multi-depth anomaly analysis across multiple variables using an RF-based framework, and 3) leveraging fine‐scale spatial patterns via convolutional-neural-network‐derived features. Subsurface variables down to 500 m are not merely ancillary—they are indispensable for capturing the ocean precursors of the strongest hurricanes, particularly when the 26 °C isotherm (typically shallower than 100 m) fails to represent the full heat reservoir. This deeper thermal structure may represent a key energy source that can support—and potentially accelerate—severe hurricane intensification. These findings highlight the untapped predictive value of deep-layer ocean information and its potential to enhance early-warning systems for high-impact storm events."

One common practice that is well-known to benefit crop yields is crop rotation, yet there remains limited understanding of how the benefits of crop rotation vary for different crop sequences and for different weather conditions. To address these gaps, we leverage crop type maps, satellite data, and causal machine learning to study how precrop effects on subsequent yields vary with cropping sequence choice and weather. Complementing and going beyond what is known from randomized field trials, we find that (i) for those farmers who do rotate, the most common precrop choices tend to be among the most beneficial, (ii) the effects of switching from a simple rotation (which alternates between two crops) to a more diverse rotation were typically small and sometimes even negative, (iii) precrop effects tended to be greater under rainier conditions, (iv) precrop effects were greater under warmer conditions for soybean yields but not for other crops, and (v) legume precrops conferred smaller benefits under warmer conditions.

Low-carbon hydrogen produced from fossil resources is often viewed as a bridge in the energy transition. This study comparatively evaluates life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of diverse pathways of fossil-based hydrogen production for fuel cell vehicle use. Life cycle emissions of hydrogen production alone vary significantly with production technology and are highly influenced by the supply sources of feedstock and electricity. Reforming and chemical looping with carbon capture and storage (CCS) are competitive to produce low-carbon hydrogen, whereas plasma pyrolysis is not competitive. Using low-carbon hydrogen to replace gasoline and diesel can significantly reduce life cycle emissions for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. Low-carbon hydrogen production by steam methane reforming, autothermal reforming, gasification, and chemical looping with CCS accounts for 64%–78% of the total life cycle emissions associated with hydrogen production, transport, leakage, and vehicle use. Although nominal hydrogen leakage alone has no remarkable effect on life cycle emissions, the expansion of assessment system boundary by including hydrogen transport and utilization can sizably elevate emissions. To secure short-term climate benefits for replacing diesel-fueled heavy-duty trucks and transit buses with hydrogen-fueled vehicles, however, it is necessary to simultaneously limit methane and hydrogen leakage along their supply and utilization chains. These findings imply that economic incentives and policies for a low-carbon hydrogen economy should be developed based on the life cycle emissions of both hydrogen production and utilization."

When ground ice melts, surface subsidence produces thermokarst landforms that expand wetlands at the edges of permafrost plateaus. Thermokarst represents an accelerating climate feedback, but uncertainties remain about how ground ice, hydrology, and vegetation interact to shape landscape change and carbon fluxes. We extended the process-based model ecosys to simulate thermokarst dynamics in laterally coupled 2D transects at a well-characterized boreal peatland site in Canada’s Northwest Territories. After benchmarking against site observations, we varied ground ice content and hydrologic boundary conditions across ranges typical near the southern permafrost limit. Simulations revealed distinct degradation regimes governed by the elevation difference between the frost table and the external water table. Rates of lateral retreat, the thaw-driven encroachment of wetlands into adjacent plateaus, ranged from 0 to >2 m yr−1 under identical weather forcing, consistent with observations and highlighting the strong role of WT and ground ice. Simulated vegetation dynamics indicate that black spruce mortality cannot be explained by anoxia alone, pointing to additional stressors such as root damage, pathogens, or physical destabilization. Despite large hydrologic shifts, net ecosystem CO2 exchange remained a slight sink after collapse, while methane (CH4) emissions rose by one to two orders of magnitude. As a result, lateral retreat substantially increases the greenhouse warming potential of permafrost peatlands (1.7 million km2 in area), with simulated emissions of 0.1–10 Mt CO2-eq decade−1 depending on hydrology and retreat rates. These results underscore the need to account for both ground ice and hydrologic dynamics when assessing thermokarst-driven climate feedbacks."

The results indicate a clear east–west asymmetric change in chlorophyll-a concentration between 180°W–130°W: decreasing (increasing) in the west (east), which is dominated by the changes in wind forcing and sea ice coverage. Cyclonic wind anomalies drive regional sea ice divergence off Marie Byrd Land, while increasing coastal easterly winds off Marie Byrd Land and southerly wind anomalies in the western Ross Sea drive regional sea ice convergence.

However, a high landscape heterogeneity and small size of ponds make it challenging to assess trends in surface water extent and associated carbon and energy fluxes, especially in the understudied Eastern Siberian tundra. Here, we show that surface water extent in these landscapes can be highly dynamic, shaped by small-scale pond processes. Using a time-series of aerial imagery at 12 cm resolution spanning eight years (2014–2021), we classified surface water at three sites in Kytalyk National Park and traced all 465 ponds (i.e. patches of surface water) larger than 1 m2. The total surface water extent at the sites varied between 102%-124% relative to the time-series mean, without significant trends in contrast to previous reports. Individual pond area fluctuated by 52% on average, and two thirds of ponds were present for less than six years. One-quarter of ponds showed evidence for thermokarst or vegetation colonisation as drivers of change, based on our high-resolution surface elevation models. These findings highlight that tundra ponds in Siberia can be highly dynamic in nature and stresses the need for improved change detection of very small surface water bodies in remote sensing analyses to better model carbon and energy fluxes in the tundra biome."

ABM can simulate how humans interact and co-adapt with their environment, which is beneficial for understanding the effects of humans’ decisions in the face of hazards and climate change. ABMs can serve as tools for examining the effects of current and future hydrological hazard management strategies. However, the implementation of hydrological hazard management in ABMs has not yet been systematically evaluated for floods and droughts. To map the current status of ABMs in hydrological hazard modelling and facilitate a discussion on further potential, we conducted a systematic mapping review based on the ROSES protocol. In this review, we investigate what kinds of hydrological hazards and management strategies that are represented in ABMs. Additionally, we synthesise current practices regarding agent types and their decision-making. A total of 377 articles were screened, and 77 articles were analysed in full text. Our findings indicate that hydrological hazard management strategies in ABMs include both structural and non-structural measures. However, there is an emphasis on the complexity of individual agents’ decision-making in implementing these measures, whereas collective agents (e.g. governments) performing non-individual hazard management are implemented more simplistically, often as static scenarios or collective agents with ad-hoc or rational decision-making. Conversely, individual agents are commonly implemented with human-like behaviour. Our study highlights that the simplicity of hazard management in these models could restrict the potential of ABMs as policy and predictive tools, as the implemented hazard management does not capture the full dynamics of human–water systems. Involving stakeholders, adopting interdisciplinary methods, or incorporating bounded-rational decision-making could represent a significant shift to further enhance the explanatory power of ABM for addressing challenges in hydrological hazard management."

We analyse results from two CMIP6 overshoot scenarios run by an ensemble of Earth system models to assess changes in temperature and precipitation across the globe. We find that overshooting a temperature target by a larger amount leads to a warmer Southern Hemisphere, a cooler Northern Hemisphere, and larger decreases of precipitation in North Africa and increases in East Asia, compared to a smaller temperature overshoot. Some differences, notably increases in extreme temperatures, persist for centuries after the overshoot. These findings show that reversal of global temperatures will not be felt evenly across the globe and that the size of an overshoot matters long term."

Mangroves, as biodiversity hotspots offering crucial ecosystem services, have seen some conservation gains, yet key drivers of high-value mangrove loss remain unaddressed in intergovernmental policy frameworks. It is the first global assessment linking GBF Targets 1 & 3 to mangrove loss drivers and ecosystem assessment. We apply an interdisciplinary approach—combining global-scale geospatial analysis of mangrove loss trajectories between 2000 and 2016 and ecosystem value distribution, and thematic policy analysis. We classify all 120 countries where mangroves are present by their short- and long-term mangrove loss management strategies and evaluate the inclusion of relevant actions under Targets 1 and 3 of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Between 2000 and 2016, 78% of mangrove loss occurred in areas rich in biodiversity, biomass, and coastal protection, mostly outside protected zones. Of 120 mangrove-holding countries, 30 (25%) experienced significant loss. Among them, 11 have the potential to implement short-term mitigation by expanding or managing protected areas, though only 5 included these strategies in national targets. Four countries referenced broader measures like indigenous rights and the prioritisation of ecosystem service hotspots. Only Cameroon, Colombia, Gabon, Panama, and Tanzania are positioned to address major loss drivers within the GBF timeline. This paper is the first global assessment of GBF-aligned national targets to mitigate mangrove loss, contributing to SDGs 14 and 15. We show that mangrove loss cannot be halted by 2030 under the current level of national targets. Policy amendments at national scales can include short-term (area-based protection) and long-term strategies (restoration, rehabilitation and ecosystem-based approaches) to halt mangrove loss."

An effective method to prevent these at a free surface already exists. Here this is tested for compositional layers deeper in the mantle. The stabilisation method works effectively if density gradients due purely to compositional gradients are used but produces severe artefacts if total density is used. 
 Large density jumps in numerical simulations of solid Earth dynamics can cause numerical “drunken sailor” oscillations. An implicit method has previously been shown to be very effective in stabilising the density jump that occurs at a free surface against such instabilities (Kaus et al., 2010; Duretz et al., 2011). Here the use of this to prevent oscillations of compositional layers deeper in the mantle is examined. If the stabilisation algorithm uses the total density field including the steady increase of density with depth due to adiabatic compression and jumps due to phase transitions, then a severe artificial reduction in convective vigour occurs because the algorithm assumes that density is advected with the flow but these density gradients are not. This artificial vigour reduction increases with Rayleigh number but decreases with decreasing grid spacing. Thus, it is essential to use only composition-related density gradients in the stabilisation algorithm, and a simple method for isolating these is presented. Once this is done, the stabilisation method works effectively for internal compositional layers as well as a free surface."

 This paper presents a Lagrangian model for particle transport driven by a two-dimensional (2D) shallow water model, assuming that the particles have negligible mass and volume, are located at the free surface, and without interactions between them. Particle motion is based on advection and turbulent diffusion, which is added using a random-walk model. The equations for particle advective transport are solved using the flow velocity provided by a 2D shallow water solver and an online first-order Euler method, an online fourth-order Runge–Kutta method and an offline fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The primary objective of this work is to present the capabilities of the new Lagrangian particle transport (LPT) model, while also providing an analysis of the accuracy and computational efficiency of the numerical schemes and their implementation for particle transport. To verify the accuracy and computational cost, several test cases inspired by laboratory set-ups are simulated. In this analysis, the Euler online method provides the best compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency.

 Linear carbon (Cn), an elusive sp-hybridized carbon allotrope, has long attracted interest for its remarkable properties and debated structures. Here, we report the synthesis of an uncapped linear C5 via tip-induced dehalogenation and ring-opening reaction of C5Br6, with its cumulenic structure confirmed by atomic force microscopy. We further demonstrate the tip-induced coupling of linear C5 to form longer chains (e.g., C10, C15). By applying higher voltage pulses to C5Br6 (also C6Br6), various carbon chains, including C9, C10, C13, C14, C15, C17, C18, C21, C23, could be synthesized. Even-numbered chains (C10, C14 and C18) adopt polyynic structures due to a Peierls transition on NaCl, whereas for odd-numbered chains, C9 adopts a cumulene-like structure, and longer ones exhibit hybrid structures with terminal triple bonds and cumulene-like interiors. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals smaller transport gaps for odd- than even-numbered chains, consistent with Peierls theory, and decreasing gaps with increasing chain length.

 Sulfated fucan is one of the most recalcitrant polysaccharides. The molecular mechanism underlying the endo-1,3-fucanase, which plays a critical role in the breakdown of sulfated fucan, remains unexplained. Here, we conduct a comprehensive structure-function relationship investigation on the endo-1,3-fucanases within a family space—GH168. The family can be divided into four subfamilies according to phylogenetic relationship and functional similarities. Subfamily I, Ⅱ and Ⅳ preferentially recognize Fucp2(OSO3−), Fucp2,4(OSO3−) and Fucp units at the +1 subsite, respectively, while consistently recognizing the Fucp2(OSO3−) unit at the −1 subsite. Remarkably, two-thirds of the interacting residues are dedicated to the recognition of sulfate groups along the glycoside chains. This mechanism is distinct from the direct recognition of the sugar backbone employed by neutral polysaccharide hydrolases. These findings unveil a critical enzyme recognition mechanism for sulfate polysaccharides and promote the application of endo-1,3-fucanases in the structural analysis and oligosaccharide production of sulfated fucan.

 Pd nanoparticles, together with bulk and thin film Pd, constitute the archetype model system for metal-hydrogen interactions. The density of defects in Pd nanoparticles, such as grain boundaries and dislocations, combined with their size, shape, composition and lattice strain, dictate their hydrogen sorption kinetics and thermodynamics. Despite decades of research and its relevance in applications, such as solid-state hydrogen storage, hydrogen sensors, hydrogen embrittlement, and hydrogen separation membranes, a coherent picture of the intricate interplay between defects, strain and Pd nanoparticle hydrogen sorption properties is missing.

We not only show a clear deformation-level dependent trend of both the kinetics and the hydride formation pressure, but also reveal their complex evolution upon hydrogen cycling. We discuss how these results provide a quantitative view of the impact of plastic deformation on nanoscale metal hydrides, and how they reveal the surface and bulk morphology of Pd nanoparticles upon repeated hydrogen cycling.

Then, this very simple SNN was found to be effective at classifying action potentials in a fully unsupervised and online-compatible mode on simulated and real spike sorting datasets. These results pave the way for highly frugal SNN architectures for automatic unsupervised real-time pattern recognition in high-dimensional neural data recordings, which could be suitable for future embedding into ultra-low power hardware platforms, such as active neural implants.

This study assesses changes in the P cycle upon abrupt thaw and shows accelerated soil P cycling and increased plant uptake, which may boost primary production and partially offset soil carbon loss. 
 Permafrost thaw can stimulate soil carbon release, triggering a positive carbon–climate feedback, which may be mediated by changes in soil phosphorus (P) availability. However, the response of soil P cycling to permafrost thaw and the potential biotic and abiotic mechanisms involved are largely unknown. We investigate how soil P cycling responds to abrupt permafrost thaw based on large-scale sampling along a permafrost transect on the Tibetan Plateau, combined with 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 33P-labelling and metagenomic sequencing. In collapsed areas, gross phosphate (Pi) mobilization in the topsoil (0–15 cm) is 50% faster compared with non-collapsed landforms, linked to a higher abundance of microbial P-cycling genes. Meanwhile, plant P uptake increases by 71% due to the enhanced gross Pi mobilization, improved plant P-acquisition capabilities and reduced microbial competition with plants upon permafrost collapse. These findings demonstrate that abrupt permafrost thaw accelerates soil P cycling, which could then mediate the permafrost carbon–climate feedback.

This study explores why this is yet to be seen in observations, finding that recent surface freshening increases stratification and traps the CO2-rich water in the subsurface layer, which prevents atmospheric outgassing. 
 The Southern Ocean mitigates global surface warming by taking up a large portion of the carbon released by human activities. While models suggest this carbon sink should weaken as climate change increases upwelling of carbon-rich deep water, such a decline has not been observed over the past decades. Here, using circumpolar hydrographic observations, we reveal that Southern Ocean freshening since the 1990s has enhanced density stratification, which prevents these CO2-enriched waters from reaching the surface. Meanwhile, the surface layer has become thinner, allowing the CO2-rich circumpolar deep water to get closer to the surface, replacing winter water between 100 m and 200 m. In this layer, the CO2 fugacity increased by ~10 µatm because of changing ocean dynamics since the 1990s. Our findings imply that the observed surface freshening temporarily buffered the model-predicted weakening of the Southern Ocean carbon sink, but that such a signal could potentially emerge if stratification weakened.

 Damage features, such as rifts and crevasses, are the first signs of a weakened ice shelf and the precursor for retreat. Yet, damage changes are not widely quantified on Antarctic ice shelves, leaving future ice shelf weakening poorly understood. Here we use satellite imagery to detect both long-term (24-year) and short-term (annual, 2015–2021) Antarctic-wide damage changes, revealing a multiyear damage development cycle strongly correlated to ice shelf area changes, and a net decline in damaged area from 1997 to 2021. We establish a data-driven link between damage and ice flow characteristics, which shows that ice flow acceleration, strain rate increases and thinning lead to more damage development, in particular under high-emission climate scenarios. This sensitivity to warming suggests that without quantification of damage impacts by detailed physical models the (timing of) ice shelf retreat and Antarctic mass loss may currently be underestimated.

Here the authors assess cascading climate impacts on the EU and identify intervention points for adaptation related to water, livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure and economy, and violent conflict. 
 In an interconnected world, climate change impacts can cascade across sectors and regions, creating systemic risks. Here we analyse cascading climate change impacts on the EU, originating from outside the region, and identify critical intervention points for adaptation. Using network analysis, we integrate stakeholder-co-produced impact chains with quantitative data for 102 countries across foreign policy, human security, trade and finance. Our archetypal impact cascade model reveals critical intervention points related to water, livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure and economy, and violent conflict. Livelihood instability, with violence exacerbating conditions in conflict-prone regions, tends to amplify risks of cascading impacts emerging from low-income countries. High-income countries can trigger cascading impacts through, for example, reduced crop exports. Our findings highlight the importance of policy coherence in addressing interconnected vulnerabilities rather than isolated risks. Thus, agricultural intensification without integrated water management may exacerbate scarcity, whereas safeguarding livelihoods alleviates cascading risks related to forced migration, violent conflict and instability. Impacts from a climate event can cascade through natural, anthropogenic and socio-economic systems.

Nürnberg,Quaternary deep-thermocline cooling enhanced by southern Pacific Ocean tunnelling,"Freshening of the tropical Pacific in the early Quaternary aligned with a volume increase of the Antarctic ice shield, according to analyses of oxygen isotope ratios in foraminifera from the Western Pacific. 
 Tropical climate is considered to be one of the decisive keys to global climate dynamics. The extent to which extratropical forcing mechanisms contributed to changes of tropical heat and thus global changes in the climate system, however, is only poorly understood. Here, we reconstruct early Quaternary hydrographic variability of the tropical deep thermocline of the eastern margin of the West Pacific Warm Pool using magnesium to calcium and oxygen isotope ratios of surface and deep-dwelling foraminifera. This approach allows to determine past ocean temperatures and relative salinity changes likely related to extratropical oceanographic reorganisations. Our proxy records point to a freshening of the tropical Pacific deep-thermocline and exhibit a strong coupling to the volume increase of the Antarctic ice shield and cooling of high/mid latitude surface water masses at 1.5 Ma. This temporal coincidence is accompanied by the progressive increase in Earth´s obliquity amplitude and suggests high latitude climate impact via ocean tunnelling of southern-sourced sub-surface water masses towards the equatorial Pacific. We hypothesize that ocean tunnelling of mid-latitude Southern Ocean/South Pacific water to the West Pacific Warm Pool effectively contributed to global climate between 1.7 Ma and 1.2 Ma prior the Mid-Pleistocene-Transition, particularly through changes in oceanic heat budget across vast latitudinal ranges. Freshening of the tropical Pacific in the early Quaternary aligned with a volume increase of the Antarctic ice shield, according to analyses of oxygen isotope ratios in foraminifera from the Western Pacific."

 Climate models project an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown under anthropogenic greenhouse warming. Despite a ~1.5 °C increase in the global mean surface temperature, debate remains on whether and when this circulation has slowed. Here we identify a distinctive temperature fingerprint in the equatorial Atlantic that signals the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation change through numerical ocean model experiments. The equatorial Atlantic is a crucial crossroads for the circulation anomalies to propagate to other oceans. A slowdown drives a mid-depth (1000–2000 m) warming in the equatorial Atlantic in a decade via baroclinic Kelvin waves. Analysis of climate models shows that this mid-depth temperature change is a better indicator for Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation change on decadal and longer timescales than other surface proxies. Observations reveal a robust mid-depth warming since 1960 that emerged from natural variability in the early 2000s, suggesting a slowdown that already started in the late 20th century.

 Flooding exacerbated by climate change presents growing risks to communities worldwide. Despite extensive research on flood risk, there is a lack of critical analysis of flood adaptation measures spanning traditional and emerging methods. Here, we compile a comprehensive portfolio of 39 adaptation measures classified into four groups: infrastructural/technological, institutional, behavioral/cultural, and nature-based measures. Each measure is evaluated for its advantages, disadvantages, co-benefits, and tradeoffs. Our analysis identifies four broad eras in the evolution of flood adaptation measures. While early efforts primarily focused on structural modifications, more recent projects shifted toward soft adaptation measures, with a growing interest in employing community-centered and nature-based solutions. We lay out key decision-making attributes to identify successful adaptation strategies that are socially just, practically feasible, and technically sound. Finally, we highlight gaps and provide recommendations for future research, with an emphasis on a transdisciplinary approach toward developing and implementing climate-resilient and equitable flood adaptation strategies.

 This review integrates vent fluid chemistry and biogeochemical processes to assess how hydrothermal systems influence oceanic iron distribution. Despite rapid precipitation of iron-bearing minerals immediately after venting, buoyant hydrothermal plumes disperse dissolved and nanoparticulate iron across thousands of kilometers, aided by slow oxidation, reversible exchanges between soluble and particulate iron, and biological interactions. These mechanisms underscore hydrothermal vents as a widespread iron source, impacting deep and surface marine ecosystems. Transport dynamics are governed by temperature, pH, microbial activity, and water-mass residence times. We investigate the controls on hydrothermal iron distribution by examining relationships between iron and pH, temperature, chlorinity and hydrogen sulfide in vent fluids, along with solubility modeling of iron(III) hydroxide and iron(II) sulfide. Finally, we highlight key research frontiers that will advance understanding of both hydrothermal processes and their role in shaping the ocean iron biogeochemical cycle.

 Large explosive volcanic eruptions can cover wide areas of land with tephra, sometimes with profound hydrological, ecological, and societal impacts. However, while consequences of tephra fallout and flow deposits have been well studied on annual to decadal timescale, little is known about centennial and longer-term changes in vegetation composition. Here, we consider the enduring impacts of the 946 CE Millennium Eruption of the Changbaishan volcano. We reconstruct the pre-eruption vegetation composition based on species, age, and size of carbonized trees recovered from the pyroclastic deposits and analysis of phytolith records in peat cores. Compared with the early 10th century forest composition and structure, the present montane forest hosts a higher abundance of broad-leaved species. Higher elevations, which today are dominated by alpine tundra, were covered in a spruce forest before the eruption. These differences reflect the long process of ecological recovery following the eruption rather than the effects of recent warming, as has been suggested. However, present warming trends are likely to drive the ecological succession towards a reduction of the alpine vegetation zone. Our study emphasizes the importance of interpreting contemporary ecological change in the context of past massive disturbances, together with subfossil evidence of vegetation composition.

 Global atmospheric rivers are major conduits for moisture and energy transport, playing a critical role in the global hydrological cycle and energy redistribution as climate changes. Here, we assess their evolving roles using observations and climate simulations. By 2100, under a high-emission scenario, about 70% of mid-latitude atmospheric rivers are projected to carry more moisture than the Amazon River, with 11% of this intensification driven by future warming. This trend is expected to increase flood risks in densely populated basins such as the Yangtze, Loire, and Sacramento. Moist static energy provides insight into atmospheric rivers’ behavior on subseasonal scales. Atmospheric rivers redistribute meridional energy transport during active seasons, a process projected to intensify and shift poleward.

 Projecting future climate change is important for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions to a level that would keep the global average temperature increase to 2100 below 2 °C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses emissions scenarios for projecting climate change, but since 2017, an alternative fully statistical Bayesian probabilistic approach has been developed. Both approaches rely on an equation that expresses emissions as the product of population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, and carbon intensity, namely carbon emissions per unit of GDP. Here, we use data on these quantities for 2015–2024 to probabilistically assess the changes in climate change prospects associated with post-Paris emissions. These show that carbon intensity declined (i.e., improved) substantially over that period, but that overall carbon emissions rose, due to the rapid rise in world GDP, which more than canceled out the progress made. We found that the projected temperature increase to 2100 declined only slightly, from 2.6° C to 2.4 °C. Meanwhile, the chance of staying below 2 °C remained low, at 17%. However, the chance of the most catastrophic climate change, above 3 °C, has gone down substantially, from 26% to 9%.

 For over fifty years, the Landsat satellite series has provided continuous and comprehensive data for monitoring changes on the Earth's terrestrial surface. Eight successive missions, carrying progressively more sophisticated sensors, with improved radiometric, geometric, and spatial characteristics, have provided an unbroken series of optical and thermal imagery, unparalleled globally. With limited lifetimes for each Landsat satellite, planning of each mission typically overlaps to ensure continuity. Commencing in 2021, planning of a Landsat-9 successor gathered user needs from across the Earth Observation (EO) community, resulting in the Landsat Next (LNext) mission design of three sun-synchronous satellites to acquire reflective and thermal wavelength observations with two to three times the temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of previous missions. Proposed 2026 U.S. budgets have significantly reduced NASA Earth Science funding. Alternate architectures are now being investigated for Landsat Next that would only meet Landsat-9 design requirements. While this would provide observation continuity, this implies a revised Landsat Next program launched in the early 2030s with nearly 30 year old capabilities, that may acquire data with lower radiometric quality than the current on-orbit Landsat-8 and 9 missions, and that will not support the new capabilities advocated for by the EO user community.

 Urban renewal has been elevated to a national strategy in China, leading to rapid development and transformation of street blocks. However, monitoring construction events at high temporal resolution remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods, which often struggle with noise interference and lack continuous monitoring capabilities. To address this, we propose Semantic Similarity Contrast-based Street Block Monitoring (SSC-SB), a method that leverages Sentinel-2 time series imagery for automated, high-frequency detection of street block development and renewal. By extracting deep semantic features with a pretrained encoder, SSC-SB analyzes similarity curves to identify development and demolition construction events. Applied to the Middle Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) urban agglomeration shows that SSC-SB achieves 90.4% spatial domain accuracy, with construction start and end date detection accuracies of 68.8% and 54.9%, respectively. Results indicate an increasing emphasis on urban renewal, as demolished street blocks outnumbered new developments for the first time in 2023, with Hunan Province leading in renewal efforts, where renewal blocks accounted for 41.5% of all changed street blocks, reflecting a balanced focus on expansion and infrastructure renewal. Transfer experiments in Xi’an further demonstrate that SSC-SB retains up to 80% of the performance of a locally trained model when applied across regions without fine-tuning, indicating a decent level of generalizability. By providing fine-grained, continuous monitoring, SSC-SB presents a scalable solution for tracking urban transformation."

 Retrieval of suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM) from remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) is useful for frequent and widespread monitoring of water quality. However, Rrs values vary not only with SPM but also with particle composition (organic-dominated or mineral-dominated) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), making it difficult to accurately estimate SPM in diverse aquatic environments using a single algorithm. In this study, two water type classification schemes: optical water type classification scheme and particle composition classification scheme, were integrated into a semi-analytical method to improve the accuracy of SPM estimation in various water bodies. By combining these two classification schemes, we classified water bodies around the world into 12 water types and developed an SPM estimation algorithm for each water type. Using 4,513 in situ Rrs-SPM measurements, the performance of the new SPM estimation algorithm was compared to that of 11 existing SPM estimation algorithms, and the results show that the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) was reduced from 51.3 to 58.9% to 43.2%.

 Black carbon (BC) aerosols are major climate-forcing agents and hazardous air pollutants that contribute to excess mortality in East Asia, yet their public health impacts and associated economic impacts remain under-evaluated in East China in the context of global warming. Here we assess BC pollution characteristics and associated health outcomes in Hangzhou, East China, during 2017. BC from fossil fuel (BCff) combustion dominated BC levels year-round, accounting for about 80 %, with additional regional contributions from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and from ship emissions in summer and autumn. High-pollution episodes were driven by intensified transportation emissions and unfavorable meteorological conditions, with vehicle type playing a critical role. The relative risk of mortality associated with BC exposure peaked in winter, with stronger effects observed for respiratory mortality than for cardiovascular mortality. We estimate that long-term exposure to BC in 2017 resulted in 1442 (95 % CI: 1314, 1561) all-cause deaths, 83 % of which were attributable to BCff, corresponding to an economic loss of 312 (95 % CI: 284, 338) million USD. Besides the regional transport influence, targeted emission reductions in fossil fuel consuming sectors, such as cleaner vehicle technologies and traffic or coal restrictions during pollution episodes in the city, could have substantially reduced mortality: a 50 % reduction in BC concentrations could have avoided 724 deaths and 157 million USD in economic losses, while a more stringent 80 % reduction could have prevented more than 1000 deaths and 216 million USD in losses.

This study investigates the effects of 13 parameters in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Double-Moment 6-class (WDM6) microphysics scheme, which define the hydrometeor characteristics such as fall velocity–diameter and mass–diameter relationships, as well as the shape parameter of the drop size distribution for precipitating particles such as rain, snow, and graupel on simulated winter precipitation. A comparison between the model's pre-defined parameters and observations from the International Collaborative Experiments for the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign reveals that the fall velocity–diameter relationship for rain, the mass–diameter relationships for snow and graupel, and the shape parameters for all precipitating particles in the WDM6 scheme deviate from the median values observed by the two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD). To quantify parameter sensitivities, a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of 256 simulations was conducted within parameter ranges constrained by 2DVD observations for three winter precipitation cases. Bayesian optimization was then applied to identify parameter sets that minimized the root mean square error (RMSE) for each case, achieving reductions of up to 30.2 %. These results demonstrate that ensemble-based uncertainty quantification and parameter optimization can help identify key parameters and provide a pathway to improving precipitation simulation performance.

The maximum RMSE difference reaches 14.4 % between optimal and worst validation configurations, highlighting systematic deficiencies in traditional validation approaches; (2) the EVPF framework, based on CNN-LSTM deep learning architecture, employs cyclical training using different stations as validation sets, effectively eliminating the “validation set gambling” phenomenon and achieving robust performance with RMSE = 8.14 mm d−1, MAE = 3.07 mm d−1, CC = 0.78, R2 = 0.60, POD = 0.88, FAR = 0.39, CSI = 0.57, ETS = 0.41, and HSS = 0.58; (3) there exist significant geographical differentiation patterns from spatial analysis. Coastal stations exhibit larger absolute errors but lower coefficients of variation with systematic error characteristics, while inland mountainous stations show smaller average errors but higher variability, reflecting complexity differences in precipitation mechanisms across diverse geographical environments; (4) the complex attention mechanisms and the Transformer architectures provide limited marginal benefits over the baseline CNN-LSTM framework, while data source ablation experiments confirm that all six precipitation products contribute meaningful information to the fusion process. The EVPF provides a novel methodological foundation for multi-source remote sensing data fusion, with significant application value for regional hydrological forecasting, agricultural decision-making, and disaster risk assessment."

Using a chemical transport model and measurements, it was found that the model underestimated organic particle concentrations. This was due to an underestimation of gases from domestic heating that form secondary organic particles. Improving the model by increasing these emissions and the particle formation led to better results, demonstrating the important role of heating emissions in winter. 
 Anthropogenic aerosol particles remain a significant air quality concern in central Europe, particularly during winter months. This study employs the chemistry transport model COSMO–MUSCAT (COnsortium for Small scale MOdelling coupled with the MUltiScale Chemistry Aerosol Transport) to investigate particulate matter sources, with a focus on emissions from residential heating. The model results are compared with winter measurements from one site in Germany and two sites in the Czech Republic, where solid fuels are commonly used for heating. A non-reactive tagging method tracking primary organic matter (OM) reveals a high contribution from residential heating. Although the magnitude and temporal changes of the model results mostly agree with total OM values at two measuring stations, it appears to underestimate measurements at a site in the central Czech Republic. This underestimation is partly attributed to the inadequate representation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) emitted from wood combustion. The study highlights the impact of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) on SOA formation, which are currently underrepresented in air quality models. Sensitivity tests adjusting SOA yields and AVOC emissions increase OM concentrations by up to 40 % at the measurement sites. These findings emphasise the need for accurate parameterisation of AVOC-derived SOA formation and residential heating emissions to better tackle wintertime air quality challenges in central Europe."

A novel deep learning approach is developed to classify rain, snow, and graupel, achieving 93 % accuracy in real-world observations. The model remains robust to camera parameter variations and maintains reliable performance at wind speeds below 5 m s−1, demonstrating strong potential for large-scale practical applications. 
 Urban surveillance cameras offer a valuable resource for high spatiotemporal resolution observations of near surface precipitation type (SPT), with significant implications for sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and meteorology. However, distinguishing between common SPT – rain, snow, and graupel – present considerable challenges due to their visual similarities in surveillance videos. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing both daytime and nighttime videos, leveraging meteorological, optical, and imaging principles to identify distinguishing features for each SPT. Considering both computational accuracy and efficiency, a new deep learning framework is proposed. It leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNet V2 for spatial feature extraction and incorporates a Gated Recurrent Unit network to model temporal dependencies between video frames. Using the newly developed 94 h SPT Surveillance Video (SPTV) dataset, the proposed model is trained and evaluated alongside 24 comparative algorithms. Results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.9677 on the SPTV dataset, outperforming all other relevant algorithms. Furthermore, in real-world experiments, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.9301, as validated against manually corrected Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer measurements. It remains robust against variations in camera parameters, maintaining consistent performance in both daytime and nighttime conditions, and demonstrates wind resistance with satisfactory results when wind speeds are below 5 m s−1. These findings highlight the model's suitability for large-scale, practical deployment in urban environments. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using low-cost surveillance cameras to build an efficient SPT monitoring network, potentially enhancing urban precipitation observation capabilities in a cost-effective manner."

The current was built up earthward of the pre‐existing X‐line formed prior to the previous substorm activation 45 min before. The most pronounced effect of the tail reconfiguration at the moments of two substorm activations and the current disruption is the rapid earthward redistribution of the magnetic flux.

However, building a geometry like the real magnetopause in laboratory remains a key challenge. Here, we present the first laboratory experiment at the Space Plasma Environment Research Facility trying to replicates Earth's magnetopause configuration. Using a dipole magnet (mimicking magnetosphere) and coaxial flux cores (simulating solar wind), we establish a magnetopause‐like current sheet via dynamic plasma compression.

Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we identify Eastern Pacific and Modoki ENSO as the two leading modes most relevant to the pattern effect at interannual timescales. These ENSO variants exhibit distinct radiative signatures due to subtle shifts in the location of SST anomalies relative to the climatological warm pool. Furthermore, analysis of individual ENSO events indicates that each event has a unique radiative signature depending on its evolving spatial structure.

Under conditions of unstable stratification, the water vapor is lifted to the condensation level, promoting the formation of stratocumulus clouds. Conversely, in summer, evaporation is suppressed due to stable stratification, which hinders vertical vapor transport. Enhanced dry advection reduces the transport of water vapor, leading to a decrease in the amount of stratocumulus clouds during summer.

 Reliable tidal wetland maps are crucial for coastal monitoring. However, the inherent spatiotemporal variability and dynamic flooding patterns of tidal wetlands pose substantial challenges to conventional remote sensing classification approaches. While deep learning approaches show promise for accurate mapping when sufficient training data exist, large-scale applications face sample scarcity issues. In this paper, given the challenges posed by the complexity of tidal wetland formation and succession on sample quantity and quality, we propose a point-sample-driven tidal wetland mapping method based on debiased sampling and noise-resistant learning. Historical point samples are first converted into pixel-wise pseudo-labels to train a deep learning classifier. To alleviate sample selection bias, covariate statistical features are explicitly modeled, ensuring that the generated pseudo-labels better reflect the true spatial distribution of tidal wetlands. To mitigate semantic errors in pseudo-labels, confusion probabilities between tidal wetland categories are incorporated as prior knowledge, enabling the identification and suppression of label noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested across the tidal regions of Asia, covering a coastline of approximately 3,800,000 km2 and achieving an extraction accuracy of 85 %. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing approaches, yielding substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

 Sea ice indices such as sea ice concentration (SIC) play a key role in monitoring climate change. However, it does not fully capture the vulnerability of sea ice to melting, especially under conditions of floe fragmentation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel metric—the floe fragmentation index (FFI)—designed to quantify the degree of fragmentation of sea ice. We constructed the FFI reference map using high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery based on k-means clustering and manual editing. This reference was then paired with AMSR2 passive microwave data to train three machine learning models—gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR)—enabling consistent, daily mapping of FFI across the Arctic. FFI increases as sea ice becomes more fragmented. Even under identical SIC conditions (e.g., 50%), the reference FFI captured distinct differences in floe structure, demonstrating its ability to represent fragmentation more explicitly than SIC. In comparison with the reference FFI derived from Sentinel-2, the gradient boosting model demonstrated the best performance, with an R2 exceeding 0.94 and a root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.22. Since RMSE was computed against the reference FFI, it is expressed in the same unit as FFI, which is dimensionless. To examine differences between SIC and FFI under relatively stable sea ice conditions, we focused on the Laptev Sea—a region where import and export of sea ice are minimal in summer. At the point of sea ice disappearance within this area, no early signs were observed in SIC, whereas FFI did reveal such signals. In particular, under conditions where the sea ice was highly fragmented and thus more likely to drift away or melt, SIC remained close to 100%, while FFI captured the relatively severe fragmentation of the sea ice. The time-series comparison between the FFI and SIC revealed that a rapid increase in FFI, highly exceeding its seasonal tendency, was followed by or occurred simultaneously with a rapid decrease in SIC, which also exceeded twice the magnitude of its seasonal tendency. Ultimately, the FFI complemented SIC by capturing fragmentation changes, potentially allowing earlier detection of SIC change in the melting seasons."

 Understanding human adaptive behavior and community resilience during typhoons is essential for developing human-centered disaster mitigation strategies. However, research on cross-city community responses and dynamic resilience during typhoons remains limited. This study examines communities’ mobility responses and resilience patterns during Typhoon Doksuri in 2023 using anonymized mobile data from 3.7 million users across six coastal cities of Fujian, China. The study developed a novel Disturbance-Response-Recovery (DRR) framework for assessing dynamic resilience that integrates disaster hazard factors with mobility patterns during typhoons, offering more specific and empirical grounded insights. The results demonstrate rapid pre-disaster response and post disaster recovery in Fujian: 70% of communities responded within two days before landfall, community mobility intensity dropped by 80% on the landfall day, and 90% of communities recovered within three days post-impact. Pre-disaster community response variations were significantly associated with early warnings, typhoon track proximity, localized rainfall and wind intensity and historical typhoon experience, while recovery dynamic disparities were significantly predicted by rainfall, economic capacity (GDP) and road density. The results further revealed a significant spatial clustering pattern of community resilience that correlated with geographical location, disaster progression, and economic levels. Inland communities’ heightened sensitivity to disturbances, urban communities and towns that endured heavy rainfall demonstrated enhanced recovery capacity, and communities with lower economic status showed both higher sensitivity and lower recovery capacity. These findings provide valuable references for improving community resilience and optimizing disaster management strategies."

 Traditional manual inspections for urban water supply network leak detection face challenges such as high costs, low efficiency, and limited coverage. Microwave remote sensing technology, offering a wide detection range and high operational efficiency, has emerged as a promising approach for large-scale leakage detection. However, in complex urban environments, existing microwave-based methods often struggle to effectively extract distinctive features of leakage-induced anomalies, thereby limiting detection accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Multi-feature Deep Fusion Leakage Detection Network (MDFLD-Net) that integrates backscatter intensity, polarimetric decomposition, and closure phase features—complementary observables that mitigate surface disturbances and enhance sensitivity to leakage-related soil moisture anomalies. The network employs multi-scale feature extraction modules (MSFE) to hierarchically capture both local details and global semantic patterns, abnormal frequency extraction modules (AFE) to capture the key frequency-domain characteristics of leakage, and deformable convolution modules (DC) in the fusion stage to refine spatial adaptability. Experimental results show that MDFLD-Net achieves a leakage identification accuracy of 86.3%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in leakage detection."

 Drought remains the most widespread and debilitating climate hazard in Africa, which threatens food safety and socio-ecological stability across the continent. Traditional drought monitoring systems, however, typically never register the dynamic evolution of drought episodes, which can extend between areas and amplify effects downstream. This study proposes a new Multivariate Drought Index Fusion (MDIF) that, apart from merging different drought indicators, mainly tracks the spatiotemporal trajectory of mobile drought fronts across Africa from 2000 to 2024. Avoiding the shortcomings of static drought maps, this approach offers a dynamic presentation of drought propagation patterns required for timely warning and management. Through the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), MDIF integrates multiple drought indicators, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), precipitation, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), into a fused, highly reliable, meteorological-ecological sensitivity drought index. The MDIF exhibited significant correlations with SPI-3 (r = 0.72–0.84), particularly across arid and semi-arid regions, and with VHI (r = 0.76–0.87), further underscoring its robustness in capturing both meteorological and ecological drought conditions. The findings indicate the Horn of Africa as a long-term drought hotbed, with severe events during 2006, 2011, 2017–2019, and 2022–2023, while Southern Africa experienced severe multi-year droughts from 2014 to 2017. Our tracking analysis, for the first time, indicates a dominant northeast-to-southwest trajectory of drought fronts over sub-Saharan Africa.

 Atmospheric black carbon (BC) substantially influences on both regional environments and human health. Yet, research on BC in Central Asia remains scarce. Here, we report on a 3-year-long online BC monitoring campaign conducted in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. Our analysis delves into the seasonal and diurnal variations of BC, and its associated health risks. The results reveal an average atmospheric BC concentration of 3462 ± 3458 ng m−3 in Dushanbe, with a distinct seasonal pattern—concentrations peak in winter and are comparatively lower in spring and summer. BC displays a consistent diurnal variation at different season, marked by a pronounced double-peak phenomenon. Local emissions primarily drive the BC levels and variations in Dushanbe's atmosphere. Our health risk assessment indicates that BC exposure poses differential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks to adults and children, with winter presenting significantly higher health risks than other seasons. Additionally, BC exposure can elevate mortality rates via multiple pathways. These findings underscore the severity of atmospheric BC pollution in Dushanbe and its heightened health risks to local inhabitants, particularly during winter. Consequently, the local government should pay more attention to BC emission reduction and associated governance initiatives."

 Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) are a very high-priority air pollutant group as they pose serious threats to human and environmental health. Most of the PCDD/F research studies have been carried out in urban and industrial areas where these pollutants are expected to be in high concentrations. There are few studies conducted in suburban areas worldwide, especially in Türkiye. In this study, a sampling campaign covering 12 months (June 2022–June 2023) was conducted in a suburban area in Bursa, Türkiye, to address this gap. The total average concentration was found to be 22.6 ± 3.21 fg I-TEQ/m3. This value was found to be comparable to the results reported for suburban and rural areas worldwide. The influence of the seasonal effect on concentrations was seen as a strong negative correlation (r = −0.84, p < 0.001) was observed between total concentration values and temperature. A negative correlation was found between low chlorinated congener gas phase concentrations and inverse ambient temperature using Clausius-Clapeyron. In the study, the performance of 7 different gas/particle partitioning models was evaluated. It was aimed to investigate the factors affecting the gas/particle partitioning of PCDD/Fs by using models based on different parameters. According to their performance, the models were ranked as Harner-Bidleman ≈ Dachs-Eisenreich > Li-Ma-Yang > Junge-Pankow ≈ pp-LFER > QSPR > mp-pp-LFER. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the main pollutant source in the region is traffic emissions.

 Surface air temperature and precipitation in glacial regions directly affect glacial physical processes and mass balance. Significant efforts have been made to explain the response of glaciers to climate change, but their impact on regional climate has been overlooked. In this study, temperature and precipitation trends between glacial and nonglacial regions of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1979 to 2022 were compared using measured and reanalysis data, and the effects of glaciers on regional climate change were examined. The results are as follows: (1) The overall warming trend across the TP is 0.33 °C/decade, with glacial regions (0.30 °C/decade) exhibiting a slightly lower rate than nonglacial regions at similar elevations (0.32 °C/decade), particularly in summer. (2) The precipitation trend over the entire TP is 14.40 mm/decade, with values for glacial regions (11.75 mm/decade) exceeding those for nonglacial regions (10.90 mm/decade) at similar elevations. (3) The upward latent heat flux in glacial regions (9.82 W/m2) significantly exceeds that in nonglacial regions (9.12 W/m2), whereas the sensible heat flux in glacial regions (11.30 W/m2) is markedly lower than that in nonglacial regions (13.40 W/m2). Therefore, more energy is consumed in glacier ablation and the increase in ice temperature, further leading to a slower air temperature trend. (4) The glacier effect leads to stronger water vapour convergence in glacial regions, resulting in a greater precipitation trend in glacial regions than in nonglacial regions. However, enhanced glacier winds during summer lead to anomalous precipitation change characteristics in glacial regions. This study highlights the importance of considering glacier effects in regional climate studies."

 Rainfall is a vital component of the hydrological cycle, characterized by its variability. Research shows that factors such as wind influence the raindrop fall speed (vf), forcing deviations from theoretical estimates (vt). This study examines rainfall measurements collected using PWS100 disdrometers from 2015 to 2019 at two locations in Mexico (one near the Pacific coast and another in Central Mexico), focusing on how horizontal wind intensity (w, measured with a WindSonic4 anemometer) affects vf for raindrops with diameters (D) between 0.8 and 6 mm. Coastal data includes measurements collected during the passage of tropical cyclones over the sampling area. The data comparison between PWS100 and rain gauges when w > 10 m s−1 exhibits significant biases, underscoring instrumental limitations by wind distortion. Findings indicate that average vf decreases compared to vt as wind intensity increases, but these differences are not statistically significant. The statistical and post-hoc outcomes for the vf standard deviation, used as a proxy of vf dispersion, demonstrate that w significantly affects vf, with the effect growing stronger as w intensity increases. Further, the w effect also varies with raindrop size. Small raindrops (D < 1 mm) show both super-terminal and sub-terminal behavior, whereas mid-sized and large drops (D > 1 mm) predominantly exhibit sub-terminal behavior. At coastal sites, the wind impact is more pronounced due to the higher air density and the greater wind energy pushing over the raindrops. These outcomes support the need for further research to incorporate wind effects into numerical modeling and remote sensing instrumentation."

 Using daily records from 18,370 rain gauges across Brazilian hydrometeorological networks spanning 1961 to 2024, we developed the BRazilian Daily (BRain-D) rainfall gridded dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1°. A key innovation of BRain-D compared to existing gridded datasets is its foundation on a strict automatic quality control procedure (A-QCP) designed to filter out Low-Quality (LQ) data based on the annual classification of records as either High-Quality (HQ) or Low-Quality (LQ). A confusion matrix was used to evaluate the method based on an independently assessed reference dataset in which 98.0 % of HQ series were identified. For application to Brain-D, approximately 14 % of LQ data records have been removed from the original dataset, with the remaining data interpolated to a regular grid. Cross-validation statistics revealed that BRain-D adequately represented daily rainfall, exhibiting Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.629, bias of 0.002 mm, root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.559 mm, and a critical success index (CSI) of 0.517. An analysis based on climatological normals from a Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) dataset for two reference periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2020) confirmed that BRain-D spatially represented long-term precipitation well. This was evidenced by R values higher than 0.972, absolute bias smaller than 6.3 mm, and RMSE lower than 22.3 mm when monthly-averaged values were compared. The methodological improvements implemented in BRain-D minimise the propagation of systematic errors found in previous gridded datasets, thereby contributing to a more robust and representative spatialisation of rainfall in Brazil with many potential applications."

Maher,Apparent Changes in Pacific Decadal Variability Caused by Anthropogenically Induced Mean State Modulations,"Pacific decadal variability (PDV), reflected in low‐frequency Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) changes, impacts global climate. Disentangling anthropogenic effects upon PDV is challenging because PDV and anthropogenic forcing vary on similar time scales. Using single‐forcing climate model large ensembles, we find that anthropogenic forcing drives a spatially varying pattern of mean‐state change in Pacific SST that projects onto PDV patterns, principally the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). When the trend is removed by subtracting the ensemble mean, there is no forced change of either PDV mode. However, analysis of individual ensemble members, where the mean‐state trend cannot be cleanly removed, yields apparent anthropogenic changes in PDO and NPGO decadal variability. This suggests that observed PDV responses to anthropogenic forcing may be erroneously convolved with the background trend pattern. Therefore, correctly determining the mean‐state trend is a necessary precursor for identifying possible forced changes to PDV."

HF lightning skywaves were detected at distances up to 3,300 km (potentially farther) during both day and night, with over 64% of events having peak currents below 50 kA. HF measurements revealed distinct temporal features of negative cloud‐to‐ground (CG) leaders, narrow bipolar events, and negative breakdown following positive return strokes. Unlike VLF and LF methods, which primarily capture current pulses along lightning channels, HF observations detect both transient and prolonged leader emissions. This provides more equal sensitivity to both in‐cloud (IC) and CG events, potentially benefiting IC/CG classification and studies of IC‐associated phenomena such as terrestrial gamma‐ray flashes. Ionospheric conditions may influence HF signal propagation but can be mitigated by observing the full HF band.

The main results show that the magnitude of the trends in the past century maximizes ∼±1% of the seasonal mean per decade. Analysis of the contributing factors reveals that geomagnetic secular variation primarily contributes to the trends over the American‐Atlantic sector, while increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) explain most trend patterns over the Asia‐Pacific region. Additional evidence by Wuhan ionosonde observations covering the period of 1947–2024, supports the simulated negative trend, and the magnitude agrees well with the simulations. Furthermore, our analysis of atmospheric tides revealed that the weakening of SE2 day‐to‐day variability due to increasing GHG levels is a plausible cause. Our findings thus indicate that ionospheric weather‐like variability also undergoes long‐term trends significantly under the climate change scenario."

Positive SST anomalies in tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) strengthen the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) via Gill‐type response (basical theory describing the atmospheric response to external forces such as tropical SST), enhancing moisture transport to southern China. The 10–30‐day intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) along the subtropical westerly jet initiates the event by inducing a low‐pressure and ascending motion over southern China. The 30–90‐day ISO along the polar front jet sustains the event by intensifying East Asian westerly jet and maintaining ascending motion over southern China. Furthermore, North Atlantic SST anomalies enhance North Atlantic jet stream, promoting downstream propagation of intraseasonal wave trains via energy conversion."

We observe a positive NAO‐like pattern over NAEM, which appears in December and shifts eastward through February. IOD further modulates precipitation by inducing changes in total precipitation, event frequency, and wet spell duration. The strength of the observed teleconnection is primarily significant in December. Additionally, we observe a reduction in cyclone activity in December over the East Atlantic and Western Mediterranean. These changes in cyclone track density are primarily driven by variations in the Eady Growth Rate, which are linked to enhanced vertical wind shear associated with a strengthened meridional temperature gradient over the NAEM. The results underscore a significant remote impact of the IOD on early winter hydro‐climate variability over the NAEM region, offering a potential value for improving sub‐seasonal to seasonal prediction."

We find that the global occurrence rate of FRs associated with BWIs is comparable with those from MR. Enhanced oxygen ion outflow fluxes and densities within most nightside BWI‐FRs suggest they predominantly originate from the dayside ionosphere/magnetosphere.

Here, we show the IOD's impact is asymmetric, with negative IOD events driving stronger, opposite climate anomalies to positive IOD events. Positive IOD modulates the local Hadley circulation and the South Asian High, establishing a lower‐level anticyclone over the AP. This anomalous circulation drives a dipole surface air temperature pattern (warmer south, slightly cooler north) via altered horizontal advection. It also suppresses southwestern AP precipitation through weakened ascent and reduced moisture influx. The stronger negative IOD response is attributed to distinct factors: for temperature, nonlinear advection and enhanced cloud‐radiation feedback; for precipitation, a “floor effect” from low mean‐state precipitation limits further drying during positive IOD. Clarifying these mechanisms provides a new framework for understanding and predicting climate in this vulnerable region."

 Wildfire extent and intensity are changing globally, driven by climate and socio-economic changes. Data across local to global scales are needed to support wildfire adaptation, yet comprehensive analysis of the main variables controlling multiple dimensions of wildfire risk including availability of global data for those variables is lacking. This review examines key variables influencing wildfire risk including fire danger (ignition and propagation), exposure and social and ecosystem vulnerability - the latter two often missing from fire risk analyses. We propose spatial and temporal requirements for these variables, a major gap in the literature, to support adaptation to future conditions. We assess which variables are monitored by national observation networks and evaluate the extent to which the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), traditionally used for climate system modeling, meet wildfire adaptation needs.We identified 30 key wildfire risk variables, 25 of which are represented by GCOS ECV products within 18 ECVs. Cross-product analysis showed most are relevant to multiple wildfire risk components (ignition, propagation, exposure, societal and ecological vulnerability) and that many relevant to fire danger (ignition and propagation) also inform exposure and vulnerability. Currently, 20 key variables are operationally monitored by space agency satellites, with global coverage at estimated temporal and/or spatial resolution available for at least half of variables in each risk component, except exposure. Future research directions and global observation needs to strengthen wildfire adaptation challenges are identified.

 Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serves as a valuable indicator for remote sensing of plant physiology. Recent studies have shown that far-red SIF at 761 nm (hereafter SIF) from mid spectral resolution (SR) imagers (3–7 nm full width half maximum (FWHM)) derived reliable fluorescence emission in relative levels. Such mid SR based SIF (SIFMS; the subscript MS refers to mid SR basis) has been extensively utilized for assessing fluorescence variability in precision agriculture and plant stress detection across various platforms. However, the uncertainties regarding the ability of SIFMS to detect physiological SIF yield (ΦF) remain inadequately investigated. Here, we evaluated various retrieval techniques (i.e., Fraunhofer line depth (FLD), its variant methods, and spectral fitting method (SFM)) under theoretical condition (SCOPE simulation), stress condition (DCMU experiment at field level and rice brown spot disease detection at drone level), and at airborne level employing mid SR (3–7 nm FWHM) and sub-nanometer SR (< 0.2 nm FWHM) sensors. Under theoretical conditions, the SIFMS derived from aFLD, 3FLD and SFM showed strong linear relationships with the simulated fluorescence at 761 nm (R2 > 0.9; RMSE <0.5 mW m−2 nm−1 sr−1). With data collected under stress conditions, however, only the SFM method captured the stress-induced physiological changes in the field-ΦFMS (p-value <0.05) and from the drone-ΦFMS (p-value <0.05; R2 = 0.51). SFM also produced a robust and clear map of airborne-SIFMS (SIFMS = 1.03 x SIFSN + 0.48 where the subscript SN refers to sub-nanometer SR). Conversely, 3FLD and aFLD methods yielded a limited ability to adequately detect the physiological changes in field-ΦFMS (p-value>0.05) and drone-ΦFMS (p-value <0.05; R2 ≤ 0.15) and exhibited a noticeable stripe noise in the airborne-SIFMS map. Our finding demonstrated that mid SR imagery with SFM has the potential to track crop ΦF changes induced by stresses."

However, due to limited historical records, it is difficult to anticipate the risks of unprecedented extreme rainfall episodes. In this study the UNSEEN method (UNprecedented Simulated Extremes using ENsembles) is applied for studying these events, by sampling large ensemble climate model simulations of Version 6 of the Met Office Global Seasonal Forecasting System (GloSea6). We first perform fidelity tests on gridboxes in Southeast China and show that the climate model can represent observations realistically. Probabilities of unprecedented Southeast China rainfall are then computed for each of the five gridboxes within Southeast China, revealing probabilities of about 6% (up to 9%) in summer. The circulation dynamics associated with such events is also examined. For gridboxes close to the western north Pacific, a strengthened western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) leads to anomalous low-level southerlies onshore to Southeast China, thereby contributing to heavy rainfall there. For gridboxes along 35° N, unprecedented events are often associated with an upper-level stationary wave pattern along the climatological jet, inducing vertical motion conducive to convection. For gridboxes along 25° N, extreme rainfall events are often associated with a southward shifted subtropical jet. Finally, the importance of the shifted jet and the WPSH strength in generating the unprecedented rainfall in the southern gridboxes along 25° N is also investigated. A southward-shifted jet could lead to extreme rainfall in the southern gridboxes even when the WPSH displacement is not strong. Overall, anomalous upper-level flow and WPSH activity can be equally important in triggering unprecedented summer rainfall in Southeast China. In short, we demonstrate that the UNSEEN method can be applied for estimating the risk of extreme monsoon rainfall in Southeast China and understanding the associated mechanisms."

However, leakage accounting for these practices often relies on limited analysis and ad hoc reasoning, leading to integrity concerns and underinvestment in CSF. This study proposes a data-intensive, dynamic economic-ecological modeling approach to estimating regional CSF leakage, with global applicability. Results show how leakage varies by CSF activity, location, forest type, timeframe, and implementation rate. Critically, we show that widely cited harvest leakage estimates ignore complex forest dynamics and are a poor proxy for the metric most applicable to CSF implementation: carbon leakage. While harvest leakage is nearly always positive, our results demonstrate that some project designs can result in beneficial carbon spillovers, or negative carbon leakage. These results improve the evidence base for robust leakage quantification in CSF-based projects, enabling more accurate accounting and thereby ensuring credible climate benefits. These results are relevant in a carbon markets context, where robust leakage accounting would help safeguard the credibility of ecosystem service payments, but are also applicable to traditional, non-carbon markets conservation projects seeking to quantify carbon mitigation impacts."

Here we develop a methodology to trace these compounds throughout the environment using a stringent concept to describe their fate consistently and comprehensively. Using an individual country as the system scale, the individual flows of reactive nitrogen compounds are characterized between and within eight pools reflecting human society, economic sectors and environmental spheres, also accounting for transboundary flows, to create a national nitrogen budget. The methodology has been devised for implementation by national agencies in conjunction with greenhouse gas or air pollution emission inventories, hence it links closely with the structures and data derived in these contexts. The guiding methodological principle is the mass conservation of reactive nitrogen, implemented as a material flow analysis that systematically describes all flows and stock changes. Embedding results obtained from five European countries demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. The major environmental pathways of reactive nitrogen compounds can be traced from industrial processes and agricultural production, including the agri-food chain, indicating levers for policy interventions. Spatial and temporal benchmarking of the results demonstrates comparisons between countries or over time. While further results of practical implementation are needed to assess overall robustness, the budget approach allows for multiple opportunities of data checks and verification to visualize the uncertainty associated to many input data, such as lacking information on nitrogen contents and specific flows, or the relevance of so-far unaccounted-for stocks of reactive nitrogen. Useful applications have been identified that link nitrogen budgets to impacts on human health as well as on ecosystems and the climate, indicating that developing and using national nitrogen budgets may shape improved and information-led policies."

 Airborne hazardous trace metals pose significant risks to human health. However, the response characteristics of ambient trace metals to emission reductions remain poorly understood. The COVID-19 pandemic offered a unique opportunity to investigate these response mechanisms and optimize emission control strategies. In this study, we employed the Global Modeling System for Chemistry (GEOS-Chem) chemical transport model to predict global variations in atmospheric concentrations of nine hazardous trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) and assess their responses to COVID-19 lockdown measures. Our results revealed that global average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and V decreased by 1 %–7 %, whereas Pb and Zn levels increased by 0.4 % and 2 %, respectively. The rise in Pb and Zn concentrations during lockdowns was primarily linked to sustained coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting activities, which remained essential for residential energy demands. Spatially, India, Western Europe (WE), and North America (NA) experienced the most pronounced declines in trace metal levels, while Sub-Saharan Africa (SS) and Australia showed minimal sensitivity to lockdown-induced emission reductions. Based on the scenario analysis, we found the concentrations of trace metals displayed linear response to emission reduction. Combined with the health risk assessment, we demonstrated the reduced emissions of Pb and As during the lockdown period yielded the greatest health benefits – Pb reductions were associated with lower non-carcinogenic risks, while As declines contributed most significantly to reduced carcinogenic risks. Targeting fossil fuel combustion should be prioritized in Pb and As mitigation strategies."

A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 complete time series at sites of tide gauge, which allows for direct statistical assessment. The average of our reconstructed global mean sea level shows strong agreements with other reconstructions. 
 Tide gauges record sea level changes along coastlines. They are widely used to determine the twentieth century global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. However, a major issue in tide gauge data is the presence of various, substantial, and sometimes persistent data gaps, which hinder our understanding of sea level rise, especially at regional and local scales. Whilst the GMSL reconstructions have been provided by several influential studies, reconstructions at the exact sites of tide gauges are rarely available. Here, we present sea level reconstructions at global 945 tide gauges, covering the period from 1900 to 2022. Our approach relies on a data assimilation technique that integrates various physical sea level observations and predictions, including sea level simulations from 35 climate models. A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 reconstructions at each site of tide gauge, providing continuous and refined sea level time series. This ensemble reconstruction allows for direct statistical assessments, e.g., average, median, spread, and percentile. The average of reconstructed sea level across 945 tide gauges reveals a GMSL rate of 1.75 ± 0.05 mm yr−1 over 1900–2020, and shows strong agreement with other GMSL reconstructions for both the curves of time series and overall trends. At local scale, our reconstructions are comparable to an independent reconstruction. Despite some rate differences at certain locations, the reconstructed sea level trends closely follow the raw records when they are available, emphasizing the importance of the observations at tide gauges. Our sea level reconstructions offer a valuable resource for improving global and regional sea level projections, validating climate model performance, and informing coastal adaptation strategies through understanding the sea level rise over the past century.

This study provides a new, twenty-year dataset of pH measurements from the North Atlantic, resulting from the correction and reevaluation of historical and recent pH measurements that had methodological-derived bias. This revised dataset supports accurate reassessment of pH trends and carbon variables, under novel and updated methodological standards. 
 The North Atlantic (NA) GO-SHIP A25 OVIDE-BOCATS section is a long-term repeat hydrographic transect extending from Portugal to Greenland. Since 2002, physical and biogeochemical measurements have been carried out biennially along the OVIDE-BOCATS section, contributing to a better understanding of water mass properties, mixing, circulation, carbon storage, and climate change impacts such as ocean acidification (OA) in the NA. In particular, the high-precision pH measurements on the total hydrogen ion scale (pHT) from the OVIDE-BOCATS program represent a key milestone in monitoring OA in this particularly climate sensitive region. The method used for pHT determination relies on adding meta-cresol purple (mCP) dye to the seawater sample and spectrophotometrically measuring its absorbances at specific wavelengths. The OVIDE-BOCATS program has used unpurified mCP dye, which impurities have been proven to bias pHT values. Here we quantified the bias induced by these impurities in pHT measurements. We found that measurements carried out using the unpurified mCP dye tend to be, on average, 0.011 ± 0.002 pHT units higher than those obtained using the purified mCP dye, with this difference slightly decreasing at higher pHT values. Moreover, we tested independent methods to correct the effect of impurities in both the historical and recent OVIDE-BOCATS pHT data, demonstrating that the correction is consistent across methods. The long-term pHT dataset has been updated to include newly acquired data and absorbance measurements, and to standardize corrections for mCP dye impurities. This effort results in a twenty-year dataset of pHT corrected for mCP dye impurities, that demonstrates the possibility of a global effort to improve the reliability and coherency of spectrophotometric pHT measurements made with unpurified mCP dye. The corrections applied to our pHT dataset have negligible implications for the OA rates previously reported, but they do affect the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon, implying a shoaling of approximately 150 m."

Watts;Annett Bartsch,A satellite-based ice fraction record for small water bodies of the Arctic Coastal Plain,"Ice cover on small water bodies is highly sensitive to climate change and influences ecosystems, water, and the carbon cycle. We produced a satellite-based ice fraction dataset for small water bodies on the Arctic Coastal Plain from 2017 to 2023. The dataset captures freeze-up and break-up timing and reveals spatial variability. It will support studies of climate–ice interactions and improve models of water and carbon processes. 
 Ice cover of water bodies in the northern high latitudes (NHL) is highly sensitive to the changing climate, and its dynamics exert substantial impacts on the NHL ecosystems, hydrological processes, and the carbon cycle. Yet, operational quantification of ice cover dynamics for smaller water bodies (e.g., ≤ 25 km²) over vast, remote NHL regions remains limited. Here, we developed an ice fraction dataset for small water bodies (900 m² to 25 km²) across the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska (ACP) from 2017 through 2023, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, texture features, and Daymet air temperature data. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of approximately 6 days. Compared with the Google Dynamic World (DW) product derived from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing, our dataset shows high consistency with DW (R = 0.91, RMSE = 0.19) while having enhanced temporal coverage due to less SAR constraints from solar illumination, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. Validation against in-situ observations suggests that our dataset is more capable of capturing small water body ice phenology (e.g., freeze-up and break-up dates) relative to DW, with an 11-day reduction in mean absolute error. Our ice fraction dataset reveals high spatial heterogeneity in ice conditions mainly occurring in June for small water bodies across the ACP. The ice phenology analysis over three selected subregions further shows that a warmer transition period generally leads to earlier ice break-up and later freeze-up, while the responses of ice fraction to warming climate vary among and within individual water bodies. The resulting dataset is anticipated to fill a gap in ice phenology studies for small water bodies, improve our understanding on the interactions between ice dynamics and climate change, and enhance the coupled modelling of ice and carbon processes.

We created the first long-term record of these glaciers and their lakes from 1990 to 2022 by analyzing satellite images. Our results show that many glaciers are shrinking while their lakes are growing. These changes matter because they affect water supply, flood risks, and mountain landscapes. This dataset offers new knowledge to support research and planning for climate change impacts. 
 Lake-terminating glaciers (LTGs) typically exhibit higher rates of retreat and thinning compared to land-terminating glaciers. However, a comprehensive inventory for LTGs and their associate proglacial lakes across High Mountain Asia (HMA) is currently lacking, limiting further understanding of their spatial heterogeneity in glacier change. This study employs a semi-automated identification method, coupled with rigorous visual inspection, to construct a comprehensive inventory of LTGs and proglacial lakes in HMA for 1990 and 2022. Our data indicate that, by 2022, HMA hosted 1740 LTGs (5082.08 ± 13.15 km²), among which 667 glaciers (3454.59 ± 12.43 km²) remained in contact with proglacial lakes since 1990, 1073 (1627.49 ± 4.30 km²) are newly developed and 468 (960.13 ± 3.18 km²) had disconnected from proglacial lakes during the investigation period.

Natali,ABCFlux v2: Arctic–boreal CO2 and CH4 monthly flux observations and ancillary information across terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems,"This dataset includes monthly measurements of carbon dioxide and methane exchange between land, water, and the atmosphere from over 1,000 sites in Arctic and boreal regions. It combines measurements from a variety of ecosystems, including wetlands, forests, tundra, lakes, and rivers, gathered by over 260 researchers from 1984–2024. This dataset can be used to improve and reduce uncertainty in carbon budgets in order to strengthen our understanding of climate feedbacks in a warming world. 
 Measurements of surface-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes have been relatively sparse across the Arctic tundra and boreal biomes, causing significant uncertainties in carbon budget estimates from the region. While the availability of Arctic-boreal carbon flux data has increased substantially over the past decade, the data have remained spread across different repositories, scientific articles, and unpublished sources, making it difficult to leverage. Here we present a new dataset of monthly Arctic-boreal carbon fluxes (ABCFlux v2) across terrestrial (wetlands and uplands) and freshwater (lakes and rivers) ecosystems compiled from previous syntheses including the Arctic-boreal CO2 flux database (ABCFlux v1), the Boreal-Arctic Wetland and Lake Methane Dataset (BAWLD-CH4), and the Global River Methane Database (GRiMeDB). In addition, we consider data from general-purpose (e.g., Zenodo) and flux network repositories, literature, and site principal investigators. The dataset includes surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), alongside CH4 fluxes. For aquatic ecosystems, we split CH4 fluxes into diffusive and ebullitive flux pathways, and included potential emissions from transient storage in the water column (“storage fluxes”), alongside CO2 and CH4 concentrations dissolved in the surface water. Fluxes are measured through a variety of methods including chamber and eddy covariance techniques alongside bubble traps, ice-surveys, and concentration-based turbulence-driven modelling in aquatic ecosystems. The monthly flux data are reported together with supporting methodological and environmental metadata. The resulting ABCFlux v2 has 23,656 flux site-months, 8,182 concentration site-months, and 199 seasonal observations from 1,024 sites, and includes 55,560 reported fluxes (i.e. sum of GPP, Reco, NEE, and CH4 fluxes) from the years 1984 to 2024. The majority of monthly observations occurred after 1999. Wetlands had the highest number of site-month observations (8,641), followed by boreal forest (6,981), lotic ecosystems (6,275), lentic ecosystems (3,725) and upland tundra (3,308). Measurements of CO2 dominated the dataset across most ecosystem types (25,101) except for lentic ecosystems, where CH4 flux site-months (3,024) were more frequent than CO2 flux site-months (2,858). Overall, ABCFlux v2 includes 158 % more site-months for terrestrial CO2 flux data compared to ABCFlux v1. Integrating and updating BAWLD-CH4 flux data from growing season averages to monthly fluxes resulted in 5,671 site-months of chamber CH4 data compared to 762 site-years. This collaborative initiative, involving contributions from over 260 researchers, provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the Arctic-boreal carbon flux network and its data, and serves as an important step in reducing uncertainties in Arctic-boreal carbon budgets and in enhancing our understanding of climate feedbacks.

New spatial verification metrics like the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) perform better but are difficult to use in a global domain due to large computational cost. We introduce two new global smoothing methodologies that can be used with smoothing-based metrics in a global domain. We demonstrate their effectiveness with an analysis of global precipitation forecasts. 
 Forecast verification plays a crucial role in the development cycle of operational numerical weather prediction models. At the same time, verification remains a challenge as the traditionally used non-spatial forecast quality metrics exhibit certain drawbacks, with new spatial metrics being developed to address these problems. Some of these new metrics are based on smoothing, with one example being the widely used Fraction Skill Score (FSS) and its many derivatives. However, while the FSS has been used by many researchers in limited area domains, there are no examples of it being used in a global domain yet. The issue is due to the increased computational complexity of smoothing in a global domain, with its inherent spherical geometry and non-equidistant and/or irregular grids. At the same time, there clearly exists a need for spatial metrics that could be used in the global domain as the operational global models continue to be developed and improved, along with the new machine-learning-based models. Here, we present two new methodologies for smoothing in a global domain that are potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible. Both approaches also consider the variability of grid point area sizes and can handle missing data appropriately. This, in turn, makes the calculation of smoothing-based metrics, such as FSS and its derivatives, in a global domain possible, which we demonstrate by evaluating the performance of operational high-resolution global precipitation forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts."

However, our understandings of the ASC variability and its driving mechanisms remain limited due to observational constraints in the Antarctic region. This study investigates the seasonal variability of the ASC in the Cosmonaut Sea, East Antarctica, focusing on the observed spring weakening of the ASC and its underlying mechanisms. The spring weakening of the ASC is shown to be linked to reduced wind‐driven poleward Ekman transport, which induces a seesaw shift in sea surface height and a subsequent adjustment in the isopycnal structure across the continental slope.

While waves ranging from below the ion cyclotron frequency to above the electron plasma frequency are commonly observed near reconnection sites, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves—frequent in other plasma environments—have been rarely observed in the reconnection region. Here, we report the first detection of EMIC waves in a magnetic reconnection exhaust at Earth's magnetopause. The free energy required for EMIC wave growth was supplied by the strong perpendicular‐to‐parallel temperature anisotropy of hot proton beams. This proton temperature anisotropy was generated by magnetopause reconnection, rather than inherited from the magnetosheath. Our findings differ from previous reports of parallel‐preferential proton heating during magnetopause reconnection, calling for revised theoretical frameworks to reconcile observed perpendicular‐preferential heating with established reconnection paradigms."

We found there is little correlation between TC intensity and outer size forecast accuracy. Higher‐resolution models outperform coarser‐resolution models in intensity prediction but perform similarly for outer size regardless of resolution. Notably, the initial storm outer size may significantly influence the outer size forecast: initially larger storms may present greater challenges for accurate size prediction.

Here, we analyze the centennial‐ to millennial‐scale isotope variability of the Greenland ice cores NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 to investigate how their coherent signal and local noise have evolved over the last 100,000 years. We show that the noise systematically depends on the climate state, with higher levels under colder temperatures and lower accumulation rates. Most of the noise originates from local stratigraphic disturbances, while additional noise variability only emerges in the Greenland stadials. The remaining climate signal variability is higher in the last glacial period compared to the Holocene, but does not systematically differ between stadials and interstadials. We show that, by considering systematic changes of noise, it is possible to achieve more accurate estimates of past climate variability."

While plastic wear has been inferred as one of the dominant wear modes, the dynamic wear mechanism of plastic wear has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we explicitly present a series of nanoscale 3‐D plastic wear processes of α‐quartz asperities by using molecular dynamics method, where asperity climbing mode dominates during the sliding. We identify a transition from atom‐by‐atom wear damage to layer removal of α‐quartz asperities with increasing normal forces. Moreover, nanoscale wear volume evolution depends on the normal force and loading velocity and shows sublinear increase with loading distance.

Autocorrelation and natural migration profiles reveal a ∼3‐km‐wide fracture zone (WFZ), which we interpret as a legacy of long‐term slip on the NAF. The low Vs and structural complexity suggest the WFZ functions as a soft barrier. Hence, it could have contributed to arrest rupture propagation during the 1999 M7.6 Izmit earthquake, as well as partitioning stress between fault segments.

We found that areas with higher climate heterogeneity support greater vegetation adaptability and migration potential in response to changing climate conditions. Including climate heterogeneity in species distribution models clearly confirmed that climate heterogeneity promotes vegetation migration. Our results show that while rising temperatures generally limit vegetation migration, climate heterogeneity can help offset this effect by offering climatic refugia and expanding suitable habitat ranges.

Here we identify synoptic origins (referring to large‐scale weather patterns and the associated rainfall processes) of extreme floods by analyzing a large catalog of flood‐producing storms over the North China Plain. The most extreme floods are associated with a northward and westward extension of the Subtropical High, providing favorable synoptic conditions for predecessor rainfall processes, despite their relatively low frequency of occurrence.

Our new records from the Russian Far East, spanning 9–5 ka BP, fill this spatial gap and reveal a synchronous δ18O negative excursion and intensified monsoon precipitation between 8 and 9 ka BP, contrasting with trends in North China. We suggest this difference may stem from changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI) over the Holocene. The NHSI decrease since early Holocene weakens southwesterly winds and the Western Pacific Subtropical High, shifting the westerly jet and rainbelt southward. This causes reduced (increased) precipitation in North China (Northeast Asia), as well as reduced (increased) contribution of Pacific Ocean moisture to North China (Northeast Asia), resulting in δ18O increase (decrease) in North China (Northeast Asia)."

Their presence in the Triassic, alongside unrelated calcifying organisms, suggests a diversification of marine calcifying organisms after the end-Permian mass extinction. 
 Over geologic time, biocalcification – the process by which marine organisms make calcium carbonate (CaCO3) – has reshaped climates, ocean life, and seawater chemistry. In particular, the evolution of coccolithophores, the largest group of nannoplankton and today’s most productive calcifiers, transformed ocean environments and the carbon cycle. Their origins, however, remain enigmatic. This is partly because studying coccolithophore fossils traditionally requires CaCO3 preservation. Here, we bypass this limitation, searching for their ‘ghost’ fossils –imprints on organic matter. We present coccolithophores from ~241-million-year-old (Triassic) rocks, predating previous records by ~26 million years (myrs). The >100 ghost fossils, exceptionally preserved within zooplankton faeces, show that coccolithophores, nannoplankton, ‘modern’ eukaryotic phytoplankton, and planktonic biocalcification evolved earlier than previously thought. Coccolithophores now first appear alongside stony corals and other unrelated calcifiers, suggesting a diversification of a range of marine calcifying organisms following Earth’s deadliest mass extinction, the end-Permian event. These findings indicate that coccolithophore diversity remained remarkably low for ~50 myrs, until after the end-Triassic mass extinction, showing that both Triassic-bookending extinctions were critical in their evolution. Our discoveries elucidate the evolutionary origins of coccolithophores, but also highlight the role mass extinctions have played in shaping life on Earth.

The authors develop a fluorinated polymer electrolyte with tailored Li–F/O coordination that decouples ion conduction from polymer relaxation, enabling stable Li metal cell operation from −50 to 70 °C. 
 Polymer-based solid-state batteries operable across broad temperatures are critical for advanced energy storage but face limitations from sluggish ion transport kinetics in polymer electrolytes. Here, we develop a fluorinated quasi-solid polymer electrolyte that balances weak Li⁺-polymer interactions with efficient salt dissociation. This electrolyte was fabricated by in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl acrylate. The incorporation of -CF2- groups within 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl acrylate promotes the formation a fluorine-oxygen co-coordination structure that decouples ion conduction from polymer relaxation. This mechanism creates more efficient Li⁺ transport pathways along polymer chains and surrounding solvent molecules, promoting uniform Li⁺ flux at the Li metal electrode interface. Consequently, the electrolyte exhibits 0.27 mS cm−1 conductivity at −40 °C, enabling 10 C rates and operation from −50 to 70 °C in Li | |LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells.

Here, authors use these sequences in a proteomic search method called “signal strapping” to discover metalloproteins, which have an N-terminal histidine that chelates a transition metal ion. 
 Metalloprotein discovery is often made post hoc, in which activity studies following protein isolation reveal a metal-ion dependence. Herein we take a different approach to finding metalloproteins, by building on the discovery of copper-containing lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which include an N-terminal histidine as part of their sequence. This residue acts as a natural chelator for transition metal ions, irrespective of the structure of the protein. We report the method of signal strapping, where sequences of N-terminal signal peptides artificially appended with a histidine residue at their C-terminus are used to bootstrap a proteomic search. These searches return sequences of proteins with an N-terminal histidine capable of coordinating a metal ion. We exemplify the approach by the discovery and characterisation of four classes of bacterial metalloproteins, including two that we denote as anglerases reflecting their potential to capture transition metal ions from the bacterial environment. Signal peptide sequences appear in secreted proteins.

 A common mechanism by which cancer cells acquire resistance to chemotherapeutics is through the overexpression of efflux pumps, enabling the removal of cytotoxic agents, such as anthracycline drugs. However, platinum anticancer agents that crosslink DNA and interact with proteins are poor efflux pump substrates. Here, we design dual warhead drug conjugates by tethering a platinum pharmacophore to the doxorubicin backbone. These drug conjugates retain the anticancer activity of anthracyclines and exhibit the ability to both circumvent drug efflux and delay the acquisition of drug resistance. In vivo experiments demonstrate that such drug conjugates extend survival in a preclinical organoid-based model of metastatic colon cancer in mice. Mechanistic studies indicate that these drug conjugates overcome resistance through covalent platinum-protein interactions, leading to significantly improved drug retention and alteration of subcellular drug distribution. This application of platinum offers many opportunities to confront issues related to chemoresistance and alternative pathways for augmenting conventional chemotherapeutics.

Here, authors employ evolutionary molecular dynamics simulations to explore interactions driven by linear protein sequences, challenging the predictive power of traditional cholesterol-binding motifs. 
 The existence of linear cholesterol-recognition motifs in transmembrane domains has long been debated. Evolutionary molecular dynamics (Evo-MD) simulations—genetic algorithms guided by (coarse-grained) molecular force-fields–reveal that thermodynamic optimal cholesterol attraction in isolated alpha-helical transmembrane domains occurs when multiple consecutive lysine/arginine residues flank a short hydrophobic segment. These findings are supported by atomistic simulations and solid-state NMR experiments. Our analyses illustrate that linear motifs in transmembrane domains exhibit weak binding affinity for cholesterol, characterized by sub-microsecond residence times, challenging the predictive value of linear CRAC/CARC motifs for cholesterol binding. Membrane protein database analyses suggest even weaker affinity for native linear motifs, whereas live cell assays demonstrate that optimizing cholesterol binding restricts transmembrane domains to the endoplasmic reticulum post-translationally. In summary, these findings contribute to our understanding of cholesterol-protein interactions and offer insight into the mechanisms of protein-mediated cholesterol regulation within membranes. Cholesterol plays a key role in membrane biology. Here, authors employ evolutionary molecular dynamics simulations to explore interactions driven by linear protein sequences, challenging the predictive power of traditional cholesterol-binding motifs."

With spatially explicit data, researchers show how the so-called carbon hoofprint varies between cities due to the different carbon intensities of producing regions. 
 Meat consumed in cities is largely produced in rural regions. Supply chain opacity and complexity hinder understanding of (and the ability to address) the distributed impacts of urban meat consumption on rural communities and environments. Here we combine supply chain models with spatial carbon accounting to quantify and map the GHG emissions from beef, chicken and pork consumption—the carbon hoofprint—for all 3,531 cities in the contiguous USA. This carbon hoofprint totals 329 MtCO2e, equivalent to emissions from US at-home fossil fuel combustion. Surprising differences in the carbon intensity of meat-producing regions explain variation in per capita hoofprints between cities (500–1,731 kgCO2e). Demand-side measures such as reducing food waste and dietary shifts (for example, more chicken, less beef) could halve emissions. Our modelling highlights reduction strategies across the supply chain and provides a basis to address the transboundary impacts of cities. Meat products represent a large share of the carbon footprints of cities, which are dependent on the characteristics of supply regions. With spatially explicit data, researchers show how the so-called carbon hoofprint varies between cities due to the different carbon intensities of producing regions."

 Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, fluctuate on timescales of seconds to hours. Harnessing such intermittent energy to drive chemical synthesis represents a major challenge, as conventional 3d-block metal catalysts are prone to degradation even under small variations in operating potential. Here we report an electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction system that is tolerant to voltage fluctuations through the design of catalytic pathways. By leveraging the redox chemistry of manganese oxide, we integrated the Guyard reaction (4Mn2+ + Mn7+ → 5Mn3+) as a regeneration pathway into the catalytic cycle. Unlike other 3d-block metal catalysts, which rapidly degrade under fluctuating conditions, the constructed manganese oxide system shows resilience to voltage fluctuations by alternating between decomposition and regeneration. When the voltage is switched between 1.68 and 3.00 V repeatedly, the catalyst can maintain an oxygen evolution reaction at pH 2 for more than 2,000 h, highlighting the importance of pathway design for sustainable energy conversion from intermittent renewable sources.

 With climate change-induced sea ice decline in the Arctic Ocean, nitrogen is expected to become an increasingly important determinant of primary productivity. Nitrogen fixation is the conversion of molecular nitrogen to bioavailable ammonium by microorganisms called diazotrophs. Here, we report nitrogen fixation rates, diazotroph composition, and expression under different stages of declining sea ice in the Central Arctic Ocean (multiyear ice, five stations) and the Eurasian Arctic (marginal ice zone, seven stations). Nitrogen fixation in the Central Arctic Ocean was positively correlated with primary production, ranging from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 2.5 ± 0.87 nmol N L−1 d−1. Along two transects across the marginal ice zone, nitrogen fixation varied between days and ice regime from below detection up to 5.3 ± 3.65 nmol N L−1 d−1 associated with an ice-edge phytoplankton bloom.

 Giant magnetofossils are unusual, micron-sized biogenic magnetite particles found in sediments dating back at least 97 million years. Their distinctive morphologies are the product of biologically controlled mineralisation, yet the identity of their biomineralising organism, and the biological function they serve, remain a mystery. It is currently thought that the organism exploited magnetite’s mechanical properties for protection. Here we explore an alternative hypothesis, that it exploited magnetite’s magnetic properties for the purpose of magnetoreception. We present a three-dimensional magnetic vector tomography study of a giant magnetofossil and assess its magnetoreceptive potential. Our results reveal a single magnetic vortex that displays an optimised response to spatial variations in the intensity of Earth’s magnetic field. This magnetic trait may have conferred an evolutionary advantage to mobile marine organisms, providing an upper age limit on the development of navigational magnetoreception and raising the possibility that earlier evidence of this sense may yet be preserved in the fossil record. More broadly, this work provides a blueprint for assessing the morphological and magnetic evidence for putative biogenic iron oxide particles, which are a key component in the search for early life on Earth and Mars.

 The 1458/59 CE volcanic event, among the largest in the last millennium, is primarily attributed to the Kuwae volcano in Vanuatu. However, a recent study suggests the Reclus volcano in southern Patagonia, Chile, as an alternative source. Here, we assess the hypothesis by examining unpolished, micron-sized glass shards from the 1458/59 CE cryptotephra in the Antarctic Vostok Station firn core. Results reveal a bimodal composition of dacitic and rhyolitic shards, linked to Kuwae and Reclus, respectively. Antarctic ice core records also exhibit a two-stage pattern of ash deposition: coarse ash from nearby volcanoes followed by finer ash transported over long distances, implying concurrent eruptions. Nevertheless, discrepancies in composition between observed rhyolitic shards and existing Reclus data, combined with no recorded Reclus activity in the 1450 s, suggests the possibility of an undocumented extratropical rhyolitic source. This study underscores the value of glass shard analysis in identifying the origins of volcanic eruptions.

 Coral reefs, among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, face an existential threat from the increasing frequency and intensity of coral bleaching events driven by global warming. While much of the existing research examines bleaching as an isolated phenomenon, the critical threshold linking bleaching rates to long-term reef degradation remains poorly understood. Here we identified pivotal factors influencing coral bleaching rates at a global scale, leveraging a data-driven model integrating historical field observations with climate simulations across multiple emission scenarios. Our findings reveal a critical bleaching threshold of 7.9% annually, beyond which coral reef ecosystems would undergo significant degradation. Alarmingly, even under the most optimistic mitigation pathways, substantial degradation is projected across all major tropical marine regions by the end of the century. This study highlights the urgent need for bold and effective global policies to safeguard coral reef ecosystems and ensure their sustainability under an increasingly warming climate.

 Climate risks from compound extreme events are much greater than the sum of their sub-components. In early summer 2022, unprecedented rainstorm in South China and heatwave in North China were observed concurrently during 1979–2024 (referred to here as an SRNH event). However, most of seasonal predictions failed to capture this far-reaching SRNH event and the behind mechanisms are still unclear. The high-ranking dipole sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic (SSTNA) in February–March promoted the 2022 SRNH extreme, which was successfully verified by numerical experiments. The SSTNA, highest in the recent decade, triggered the Rossby wave train, leading to record-breaking East Asian subtropical jet stream and high-level key mid-tropospheric atmospheric circulations. An anomalous anticyclonic circulation was strengthened over the Altai Mountains and North China, causing heatwave in North China. The enhanced northeast China cold vortex stabilized the western Pacific subtropical high around 20°N. The co-occurrence of the stronger Northeast cold vortex and stable western Pacific subtropical high jointly led to the rainstorm over South China in 2022.

These results allow further research on the UTLS turbulent mixing and its implications for the climate system. 
 The chemical composition of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) plays an important role for the climate by affecting the radiation budget. Small-scale diabatic mixing like turbulence has a significant impact on the distribution of tracers which further affect the energy budget via their radiative impact. Current models usually have a higher vertical resolution near the surface and a coarser grid spacing in the free atmosphere, which is insufficient to resolve the occurrence of small-scale turbulence in the UTLS. In this work, we utilise enhanced vertical resolution (200 m in the UTLS) simulations focusing on mixing events in the Scandinavian region using the state-of-the-art multi-scale atmospheric chemistry model system MECO(n). These model simulations are able to represent different distinct turbulent mixing events in the UTLS and depict a significant impact of mixing on the tracer distribution in the UTLS. A novel diagnostic (delta tracer–tracer correlation) is introduced to determine the direction of the vertical mixing. The strength of the UTLS turbulent mixing depends on the particular situation, i.e., the vertical tracer gradient, and dynamical and thermodynamical forcing, i.e., vertical wind shear, deformation and  static stability. This work provides evidence that high-resolution simulations are able to represent significant turbulent mixing in the UTLS region, allowing for further research on the UTLS turbulent mixing and its implications for the climate system."

 Due to the complex composition of organic aerosols (OAs), identifying their sources and understanding their dynamics remain challenging, particularly in urban environments of China where natural and anthropogenic influences to OAs intersect. This study aimed to clarify the relative contributions of primary emissions and secondary formation to urban OAs and confirm the sources and influencing factors of OA pollution. We analyzed major polar organic compounds in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) collected over one year in Nanchang, Central China. Specific biomarkers and diagnostic ratios were applied to characterize OA sources and distribution patterns, while chemical mass balance (CMB) models and tracer-based approaches were used to estimate source contributions. Statistical analyses were conducted to investigate OA characteristics and drivers during winter pollution episodes. Notably, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and saccharides predominated over lignin, resin products, sterols, glycerol, hydroxy acids, and aromatic acids, with molecular profiles indicating both anthropogenic and biogenic origins. Source apportionment results showed that primary organic carbon (POC) and primary OAs (POAs) contributed 58 % of total organic carbon and 23 % of PM2.5 mass, respectively, compared with 8 % and 4 % from secondary organic carbon (SOC) and secondary OAs (SOAs). Anthropogenic sources dominated, accounting for approximately 90 % of POC and POAs as well as 60 % of SOC and SOAs. Seasonal patterns revealed stronger biogenic influences in spring–summer, whereas anthropogenic emissions dominated in autumn–winter.

We built a Lagrangian modeling framework using a single-column model (AOSCM) to simulate the air mass transformation. Comparing to observations, reanalysis, and forecast data, we found that the Lagrangian AOSCM can successfully reproduce the main features of the transformation. The Lagrangian AOSCM can be used for future model development to improve Arctic weather and climate prediction. 
 In Arctic warm-air intrusions, air masses undergo a series of radiative, turbulent, cloud, and precipitation processes, the sum of which constitutes the air mass transformation. During the Arctic air mass transformation, heat and moisture are transferred from the air mass to the Arctic environment, melting the sea ice and potentially reinforcing feedback mechanisms responsible for the amplified Arctic warming. We tackle this complex, poorly understood phenomenon from a Lagrangian perspective using the warm-air intrusion event on 12–14 March captured by the 2022 HALO-(𝒜𝒞)3 campaign. Our trajectory analysis of the event suggests that the intruding air mass can be treated as a cohesive air column, therefore justifying the use of a single-column model. In this study, we test this hypothesis using the Atmosphere–Ocean Single-Column Model (AOSCM). The rates of heat and moisture depletion vary along the advection path due to the changing surface properties and large-scale vertical motion. Cloud radiative cooling and turbulent mixing in the stably stratified boundary layer are constant sinks of heat throughout the air mass transformation. Boundary layer cooling intensifies over the marginal ice zone and forces the development of a low-level cloud underneath the advected one. As the air mass flows past the marginal ice zone, large-scale updrafts dominate the temperature and moisture changes through adiabatic cooling and condensation. The ability of the Lagrangian AOSCM framework to simulate elements of the air mass transformation seen in aircraft observations, reanalysis, and operational forecast data makes it an attractive tool for future model analysis and diagnostics development. Our findings can benefit the understanding of the timescales and driving mechanisms of Arctic air mass transformation and help determine the contribution of warm-air intrusions in Arctic amplification."

Unlike the traditional view, this process may explain how liquid and ice can coexist in cold clouds. Based on theory and aircraft data, our findings provide new insight into the microphysics of mixed-phase clouds, which could improve understanding of how Arctic clouds affect climate. 
 The Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process describes the growth of ice crystals at the expense of supercooled liquid droplets in mixed-phase clouds, driven by phase transitions at temperatures below 0 °C. In this study, we introduce a potential mechanism involving the transfer of water vapor from ice to cloud droplets formed on Giant Cloud Condensation Nuclei (GCCN). This process occurs under specific atmospheric conditions influenced by temperature and CCN size, particularly for CCN with diameters exceeding 1 µm. We term this mechanism the Giant Cloud Condensation Nuclei-Enhanced Ice Sublimation Process (GCCN-ISP). We first conduct a theoretical analysis to develop a physical model for determining these specific atmospheric conditions, followed by validation through observations. Model simulations informed by observational data from aircraft indicate that when CCNs are sufficiently large and cold, the water vapor partial pressure over droplets formed on these CCNs can be lower than that over ice. Consequently, water vapor can transfer from ice to supercooled droplets, causing the droplets to grow. Eventually, the water vapor pressures of both reach equilibrium, resulting in their coexistence."

 As global temperature rises, the severity and frequency of droughts are projected to increase. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a potential solution to reduce surface temperatures, but its effectiveness in alleviating drought extremes remains unclear. Here, we assess the global impacts of SAI on drought extremes based on experiments from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (GeoMIP6) and the Geoengineering Large Ensemble Project (GLENS). By 2100, the frequency of extreme droughts is projected to increase by 7.33 % under the high-emission Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario relative to present day. SAI reduces this increase by 1.99 % in GeoMIP6, and by 1.80 % in GLENS compared with Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5). Attribution analyses show that SAI-induced cooling alone reduces extreme drought frequency by 3.42 % in GeoMIP6 and 4.28 % in GLENS relative to their respective high-emission scenarios, outweighing the 2.12 % increase driven by SAI-induced precipitation reductions under the same conditions. However, these rainfall deficits lead to substantial inequities in drought exposures. Compared to developed nations, countries with less development experience smaller reductions, or even increases, in economic and population exposure to extreme drought under SAI relative to SSP5-8.5 or RCP8.5. These findings suggest that the current SAI strategies in GeoMIP6 and GLENS may induce the risk of unintentionally worsening regional hydroclimatic disparities."

Using a surface-specific technique, sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we found that compounds like 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA) not only act as photosensitizers but also generate new surface-active products under UV light. These reactions have implications for oceans, lakes, and clouds, providing crucial insights for modeling natural processes. 
 Organic compounds concentrated at air–water interfaces, such as the sea-surface microlayer (SML), or aerosol and cloud droplets, are key contributors to complex photochemical reactions. Nonanoic acid (NA) is surface active, and 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA) is a photosensitizer. This study combines investigations at the air–water interface by sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and in the liquid and gas phases by mass spectrometry (MS) to study the photochemical interactions of both substances at the air–water interface. We identify a novel interfacial aromatic signal via SFG, revealing surface-localized photoproducts previously undetected (C9H10O5). The study demonstrates that 4-BBA not only acts as photosensitizer but also undergoes photodegradation. Our experiments show the critical influence of the UV portion of the solar spectrum on photoproduct formation, as significant amounts of benzene (C6H6) and benzaldehyde (C7H6O) were detected as degradation products of 4-BBA in the gas phase particularly for the lowest wavelengths (280–310 nm). In the liquid phase, we identified the following photoreaction products: C8H12O4, C8H12O5, C9H10O5, C9H14O3, C9H16O3, C9H16O4, and C10H14O4. Among these, C8H12O4, C9H10O5, and C9H16O3 were most enhanced (by a factor of ∼ 11) in the presence of 4-BBA, with C9H10O5 strongly dependent on the presence of oxygen. The formation of C9H10O5 increased at shorter wavelengths due to photodegradation of 4-BBA, while C8H12O4 and C9H16O3 were dominant at longer wavelengths, consistent with photooxidation of NA. While pH and salinity were not varied systematically in this study, we found that decreasing the pH from 8 to 5.4 affected the water restructuring at the interface and increased the rate of photoproduct formation. Increasing salinity from zero to ∼ 38 ppt enhanced the photoreaction rates by a factor of 2. These findings highlight the importance of environmental factors in modeling interfacial photochemistry and demonstrate how SFG reveals surface–bulk coupling relevant to product formation in diverse aquatic systems."

A significant improvement was found in vertical profiling of temperature gradients compared to slower solid-state sensors, demonstrating reduced hysteresis between ascent and descent phases and accurate representation of strong gradients. More than 100 single flights with the sensors attached to drones of the SWUF-3D fleet were carried out in vicinity to a meteorological mast array at the WiValdi wind energy research park in Northern Germany. The comparison to sonic anemometers shows that temperature variance can be accurately measured within the background flow variability. The same applies for heat flux, which was measured for the first time with multicopter UAS and the eddy covariance method without external sensors. Heat flux is a crucial parameter to understand the energy balance of the atmospheric boundary layer and turbulent mixing. An uncertainty below 50 W m−2 was determined with the constraint that only low to moderate wind speed conditions (3–8 m s−1) could be used to allow vertical wind speed measurements with the current algorithm. The results indicate that the temperature sensors are suited for heat flux measurements, but further improvements are necessary with regard to vertical wind speed estimates to decrease the overall uncertainty."

Sapkal;Michael Rösch;Zamin A. Kanji,Development of the Horizontal Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (HCCNC) to detect particle activation down to 4 °C temperature and 0.05 % supersaturation,"The newly developed Horizontal Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (HCCNC) is capable of generating supersaturation as low as 0.05 % at temperatures as low as 4 °C, allowing for the investigation of CCN activity of ammonium sulfate particles up to 200 nm diameter and ambient aerosol of larger diameter. The HCCNC could be used for low-temperature experiments where gas-phase partitioning into or out of the aerosol phase for semi-volatile compounds is relevant for CCN activity. 
 Aerosol particles play a critical role as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. The capacity of aerosol particles to activate into cloud droplets is measured experimentally using CCN counters (CCNCs). Recent findings suggest that the co-condensation effect of semi-volatiles can enhance aerosol particle growth and cloud droplet activation. Conventional CCNCs, such as the streamwise CCNC, heat particles as they transit the CCNC column and may inadvertently not capture the co-condensation effect, leading to an underestimate in CCN concentrations. Additionally, streamwise CCNCs struggle to achieve supersaturations below 0.13 %, limiting their applicability for studying hydrophilic particles like (NH4)2SO4 larger than 111 nm. To address these limitations, we developed the Horizontal Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (HCCNC), which can generate supersaturation (SS) down to 0.05 % for temperatures down to 4 °C. This study presents the development of the HCCNC, providing a detailed technical description of its 3D geometry, computational fluid dynamics simulations and the key components that demonstrate its performance, showing accurate performance at low temperatures and SS, which the widely used, commercially available Droplet Measurement Technologies Inc. (DMT) CCNC cannot achieve. The main chamber parts were 3D-printed from an aluminium alloy. Sampling and humidity generation followed the principle of the previously used continuous-flow thermal-gradient diffusion chambers. Particles were detected using a commercially available optical particle counter (OPC; MetOne Instruments, Inc., Model 804). The instrument's performance is validated by conducting laboratory tests using ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) particles in the size range between 50 and 200 nm and for temperatures between 30 and 8 °C. Future work will focus on exploring the co-condensation effect on cloud droplet activation of levoglucosan and ammonium sulfate particles."

 The observational consistency between ground-based weather radars significantly impacts the quality of mosaic products and severe convection identification products. The real-time monitoring of observational biases between radars can provide a basis for calibration and validation. This study designed a consistency verification method for weather radar networks based on the FY-3G precipitation radar (SGRCM) and a ground-based weather radar network consistency verification method (AWRCM). From January to October 2024, observational experiments were conducted in the South China region involving 19 S-band weather radars and 13 X-band phased-array weather radars. The aim was to analyze the influencing factors of the consistency verification methods and the observational biases of reflectivity factors for radars with different bands and systems. For the S-band weather radars, the difference in the bias between the two methods ranged from −1.5 to 1.4 dB, and the difference in the standard deviation ranged from −1.2 to 1.2 dB. For the X-band phased-array weather radars, the difference in the bias between the two methods ranged from −6.67 to 0.84 dB, and the difference in the standard deviation ranged from −0.38 to 1.51 dB. The evaluation results of the two methods show good consistency for weather radars with different bands. We selected one radar with a larger bias for recalibration and rectification, and the changes in bias before and after rectification thus provide a good indication of the improvement in network consistency among the radars."

The datasets were developed using a data-driven approach and rigorously validated against in-situ observations and existing H and Ts-a datasets, demonstrating both high accuracy and exceptional spatial resolution. 
 Accurate estimation of land surface sensible heat flux (H) is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of surface energy transfer and the cycles of water and carbon. Yet, existing H products mainly are meteorological reanalysis datasets with coarse spatial resolutions and high uncertainties. FLUXCOM is the sole remotely sensed product with its 0.0833° spatial and 8- temporal resolution spanning from 2001 to 2015, so there is still a need for accurate and high spatial resolution global product based on satellite data. To address these issues, we generated the first global high resolution (1 km) daily H product from 2000 to 2020 using long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models, incorporating data from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite. Furthermore, considering that the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature (Ts-a) is a key driver of H, we introduce the first global accurate satellite-based Ts-a product. This product refines the uncertainty compared with obtaining Ts-a directly from existing products by subtracting air temperature from land surface temperature. Our model, distinct from previous models that estimate H per pixel through physically-based models requiring parameters that are not readily accessible, can conveniently derive global values and efficiently capture nonlinear interactions. Additionally, it accounts for the temporal variation of H. Validation against independent in-situ measurements yielded a root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) of 25.54 W m−2, 18.649 W m−2, and 0.54 for H, and 1.46 K, 1.073 K, and 0.52 for Ts-a, respectively. The estimated H and Ts-a values are more accurate than current products such as MERRA2, ERA5-Land, ERA5, and FLUXCOM under most conditions. Additionally, the new H product offers more detailed spatial information in diverse landscapes. The estimated global average land surface H from 2000 to 2020 is 35.29±0.71 W m−2. These high-resolution H and Ts-a products are invaluable for climatic researches and numerous other applications.

Using fossil pollen records and statistical models, we mapped changes across space and time. The dataset shows how forests, grasslands, and alpine ecosystems shifted over millennia, offering insights into past climate–vegetation interactions and improving future climate and land-use research. 
 Spatiotemporally contiguous paleo-vegetation reconstructions are essential for studying climate-vegetation interactions, providing critical data for paleoclimate modeling, and refining past land cover in Earth System Models (ESMs) and scenarios of anthropogenic land-cover changes (ALCCs). Here, we present the first spatiotemporally contiguous paleo-vegetation cover dataset for the Tibetan Plateau, spanning from the last deglaciation (16 ka) to the preindustrial era. This dataset was achieved using two sets of random forest (RF) models: one focused on temporal reconstructions (RF-temporal) and the other on spatial reconstructions (RF-spatial). RF-temporal reconstructs temporal trends from 61 fossil pollen records across the Tibetan Plateau, while RF-spatial interpolates site-based cover, producing a dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5° and a temporal resolution of 400 years. The dataset provides estimates of vegetation cover, along with a 95 % confidence interval, for seven vegetation types (total vegetation, woody vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, coniferous forest, broadleaved forest, alpine steppe, and alpine meadow). To illustrate, we present the temporal trends and spatial distribution of vegetation cover for these vegetation types, comparing them with the vegetation cover used in ESMs. We further discuss the dataset's reliability, limitations, and applications, along with the discrepancies between our reconstructed results and those used in ESMs, highlighting possible reasons for these differences.

This work supports better decisions in food security, disease control, and environmental protection around the world. 
 Understanding global livestock dynamics is essential for global food security, public health, socio-economic and sustainable development. This study developed an automated global livestock mapping framework that integrated Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the Random Forest regression model. By implementing the mapping scheme on Google Earth Engine (GEE), we develop the first annual gridded livestock of the world (AGLW), covering the period from 1961 to 2021 at a spatial resolution of 5 km.

The AGLW maps reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of global livestocks over the past six decades, highlighting both global expansion and localized fluctuations, such as the notable increase in pig stock in China and the decline in horse stock in Poland. By offering a reliable and continuous dataset, AGLW overcomes the limitations of existing livestock mapping products in terms of spatio-temporal continuity and resolution. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for enhancing our understanding of global livestock dynamics, informing policy decisions, guiding sustainable agricultural practices, and promoting resilience in both ecological and human systems.

The modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating net primary production and annual precipitation. 
 A dataset of pollen extracted from the surface-sediments of lakes with broad spatial coverage is essential for pollen-based reconstructions of past vegetation and climate. We collected 90 new lake surface-sediment pollen samples from the Tibetan Plateau (TP), covering major vegetation types, including alpine forest, alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert. By integrating these new data with previously published lacustrine pollen datasets, we established a comprehensive modern pollen dataset comprising 476 samples across the TP, covering the full range of climatic gradients across the TP, with Net Primary Production (NPP) from 0.16 to 6617.36 kg C m−2, mean annual precipitation (Pann) from 97 to 788 mm, mean annual temperature (Tann) −9.09 to 6.93 °C, mean temperature of the coldest month (Mtco) −23.48 to −2.65 °C, and mean temperature of the warmest month (Mtwa) 1.77 to 19.26 °C. Numerical analyses based on the comprehensive modern pollen dataset (n=476) revealed that Pann is the primary climatic determinant for pollen distribution, while NPP is a valuable variable reflecting vegetation conditions. To detect the quantitative relationship between pollen and NPP / Pann, both Weighted-Averaging Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS) and Random Forest algrithom (RF) were employed. The performance of both models suggests that this modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating past NPP and Pann, but RF has a slight advantage with this dataset. This comprehensive modern pollen dataset provides a reliable basis for reconstructing past vegetation and climate changes on the central TP. However, caution is required when applying it to pollen spectra from marginal regions of the TP or to records covering the Last Glacial period, where analogue quality is relatively poor. The dataset, including site locations, pollen percentages, NPP, and climate data for 90 lakes, is available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC; Tian et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.11888/Paleoenv.tpdc.302470)."

Slater;Eleanor Johnstone;Martim Mas e Braga;Neil J. Fraser;Tom Cowton;Mark Inall,FjordRPM v1.0: a reduced-physics model for efficient simulation of glacial fjords,"Glacial fjords connect ice sheets to the ocean, controlling heat delivery to glaciers, which impacts ice sheet melt, and freshwater discharge to the ocean, affecting ocean circulation. However, their dynamics are not captured in large-scale climate models. We designed a simplified, computationally efficient model – FjordRPM – that accurately captures key fjord processes. It has direct applications for improving projections of ice melt, ocean circulation, and sea level rise. 
 Interactions between ice masses and the ocean are key couplings in the global climate system. In many cases, these interactions occur through glacial fjords, which are long, deep, and narrow troughs connecting the open ocean to marine-terminating glaciers. By controlling the fluxes of ocean heat towards the ice sheet and ice sheet freshwater towards the ocean, glacial fjords play an important role in modulating ice sheet mass loss and the impacts of freshwater on ocean circulation. Yet, these dynamics occur at small scales that are challenging to resolve in earth system models and hence are often ignored, represented in an ad-hoc manner, or studied using expensive high-resolution models that are limited in scope. Here, we propose a means of capturing glacial fjord dynamics at negligible computational expense in the form of a “reduced-physics” model (FjordRPM) that resembles a “1.5-dimensional” or box model. We describe the design and physical parameterisations in the model and demonstrate its ability to capture important modes of glacial fjord circulation by comparing it against a general circulation model in idealised and realistic simulations. We suggest that the model is a useful tool for understanding fjord dynamics and a promising approach for representing glacial fjord processes within large-scale models or climate and sea level projection efforts."

This model seamlessly integrates simulations from the North American Atlantic coastal ocean to tidal tributaries and wetlands. By bridging the gap between large-scale regional ocean models and fine-scale shallow water systems and intertidal zones, this work helps fill observational gaps and provides valuable insights into studies like saltwater intrusion. 
 Saltwater intrusion is an increasing concern for coastal ecosystems. While groundwater models have made progress in simulating aquifer salinization, their boundary conditions – potentially informed by ocean model simulations in shallow water systems and intertidal zones – remain constrained. Here we presented a 3D unstructured-grid model that covers the Gulf of Maine and the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and most areas of the South-Atlantic Bight along the North American Atlantic Coast (“NAAC”) for 2 decades, with a focus on the salinity simulations. This model resolves detailed geometric features of tidal tributaries down to 100 m while maintaining a resolution of 6.5 km in the coastal ocean. The two-decadal simulations from 2001 to 2020 were evaluated using a comprehensive observational dataset of elevation, temperature, and salinity. The mean absolute error in the M2 amplitude across the NOAA tidal gauges within the domain is 0.11 m. The root-mean-square deviation for salinity and temperature measurements are 0.27 PSU and 0.12 °C, respectively. The model reasonably captured the currents and circulations. For the first time, we extended a regional continental scale ocean model to the tidal wetlands to include compound flooding process. The two-decade of simulations of hydrodynamic and hydrological connectivity along the Atlantic Coast have significantly addressed numerous observational gaps in many systems. Specifically, saltwater intrusion patterns in major estuaries of the Mid-Atlantic, such as Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and other tributaries within the same hydrologic unit, exhibit significant correlations. The seamless cross-scale capability of this model facilitates future applications to land-sea interactions, such as carbon fluxes."

We show that calculating the mean absolute error of bins best fits the observational datasets under multiple conditions and without using temperature corrections. Additionally, we show that calibration at a smaller scale than all Antarctic ice shelves is not needed. Finally, we assess the impact with future projections until 2300. 
 Uncertainties in future sea level rise are mainly due to uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet projections. Indeed, modelling the future of the Antarctic ice sheet presents many challenges. One of them is being able to model the physical interactions between the ocean and the ice shelves. As a result of technical challenges related to computational resources, implementation, and different modelling timescales, these interactions are often parameterised rather than explicitly resolved in ice sheet models. These parameterisations vary in complexity and calibration method, eventually leading to differences in resulting sea level rise contribution of several metres. Here we present the implementation of the Potsdam Ice-shelf Cavity mOdel (PICO) basal ice shelf melt module in the GRISLI v2.0 ice sheet model. We compare six different statistical methods to calibrate PICO and assess how robust these methods are if applied at different resolutions and areas of the Antarctic ice sheet. We show that computing the mean absolute error of the bins is the best method as it allows us to match the entire distribution of melt rates retrieved from satellite data at different resolutions as well as for different Antarctic ice shelves. It also results in a smaller parameter space than the other tested methods. This method makes use of melt rate bins and minimises the differences between the values of the bins of the model and the ones of the observational target. It gives equal weight to the full distribution of melt values: low, medium, and high values. We find that, using this method, region-specific calibration of ice–ocean interactions is not needed and we can avoid using ocean temperature bias corrections. Finally, we assess the impact of the implementation of PICO in GRISLI and of the calibration choice on future projections of the Antarctic ice sheet up to the year 2300."

Foster,"Phytoplankton Blooms on the Barents Shelf, Svalbard, Associated With the Permian–Triassic Mass Extinction","Mid‐ to higher‐latitude shallow marine environments are suggested to serve as refugia for organisms during intervals of rapid environmental change associated with hyperthermals. To understand the role of these environments during hyperthermals, we herein investigate the Permian–Triassic environmental crisis, which led to the most severe mass extinction event in the Phanerozoic. Our analysis of siliciclastic deposits from the Boreal Ocean from Lusitaniadalen, Svalbard, reveals a distinct increase of the lipid biomarkers C33‐n‐alkylcyclohexane (C33‐n‐ACH) and phytanyl toluene following the extinction event. This increase does not appear to reflect facies changes. Rather, it coincides with the extinction horizon, and persists into the lowermost Triassic (Griesbachian). Our findings suggest that neither C33‐n‐ACH nor phytanyl toluene are linked to short periods of photic zone euxinia recorded at Lusitaniadalen, but rather are derived from a specific group of phytoplankton. This indicates that higher‐latitude ecosystems may have supported regional blooms of unknown primary producers after the Permian–Triassic mass extinction, thus explaining the selective survival of some marine organisms. We also identify (albeit in lower abundance) C33‐n‐ACH and its pseudohomologs in northern Italy, which is the first report of n‐ACHs in the tropical Tethys region across the Permian–Triassic transition outside of South China, highlighting the wide paleogeographic distribution of this biomarker. Phytanyl toluene, however, is found exclusively in deposits recording higher‐latitude ecosystems, and is likely linked to organisms occupying a similar ecological niche as the source organism of C33‐n‐ACH in these settings."

The new satellite mission Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) provides a global coverage of these scales by measuring sea surface height. Through the radar backscatter coefficient, it also provides surface wind speed at the same resolution. Here, we examine situations in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Extension regions where SWOT as well as scatterometer winds and sea surface temperature (SST) at kilometer scale were available. A good correspondence between winds from SWOT and scatterometer is found at the mesoscales. More importantly, the signature of SST anomalies is found in SWOT winds down to 10 km scales, confirming the effect of the ocean on the atmosphere at those scales. SWOT therefore opens new opportunities for the study of submesoscale air‐sea interactions from space."

While often land masses are INP sources, we found especially low INP concentrations for the two stations furthest south, Neumayer and Princess Elisabeth. At Neumayer no clear annual cycle could be identified. No strong signal from biological particles, as known to occur for example, in the summertime Arctic, was observed.

However, its operational timescales remain unclear due to challenges in quantifying past weathering intensity, especially in marine sediments—the final sink of continental weathering fluxes. Using Holocene Mediterranean sediments as a test case, we examine climate‐driven weathering responses recorded in deep‐sea archives. Geochemical analyses of 18 well‐dated eastern Mediterranean cores reveal distinct provenance‐controlled weathering signals. After accounting for provenance and grain‐size effects using fixed‐effects models, we identify a consistent pattern between climate changes and weathering responses, with a time lag of ∼3,000–5,000 years. The observed lag varies by depositional setting, requiring up to 2,000 years for marine sediment transit from nearshore to abyssal environments. Catchment erosion and transport introduce another ∼3,000‐year delay, reflecting hydroclimate instability influences on weathering dynamics. Consequently, deep‐sea archives effectively preserve climate‐driven weathering changes only on timescales exceeding sediment residence time (generally >103 years)."

The MEP‐retrieved VWC exhibited strong correlation with in situ measurements of LFM (r > 0.6) in the Western U.S. The integration of high‐resolution vegetation coverage data enhances the detection of sub‐grid vegetation heterogeneity.

Geological records, like speleothems and lake sediments, show precession drives orbital‐scale temperature and precipitation variations in this region but lack seasonal detail. By reconstructing a full precession cycle using Alfred Wegener Institute Earth System Model, here, we examine how precession impacts the timing and duration of the East Asian summer and rainy season. The results reveal that in a precession cycle with high eccentricity, summer duration varies by up to 57 days, with onset and termination shifting by up to 48 and 52 days, respectively. The rainy season duration varies by up to 21 days, with onset and termination shifting by up to 31 and 35 days. These changes stem from precession‐modulated perihelion timing, affecting surface temperature and the meridional shift in subtropical high system. These findings may refine the interpretations of the complex paleoclimate proxies and offer insights into precession‐driven climate dynamics in subtropical regions, supporting future climate projections."

Most existing simulations of electron precipitation rely on test particle models that neglect particle feedback on waves. However, both theoretical and observational studies indicate that the feedback from energetic electrons significantly influences chorus wave excitation and evolution. In this study, we quantify electron precipitation driven by chorus waves using self‐consistent simulations at L = 6 with typical magnetospheric plasma parameters. Electrons in the ∼10–200 keV range are precipitated, exhibiting energy‐dispersive characteristics. The precipitation intensity reaches ∼108–109 ${10}^{8}\!\mathit{\mbox{--}}\!{10}^{9}$ keV/s/sr/cm2/MeV $\mathrm{k}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{s}\mathrm{r}/{\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}}^{2}/\mathrm{M}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}$, consistent with the typical values in observations.

We tested several GIA models in Fennoscandia, Laurentia and Greenland and found spatial coherence in the pattern of errors, with root mean square velocity errors of ∼ ${\sim} $1 mm/yr, ∼ ${\sim} $2 mm/yr and ∼ ${\sim} $5 mm/yr, respectively.

 α,β-Unsaturated carbonyl functionality- those with connected carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds- are commonly found in bioactive compounds. Late-stage functionalization of these compounds could involve oxidation of methylene (2°) C—H bonds while leaving the C—C double bonds that are important for biological activity intact1–3. Catalytic systems have been developed for selective oxidation of methylenes in the presence aromatics4 and N-heterocycles5, however olefins remain an unsolved problem.

Chemoselective methylene oxidation is demonstrated in forty-five molecules housing α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functionality where all previous methods afforded allylic oxidation or epoxidation. Mechanistic studies support that the new oxidant proceeds via a more charged pathway that disfavors electron deficient bonds, demonstrating that highly reactive metal oxidants can be tuned to achieve chemoselectivity.

 Parity and breastfeeding reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1,2, yet the immunological mechanisms underlying this protection remain unclear. Here, we show that parity induces an accumulation of CD8+ T cells, including cells with a tissue-resident memory (TRM)-like phenotype within human normal breast tissue. In murine models, pregnancy followed by lactation and involution drove the accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells in the mammary gland, coinciding with reduced tumour growth and increased intratumoural immune cell infiltration, effects that were abrogated by CD8⁺ T cell depletion. Importantly, this CD8+ T cell dependent tumour control was only observed following a complete cycle of lactation and involution. Consistent with this, primary TNBCs from parous women exhibited greater T cell infiltration and improved clinical outcomes. Together these findings, spanning preclinical models and over 1000 patient samples, provide new insight into how reproductive history shapes breast immunity, positioning CD8⁺ T cells as key mediators of parity-associated protection and informing novel strategies for both prevention and treatment of breast cancer."

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has led to paradigm shifts in the treatment of various tumour types1-4, yet limited efficacy has been observed in patients with metastatic mismatch-repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer5. Here we report clinical results and in-depth analysis of patients with early-stage pMMR colon cancer from the phase II NICHE study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03026140). A total of 31 patients received neoadjuvant treatment of nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by surgery. The response rate was 26% and included six patients with a major pathological response (≤10% residual viable tumour). One patient with an ongoing clinical complete response did not undergo surgery. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) was positive in 26/31 patients at baseline, and clearance was observed in 5/6 responders prior to surgery, while 19/20 non-responders remained ctDNA+. Responses were observed despite a low tumour mutational burden in all tumours, while chromosomal genomic instability scores were significantly higher in responders compared to non-responders. Furthermore, responding tumours had significantly higher baseline expression of proliferation signatures and TCF1, and imaging mass cytometry revealed a higher percentage of Ki-67+ cancer and Ki-67+ CD8+ T cells in responders compared to non-responders. These results provide a comprehensive analysis of response to neoadjuvant ICB in early-stage pMMR colon cancers and identify potential biomarkers for patient selection."

 The sensitivity of terrestrial Arctic climate during the Late Miocene remains poorly understood, despite this interval marking the transition towards a cooler, more variable global climate and the prelude to Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Here we present a Late Miocene terrestrial proxy record, developed through the analysis of speleothems, from eastern North Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat). Growth periods indicate multiple episodes of permafrost absence between ~10 and 5 Ma, suggesting mean annual air temperatures ~14 °C higher than present coinciding with atmospheric CO2 concentrations above ~310 ppm and local sea surface temperature anomalies >2 °C higher than present. Such moderate thresholds for permafrost absence highlight the climate sensitivity of North Greenland. Spikes in siliciclastic-derived trace elements ~6.3 and ~5.6 Ma are interpreted as terrestrial indicators for Late Miocene ephemeral glaciers in North Greenland. Climate variability recorded during speleothem growth periods was predominantly forced by obliquity, although, in the earliest Late Miocene, obliquity-scale anti-phasing with Antarctica may have occurred. Regional sea-ice extent was at its greatest following ~5.6 Ma during phases of transient glacial–interglacial cycles. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the Arctic climate system and permafrost to modest CO2 levels and provide insights into regional responses to orbital forcing.

 Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the g-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.

 Eosinophils are innate immune cells with central roles in allergy, parasitic diseases and multiple inflammatory conditions. Moreover, their role in host-pathogen interactions has been well characterized. However, the role of eosinophils during fungal infection is poorly defined. In this study, we delineate the importance of eosinophils during C. albicans systemic infections. C. albicans is promptly phagocytosed by human eosinophils, but growing hyphae escape this mechanism by releasing the fungal toxin candidalysin, which causes eosinophil membrane damage and cell death. Concomitantly, eosinophil mediators, notably major basic protein 1 (MBP-1), released during cytolysis, inhibits C. albicans growth and viability. Moreover, systemic candidiasis in genetic (Δdbl/GATA) or anti–IL-5–mediated depletion of eosinophils results in increased fungal burden and decreased survival. We here identified CD48 as a major receptor of eosinophils and possibly of other immune cells involved in the recognition of C. albicans via agglutinin-like sequence 6 (Als6). CD48 is important for protection in a model of systemic candidiasis as shown in CD48−/− mice and it binds clinical isolates of C. albicans. In conclusion, we have defined a protective role for eosinophils in vitro and in mouse C. albicans infections through CD48/Als6 host-pathogen interaction axis. In this work, authors show that via CD48–Als6 interaction, eosinophils can kill Candida albicans in vitro and protect against systemic candidiasis in vivo, reducing the fungal growth and improving survival of mice."

 We employ a time series of ERS-1/2, ALOS-1/2 PALSAR, Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, and RCM differential synthetic-aperture radar interferometry data from 1996 to 2023 to document the short and long-term migrations of the grounding line (GL) of Berry Glacier, West Antarctica, a tributary of Getz Ice Shelf that controls 10% of its ice discharge. In 2019–2021, we detected a short-term GL migration of 18.0 ± 0.9 km, which is exceptionally long and implies that the glacier bed is up to 1300 m deeper than previously known. On short time scales, the GL migrates between three states controlled by bed topography. The observed flexing of the glacier suggests that seawater is trapped in the newly formed ice shelf cavity in an irregular fashion during the tidal cycle. From 1996 to 2021, the most inland position of the GL retreated by 18.1 ± 0.4 km, or 0.7 km/year, the ice thickness decreased by 11 ± 1 m/year, the ice sped up by 64 ± 5%, and the glacier lost a total mass of 131 ± 23 Gt. We attribute the rapid retreat to an enhanced ocean heat flux from warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) reaching the grounding line through favorable bathymetry channels, combined with km-sized seawater intrusions beneath the glacier that cause rapid melting of basal ice.

Here, authors develop a tailored ionic-molecular sieve membrane that selectively intercepts hydrated ions, enabling stable high-capacity long cycling with low projected costs. 
 Aqueous Zn-I flow batteries are attractive for grid storage owing to their inherent safety, high energy density, and cost-effectiveness. However, Zn anode deposition/dissolution reactions cause severe water migration owing to ionic imbalance, especially under harsh conditions with high state-of-charge and high areal/volumetric capacities, further exacerbating intrinsic challenges for practical Zn-I systems. Herein, we develop a tailored ionic-molecular sieve membrane to regulate the transport behaviors of water/hydrated ion clusters, enabling the electrolyte balance by precise size sieving effects. Systematic investigations of different subnanometer pore sizes reveal that the optimal range (0.55–0.65 nm) can selectively intercept large hydrated ion clusters and reduce polyiodide shuttling. In this way, Zn-I flow batteries with this membrane exhibit a stable cycling over 2000 h (500 cycles) under harsh conditions (50% state-of-charge), achieving 66.4 mAh cm−2/53.2 Ah L−1posolyte/27.66 Wh L−1system. This systems also deliver a low self-discharging rate, retaining a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% after 3 days static flow. Furthermore, techno-economic cost analysis reveals a competitive levelized cost of long-term energy storage for systems incorporating this membrane (551.98 USD MWh−1 at an energy-to-power ratio of 18 h).

 Integrated photonic devices made of silicon nitride, which can be integrated with silicon-on-insulator and III-V platforms, are expected to drive the expansion of silicon photonics technology. However, the relatively low refractive index contrast of silicon nitride is often considered a limitation for creating compact and efficient devices. Here, we present three freeform silicon nitride devices—a coarse wavelength-division multiplexer, a five-mode mode division multiplexer, and a polarization beam splitter—while systematically benchmarking both the design capability and the fabrication repeatability and robustness of inverse-designed components. We demonstrate up to a 1200× reduction in footprint while maintaining relatively large minimum feature sizes of up to 160 nm, showing that inverse-designed silicon nitride devices can be as compact as their silicon counterparts. These results enable high-density integration in silicon nitride photonics and pave the way for multidimensional data transmission and quantum applications, as the inverse design technique can be applied to different silicon nitride thicknesses and is potentially extendable to other low- and mid-index contrast platforms.

 Chromosome congression is crucial for accurate cell division, with key roles played by kinetochore components, the molecular motor CENP-E/kinesin-7, and Aurora B kinase. However, Aurora B kinase can both inhibit and promote congression, suggesting the presence of a larger signaling network. Our study demonstrates that centrosomes inhibit congression initiation when CENP-E is inactive by regulating the activity of kinetochore components. Depletion of centrioles via Plk4 kinase inhibition allows chromosomes near acentriolar poles to initiate congression independently of CENP-E. At centriolar poles, high Aurora A kinase enhances Aurora B activity, increasing phosphorylation of microtubule-binding proteins at kinetochores and preventing stable microtubule attachments in the absence of CENP-E. Conversely, inhibition of Aurora A or expression of a dephosphorylatable mutant of the kinetochore microtubule-binding protein Hec1 enables congression initiation without CENP-E. We propose a negative feedback mechanism involving Aurora kinases and CENP-E that regulates the timing of chromosome movement by modulating kinetochore–microtubule attachments and fibrous corona expansion, with the Aurora A activity gradient providing critical spatial cues for the network’s function. This study reveals that centrosomal Aurora A regulates the CENP-E–Aurora B feedback at kinetochores to control initiation of chromosome movement, linking the signaling of two key mitotic structures."

 Zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) CO2 electrolysers offer high energy efficiency and promise for industrial application. However, the transport of carbonates within an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyser leads to CO2 loss, thereby limiting carbon utilization efficiency. Emerging acidic anolyte electrolysers using cation exchange membrane (CEM) can address this challenge but face critical stability issues, including accelerated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and persistent salt precipitation. Here, we propose a porous membrane (PM) as an alternative to the CEM in acidic anolyte electrolysers. The system demonstrates continuous operation at 100 mA cm−2 for 200 h without salt precipitation, while maintaining nearly 100% CO selectivity. Furthermore, large-scale device (100 cm2) also shows stable performance. Mechanism analysis suggests that enhanced water permeation and bidirectional ion transfer are critical for achieving stable performance in acidic anolyte electrolysers. These findings offer a feasible approach for high-performance, stable and scalable acidic MEA CO2 electrolysers.

 Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized the imaging of complex physical and biological systems by surpassing the Abbe diffraction limit. Recent advancements, particularly in single-molecule localization microscopy, have pushed localization below nanometer precision, by applying prior knowledge of correlated fluorescence emission from single emitters. However, achieving a refinement from 1 nm to 1 Ångström demands a hundred-fold increase in collected photon signal. This quadratic resource scaling imposes a fundamental barrier in single-molecule localization microscopy, where the intense photon collection is challenged by photo-bleaching, prolonged integration times, and inherent practical constraints. Here, we break this limit by harnessing the periodic nature of the atomic lattice structure. Applying this discrete grid imaging technique (DIGIT) in a quantum emitter system, we observe an exponential collapse of localization uncertainty once surpassing the host crystal’s atomic lattice constant. We further applied DIGIT to a large-scale quantum emitter array, enabling parallel positioning of each emitter through wide-field imaging. Collectively, these advancements establish DIGIT as a competitive tool for achieving unprecedented, precise measurements, ultimately paving the way to direct optical resolution of crystal and atomic features within quantum and biological systems.

Here, we analyze 42 years (1981–2022) of atmospheric and hydrological variability to show that the drying trend in Central Congo is linked to reduced atmospheric moisture convergence and precipitation, primarily during the rainiest period.

 Wildfires are a key component of Earth system dynamics with respect to carbon cycling. Thus, reconstructing past wildfire dynamics is crucial for understanding potential future climate change as related to (paleo)environmental feedbacks. Here, we explore wildfire during the Early Triassic (Smithian and Spathian, ca. 250 million years ago) – a time interval characterized by scarce fire evidence, perturbation of the carbon cycle, climatic oscillations, vegetation succession and biotic radiation-extinction pulses – using polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which are an organic (geo)chemical fire indicator in sediments. Hydrocarbon abundances in shales from Spitsbergen show a prominent increase after the Smithian-Spathian boundary. Diagnostic ratios of hydrocarbons suggest that these compounds were derived from relatively unaltered biomass as opposed to soil erosion and petrogenic carbon inputs or coal combustion vis-à-vis a coincidental Siberian Trap volcanism. Our data indicates that as temperatures decline during the late Smithian, coeval hydrological conditions become less intense and changing vegetation successions become more amenable to wildfire activity. We hypothesize that changing regional wildfire regimes influenced biogeochemical cycles, potentially affecting long-term carbon sequestration. The observed coupled behavior in water-vegetation-wildfire systems amid key perturbations in Earth’s history provides new insights into imminent future climate change consequences.

 Here we present a detailed analysis of how existing buildings in U.S. cities can contribute to storing carbon. Carbon can be retained in two ways: as biogenic carbon in wood-based materials, and through carbonation of concrete, a natural process in which carbon dioxide reacts with cement-based compounds. We examined buildings constructed before 2000 across 12 large metropolitan areas, using building stock data, satellite imagery, and Google Street View images interpreted with computer vision. These sources were combined into 1715 building categories to estimate material use and carbon storage. The analysis shows that existing buildings could store around 134,863 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Chicago and Las Vegas contain the largest stores of biogenic carbon (156.06 and 72.88 million tons), while New York shows the highest contribution from concrete carbonation (15.36 million tons). These findings highlight the importance of developing effective building preservation, reuse, and demolition policies in support of long-term climate goals.

 BackgroundA growing body of study have demonstrated a significant correlation between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and the occurrence of preterm birth (PTB). Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.MethodsTo explore the relationship and underlying mechanism behind PM2.5-induced PTB, a real-time system simulating environmental air conditions was utilized, alongside culturing uterine smooth muscle cells (HUSMCs). Collagen contractility assays were conducted to evaluate the contractility of HUSMCs, while quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot (WB) analyses were used to determine microRNA (miRNA) and protein expression. Additionally, a dual-luciferase assay validated the targeting relationship between miR-200a and progesterone receptor (PGR).ResultsWe found that intrauterine exposure to PM2.5 resulted in a reduction of pregnancy duration in C57BL/6 mice (mean pregnancy duration was 18.25 ± 0.95 days in PM group vs. 19.33 ± 0.52 days in control group). The contractility of HUSMCs was elevated after PM2.5 treatment. qPCR and WB analyses of both uterine tissue and HUSMCs suggested that PM2.5 activated miR-200a while inhibiting the expression of the PGR in vivo and in vitro. Dual luciferase assay validated the targeting relationship between miR-200a and PGR. Further investigations indicated that downregulation of PGR may enhance the contractility of HUSMCs by modulating oxytocin signaling, specifically altering the protein expressions of Oxtr, TRPC3, and PLCL2. Subsequently, the miR-200a inhibitor significantly alleviated the effect of PM2.5 in downregulating expression of PGR, changing oxytocin signaling, and increasing contractility of HUSMCs.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that miR-200a-targeted PGR regulates oxytocin signaling, likely serving as a crucial factor contributing to PM2.5 exposure-induced inappropriate myometrial contractions and the onset of PTB."

However, few studies have focused on bridging the polarimetric structure and lightning activity during the cloud life cycle. Here, we evaluated the sequence and interactions of polarimetric parameters for indicating lightning activity from the perspective of the cloud life cycle, and the cloud microphysics of the polarimetric structure were explored. 
 Polarimetric structures detected by radar can characterize cloud microphysics and dynamics. Many studies have indicated that differential reflectivity (ZDR) and specific differential phase (KDP) columns, which serve as proxies for updraught strength, are related to lightning activity; moreover, the quantities of ice and supercooled liquid water strongly influence the occurrence of lightning flashes via non-inductive charging. However, the sequence or interactions among these factors with dynamics and microphysics from the perspective of the cloud life cycle are uncertain. Here, we improve the “3D mapping columns” method to identify and quantify the ZDR/KDP columns, which is based on Cartesian grid datasets; this method is sensitive in the early phase of cloud formation. Our study bridges the polarimetric structure and lightning activity within 15 isolated thunderstorms during the cloud life cycle. The results indicate that microphysical variations in supercooled liquid water and graupel yield better correlation coefficients for the lightning activity prediction at short warning times (e.g. 6 min) than dynamical variations in the ZDR column volume do; however, the trend of the ZDR column volume implies good performance at longer warning times (e.g. 12 min). The KDP column is probably absent in the early phase of convection development; however, it will occur in the later stage with heavily cold cloud processes, replacing the ZDR column to indicate updraughts within the reflectivity core when obvious graupels and hailstones occur. Our study improves the understanding of the polarimetric structure, which is related to dynamics and microphysics, and is also associated with lightning activity."

Vreact advances pollutant formation insights and supports emission control strategies, aiding global air quality and public health efforts. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly influence global atmospheric chemistry through oxidative reactions with oxidants.  These reactions produce key precursors to the formation of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), which in turn play a crucial role in regulating O3 pollution and reducing PM2.5 concentrations. With the increasing diversity of VOCs, the need for advanced modeling techniques to accurately estimate the atmospheric oxidation reaction rate constants (ki, where i∈{OH,Cl,NO3, or O3}) has become more urgent. Here we introduce Vreact, a Siamese message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture that jointly models VOC–oxidant reactivity. The model simultaneously predicts log 10ki values and achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.299 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.941 on the internal test set. This framework overcomes the single-oxidant constraint of traditional models, enabling unified and scalable prediction of VOC oxidation kinetics across multiple oxidants.

The hydroxyl radical total reactivity and compositions of evaporative emissions were quantified, and identified key volatile organic compounds reactive species contributing to atmospheric photochemical processes. 
 Vehicle evaporation emission is one of the important sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. Research on its emission factors and chemical composition, especially the emissions from in-use vehicles under the new regulatory standards, is still scarce and affects the understanding of evaporation emissions. In this work, evaporative emission measurement for in-use gasoline vehicles was carried out for the China VI and China V vehicles, and their emission factors, chemical compositions and hydroxyl radical total reactivity (kOH) were measured. These three evaporative emission processes, hot soak loss (HSL), diurnal breathing loss (DBL) 24 h, and DBL 48 h emission factors, China V vehicles can reach 3.2, 4.6 and 7.6 times that of China VI vehicles, and high mileage vehicle aging and abnormal evaporative emission control systems can significantly increase emissions. In the HSL process, aromatics dominate, with contributions from China VI and China V reaching 44.1 % and 42.8 %, followed by light carbon alkanes (LC-alkanes, ≤ C6). In the DBL process, the chemical components were dominated by LC-alkanes, contributing 40.7 %–50.5 %. The source profiles of evaporative emissions have been established, with n-butane (3.2 %–26.1 %), isopentane (6.2 %–13.5 %), toluene (6.1 %– 16.0 %) being the more important components. It was also discovered that n-pentane/ethane and methyl tert-butyl ether/benzene with can be used to discriminate the sources of evaporative emissions and exhaust. The kOH analysis revealed that branched chain alkenes (BC-alkenes), linear alkenes and aromatics were the most reactive components, such as mainly 2-methyl-2-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, trans-2-pentene and toluene etc. The measurement of BC-alkenes has expanded our understanding of highly reactive components. It is necessary to strengthen the measurement of high reactivity alkenes, especially BC-alkenes, in future research."

We used the chamber to track how particles clump together over time. We found that although the particles behave differently at first, they eventually settle into similar patterns, with smoke clumping a bit more due to its unique shape. Overall, our work demonstrates that the chamber produces reliable results and can be adapted for future studies under more humid conditions. 
 We have developed an intermediate size (906 L) aerosol processing chamber, and this work reports on the design and initial characterization of dry aerosol experiments. Specifically, we are determining wall-loss and coagulation correction factors using the observed size distribution measurements for surrogates of common aerosol classes: sodium chloride, sucrose, and biomass burning aerosol smoke. Results show that, on average, sodium chloride, sucrose, and smoke wall-loss rates converge to similar values on relatively short time scales (< 1 h). The fitted coagulation correction factor, WC-1, for smoke particles (1.23 ± 0.312), indicates that on average they adhere to each other more than sodium chloride (0.969 ± 0.524) and sucrose (1.16 ± 1.38). The relative uncertainty is high for the coagulation correction, but it is consistent with our Monte Carlo error analysis.

It provides a scientific basis for reconstructing temporal changes in climate and vegetation, and enables the assessment of pollen assemblages' reliability in representing the dynamics of vegetation cover, plant diversity, and functional traits. 
 Modern pollen datasets can provide invaluable data for interpreting temporal variations in climate, vegetation, land cover, and plant diversity from fossil pollen. Here we present 555 pollen count data, identified from topsoil collected within plant plots across a vast area of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and along the southern margin of Xinjiang that borders the TP. This dataset fills a geographical gap in the published datasets that offer pollen count data for this area. Ordination analysis and multiple regression reveal that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the spatial distribution of pollen assemblages across the entire study area. Furthermore, ordination analysis indicates that pollen assemblages can be used to distinguish vegetation types in the southeastern TP, such as coniferous forest, alpine shrubland, and alpine meadow, from vegetation types found in other regions of TP. Additionally, it is possible to distinguish vegetation types that have low precipitation or moisture requirements based on pollen assemblages. Generalized additive models demonstrate that six commonly used pollen ratios, involving taxa such as Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae, are not sufficiently reliable for reflecting changes in annual precipitation. Nevertheless, they can provide some indication of changes in vegetation or landscape. This dataset holds various potential applications in paleoecological and paleoclimatic research. It not only offers a scientific foundation for reconstructing changes in climate and vegetation over time, but also enables the assessment of the reliability of pollen assemblages in representing the dynamics of vegetation cover, functional traits, and plant diversity, by integrating data on simultaneously measured plot-level plant communities and functional traits.

 FAOSTAT forest emissions and removals statistics were updated for the period 1990–2025 for 234 countries and territories, using new country data collected via the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2025. The new FAOSTAT estimates align with the published literature, indicating that the world forests were net carbon sinks, storing an additional 140 Gt CO2 in their standing living biomass over the 1990–2025 period, while losing 100 Mha and 17 Gt C through net forest conversion—a proxy used in FAOSTAT for deforestation. For the most recent period available in this release, 2021–2025, the FRA 2025 FAOSTAT estimates of mean annual forest removals were -3.6 Gt CO2 yr-1, only partially offset by net forest conversion losses averaging 2.8 Gt CO2 yr-1, resulting in mean annual net removals of −0.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 during 2021–2025. This net flux had decreased nearly 80 % from mean annual values of −1.4 Gt CO2 yr-1 a decade earlier, during 2011–2015.

Unlike earlier methods, ours can detect turbulence not only in unstable air but also in stable layers with strong wind changes. This approach better matches aircraft turbulence reports and reveals global patterns, such as seasonal shifts linked to jet streams and convection, helping improve flight safety and our understanding of extreme weather. 
 This study proposes a new method for estimating atmospheric turbulence from high vertical-resolution radiosonde data (HVRRD) using the minimum Richardson number (Rimin). While previous studies using HVRRD have primarily been based on the Thorpe method, which detects turbulence only in regions of local potential temperature overturning (Ri < 0) and does not explicitly account for wind shear, the proposed approach overcomes these limitations. By incorporating the effects of gravity waves on the static stability and vertical wind shear, this method enables the detection of turbulence not only in regions of Ri < 0 but also within statically stable layers characterized by strong shear (0 < Ri < 0.25), where Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is likely to occur. Additionally, comparison with turbulence observations from commercial flights demonstrates that the time series of turbulence derived from the Rimin method exhibits a significantly higher positive correlation with flight observations than that derived from the Thorpe method. Utilizing 10 years of global operational HVRRD, this study further analyzed the climatological distributions of turbulence derived from the Rimin method. Results show that turbulence under positive Ri conditions occurs most frequently in winter and less frequently in summer, reflecting the seasonal variability of the jet stream. In contrast, negative Ri cases exhibit a summertime maximum and wintertime minimum in the troposphere, and the opposite seasonal variation in the stratosphere. Regionally, turbulence is most pronounced over Asia, South America, and Antarctica for both positive and negative Ri cases.

We focused on a probabilistic approach, inverting the model with its respective uncertainty. Considering future applications to big data, we explored a neural-network-based method, retrieving computationally efficient estimates with an accuracy comparable to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 
 Within the New Copernicus Capability for Trophic Ocean Networks (NECCTON) project, we aim to improve the current data assimilation system by developing a method for accurately estimating marine optical constituents from satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance. We compared two frameworks based on the implicit inversion of a semi-analytical model derived from the classical radiative transfer equation. The first approach employed an iterative Bayesian inversion with a Gaussian approximation, which provides maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of the optical constituents along with their associated uncertainties. To improve the model performance, we optimized the model parameters using historical in situ measurements from the BOUSSOLE buoy and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) between the retrieved and observed values. The second approach employed the stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator, which is designed to approximate the MAP estimates of the optical constituents while simultaneously optimizing the model parameters through maximum likelihood. This method resulted in faster computations than the iterative Bayesian inversion while maintaining comparable RMSE values. While the iterative Bayesian inversion provided reliable uncertainty estimates, the SGVB estimator offered faster computations of the optical constituents. Moreover, using a dataset of in situ sea surface chlorophyll a concentrations across a broad region of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, we compared the inversion techniques with a state-of-the-art algorithm used within the Copernicus Marine Service, finding comparable performances across methods. Notably, the SGVB estimator showed the highest correlation between in situ measurements and retrievals throughout the analyzed region. We conclude that both inversion methods achieve a performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The Gaussian approximation offers robust uncertainty quantification, while the SGVB estimator provides a reliable and computationally efficient alternative."

TECO-CNP provides enhanced biogeochemical cycle representations, enabling more reliable predictions of ecosystem carbon cycle responses to global change through efficient parameter optimization. 
 Subtropical forests play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, yet their carbon sink capacity is significantly constrained by phosphorus availability. Models that omit phosphorus dynamics risk overestimating carbon sinks, potentially undermining the scientific basis for carbon neutrality strategies. In this study, we developed TECO-CNP Sv1.0, a coupled carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus model based on the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model, which explicitly captures key biogeochemical interactions and nutrient-regulated carbon cycling. The model simulates how plant growth and carbon partitioning respond to both external soil nutrient availability and internal physiological constraints, enabling plant acclimation to varying nutrient conditions. Using observations from a phosphorus-limited subtropical forest in East China, we first evaluated the model's performance in estimating state variables with empirically calibrated parameters. Compared to the C-only and coupled C-N configurations, the CNP model more accurately reproduced the observed pools of plant and soil C, N, and P. To systematically optimize model parameters and reduce uncertainties in predictions, we further incorporated a built-in data assimilation framework for parameter optimization. The CNP model with optimized parameters significantly improved carbon flux estimates, reducing root mean square errors and enhancing concordance correlation coefficients for gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange. By explicitly incorporating phosphorus dynamics and data assimilation, this study provides a more accurate and robust framework for predicting carbon sequestration in phosphorus-limited subtropical forests."

Validated across European forests, PHOREAU simulates how tree communities function under drought and warming. Our findings support the use of trait-based modeling to guide forest adaptation strategies under future climate scenarios. 
 Climate change impacts forest functioning and dynamics, but large uncertainties remain regarding the interactions between species composition, demographic processes and environmental drivers. While the effects of changing climates on individual plant processes are well studied, few tools dynamically integrate them, which precludes accurate projections and recommendations for long-term sustainable forest management. Forest gap models present a balance between complexity and generality and are widely used in predictive forest ecology, but their lack of explicit representation of some of the processes most sensitive to climate changes, like plant phenology and water use, puts into question the relevance of their predictions. Therefore, integrating trait- and process-based representations of climate-sensitive processes is key to improving predictions of forest dynamics under climate change.In this study, we describe the PHOREAU model, a new semi-empirical forest dynamic model resulting from the coupling of a gap model (FORCEEPS), with two process-based models: a phenology-based species distribution model (PHENOFIT) and a plant hydraulics model (SurEAU), each parametrized for the main European species.

This, alongside an improved capacity to predict stand leaf areas from inventories, resulted in better annual growth compared to ForCEEPS, and a strong ability to predict potential community compositions.By integrating recent advancements in plant hydraulic, phenology, and competition for light and water into a dynamic, individual-based framework, the PHOREAU model, developed on the Capsis platform, can be used to understand complex emergent properties and trade-offs linked to diversity-effects effects under extreme climatic events, with implications for sustainable forest management strategies."

 Humans and other animals use powerful reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that have been discovered by evolution over many generations of trial and error. By contrast, artificial agents typically learn using hand-crafted learning rules. Despite decades of interest, the goal of autonomously discovering powerful RL algorithms has proven elusive7-12. In this work, we show that it is possible for machines to discover a state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually-designed rules. This was achieved by meta-learning from the cumulative experiences of a population of agents across a large number of complex environments. Specifically, our method discovers the RL rule by which the agent's policy and predictions are updated. In our large-scale experiments, the discovered rule surpassed all existing rules on the well-established Atari benchmark and outperformed a number of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on challenging benchmarks that it had not seen during discovery. Our findings suggest that the RL algorithms required for advanced artificial intelligence may soon be automatically discovered from the experiences of agents, rather than manually designed."

 The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman1 is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of transmitting only classical, not quantum, information2–8. Here we extend the description of matter used in these theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, and so it gives information on the parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly provide evidence for the quantum nature of gravity. By applying the full framework of quantum field theory, it is shown that local classical theories of gravity can transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes."

 Achieving superpolynomial speed-ups for optimization has long been a central goal for quantum algorithms1. Here we introduce decoded quantum interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. When approximating optimal polynomial fits over finite fields, DQI achieves a superpolynomial speed-up over known classical algorithms. The speed-up arises because the algebraic structure of the problem is reflected in the decoding problem, which can be solved efficiently. We then investigate whether this approach can achieve a speed-up for optimization problems that lack an algebraic structure but have sparse clauses. These problems reduce to decoding low-density parity-check codes, for which powerful decoders are known2,3. To test this, we construct a max-XORSAT instance for which DQI finds an approximate optimum substantially faster than general-purpose classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing. Although a tailored classical solver can outperform DQI on this instance, our results establish that combining quantum Fourier transforms with powerful decoding primitives provides a promising new path towards quantum speed-ups for hard optimization problems.

 Diverse pathogen-encoded virulence factors disable apoptosis, pyroptosis or necroptosis, the host cell death programs that remove infected cells1. In the intestine, the extrusion of infected cells into the lumen for elimination provides an additional layer of host defence, but no virulence mechanisms that target the cytoskeletal changes required are known2. Here we show that the Escherichia coli ubiquitin ligase NleL is an inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) extrusion, targeting caspase-4, ROCK1 and ROCK2 for proteasomal degradation. Genetic deletion of Rock1 and Rock2 from cultured IECs diminished inflammasome-induced IEC extrusion. Moreover, mice with Rock1- and Rock2-deficient IECs were less effective than wild-type mice at constraining the numbers of Citrobacter rodentium in the colon. Notably, NleL-deficient C. rodentium triggered more IEC extrusion than did wild-type C. rodentium, resulting in diminished colonization of the colon in infected mice. Our work highlights a host–pathogen arms race focused on dynamic regulation of the host epithelial barrier.

 Chip-scale optical frequency combs based on microresonators (microcombs) have provided access to optical combs with GHz-to-THz repetition rates, broad bandwidth, compact form factors and compatibility with wafer-scale manufacturing1. Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits emerged as a leading platform and have been used in nearly all system-level demonstrations so far, ranging from optical communications2, parallel lidar3, optical frequency synthesis4, low-noise microwave generation5 to parallel convolutional processing6. Yet, transitioning to real-world deployment outside laboratories has been compounded by the difficulty of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to strong thermal instabilities. Although a variety of techniques have been developed to initiate soliton generation, including pulsed pumping, fast scanning and auxiliary-laser pumping7–11, these techniques do not eliminate thermal effects and often compromise microcomb performance, either by adding additional complexity or by reducing the accessible soliton existence range. Here we overcome thermal effects and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. We trace thermal effects to unexpected copper impurities within the waveguides, which originate from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade Si wafers and are gettered into Si3N4 during fabrication. By developing copper removal techniques, we substantially reduce copper concentration and thereby mitigate thermal effects. We demonstrate successful dissipative Kerr soliton generation with arbitrary laser scanning profiles and slow laser scanning. Our techniques can be readily applied to front-end-of-line processing of Si3N4 devices in foundries, removing a key obstacle to the deployment of soliton microcomb technology.

 Antiferromagnetic states with a spin-split electronic structure give rise to spintronic, magnonic and electronic phenomena despite (near-)zero net magnetization1–7. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting—p wave—was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems8–12. Recent theory has identified a distinct route to realize p-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations13,14, termed p-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realization of a metallic p-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalized conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localized magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space-inversion symmetry but approximately preserves time-reversal symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation—thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for p-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our p-wave magnet shows a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity13–15. Relativistic spin–orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (Hall conductivity >600 S cm−1, Hall angle >3%), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin-nodal planes found in the electronic structure of p-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the anomalous Hall effect. We establish metallic p-wave magnets as an ideal platform to explore the functionality of spin-split electronic states in magnets, superconductors, and in spintronic devices. A metallic p-wave magnet with commensurate spin helix and anisotropic electronic properties is experimentally realized and shows a giant anomalous Hall effect when distorted by a tiny spontaneous magnetization."

 Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), a public health concern worldwide, is at present regulated according to its mass concentration1. However, it is increasingly thought that mass concentration may not fully capture the physicochemical properties of PM linked to its health impact2. Consequently, it has been suggested to further investigate the adequacy of this metric as an unequivocal indicator of PM health effects3–5. The new European regulation on air quality introduced oxidative potential (OP) as a recommended parameter to be monitored at supersites1, to explore further deciphering information about PM reactivity and health impacts6,7. Here we use a database of almost 11,500 OP measurements from 43 locations across parts of Europe that were analysed with the two most commonly used OP assays8, OPAA and OPDTT, with a standardized protocol9,10. We find high spatial variability of OP across Europe, strongly influenced by site type, such as urban or rural. Accounting for OP alongside PM mass suggests that further improvements in urban air quality may require consideration, particularly near roads, where volumetric OP of PM10 exceeds background levels by a factor of 2.4 to 3.1, depending on the assay used. Analysis of mitigation strategies shows that traffic is a key source to target for effectively reducing OP in cities, whereas comprehensive reductions in PM from both traffic and biomass burning are required to also meet World Health Organization mass guidelines. Although the epidemiological evidence for OP health impacts is still evolving2,8, our findings may help inform the interpretation of future work.

 Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common developmental abnormalities, affecting around 1% of live births1. Aneuploidy causes around 15% of CHDs, with trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome) being the most frequent form2. CHDs occur in around 50% of cases of Down syndrome, with an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of atrioventricular canal (AVC) defects that disrupt the junction between the atria and ventricles3,4. The AVC contains unique myocardial cells that are essential for valvuloseptal development; however, the specific combination of dosage-sensitive genes on chromosome 21 that are responsible for Down syndrome-associated CHDs have remained unknown. Here, using human pluripotent stem cell and mouse models of Down syndrome, we identify HMGN1, a nucleosome-binding epigenetic regulator encoded on chromosome 21, as a key contributor to these defects. Single-cell transcriptomics showed that trisomy 21 shifts human AVC cardiomyocytes towards a ventricular cardiomyocyte state. A CRISPR-activation single-cell RNA droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) screen of chromosome 21 genes expressed during heart development revealed that HMGN1 upregulation mimics this shift, whereas deletion of one HMGN1 allele in trisomic cells restored normal gene expression. In a mouse model of trisomy 21, a similar transcriptional shift of AVC cardiomyocytes was restored by a reduction in Hmgn1 dosage, leading to rescue of valvuloseptal defects. These findings identify HMGN1 as a dosage-sensitive modulator of AVC development and cardiac septation in Down syndrome. This study offers a paradigm for dissecting aneuploidy-associated pathogenesis using isogenic systems to map causal genes in complex genetic syndromes. Studies using human pluripotent stem cells and a mouse model of Down syndrome identify HMGN1 as a key contributor to congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome."

A comprehensive scenario analysis shows that, although consumer-oriented recycling can reduce global emission intensity by 16.30% in 2060, it is far surpassed by integrated strategies. The highest global emission reduction (35.87%) is achieved by combining cross-regional cooperation on technology and trade with regionally tailored domestic circular economy policies. This synergistic approach proves highly effective in key manufacturing economies, yielding potential emission reductions of 39.14% in the USA, 37.28% in the European Union and 42.35% in China. By revealing the synergy of combining environmental, technological and trade levers through both global collaboration and local adaptation, our work provides a blueprint for decarbonizing complex global supply chains and establishes a framework for analysing their sustainability analysis. A circular economy approach applied to the global lithium-ion battery supply chain shows that combining cross-regional cooperation on technology and trade with regionally tailored domestic circular economy policies yields the highest global emission reduction."

 To ensure specificity, sensory neurons must select and express a single receptor from often vast gene families, adhering to the rule of ‘one receptor per neuron’. For example, each olfactory sensory neuron in mammals expresses only one odorant receptor (Or) gene1,2. In Drosophila, which has about 60 Or genes, this selection is deterministic3. By contrast, mice face the challenge of choosing one Or gene from over 1,000 options4. They solve this through a complex system of stochastic choices5–9. Ants also possess many Or genes, most of which are organized into tandem arrays similar to those in mammals, but their regulatory mechanisms have evolved independently. Here we show that, in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, each olfactory sensory neuron activates a single promoter within an Or gene array, producing a mature capped and polyadenylated mRNA. While the promoters of downstream genes in the array are inactive, all downstream genes are nonetheless transcribed due to transcriptional readthrough from the active promoter, probably caused by inefficient RNA polymerase II termination. This readthrough appears to suppress downstream promoters through transcriptional interference, resulting in aberrant non-capped transcripts that are not translated, ensuring that only the active gene is expressed. Simultaneously, long antisense transcription originating from the chosen Or promoter covers upstream genes, presumably silencing them. Ants therefore appear to have evolved a unique transcriptional-interference-based mechanism to express a single OR protein from an array of Or genes with functionally similar promoters. Ants evolved a transcriptional-interference-based mechanism to express a single odorant receptor from an array of Or genes with functionally similar promoters."

Slosky,Designing allosteric modulators to change GPCR G protein subtype selectivity,"Studies of the G-protein-coupled receptor NTSR1 show that the G protein selectivity of this receptor can be modified by small molecules, enabling the design of drugs that work by switching receptor subtype preference. 
 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) convert extracellular signals into intracellular responses by signalling through 16 subtypes of Gα proteins and two β-arrestin proteins. Biased compounds—molecules that preferentially activate a subset of these proteins—engage therapy-relevant pathways more selectively1 and promise to be safer, more effective medications than compounds that uniformly activate all pathways2. However, the determinants of bias are poorly understood, and we lack rationally designed molecules that select for specific G proteins. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we show that small molecules that bind to the intracellular GPCR–transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling structure-guided drug design. We find that the intracellular, core-binding compound SBI-553 switches the G protein preference of NTSR1 through direct intermolecular interactions3–5, promoting or preventing association with specific G protein subtypes. Modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe independent, conserved across species and translate to differences in activity in vivo. Our studies show that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor–transducer interface. Moreover, given that this pocket is broadly conserved, our findings could provide a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery that is applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily. Studies of the G-protein-coupled receptor NTSR1 show that the G protein selectivity of this receptor can be modified by small molecules, enabling the design of drugs that work by switching receptor subtype preference."

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) extend survival in many patients with cancer but are ineffective in patients without pre-existing immunity1–9. Although personalized mRNA cancer vaccines sensitize tumours to ICIs by directing immune attacks against preselected antigens, personalized vaccines are limited by complex and time-intensive manufacturing processes10–14. Here we show that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 also sensitize tumours to ICIs. In preclinical models, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines led to a substantial increase in type I interferon, enabling innate immune cells to prime CD8+ T cells that target tumour-associated antigens. Concomitant ICI treatment is required for maximal efficacy in immunologically cold tumours, which respond by increasing PD-L1 expression. Similar correlates of vaccination response are found in humans, including increases in type I interferon, myeloid–lymphoid activation in healthy volunteers and PD-L1 expression on tumours. Moreover, receipt of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines within 100 days of initiating ICI is associated with significantly improved median and three-year overall survival in multiple large retrospective cohorts. This benefit is similar among patients with immunologically cold tumours. Together, these results demonstrate that clinically available mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumour-related antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumours to ICIs. mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 also sensitize tumours to immune checkpoint inhibitors."

 Global climate change and its consequences for the symbiosis between corals and microalgae are impacting coral reefs worldwide—ecosystems that support more than one-quarter of marine species and sustain nearly one billion people1–3. Understanding how stony corals, the primary architects of both shallow and deep reef ecosystems, responded to past environmental challenges is key to predicting their future4. Here we describe a time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic analysis that includes hundreds of newly sequenced coral taxa, and sheds light on the deep-time evolution of scleractinian corals. We date the emergence of the most recent common ancestor of Scleractinia to about 460 million years ago and infer that it was probably a solitary, heterotrophic and free-living organism—or one that could reproduce through transverse division—thriving in both shallow and deep waters. Our analyses suggest that symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates was established around 300 million years ago and spurred coral diversification. However, only a few photosymbiotic lineages survived major environmental disruptions in the Mesozoic era. By contrast, solitary, heterotrophic corals with flexible depth and substrate preferences appear to have thrived in the deep sea despite these environmental disturbance events. Even though ongoing environmental changes are expected to severely affect shallow reefs5, our finding that stony corals have shown resilience throughout geological history offers hope for the persistence of some lineages in the face of climate and other environmental changes.

 The landmark discovery that neutrinos have mass and can change type (or flavour) as they propagate—a process called neutrino oscillation1–6—has opened up a rich array of theoretical and experimental questions being actively pursued today. Neutrino oscillation remains the most powerful experimental tool for addressing many of these questions, including whether neutrinos violate charge-parity (CP) symmetry, which has possible connections to the unexplained preponderance of matter over antimatter in the Universe7–11. Oscillation measurements also probe the mass-squared differences between the different neutrino mass states (Δm2), whether there are two light states and a heavier one (normal ordering) or vice versa (inverted ordering), and the structure of neutrino mass and flavour mixing12. Here we carry out the first joint analysis of datasets from NOvA13 and T2K14, the two currently operating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments (hundreds of kilometres of neutrino travel distance), taking advantage of our complementary experimental designs and setting new constraints on several neutrino sector parameters. This analysis provides new precision on the

 The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, relies exclusively on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission. Once ingested during blood feeding, most parasites die in the mosquito midgut lumen or during epithelium traversal1. How surviving ookinetes interact with midgut cells and form oocysts remains poorly understood, yet these steps are essential to initiate a remarkable growth process culminating in the production of thousands of infectious sporozoites2. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of both parasites and mosquito cells across different developmental stages and metabolic conditions, we unveil key transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions that occur in the midgut. Functional analyses uncover processes that regulate oocyst growth and identify the Plasmodium transcription factor PfSIP2 as essential for sporozoite infection of human hepatocytes. Combining shared mosquito–parasite barcode analysis with confocal microscopy, we reveal that parasites preferentially interact with midgut progenitor cells during epithelial crossing, potentially using their basal location as an exit landmark. Additionally, we show tight connections between extracellular late oocysts and surrounding muscle cells that may ensure parasite adherence to the midgut. We confirm our major findings in several mosquito–parasite combinations, including field-derived parasites. Our study provides fundamental insight into the molecular events that characterize previously inaccessible biological transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions, and identifies candidates for transmission-blocking strategies. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles gambiae reveal key developmental stages, processes and factors in parasite–mosquito interactions and identify potential targets for blocking malaria transmission."

Bent,Cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for battery interfaces,"Cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, combined with immediate plunge freezing, can be used to probe the pristine solid electrolyte interphase in lithium metal batteries. 
 Understanding the chemical environment of pristine interfaces is a long-sought goal in electrochemistry, materials science and surface science. A substantial understanding of one such interface, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium anodes, originates from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)1,2. However, room temperature (RT) combined with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) can induce major SEI evolution from reactions and volatilization during XPS1,2. Thus, a technique is necessary for SEI stabilization. Here we develop cryogenic (cryo)-XPS with immediate plunge freezing and demonstrate SEI preservation. We discover substantially different SEI speciation and a thicker pristine SEI with cryo-XPS, free from RT-associated thickness reduction and alterations to important species, including LiF and Li2O, in UHV. This new access to pristine SEI composition enables performance correlations across diverse electrolyte chemistries. Primarily, we highlight the necessity of studying sensitive interfaces under cryogenic conditions.

 Native ion channels play key roles in biological systems, and engineered versions are widely used as chemogenetic tools and in sensing devices1,2. Protein design has been harnessed to generate pore-containing transmembrane proteins, but the design of selectivity filters with precise arrangements of amino acid side chains specific for a target ion, a crucial feature of native ion channels3, has been constrained by the lack of methods for placing the metal-coordinating residues with atomic-level precision. Here we describe a bottom-up RFdiffusion-based approach to construct Ca2+ channels from defined selectivity filter residue geometries, and use this approach to design symmetric oligomeric channels with Ca2+ selectivity filters having different coordination numbers and different geometries at the entrance of a wider pore buttressed by multiple transmembrane helices. The designed channel proteins assemble into homogeneous pore-containing particles and, for both tetrameric and hexameric ion-coordinating configurations, patch-clamp experiments show that the designed channels have higher conductances for Ca2+ than for Na+ and other divalent ions (Sr2+ and Mg2+) that are eliminated after mutation of selectivity filter residues. Cryogenic electron microscopy indicates that the design method has high accuracy: the structure of the hexameric Ca2+ channel is nearly identical to that of the design model. Our bottom-up design approach now enables the testing of hypotheses relating filter geometry to ion selectivity by direct construction, and provides a roadmap for creating selective ion channels for a wide range of applications. De novo design of Ca2+ channels with ion selectivity that can assemble appropriately and mediate Ca2+ conductance when expressed in cells is described."

 The dynamics of quantum many-body systems is characterized by quantum observables that are reconstructed from correlation functions at separate points in space and time1–3. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, however, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. To circumvent this limitation and enable access to relevant dynamics in experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented4. Here we experimentally measure the second-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC(2))5–18 on a superconducting quantum processor and find that they remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long timescales. Furthermore, OTOC(2) manifests quantum correlations in a highly entangled quantum many-body system that are inaccessible without time-reversal techniques. This is demonstrated through an experimental protocol that randomizes the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution. The measured values of OTOC(2) are substantially changed by the protocol, thereby revealing constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in the configuration space. The observed interference mechanism also endows OTOC(2) with high degrees of classical simulation complexity. These results, combined with the capability of OTOC(2) in unravelling useful details of quantum dynamics, as shown through an example of Hamiltonian learning, indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage. Experimental measurements of high-order out-of-time-order correlators on a superconducting quantum processor show that these correlators remain highly sensitive to the quantum many-body dynamics in quantum computers at long timescales."

 Artificial superlattices, constructed from atomic layers such as graphene using layer-by-layer periodic stacking or sequential epitaxial growth, have emerged as a versatile platform for developing new materials with properties surpassing the existing materials1–3. However, the explored superlattices are predominantly van der Waals (vdW) superlattices, constrained by weak interface coupling4,5. Here we present an efficient synthetic protocol that achieves a family of non-vdW superlattices of carbides and carbonitrides, featuring hydrogen bonding between layers through a stiffness-mediated rolling-up strategy. The crucial step involves customizing the bending stiffness of the atomic layers derived from MAX phases by creating metal vacancies in MX slabs, triggering their ordered rolling-up under rapid flexural deformation. Unlike vdW superlattices, our non-vdW superlattices with hydrogen bonding afford robust interlayer electronic coupling with highly concentrated charge carriers (1022 cm−3). Consequently, our superlattices exhibit a notable electrical conductivity of about 30,000 S cm−1, which is around 22 times that of the counterparts. When used in electromagnetic interference shielding, the optimal non-vdW superlattice film demonstrates a remarkable shielding effectiveness of 124 dB, surpassing that of any known synthetic materials with comparable thickness. The non-vdW superlattices are anticipated to markedly broaden the material platform, offering variable compositions and crystal structures for new developments in artificially stacked systems.  A method to make a big family of non-van der Waals superlattices of carbides and carbonitrides based on the delamination and rolling-up of multilayer MXenes is presented. "

 Social behaviour is substantially shaped by internal physiological states. Although progress has been made in understanding how individual states such as hunger, stress or arousal modulate behaviour1–9, animals experience multiple states at any given time10. The neural mechanisms that integrate such orthogonal states—and how this integration affects behaviour—remain poorly understood. Here we report how hunger and oestrous state converge on neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) to shape infant-directed behaviour. We find that hunger promotes pup-directed aggression in normally non-aggressive virgin female mice. This behavioural switch occurs through the inhibition of MPOA neurons, driven by the release of neuropeptide Y from Agouti-related peptide-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ArcAgRP neurons). The propensity for hunger-induced aggression is set by reproductive state, with MPOA neurons detecting changes in the progesterone to oestradiol ratio across the oestrous cycle. Hunger and oestrous state converge on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which sets the baseline activity and excitability of MPOA neurons. Using microendoscopy imaging, we confirm these findings in vivo, revealing that MPOA neurons encode a state for pup-directed aggression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how multiple physiological states are integrated to flexibly control social behaviour. Combined behavioural, circuit-level and cellular approaches are used to demonstrate how hypothalamic neurons integrate hunger and oestrous state to drive a switch in how female mice interact with pups."

 As demand for immersive experiences grows, displays with smaller sizes and higher resolutions are being viewed increasingly closer to the human eye1. As the size of emitting pixels shrinks, the intensity and uniformity of their emission are degraded while colour cross-talk and fabrication complexity increase, making ultra-high-resolution imaging challenging2–4. By contrast, electronic paper, which uses ambient light for visibility, can maintain high optical contrast regardless of pixel size, but cannot achieve high resolution5,6. Here we demonstrate electronic paper with electrically tunable metapixels down to ~560 nm in size (>25,000 pixels per inch) consisting of WO3 nanodisks, which undergo a reversible insulator-to-metal transition on electrochemical reduction. This transition enables dynamic modulation of the refractive index and optical absorption, allowing precise control over reflectance and contrast at the nanoscale. By using this effect, the metapixels can achieve pixel densities approaching the visual resolution limit when the display size matches the pupil diameter, which we refer to as retina electronic paper. Our technology also demonstrates full-colour video capability (>25 Hz), high reflectance (~80%), strong optical contrast (~50%), low energy consumption (~0.5–1.7 mW cm–2) and support for anaglyph 3D display, highlighting its potential as a next-generation solution for immersive virtual reality systems.

Extracellular fluid Ca2+ is regulated in vertebrates through endocrine systems that manage the vast Ca2+ reservoir in the bones3–6, but the Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms used by invertebrates, which lack bones, remain largely unclear. Here we identified a potent peptide hormone, Capa, which is responsible for regulating extracellular fluid Ca2+ levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Capa-deficient larvae exhibit low haemolymph Ca2+ levels, resulting in reduced locomotion and induced elongated pupae that mimic those of animals reared on a Ca2+-free diet. Capa secreted from specific neurosecretory cells acts on specialized Ca2+ storage compartments in the anterior Malpighian tubules, elevating haemolymph Ca2+.

 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. Given racial/ethnic differences in incidence and outcomes, B-ALL genome-wide association studies among children of African ancestry are needed. Leveraging multi-institutional datasets with 840 African American children with B-ALL and 3360 controls, nine loci achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) after meta-analysis. Two loci were established trans-ancestral susceptibility regions (IKZF1, ARID5B), while the remaining novel loci were specific to African populations. Five-year overall survival among children carrying novel risk alleles was significantly worse (83% versus 96% in non-carriers, P = 4.8 × 10−3). Novel risk variants were also associated with subtype-specific disease (P < 0.05), including higher susceptibility for a subtype overrepresented in African American children (TCF3-PBX1) and lower susceptibility for a subtype with excellent prognosis (ETV6-RUNX1). Functional experiments revealed novel B-ALL risk variants had allele-specific differences in transcriptional activity (P < 0.05) in B-cell and leukemia cell lines. These findings shed insights into ancestry-related differences in leukemogenesis and prognosis.

Improving irrigation efficiency and cutting emissions are key to reducing water stress and climate impacts. 
 Irrigation has been investigated as an important historical climate forcing, but there is no study exploring its future climatic impacts considering possible changes in both extent and efficiency. Here, we address these issues via developing irrigation efficiency scenarios in line with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), implementing these in the Community Earth System Model, and applying them to generate projections over the period 2015–2074. We project that annual irrigation water withdrawal decreases under SSP1-2.6 (from  ~2100 to  ~1700 km3 yr−1) but increases under SSP3-7.0 (to  ~2400 km3 yr−1), with some new irrigation hot spots emerging, especially in Africa. Irrigation is projected to reduce the occurrence of dry-heat stress under both scenarios, but cannot reverse the warming trend due to greenhouse gas emission (e.g., increasing from  ~90 to around 600 and 1200 hours yr−1 in intensely irrigated areas, under two scenarios). Moreover, moist-heat extreme event frequency increases more substantially (by ≥1600 hours yr−1 under SSP3-7.0 in tropical regions), and irrigation further amplifies the hours of exposure (for example, by ≥100 hours yr−1 in South Asia), thereby raising the risk of moist-heat-related illnesses and mortality for exposed communities. Our results underscore the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting irrigation expansion and improving irrigation efficiency to preserve water resources and decelerate escalating exposure to dry- and moist-heat stress. This study shows that future exposures to moist-heat increase more rapidly than those to dry-heat, and irrigation can further amplify moist-heat-related health risks.

 Many prosocial and antisocial behaviors simultaneously impact both ourselves and others, requiring us to learn from their joint outcomes to guide future choices. However, the neurocomputational processes supporting such social learning remain unclear. Across three pre-registered studies, participants learned how choices affected both themselves and others. Computational modeling tested whether people simulate how other people value their choices or integrate self- and other-relevant information to guide choices. An integrated value framework, rather than simulation, characterizes multi-outcome social learning. People update the expected value of choices using different types of prediction errors related to the target (e.g., self, other) and valence (e.g., positive, negative). This asymmetric value update is represented in brain regions that include ventral striatum, subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala. These results demonstrate that distinct encoding of self- and other-relevant information guides future social behaviors across mutually beneficial, mutually costly, altruistic, and instrumentally harmful scenarios.

Here, authors elucidate the multi-scale effects of the SEI on lithium deposition behavior based on the established SEI-omics framework. 
 Accurately understanding the impact of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium deposition is critical for high-energy lithium metal batteries. Yet traditional strategies, focusing solely on isolated components, fail to capture multi-constituent synergies and underlying mechanisms. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of SEI omics and establish a dataset of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy images combined with co-localized component information. By integrating interpretable machine learning and physics-based feature selection, we decoupled the roles of SEI constituents, revealing that higher N/S/P/F content and reduced O in the SEI improve lithium deposition. Combined density functional theory and electrochemical phase-field modeling uncovered multi-scale effects of SEI components on Li growth. Results confirm that designing an inner SEI layer with high surface energy and migration ability significantly refines deposition morphology. Guided by machine learning-optimized composition, a highly disordered SEI was engineered, achieving high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.35% over 800 cycles for Li||Cu cell at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2. This work establishes a universal framework for understanding SEI-coupled effects on lithium growth, offering transformative strategies for electrolyte and interface design.

 Bacteria have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to inhibit and kill competitors. However, why some bacteria carry such weapons while others do not remains poorly understood. Here we explore this question using the genomics of the bacteriocins of E. coli as a model system, which have large well-annotated bioinformatic resources. While bacteriocins occur widely, we find that carriage is particularly associated with pathogenic extra-intestinal (ExPEC) strains. These pathogens commonly carry large plasmids encoding bacteriocins alongside virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Across all strains, we find many orphan immunity proteins, which protect against bacteriocins and suggest that these bacterial weapons are important in nature. We also present evidence that bacteriocin toxins readily move between strains via plasmid transfer and even between plasmids via transposons. Finally, we show that several E. coli bacteriocins are widely shared with the pathogen Salmonella enterica, further cementing the link to virulence. Our work suggests that the bacteriocins of E. coli are important antibacterial weapons for dangerous antimicrobial-resistant strains. Bacteria employ a range of competition systems that deliver toxins to inhibit competing strains.

Here, the authors evaluate the potential of cytochrome bc1 inhibitors as partner drugs in tuberculosis treatment regimens. 
 Tuberculosis (TB) remains the foremost cause of death from infectious diseases globally, prompting ongoing efforts to improve treatment options. This includes developing compounds with novel modes of action and identifying optimal treatment regimens that allow for treatment shortening. One promising strategy involves targeting cytochrome bc1 oxidase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a key enzyme in the respiratory chain. In this study, we evaluate the potential of cytochrome bc1 inhibitors as partner drugs in TB combination regimens. Using a relapsing mouse model, we demonstrate that these inhibitors enhance regimen sterilisation and significantly reduce the time required for effective treatment. We also propose several novel combination strategies for both multidrug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB, where cytochrome bc1 inhibitors contribute to sterilisation and improved treatment outcomes. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis clinical isolates exhibited heightened susceptibility to cytochrome bc1 inhibitors compared to laboratory-adapted strains, highlighting the importance of using clinical isolates in TB drug discovery to better reflect the diversity of TB populations. These findings emphasise the potential of cytochrome bc1 inhibition in the development of more effective and shorter treatment regimens for TB, supporting the need for further clinical investigation.

 Mosquitoes are major vectors of human diseases, and their geographic expansion is primarily driven by the unintentional, human mediated introduction beyond their native ranges. Despite the substantial public health implications and rising numbers of disease outbreaks, a global picture of the introduction trends and the resulting range expansions of mosquitoes is missing. Here, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date compilation and analysis of reported first records of human disease vector mosquitoes worldwide. We show that 45 mosquito species (~25% of those known to transmit human pathogens) have been introduced worldwide, with 28 species having established in at least one region. From the 1950’s onwards, the introduction of new species has increased sharply, with 12 species recorded for the first time outside their native range since 2000 alone. Initially, most introduced species were native to Africa, but over time, Asian species have become more dominant. North America, Australia and Europe remain the main recipients. Our results highlight the role of global trade and transportation in mosquito spread and emphasizes the need for international cooperation to control their spread and potential threat to public health.

 Climate change will reshape global demand and supply for water. Surface water supplies will become more variable, and warming temperatures may increase demand for water. These changes could impose substantial economic costs. Well-functioning water markets can mitigate some of these costs by allocating water to those who value it most. However, storage constraints limit the ability of markets to transfer water over time. Here we use transactions data from 2010 to 2022 to evaluate how water prices in California’s surface and groundwater markets respond to precipitation shocks, and how this response varies with inventory levels and water storage capacity. In groundwater markets, with high inventories, prices are unresponsive to precipitation shocks. In surface water markets, with limited inventories, prices increase strongly when precipitation declines. A 50-inch decrease in annual precipitation, typical when comparing deluge with drought in California, increases the price by US$487 per acre-foot, more than tripling compared with the average wet year. This effect is less pronounced when inventory levels are higher. Increasing storage through the joint management of groundwater and surface water supplies could provide a pathway to reduce the adverse consequences of climate-induced precipitation volatility.

 Integration of efficient value-added electrochemical oxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction presents a promising sustainable route for both hydrogen energy and the electrochemical refinery industry. However, the serious competition of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with targeted oxidation reactions at high current densities forms a substantial hurdle for industrial application. Here we report a straightforward approach to inhibit OER side reaction by introducing a trace amount of Cu2+ into the electrolyte for efficient glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Such a strategy enables improved Faradaic efficiency of glycerol to the target product formic acid from 62.2% (without Cu2+ addition) to 99.3% at a high current density of 800 mA cm−2. The underlying mechanism is that a reversible redox process of Cu2+/Cu+ fully suppresses the formation of OER-active-phase hydroxy peroxide on the surface of GOR-active Co3O4 catalyst. The current strategy also applies to other important electrochemical oxidation reactions, paving the way for developing efficient non-OER electrochemical oxidation reactions for various chemical conversion processes.

 The Eurasian winter cooling observed in the early 21st century, which contrasted with ongoing global warming, was initially attributed to Arctic warming until atmospheric internal variability became the prevailing explanation when the cooling ceased despite unabated Arctic warming. Yet the atmospheric variability responsible for it remains elusive. Here, three comparable cooling episodes, including the early 21st-century one, are identified in reanalysis since 1901. By synthesizing them with cooling episodes in large-ensemble simulations, we demonstrate two intrinsic atmospheric regimes as modulators: the Scandinavian pattern (SCAND) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The substantial positive SCAND trend strongly favors Eurasian cooling, with the NAO trend modifying cooling magnitude. Our logistic regression model indicates that the likelihood of at least one analogous cooling episode before 2050 is approximately 30% due to internal variability, with only half potentially overriding the anthropogenic warming. These findings provide important insights for energy security strategies for midlatitude Eurasian regions."

 The Hadley circulation (HC) is an important atmospheric circulation system connecting the tropics and subtropics, and variabilities of regional HC exhibit significant impacts on tropical cyclones (TC). However, the potential feedback of TC on the regional HC remains unclear. Here, we reveal that western North Pacific TC (WNPTC) activity exerts a significant 1-month lagged negative effect on the western Pacific HC intensity (WPHCI), and this relationship is independent of the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We show that WNPTC activity can influence variations in environmental fields through modulating the variations of sea surface temperature over WP, thereby altering the thermal conditions and energy conversion, ultimately contributing to the weakening of the WPHC. The mechanism is further validated by sensitivity experiments. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of WNPTC activity on its adjacent meridional circulation, and illustrate the unignorable cumulative effect of extreme weather systems on the climate systems, which is especially important for that more frequent extreme events are projected under global warming."

 Future climate confronts major challenges due to ongoing Arctic sea-ice retreat. Notably, eventful sea-ice loss in the Holocene appears comparable circumstance, but associated physics remians poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution and semi-quantitative reconstruction of sea-ice conditions over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. A compilation of sea-ice reconstructions across the circum-Arctic characterizes a Pacific-side Arctic sea-ice melting event between 4.5 and 2.2 ka BP. Together with basin-wide paleoclimate records, satellite-derived and numerical modeling datasets, we attribute this sea-ice melting event to enhanced Bering Sea Inflow with stronger poleward transport of Pacific oceanic heat, which overcame long-term Holocene cooling trend likely linked to concurrently slowing Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Such Holocene-scale competition effect of ‘Pacificization v.s. Atlantification’ may conceptually explain the modern dipole pattern in Arctic sea-ice variation. In the warming future, projected more frequent La Niña circumstance could indicate enhanced Pacificization effect, leading to aggravated Pacific-side Arctic sea-ice retreat.

 Antarctic sea ice exhibits considerable interannual variability and has experienced unprecedented decline over the past decade. Here we provide observational insights into the role of the Southern Annular Mode in driving such variations in Antarctic sea-ice area. The influence of the Southern Annular Mode on Antarctic sea-ice area exhibits more pronounced seasonality than indicated in previous work. Positive anomalies in the Southern Annular Mode lead to decreases in sea-ice area during the seasonal sea-ice maximum, but vice versa during the sea-ice minimum. Variations in Southern Annular Mode during the sea-ice maximum also have an outsized influence on annual-mean changes in sea-ice area, since the seasonally-varying persistence and shortwave effects of sea-ice anomalies peak during the following months. It is argued that a notable fraction of the dramatic losses in annual-mean sea-ice area over the past decade can be traced to variations in the Southern Annular Mode during the sea-ice maximum.

 Subglacial geology plays a key role in determining the rate of ice flow and sensitivity of the glacial system to atmospheric or ocean warming. However, bedrock geology is often poorly known because direct information from subglacial samples is extremely challenging to obtain. Here, we combine the distribution, petrology, crystallisation age and thermochronology of glacial erratics with geophysical analyses to provide evidence for Middle Jurassic (~175 Ma) granitic bedrock extending beneath Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica. Our results constrain the range of past ice flow pathways across the adjacent Hudson Mountains, providing information needed to improve models of ice sheet evolution in this vulnerable region.

 Plasticulture, a widespread practice using plastic covers (PCs) to enhance crop yields, has raised environmental concerns. Existing studies capture static PC distributions, leaving temporal dynamics uncharacterized and often missing seasonal PCs applied outside the mapping window. To address this gap, this study proposes Plastic Cover Tracker (PCT), a rule-based approach that utilizes dense Sentinel-2 time series to track the intra-annual covering cycle of PCs. PCT extracts key temporal metrics, including the start date, end date, and duration of PC coverage, and classifies each pixel as permanent, seasonal or non-PC. Specifically, PCT first applies a Hue–Saturation–Lightness (HSL) transformation to improve spectral separability between PCs and the background. A single-date PC classification is then performed using the low-saturation and high-lightness of PCs, followed by temporal filtering to remove noise and ensure temporal continuity. An NDVI-based confirmation is subsequently applied to retain only agricultural PC applications. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of PCT: the HSL transformation significantly improved feature separability between PCs and non-PCs, with the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance increasing from ≤ 0.50 using a single RGB band to 1.50 using the saturation-lightness combination. For temporal metrics, PCT achieved accuracies of ± 1.83 days for start dates, ±1.74 days for end dates, and ± 3.27 days for durations using Sentinel-2 imagery. For pixel categorization into permanent, seasonal, and non-PC types, PCT achieved F1 scores of 0.79, 0.93, and 0.98, respectively. Comparison with existing PC datasets showed high consistency in permanent PC identification, supporting the reliability of PCT. Moreover, PCT successfully detected seasonal PCs that were overlooked in these datasets. In conclusion, PCT fills a critical methodological gap in tracking PC temporal dynamics and detecting seasonal PCs, with strong potential to support environmental risk assessments and promote sustainable plasticulture management."

 Semantic segmentation of urban point clouds captured by Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is essential for understanding complex 3D environments, serving as a robust underlying data foundation for digital twin applications. The fusion of multimodal data has been proven to significantly improve the performance of ALS semantic segmentation by fully mining rich complementary information in each modality. However, existing fusion-based ALS semantic segmentation methods face critical limitations due to the reliance on multiple sensors, which constrains their applicability. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework Elevation Guidance Adaptive Fused Network, termed EGAFNet, that integrates naturally formed top-view projection images from ALS to enhance the information perception of the point cloud. The framework focuses on utilizing projection images, structured around two key components: input representation and feature representation. Specifically, to generate highly discriminative input representation, we propose a novel projection method that accurately preserves the relative height relationships between objects and develop a Height Adaptive Scaling Module (HASM) to adaptively adjust object heights, enhancing the expressive capability of elevation information in the projection images. As for feature representation, we design a dual-branch network that effectively captures local and global context from the projection images within a large receptive field. Meanwhile, we propose an Elevation Guidance Adaptive Fusion Module (EGAFM) that adaptively fuses 2D and 3D features based on occlusion relationships to reduce feature confusion caused by occlusion in elevation projection, ensuring meaningful fusion between multimodal features. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our EGAFNet outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."

 Understanding the evolutionary characteristics of regional droughts is essential for ecological and socioeconomic sustainability, especially in water-scarce regions. The propagation from meteorological drought (MD) to agricultural drought (AD) in the Loess Plateau (LP), shaped by climate change and large-scale vegetation restoration, has not yet been fully elucidated. This study investigates the dynamic propagation from MD to AD in the LP, employing cumulative precipitation anomaly and the standardized soil moisture index to characterize MD and AD, respectively. A mutation detection algorithm was applied to divide the study period into pre- and post-mutation phases, allowing for a systematic examination of changes in drought propagation characteristics and their controlling factors. The results indicate that, following the mutation, the mean drought propagation time from MD to AD across the LP decreased from 5.0 to 4.5 months. With increasing severity of MD, the drought propagation risk exhibits a nonlinear rise, and this risk further intensifies after the mutation. The required to trigger mild AD declined from 62.2 to 45.5 mm, suggesting reduced resilience of the agricultural system to MD. Dynamic attribution analysis further revealed that the normalized difference vegetation index was the dominant driver of both the shortened propagation time and the reduced thresholds, suggesting that vegetation restoration has, to some extent, exacerbated the propagation from MD to AD. These results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic propagation mechanism from MD to AD under changing environmental conditions in the LP but also offer scientific guidance for developing targeted drought-resistance strategies and mitigating the risk of AD."

 Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have significantly advanced applications in climate science and physical oceanography, yet concerns over reproducibility and rigorous evaluation remain paramount. In this study, we reproduce a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction, providing a fully documented, from-scratch methodology, from anomaly map generation to model implementation on Google Colaboratory, that ensures transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility while establishing a benchmark framework for evaluating performance metrics. Our analysis across six metrics demonstrates that different measures capture distinct aspects of model performance, revealing a sharp decline in CNN accuracy from the 20th to the 21st century, likely due to overfitting, for which we recommend generalization strategies. We further identify methodological issues, including the inadvertent use of overlapping CMIP5 training and validation datasets, which may inflate skill estimates by up to 6 %, and latent climatological signals within input data that could artificially enhance predictive skill. Comparative evaluation with the advanced 3D-Geoformer model shows that, despite similar correlation skill, the CNN exhibits substantially higher error levels, with RMSE values five times greater, underscoring the necessity of employing diverse metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of ensemble averaging and L2 norm cost functions biases predictions toward neutral ENSO conditions, limiting the model's ability to capture event intensity and posing risks for decision-making applications.

 The study of characteristic parameters of lightning current-carrying channels is crucial for a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying lightning discharge processes. The present study investigated the radial distributions and temporal evolution of temperature, electron density, and conductivity in the lightning core current-carrying channel. The calculations employed a one-dimensional radial Fourier heat conduction equation, accounting for Joule heating generated by the return-stroke current and the effects of radiative energy loss. The study found that the peak temperature is positively correlated with the current but does not follow a simple functional relationship. The decay rate of both temperature and conductivity accelerates toward the channel edge. Their peak values lag behind the current peak, reaching maxima near the half-peak point of the return-stroke current. With the presence of the return-stroke current, the calculated channel temperature matches well with the values diagnosed from ionic lines in experimental spectra. In the late stage of the return-stroke discharge, the channel temperature aligns with that derived from atomic lines. This finding further confirms that ionic lines originate primarily from radiation in the current-carrying core channel, providing a basis for deeper understanding of the light radiation mechanism within the channel. With the presence of the return-stroke current, the channel maintains a relatively high electron density and conductivity. The radial decay of electron density in the core channel does not exhibit orders-of-magnitude changes; it shows a slight increase at the edge during 30-100 μs. The regions of high temperature, electron density, and conductivity expand radially outward with time, resulting in a gradually rising of temperature, electron density, and conductivity around the perimeter of the core channel, this feature effectively enlarging the radius of the high-temperature, high-conductivity range, which is a critical factor influencing current transmission."

 Collision-coalescence and cloud-rain auto-conversion are key factors affecting cloud microphysical properties and the evolution of cloud droplet spectra. However, there are still gaps in understanding the relationship between collision-coalescence and gamma spectral parameters, which introduces significant uncertainty into cloud model development and climate prediction. In this study, aircraft observations of warm shallow cumulus clouds from the Holistic Interactions of Shallow clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HISCALE) were analyzed. In addition, auto-conversion threshold functions were utilized to indicate collision-coalescence intensity, which subsequently served as the basis for investigating its potential impact on the cloud droplet size distribution. The results reveal that the strengthening of collision-coalescence is accompanied by a nonlinear increase in relative dispersion and a notable broadening of its distribution.The correlation between relative dispersion and skewness/kurtosis is positive when collision-coalescence is strong, but becomes negative as it weakens. This transition depends on the shifting dominance from collision-coalescence to condensation. Simultaneously, according to the difference in gamma distribution under different strengths of collision-coalescence, a fourth parameter is suggested to have a larger value when collision-coalescence is stronger, and the analytical relation between skewness (kurtosis) and this parameter are deviated. The possibility of the alternative use of volume-mean radius is discussed, and it is found that with the increase in the volume-mean radius, the spectral parameters gradually decrease and converge. However, when volume-mean radius is in the range of 4-6 μm, the relationship of spectral parameters is more complex, and the reasons need to be further explored."

 Evaluating the atmospheric environmental carrying capacity (AECC) accurately and reasonably is crucial to coordinate the relationships between economic development and environmental protection. In this study, several unexpected severe haze episodes that occurred in January 2020 in two representative coal-fueled cities in northern China was investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF/CMAQ) model, with a focus on the roles of meteorological conditions and emissions.

The Atmospheric Self-Purification Index (ASI) results indicated that unfavorable meteorological conditions coupled with enhanced secondary generations were the main drivers of these haze periods. Further source apportionment results indicated that residential, industrial, and dust emissions were the major contributors in this region. The AECC exhibited similar patterns during both the 13th Five-Year Plan period and future scenarios, with values in Baotou significantly lower than those in Hohhot. Furthermore, comparable seasonal variations were observed in both cities, with the overloaded situations predominantly occurring in winter, even under more stringent future scenarios. These results suggested more stricter policy should be carried out in coal-fueled resource-oriented cities, particularly those with a significant industrial profile. Moreover, NOx and SO2 were identified as the main overloaded pollutants in both 2016–2020 and future scenarios, highlighting the urgency in introducing policies to deal with these reactive gaseous pollutants or alternatively introducing cleaner energy. Considering the substantial potential of both wind farm and photovoltaic foundation in Inner Mongolia, future policies should prioritize the development of photovoltaic and wind farm to mitigate the overloaded situations of NOx and SO2.

Data from three September 2023 fog events show that larger droplets form near the ground, while fog dissipates from both the top and bottom. Key findings include average droplet sizes, water content, and how fog impacts radiation. The results improve understanding of fog behavior and its environmental effects. 
 Based on in situ observations, remote sensing, and tethered balloon soundings, this study examines vertical profiles of microphysical and thermodynamic properties in radiative fog layers in the Strzyżów valley (Southeastern Poland). During three radiation fog events in September 2023, 74 soundings were performed, with 41 employing the OPC-N3 instrument to capture droplet spectra. All cases showed similar conditions, with liquid water path consistently above 15 g m−2, placing most observations within the thin fog regime. Effective droplet radius decreased with height (3–4.6 µm over 100 m), while larger droplets (18.5 µm) were near the ground.Fog dissipation occurred from both top and bottom. The mature stage showed peaks in liquid water content (LWC) and droplet number concentration (Nc) at about 80% of fog depth. Larger droplets (≥ 18.5 µm) were removed within minutes, affecting fog longevity. Equivalent adiabaticity (αeq) – the scaling of adiabatic lapse rate to match observed liquid water path (LWP) – ranged from 0 to 0.6, with one rare case of negative near-ground αeq. Instruments above and below the fog allowed estimation of effect of the fog's impact on radiation flux. The difference of total shortwave and longwave NET (downward − upward) radiation at ground level before and after dissipation reached 150 W m−2. A linear relationship was found between reduction in longwave radiation and LWP under optically thin conditions. Mean LWC in the fog core ranged from 0.2–0.4 g m−3, and Nc reached 300 cm−3. Near-surface effective radius was 8–10 µm, decreasing with height. Agreement between model outputs and observed fluxes supports the retrieved microphysical parameters."

Here, the occurrence of ice particle sizes and concentrations with varying temperature and cloud microphysical thickness is analyzed as well as whether they formed in-situ or were transported upwards as frozen droplets from further below. The analyses are based on a large database of airborne measurements and extensive simulations. 
 Cloud particle size distributions (PSDs) are crucial in determining the clouds physical and optical properties and hence their radiative feedback to the climate. Here we present unprecedented occurrence patterns of cloud particles derived from 270 h of cloud measurements (≈ 975 000 PSDs). The focus of the analysis is on cirrus clouds, but liquid and mixed-phase clouds are also shown. In particular, cirrus PSDs for cold to warm cirrus temperatures and microphysically thin to thick cirrus clouds are provided in a novel presentation as heat maps. The observations are accompanied by simulations of ice crystal growth in  in situ-origin cirrus, showing that the maximum size to which the cirrus ice crystals can grow increases from approx. 60 µm@T < 200 K to 230 µm@T > 220 K. Crystals larger than this size are most likely of liquid-origin. The combined evaluation of observations and simulations allows the attribution of processes shaping the PSDs. Important results are that, with increasing temperature and cirrus thickness, the most frequent ice particles change from smaller and fewer crystals of in situ-origin to larger and more crystals of both in situ and liquid-origin i.e. the cirrus type changes from in situ- to liquid-origin. In addition, three characteristic ice crystal size ranges are identified. The nucleation/evaporation size interval (∼ 3–20 µm), most frequent in the coldest, thinnest in situ-origin cirrus; the – most common – overlap size interval (∼ 20–230 µm), where both in situ-origin liquid-origin cirrus occur and the uplift/sedimenation size interval (>∼ 230 µm), which consists mostly of liquid-origin ice crystals."

BTs can rapidly degrade, leading to light absorption, high yields of sulfate, and the formation of oligomerized organic compounds. The results reveal that aqueous-phase BTs can contribute to secondary aerosols, altering the chemical and optical properties of atmospheric particles. 
 Benzothiazoles (BTs), widely used as vulcanization accelerators in the rubber industry, have frequently been identified in the atmosphere, especially in areas with heavy traffic. BTs can undergo gas-phase oxidation in the atmosphere, which contributes to secondary aerosol mass. However, given their certain water solubility, the atmospheric fate of BTs associated with aqueous-phase transformations is unclear. In this study, the reactions of benzothiazole (BT), 2-methylbenzothiazole (MBT), and 2-chlorobenzothiazole (CBT) with hydroxyl radicals (OH) were investigated. The rate constants of BT, MBT, and CBT reacted with OH radicals were determined to be (8.0 ± 1.8), (7.6 ± 1.7), and (7.6 ± 1.9) × 109 M-1s-1 at initial pH 2 and (9.7 ± 2.7), (9.8 ± 2.7), and (9.4 ± 2.7) × 109 M-1s-1 at initial pH 10, respectively. Lifetimes ranging from several minutes to several hours were estimated under mean OH concentrations in various atmospheric aqueous phases, which are significantly shorter than those estimated under mean OH concentrations in the gas phase. The nanoparticle tracing analysis (NTA) directly shows the formation of nanoparticles from the aqueous-phase photooxidation of the selected BTs. Data analysis of liquid chromatography Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS) identifies many multifunctional oligomers. Changes in optical property support the formation of oligomers and suggest that the products have the potential to contribute to the atmospheric brown carbon. In addition, higher yields of sulfate are formed after the reactions. It is highlighted that the aqueous-phase oxidation of BTs can contribute to the secondary aerosol mass in the ambient atmosphere, particularly in polluted regions where concentrations of BTs are comparable to those of benzenes, potentially altering the chemical composition and optical properties of atmospheric particles."

It provides high detection efficiency, low noise, a rapid time response, and excellent reliability, confirmed in lab experiments and at the CERN CLOUD chamber. Its design enables precise, robust long-term measurements, facilitating versatile applications in diverse environments, from laboratory settings to field and potential airborne research. 
 A dilute plasma is continuously maintained in the troposphere by ionizing particle radiation from galactic cosmic rays and radon decay. Small ions in the 1–2 nm size range play an important role in atmospheric processes such as ion-induced nucleation of aerosol particles. Consequently, there is a need for precise and robust instruments to measure small ions both for atmospheric observations and for laboratory experiments that simulate the atmosphere. Here, we describe the design and performance of the Cluster Ion Counter (CIC, Airel OÜ), which measures the number concentrations of positively and negatively charged ions and particles below 5 nm mobility diameter simultaneously, with low noise and fast time response. The CIC is primarily designed as a robust, low-maintenance instrument  prioritizing ease of operation and broad applicability, including  laboratory experiments; long-term unattended field measurements; and mobile, airborne, and battery-powered setups. The main application of the device is to study the temporal development of total cluster ion concentrations while also providing some information about the ion mobility distribution. The detection efficiency is above 80 % for ions and charged particles between 1.2 and 2.0 nm and above 90 % between 2.0 and 3.0 nm. The ion concentrations measured by the CIC agree well with reference instruments. The noise level (1 σ of background measurements) is typically between 20 and 30 ions cm−3 at 1 Hz sampling rate and an airflow rate of 7 L min−1 per analyzer. The noise level improves when higher flow rates and longer sampling periods are used. The CIC responds rapidly, with 1 s time resolution, to pulses of ionization produced in the CLOUD chamber by a CERN particle beam."

This dataset provides valuable context as to how changes in stream flow and connectivity drive hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological patterns in intermittent streams in the southeastern US. 
 Here we present a comprehensive dataset of hydrologic, biogeochemical, microbial, and macroinvertebrate community measurements from a set of multi-year, co-occurring, watershed studies in non-perennial stream networks that dynamically expand and contract over space and time. The data were collected over the 2022–2024 water years across three stream networks draining watersheds with a similar humid, subtropical climate but distinct physiographies (i.e., Piedmont, Appalachian Plateau, Coastal Plain) in Alabama, USA. Our goal was to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns and drivers of how non-perennial stream networks expand and contract, as well as the biogeochemical, microbial, and macroinvertebrate dynamics associated with changes in network connectivity and water availability. We used a combination of spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal sampling and sensor-based monitoring approaches to capture hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological responses to network expansion and contraction in each watershed. This manuscript describes the overall study design, monitoring network and sampling approaches, data and sample collection and analysis, and specific datasets generated. All data products are publicly available through the Hydroshare data repository for hydrologic, biogeochemical, and macroinvertebrate data (https://www.hydroshare.org/group/247) and through the NCBI data repository for microbial data.

In its fourth cycle, nextGEMS simulated the Earth System climate over the 2020–2049 period under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. Here, we provide an overview of nextGEMS, insights into the model development, and the realism of multi-decadal, kilometer-scale simulations. 
 The Next Generation of Earth Modeling Systems (nextGEMS) project aimed to produce multidecadal climate simulations, for the first time, with resolved kilometer-scale (km-scale) processes in the ocean, land, and atmosphere. In only 3 years, nextGEMS achieved this milestone with the two km-scale Earth system models, ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic model (ICON) and Integrated Forecasting System coupled to the Finite-volumE Sea ice-Ocean Model (IFS-FESOM). nextGEMS was based on three cornerstones: (1) developing km-scale Earth system models with small errors in the energy and water balance, (2) performing km-scale climate simulations with a throughput greater than 1 simulated year per day, and (3) facilitating new workflows for an efficient analysis of the large simulations with common data structures and output variables. These cornerstones shaped the timeline of nextGEMS, divided into four cycles. Each cycle marked the release of a new configuration of ICON and IFS-FESOM, which were evaluated at hackathons. The hackathon participants included experts from climate science, software engineering, and high-performance computing as well as users from the energy and agricultural sectors. The continuous efforts over the four cycles allowed us to produce 30-year simulations with ICON and IFS-FESOM, spanning the period 2020–2049 under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. The throughput was about 500 simulated days per day on the Levante supercomputer of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ). The simulations employed a horizontal grid of about 5 km resolution in the ocean and 10 km resolution in the atmosphere and land. Aside from this technical achievement, the simulations allowed us to gain new insights into the realism of ICON and IFS-FESOM. Beyond its time frame, nextGEMS builds the foundation of the Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin developed in the Destination Earth initiative and paves the way for future European research on climate change."

Flores;Irene Cionni;Sharon A. Billings;Pamela L. Sullivan;Hoori Ajami;Daniel R. Hirmas;Li Li,Soil parameterization in land surface models drives large discrepancies in soil moisture predictions across hydrologically complex regions of the contiguous United States,"Land models need reliable soil properties to simulate water, but these settings are uncertain. We analyzed Community Land Model version 5 simulations for the United States from 1980 to 2010 to see how different soil settings shape patterns of soil moisture. Compared with an independent global land dataset, patterns align in many regions but differ in water-limited areas such as the Great Plains. Our maps show where to improve settings and guide future tests with observations. 
 Land surface models (LSMs) are critical components of Earth system models (ESMs), enabling the simulation of energy and water fluxes that are essential for understanding climate systems. Soil hydraulic parameters, derived using pedotransfer functions (PTFs), are crucial for modeling soil–plant–water interactions; they introduce uncertainties in soil moisture simulations. However, a key knowledge gap exists in understanding how specific soil hydraulic properties contribute to these uncertainties and in identifying the regions most affected by them. This study conducts an intra-model sensitivity analysis within the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5), examining how alternative soil parameter settings influence soil moisture variability across the contiguous United States (CONUS) using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The EOF analysis revealed dominant spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture across multiple experimental configurations, highlighting the impact of soil parameter variability on hydrological processes. The results showed significant discrepancies in soil moisture simulations, particularly in the central Great Plains, which may be attributed to the combination of arid climatic conditions and limitations in modeling saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curves. Seasonal soil moisture dynamics showed broad similarity to ERA5-Land patterns, with differences in magnitude and phase, indicating the importance of refined parameterization, particularly in the representation of infiltration and drainage processes. Comparisons with ERA5-Land, used here solely as a model-based reference for pattern consistency, revealed stronger similarity in regions with consistent climatic gradients but persistent differences in hydrologically complex areas, particularly in areas with arid climates, such as the Great Plains, where hydrological processes remain difficult to represent. Because CLM5 is forced by GSWP3, whereas ERA5-Land is an offline HTESSEL replay forced by ERA5, differences reflect both forcing and structural contrasts in addition to parameter effects. This research demonstrates the necessity to refine soil parameter representations, utilize high-resolution datasets, and consider climatic variability to inform the model development of LSMs. Importantly, these findings also pave the way for future efforts that incorporate dynamic soil properties into LSMs. This work illustrates the influence of soil properties on simulated variability. While the analysis documents their importance, a future direction will be to develop approaches that allow these properties to vary dynamically within LSMs. This study contributes to ongoing efforts toward more integrated modeling frameworks that capture soil–hydrology–climate interactions."

These changes anticipating ecosystem responses to environmental change and effectively managing marine. The model-based predictions and their performance in the historical states of the ocean must be carefully evaluated against observations. In this study a coupled ocean and sea-ice simulation during 1993–2018 using observations. We focus on the Bering Sea shelf, which is the largest productive ecosystem in the US. 
 Understanding and predicting the ocean environment and marine ecosystem status depends on accurate representations of regional ocean dynamics. Recently, the Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6) has been configured to span the Northeast Pacific Ocean from Baja California to the Chukchi Sea (MOM6-NEP). In this study we present a physical hindcast (1993–2018) simulation of MOM6-NEP where it is coupled to a thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice module and includes tides. We evaluate the performance of this model in the Bering Sea. Various model metrics are benchmarked against in-situ mooring data and satellite observations. The simulation captures the general characteristics of Bering Sea dynamics, particularly with respect to seasonal and interannual variability of the middle shelf water mass properties. Modeling of shear induced mixing was found to be critical to the model's ability to reproduce the observed sharp summer thermocline and its depth. The hindcast simulation reproduces the long-term mean timing of sea-ice arrival and retreat in both the northern and southern Bering Sea, with the remaining mild biases primarily occurring in May over the northern shelf – the model captures the mean timing of sea-ice retreat, though it tends to retreat earlier in colder years and later in warmer years compared to observations. This pattern in biases suggests that the melting rate in the model likely underestimates the well-known melt-rate dependency on ice property whereby thicker (thinner) ice melts more slowly (quickly). As a result of high skills in reproducing sea-ice areal coverage, the interannual variability of the cold pool (the cold-water mass present on the bottom of the Bering Sea shelf in summer) extent is accurately reproduced by the model. Skillful representation of sea ice and the cold pool is essential for understanding ecosystem dynamics and successful fisheries management in the Bering Sea. The findings of this study contribute to the development of reliable oceanographic modeling and forecasting of marine ecosystem conditions to support fisheries management decision making."

Unlocking the thermodynamic bottleneck with photocatalysis is prone to eliminate undesirable side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, cracking, isomerization, and polymerization.

 Epidemiologic evidence on thermal stress and preterm birth (PTB) is based on ambient temperature rather than a biothermal metric. Thyrotropin abnormalities have been associated with PTB and may increase thermal vulnerability. However, it remains unknown whether thermal stress and thyrotropin abnormalities synergistically contribute to increased risk of PTB. Here we conducted a nationwide cohort study among 6,218,131 singleton live births in China. Biothermal stress was measured using the Universal Thermal Climate Index. We found that both heat stress and cold stress during each trimester were associated with increased risks of PTB, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.07) to 2.33 (95% CI: 2.30, 2.35) and from 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.09) to 1.68 (95% CI:1.67, 1.70), respectively. Participants with subnormal (<0.37 mIU/L) or supranormal thyrotropin levels (≥4.88 mIU/L) and biothermal stress had higher risks of PTB, compared with those with normal thyrotropin levels and non-thermal stress. Additive interactions were also identified between biothermal stress and thyrotropin abnormalities. We estimated that up to 13.52% of PTB were attributable to biothermal stress and thyrotropin abnormalities. Our study showed a synergistic effect of biothermal stress and preconceptional thyrotropin abnormalities, highlighting the importance of climate adaption measures and thyroid management toward pregnant women under climate change scenario. The thyroid plays an important role in pregnancy and body temperature maintenance, and both ambient temperature and thyrotropin levels have been reported to associate with risk of preterm birth.

 The non-volatile spontaneous ferroelectric polarization field serves as a cornerstone for applying ferroelectric materials in electronic devices, yet it is frequently mitigated by charge trapping at defect sites. Achieving an effective transition between ferroelectric polarization and charge trapping is challenging due to the inherent opposition of the two mechanisms and the uncontrollable charge trapping types in ferroelectric materials. Here, we realized a polarity-dependent ferroelectric transition in two-dimensional ferroelectric heterojunction transistor by integrating a hybrid organic-inorganic ferroelectric layer embedded with electron trapping sites. Through theoretical calculations and experimental validation, we demonstrate a ferroelectric manifestation and elimination mechanism based on the polarity of the semiconductor layer. The electron-majority n-type semiconductor exhibits charge trapping behavior, while the electron-minority p-type transistor exhibits the ferroelectric control mechanism. Leveraging the mechanism transition, our bipolar heterojunction transistor enables synergistic heterogeneous control of non-volatile memory and volatile synaptic weight modulation within a single bipolar ferroelectric transistor. Based on the experimentally extracted parameters from the transistors, the device-informed simulation achieves a recognition accuracy of 92.9% and a 20.7-fold improvement in training efficiency of the transfer learning network.

 Antihypertensives are associated with increased risk of syncope, hypotension, and fractures, but the highest-risk individuals are unclear. This study aimed to develop and validate three models to predict these outcomes in patients with an indication for antihypertensive treatment. A cohort study was conducted using data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Patients aged 40+ with systolic blood pressure 130-179 mmHg were included. Outcomes were first hypotension, syncope, or fracture leading to hospitalization or death within 10 years. Models were derived from CPRD GOLD data (n = 1,773,224) and validated with CPRD Aurum data (n = 3,805,366). Each model had 31-37 predictors. Validation demonstrated strong discriminative ability (10-year C-statistic: hypotension 0.824; syncope 0.819; fracture 0.790), with close agreement between predicted and observed risks for the hypotension and syncope models. Some underprediction was observed for the fracture model. These models could be used to help reassure patients about the relatively low risk of harm from antihypertensive treatment, or identify the small number of individuals with a higher risk where additional monitoring may be indicated.

 Marine diatoms are responsible for about 20% of global primary productivity, yet their capability to adapt to long-term climate warming remains uncertain. Here we show that thermal stress induces polyploidization in the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, and the polyploids (having more than two sets of chromosomes) adapt faster to elevated temperature compared with their diploid ancestor. Common molecular signatures underlying thermal adaptation in the polyploids included differential regulation of the cell cycle, responses to oxidative stress, cell wall biosynthesis and nutrient assimilation. Our findings indicate that polyploidization in diatoms may occur under thermal stress, triggering diverse changes in differential expression and accelerating evolutionary responses to temperature shifts.

 Extreme heat discomfort days (EHDDs) are increasing in frequency and intensity under global warming, raising growing concerns in subtropical regions such as South China. Using multi-decadal observational data, we identify a marked increase in the frequency and spatial extent of EHDDs since 2000, following an absence of significant trends in earlier decades. A convolutional neural network trained on sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height fields successfully detects 92% of these events and reveals their dominant circulation features. The northwestward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high induces an anomalous anticyclone over South China, weakening summer monsoon winds and suppressing ventilation. In the presence of high humidity, these stagnant and hot conditions exacerbate heat discomfort. Concurrently, a post-2000 strengthening of mid-latitude blocking high activity reinforces high-pressure anomalies over East Asia. The joint influence of intensified blocking highs and northwestward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high drives the sharp rise in both frequency and intensity of regional EHDDs. These findings highlight the importance of large-scale circulation changes, in combination with long-term global warming, in amplifying extreme thermal stress under a warming climate."

 This study investigated the influence of oceanographic dynamics on marine microplastic (MP) distribution and identified wastewater and greywater emissions as relevant sources. In June 2021, sub-surface water samples were continuously collected during steaming at a depth of 4 meters along five transects, spanning 1600 nautical miles from the Norwegian coast to Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean. MPs (>10 µm) were analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared imaging micro-spectroscopy, revealing concentrations ranging from 7 to 491 items m⁻³. Elevated MP levels near the Norwegian coast (max 399 items m⁻³) were linked to discharges from wastewater discharges, including greywater from ships, with polyester dominating, followed by polypropylene and acrylates/polyurethanes/varnish. The highest concentrations were observed near the remote Bear Island, likely driven by oceanographic features such as the Polar Front and mesoscale eddies, which can trap and accumulate MPs. Our results were compared to a parallel study analyzing stationary samples from the same cruise, revealeing systematically higher MP concentrations in underway samples and highlighting the importance of sampling strategies for inter-study comparisons. Overall, this study underlines the complexity of MP distribution and the combined roles of wastewater and greywater emissions, ocean current patterns, and frontal zones in understanding MP pollution in marine environments.

 Forest-focused Natural Climate Solutions (F-NCS) are crucial for climate change mitigation through emissions reductions and carbon sequestration. The Voluntary Carbon Market directs finance to F-NCS activities by the sale of carbon credits to offset emissions. However, inconsistent implementation and imprecise rules have led to over-crediting and other integrity challenges, reducing confidence in F-NCS effectiveness. Despite these concerns, assessments of the limitations of current protocols and how scientific advances could improve VCMs effectiveness have been piecemeal and limited in scope. To address this applied research gap, we review current and emerging methodologies for monitoring carbon impacts of forest protection and restoration activities, covering methods for monitoring carbon stock change, additionality, leakage, and non-durability, with an emphasis on integrating remote sensing (RS) technologies alongside field-based methods and emerging statistical approaches. We recommend 1) that the VCM needs to evolve as science advances. Carbon standards should also improve carbon estimates by 2) incorporating use of high-resolution maps of carbon stocks and change into standards; 3) establishing and sustainably financing a federated forest plots database for training and validation of carbon maps and testing new machine learning approaches; 4) calculate additionality for projects using causal inference methods that statisticians have developed for analysing changes in land cover and carbon density maps; 5) better understand the interaction between project and jurisdictional assessment of REDD+ projects; address leakage by 6) harnessing remote sensing to estimate its extent and evaluate the effectiveness of sustainable development measures designed to minimise it; 7) factor in non-durability upfront in F-NCS projects by leveraging map-based modelling of persistence.

 Individual Tree Detection (ITD) is essential for assessing tree parameters including spatial distribution, geometrical characteristics, and species identification within forested landscapes. This process is vital for tree inventory management and forest carbon accounting. Such information on individual trees can be derived from high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data by utilizing Deep Learning (DL) object detectors. Unlike traditional RGB images, UAV LiDAR data can be rasterized into multiple bands (or features) representing different structural and textural attributes, such as Vertical Distance (VD), Canopy Height Model (CHM), and texture-based features, to provide richer information to enhance detection. However, existing methods for UAV LiDAR data face challenges in processing high-resolution data due to complex forest environments, overlapping tree crowns, and limitations in utilizing rich multi-band information (i.e., input raster layers with more than three bands). To address these issues, this paper introduces Tree-Net, an innovative one-stage DL structure object detection for ITD on rasterized UAV LiDAR data. Inspired by a deep neural network based on You Only Look Once (YOLO), Tree-Net attempts to benefit from greater numbers of input bands to obtain sophisticated spectral and spatial features. By optimizing the neural network structure, Tree-Net improves computational efficiency and detection accuracy by employing a shallower architecture. Tree-Net's performance is evaluated on two distinct datasets, Heiberg and ForInstance benchmarks consisting of around 25,000 trees including deciduous and coniferous trees to represent different canopy shapes, heights, and densities. The Best detection metrics results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing literature (i.e., YOLOv5) and Modified YOLO by achieving 7 %, 41 %, 30 %, and 34 % improvement in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, respectively. In terms of time efficiency, Tree-Net outperformed our previously developed modified version of YOLO (Modified YOLO), which accepts multi-band instead of classic three-band (RGB) input, by 60 % on both training and testing phases. From a practical perspective, Tree-Net holds significant promise for urban tree inventory, forest management, and satellite ground-truth data generation for large-scale applications including biomass estimations and carbon exchange."

 The thermal radiation directionality (TRD) effect is a critical factor influencing the global application of thermal infrared remote sensing data, and limiting the comparison of long-term temporal data series. The inherent inconsistency of thermal radiation data acquired from different observation angles poses significant challenges for data utilization and analysis. To address this issue, this study develops a dual-band parametric angular normalization (DPAN) method based on physical model. The key parameters for angular normalization are firstly derived through theoretical analysis, then empirical estimation formulas for these parameters are established. Analysis based on simulation dataset demonstrates that the DPAN method can correct an average of 62 % of thermal radiation angular effects, with maximum corrections reaching 66–68 % and minimum corrections approximately 47–49 % under various input parameter errors. A wavelength difference of 2–3.5 μm is found to be the best for the dual-band setting to apply the DPAN method. When applied to actual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the method achieves a radiative brightness temperature root mean square difference (RMSD) of approximately 1.3 K, with maximum correction exceeding 8 K. Notably, temperature corrections typically surpass 1 K when the view zenith angle exceeds 40°. In summary, the DPAN method requires neither multi-angle nor multi-temporal observations, enabling direct application to any satellite dataset with at least two thermal infrared bands. These characteristics satisfy the essential requirements for operational angular normalization of satellite-derived land surface temperature products, indicating strong potential for widespread implementation."

 Recent studies indicate an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of drought events in the Horn of Africa. This research aims to assess the capability of high-frequency Earth observations in detecting drought events in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti. By utilizing daily vegetation and precipitation products, we explore the benefits of high frequency data to monitor meteorological and agricultural drought. A vegetation product derived from geostationary satellites with an increased capacity to minimize the effect of clouds is compared with global and regional precipitation daily datasets to analyze the relationship between vegetation and precipitation indices. Our findings demonstrate that certain daily precipitation products offer greater accuracy and a higher probability of detecting rainfall events. Particularly, we found that TAMSAT and CHIRPS products are not well-suited for analyses at daily temporal resolution. Additionally, we investigate the impact of different accumulation periods for the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993), finding that longer accumulation windows (e.g., SPI-180) provide greater robustness to wet–dry fluctuations but introduce a trade-off between precision and timeliness in detecting drought events. Through a detailed analysis of four drought events in the area, we assess their effects across different soil types, revealing that cropland and forest soils exhibited greater resilience to water stress compared to other soil types. In contrast, shrubs and bare soil types were particularly affected, contributing to severe humanitarian consequences, such as a drought event in Somalia that resulted in an estimated 250,000 fatalities. This study underscores the significance of using daily temporal resolution to identify drought events that are not visible on a monthly scale, including the alternation of short-term wet–dry spells."

 Accurate Urban Functional Zone (UFZ) mapping is a fundamental prerequisite for analyzing the spatial structure of cities and optimizing urban planning. Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing image and crowd sourcing geospatial data have emerged as critical data sources for UFZ mapping due to their capability to represent multidimensional spatial semantics. However, current research on UFZ mapping faces several limitations, including insufficient modeling of both global and local features in VHR image, unclear spatial units for functional zones, and a lack of cross-city validation. To address these issues, this study proposes a UFZ mapping framework that integrates VHR image and crowd sourcing geospatial data. First, a Global-Local Scale Attentive Network (GLSANet) is developed to extract deep functional semantic features from VHR image by modeling both local and global contextual information. Second, a Multi-scale Road-constrained Feature Segmentation (MRFS) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates OpenStreetMap (OSM) road constraints. By integrating geometric shape constraints with functional semantic features, this algorithm enables the generation of spatial units for functional zones. Finally, within the constructed spatial units, the framework integrates multiple data features, including low-light remote sensing data from SDGSAT-1, 3D building morphology features, POI kernel density features, and deep functional semantic features, and employs an ensemble learning model to classify urban functions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted UFZ mapping studies in 25 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits strong adaptability across diverse urban regions, achieving an average overall accuracy of 0.906 in UFZ mapping. In addition, comparative analyses with other related methods further highlight the superior performance of the proposed framework."

Electrification is central to India’s net-zero target by 2070, but this transition will generate substantial electric vehicle (EV) battery waste. Currently, waste management infrastructure for recycling and recovering critical battery materials (e.g. lithium, cobalt, nickel, phosphorous) is growing at an optimum pace with the help of government policy support and overwhelming participation from the private sector. This study estimates EV battery waste until 2050 and evaluates the quantum of critical battery minerals (e.g. lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, copper and phosphorous) recovered by battery waste under three distinct scenarios: • Business-As-Usual. Continues current EV sales trends (2014–2023) to project future adoption. • Transformative Scenario. Targets 30% EV sales by 2030, with segment-wise penetration (e.g. two-wheeler (2W)/three-wheeler (3W): 35%, cars: 12–25%, buses/trucks: 30%). • Accelerated Scenario. Aligns with NITI Aayog’s (NITI Aayog is a policy think tank of the Government of India, providing directional and policy inputs) net-zero targets, aiming for 100% 2W/3W, 30%–70% in other segments by 2030. And two sub-scenario of battery-chemistry: a nickel–manganese–cobalt (NMC)–dominant case (98% NMC and 2% lithium iron phosphate (LFP)) and a LFP–dominant case (20% NMC and 80% LFP). The study projects the volume of end-of-life battery waste using a Weibull distribution, capturing variations in service life across vehicle segments. Covering six key segments—2W, 3W, private and commercial cars, buses, and trucks. The study estimates EV battery waste generation to reach 37–80 GWh annually by 2030, growing further sevenfold by 2040 and tenfold by 2050. Recovered materials from end-of-life batteries could supply 28%–43% of India’s critical battery material needs by 2030 to 2050, emphasising the need for robust recycling systems to support a sustainable, circular EV transition. This article recommends circular economy-based policies and practices that combine producer responsibility with time-bound collection and recycling targets, minimum recycled content requirements, battery passport traceability and clear rules for the movement and valuation of end-of-life batteries."

Record climate conditions are increasingly common, with the 2023–2024 winter (September–April) documented as having the warmest land surface air temperatures on record for the Arctic region. However, corresponding impacts on ecosystem greenhouse gas fluxes typically take several years to diagnose, creating a knowledge gap between contemporary climate events and these fluxes. Here we synthesized near real-time data from 19 eddy covariance flux tower sites across the Arctic through the summer of 2024. This analysis revealed record net carbon dioxide and methane emissions occurring in winter, coinciding with warm 2023–2024 winter conditions. The increasing recognition of the importance of winter in shaping ecosystem carbon balance is still challenged by the difficulty of collecting data, with far more carbon flux measurements available in summer as compared to year-round. Improving the observation network’s extent and ability to deliver near real-time updates could provide immediate knowledge about the speed and strength of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate change. This increased awareness could help nations adapt their emissions policies aimed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change."

However, biodiversity is not uniformly distributed across countries. Adequately addressing this crisis requires a scientific basis for selecting protected land that considers both ecological benefits and impacts to humans. We use the global change analysis model to evaluate land use tradeoffs of four land protection cases under two climate cases. We find that biodiversity-specific land protection up to 39% globally can reduce land use constraints and food prices compared to protecting 30% of land uniformly in each country (’30 × 30’ initiative). Valuing terrestrial carbon for climate change mitigation reduces land conversion pressure and can complement protection strategies. Global impacts to agriculture of additional land protection are small, but regional impacts vary and may be considerable. Overall, biodiversity-specific land protection has greater potential than a uniform target to meet both ecological and human needs."

Here we develop a multi-scale climate network framework integrating geographic thresholds (2500 km) and directional event synchronization to quantify ENSO’s dual regulation of short- and long-range heatwave linkages across the Pacific–Indian Ocean domain. Analyses of 1979–2023 reanalysis data reveal El Niño amplifies trans-Pacific heatwave synchronization by 60% compared to neutral conditions, driven by Rossby wave trains facilitating >4000 km propagation. Conversely, La Niña confines heatwave propagation to regional scales through persistent anticyclonic circulation patterns, suppressing inter-basin linkages by 40% as regional systems prevent trans-oceanic propagation. Network topology shows El Niño’s bimodal distance distribution (peaks at 1000 km and 3000–4000 km) versus La Niña’s exponentially decaying pattern. Dynamical analysis links these patterns to phase-locked 850 hPa geopotential anomalies, demonstrating ENSO’s scale-selective control over extreme heat propagation."

In this paper we present the application of a free, open-source investment decision support tool we have developed, the MaritimeGCH, applied for the Greek fleet. We quantify the effect of two main interventions for a cost-effective carbon abatement, under the recent EU environmental regulations: the implementation of mature on-ship emission reduction technologies and transition scenarios to cleaner fuels. While significant emissions are achievable, even ambitious interventions fall short of fully decarbonizing the sector by 2050. This suggests that a more unified set of policy solutions are needed to achieve the national commitments."

Since reliable projections of any kind of drought are crucial for drought risk mitigation, studying how these flash droughts evolve as warming increases becomes essential. Herein, we analyse changes in flash drought frequency, geographic extent, and regional variability across Europe under incremental global warming levels of 1 ∘C, 1.5 ∘C, 2 ∘C and 3 ∘C. Soil moisture simulations are obtained using the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM), which has been forced with the bias-corrected meteorological data from ISIMIP3b (Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3b). We use a percentile-based method to determine the rapid decline in soil moisture conditions during the growing season. Our results show that Northern and Central Europe are expected to see more frequent flash drought events at higher warming levels above 1.5 ∘C. As temperatures increase, new areas experience flash drought in Central Europe. In contrast, the increase in frequency and area is less in the Mediterranean. Across Europe, we expect the mean frequency of flash droughts to increase from around 3 events each decade at 1 ∘C to 5 events at 3 ∘C. The median value of the spatial area covered in flash drought is expected to increase from around 30% at 1 ∘C to close to 44% at 3 ∘C. Each degree of increase in warming is expected to add around one more flash drought event each decade and more than 6% of the area across Europe under flash drought. The threshold of 1.5 ∘C marks a significant increase in the area affected by flash droughts, highlighting the importance of adhering to the Paris Agreement targets and adaptation measures to counter such flash drought conditions and safeguard the agricultural economy, food security, and ecosystems."

Improvements in efficiency over time have reduced the energy used per kilometre travelled, but so far this has not reversed the increasing energy consumption per person. Instead, due to a complex interplay of factors—including changes in the built environment, shifts in transport modes, and human behaviour—average travel distances have increased, effectively negating efficiency gains. These adaptive dynamics have made it difficult to predict future energy consumption in travel. Here, we present data on remunerated and personal travel covering over half the global population, which supports a simple predictive heuristic based on energy use per unit of travel time, rather than distance. We find that total travel time among 43 countries converges to 1.3 ± 0.2 h d−1 and is invariant with per capita income across two orders of magnitude. This implies that psychological, social, and economic factors lead people to travel for similar daily durations, regardless of wealth, culture, geography, or transport technology, and that built environments and lifestyles co-evolve with economic and technological development to preserve stable travel times despite increasing travel speeds. Therefore, significant decreases in future energy consumption can only be achieved by reducing the average energy used per hour of human travel."

In addition to upward-propagating planetary wave 2 (PW2), westward PW2 generated in-situ by barotropic–baroclinic instability, contributed to the vortex split. Unstable PW2 growth resulted from nonlinear wave-wave interactions and over-reflection. Vortex destabilization occurred as the anomalously poleward-shifted vortex reversed to easterlies. 
 On 25 September 2002, the Southern Hemisphere experienced its first and only major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW02) since routine upper-atmospheric observations commenced in 1957. This event was marked by a sudden splitting of the polar vortex. While previous studies focused on tropospheric waves and vortex preconditioning, the role of in situ-excited planetary waves (PWs) remains unexplored. The current study addressed this gap by examining the impact of in situ-generated PWs on SSW02. As the onset approached, the displaced polar vortex elongated and split into two. The explosive amplification of zonal wavenumber (ZWN) 2 PWs (PW2) at 10 hPa was driven not only by upward-propagating PW2 from below but also by westward- and downward-propagating PW2 excited in the mid-to-upper stratosphere. This spontaneous PW2 generation was associated with barotropic–baroclinic instability, triggered by easterlies descending from the polar lower mesosphere. An unusual poleward shift of the polar vortex facilitated the development of easterlies by directing ZWN1 PWs (PW1) into the polar stratosphere, where they deposited strong westward momentum. This poleward displacement was attributed to anomalous easterlies in the equatorial upper stratosphere. PW2 amplification via instability involved two mechanisms: (i) PW1 breaking generated smaller-scale waves through a nonlinear energy cascade while inducing instability that amplified those waves, and (ii) over-reflection of upward-propagating PW2. A nonlinear energy cascade initiated PW2 amplification, with over-reflection contributing immediately before the onset. Instability-driven wave growth and equatorial easterlies in the upper stratosphere also appear in other vortex-splitting SSWs, suggesting their broader significance in SSW dynamics."

We suggested that anthropogenic source dominated the OA origins, and the gas-phase and particle-phase oxidation processes are conducive to the formation of sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds, respectively. 
 Understanding the chemical composition and quantifying the sources of organic aerosols (OA) are crucial for assessing their formation and human-related effects, yet individual mass spectrometry techniques still struggle to reveal the effects of sources and atmospheric processes on OA composition at the molecular level. In this study, we combined for the first time a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), a thermal-desorption aerosol gas-chromatograph-mass spectrometer (TAG-MS), and an electrospray ionization high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer (HR-MS) to analyze OA at a background site in South China from bulk to molecular levels. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis based on AMS data and organic tracers from TAG-MS showed that the low-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA1) was mainly contributed by biomass burning-related OA (BB-OA) and gas-phase secondary OA (gas-pSOA), while the high-oxidization degree of more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) was mainly due to isoprene-derived secondary OA. Using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach constrained by PMF source contributions to offline HR-MS data, we identified molecules associated with each PMF-resolved factor. The NMF resolved cooking-related OA (C-OANMF) factor exhibited the highest O/C ratio but the lowest double bond equivalent (DBE) value, whereas the BB-OANMF factor was characterized by the greatest aromaticity and a high abundance of nitroaromatics. For secondary processes, sulfur additions played a more significant role in gas-pSOA than in secondary inorganic aerosol-related OA (SIA-OA). Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the sources and formation of different AMS components, reveals the impact of different sources on the molecular composition of OA, and underscore the prominent impact of anthropogenic emissions and their photo-oxidation on ambient OA in areas with low particulate matter pollution but high O3 levels."

The overall results provide the observation-based molecular evidence that marine emissions may play a significant role in the formation of aromatic and aliphatic organic sulfur and nitrogen aerosols in the South China Sea. 
 Marine atmospheric organic aerosols play a pivotal role in regulating global climate dynamics and influencing marine biogeochemical cycles. Compared to the extensive research on marine isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), the origins of marine aromatic and aliphatic organic aerosols remain elusive. Here, organosulfates (OSs) and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) were measured in PM2.5 collected in Sansha (the South China Sea), a region with minimal anthropogenic pollution, to investigate the potential impact of marine emissions on their formation. The proportion of aliphatic and aromatic OSs in the total OSs was higher in Sansha than in other Chinese cities investigated. The abundances of biogenic OSs correlated with both total aliphatic OS and NOC abundances, as well as with total aromatic OS and NOC abundances. Two typical SOA tracers (C6H5O4S− and C7H7O4S−), which are formed via the atmospheric oxidation of marine benzene and toluene, were found to increase with rising chlorophyll a and isoprene levels in surface seawater. Additionally, the impact of long-range transport and ship emissions on the abundances of OSs and NOCs was found to be insignificant. These results together with mantel test analysis suggest that marine-derived precursors may substantially contribute to the formation of aliphatic and aromatic OSs and NOCs in the Sansha region. Overall, this study provides the observation-based molecular evidence that marine biogenic emissions may play a significant role in the formation of aromatic and aliphatic organic aerosols in the South China Sea."

Using satellite imagery and field observations, we identify key drivers of bank erosion at a large spatial scale and highlight the role of river discharge and permafrost. The dataset enhances understanding of river channel dynamics and supports the development of predictive models for river channel evolution and erosion risk assessment. 
 Riverbank erosion monitoring and modeling have a long-standing tradition in Earth system science. The current body of research primarily relies on observations at the basin and site levels. We endeavored to compile a comprehensive dataset of riverbank migration observations using a variety of measurement techniques, with both field-based and remote sensing data. The dataset comprises information from 12 extensive river basins situated in Northern Eurasia, encompassing rivers that drain into the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and Pacific oceans, and the Caspian Sea, specifically the catchments of the Vistula, Volga, Ural, Ob, Nadym, Yenisey, Lena, Indigirka, Yana, Kolyma, Amur, and Kamchatka rivers. The rivers included in the dataset vary in terms of environmental conditions and have average discharges of between 0.3 and 19 700 m3 s−1. This study examined approximately 140 000 km of rivers in Northern Eurasia, covering small, medium, and large rivers, with data from up to 70 years of water classifications obtained from satellite images, including those from Landsat and Keyhole, across 626 772 river channel segments. The dataset collected average and maximum bank retreat rates (m yr−1), average areas of bank retreat (m2 yr−1), and gross bank-erosion sediment yield (t yr−1). It also recorded possible drivers, encompassing both hydrological and catchment factors like permafrost, natural land zones, and geology. Our study showed that river discharge and permafrost distribution are the primary indicators of riverbank erosion in Northern Eurasia. These data will enhance comprehension of bank erosion processes and their underlying factors, thereby facilitating the development of more accurate predictive models of river channels.

The dataset includes measurements of temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitations, wind speed, gust and direction, and solar irradiance. It offers high-resolution insight into local weather patterns and seasonal variations, making it a valuable resource for climate monitoring and regional environmental studies. Preliminary analysis reveals a warming trend of ∼0.15 °C.yr-1, with significant seasonal contrasts: the most pronounced increase occurs in winter (203.3 % above the annual trend, so winters are becoming milder), followed by autumn (80.1 %), spring (62.3 %), and summer (32.9 %).

The new model is evaluated against data from three different tracer gas experiments, and the promising results are an important first step towards also using DERMA for short-range dispersion modeling. 
 The Danish Emergency Response Model of the Atmosphere (DERMA) is a Lagrangian puff model originally developed for long-range dispersion modeling, at distances longer than roughly 50 km from the source. The model is used operationally as part of Danish emergency preparedness for the prediction of atmospheric dispersion in case of nuclear accidents, airborne spread of animal diseases, and ash from volcanic eruptions.  To be able to simulate dispersion on shorter spatial scales, a new description of turbulent diffusion has been developed and implemented in DERMA, combining a stochastic particle approach with a classic puff model.  Furthermore, updates have been made to the parameterizations of the turbulent wind fluctuations and Lagrangian timescales, the boundary layer height, and the initial plume rise due to heat release.  These improvements allow a more realistic description of turbulent diffusion near the release location, while an updated version of the existing turbulence description is used at longer distances.  The new version of DERMA is evaluated against three different tracer gas experiments: the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX), the Øresund experiment, and the Kincaid experiment.  The results indicate that the new particle-puff hybrid approach gives more accurate predictions, especially on shorter spatial scales, while a small improvement is also observed for long-range dispersion."

 Optical holography has undergone rapid development since its invention in 1948, but the accompanying speckles with alternating dark and bright spots of randomly varying shapes are still untamed now due to the intrinsic fluctuations from irregular complex-field superposition. Despite spatial, temporal and spectral averages for speckle reduction, holographic images cannot yet meet the requirement for high-homogeneity, edge-sharp and shape-unlimited features in optical display and lithography. Here we report that holographic speckles can be removed by narrowing the probability density distribution of encoded phase to homogenize optical superposition. Guided by this physical insight, an Adam-gradient-descent probability-shaping (APS) method is developed to prohibit the fluctuations of intensity in a computer-generated hologram (CGH), which empowers the experimental reconstruction of irregular images with ultralow speckle contrast (C = 0.08) and record-high edge sharpness (~1000 mm−1). These well-behaved performances revitalize CGH for lensless lithography, enabling experimental fabrication of arbitrary-shape and edge-sharp patterns with spatial resolution of 0.54λ/NA.

Here, the authors show that weakening the Cu–O bond energy in CuO nanocatalysts boosts the efficiency of NH₃ oxidation. 
 Tuning the electronic properties of nanocatalysts via doping with monodispersed hetero-metal atoms is an effective method used to enhance catalytic properties. Doping CuO nanoparticles with monodispersed Co atoms using different reductants affords catalysts (CoBCu/Al2O3 and CoHCu/Al2O3) with strikingly different electronic structures. Compared to CoHCu/Al2O3, the CuO nanoparticles in CoBCu/Al2O3 have longer and weaker Cu-O bonds, with a lower 1s → 4pz antibonding transition and higher 4p → 1s bonding transition (as demonstrated from HERFD-XANES and valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy). The weaker Cu-O bonds in CoBCu/Al2O3 lead to superior redox activity of the CuO nanoparticles, evidenced from operando XAFS and in-situ near ambient pressure-near edge X-ray absorption fine structures studies. Such superior redox properties of CuO in CoBCu/Al2O3 result in a much reduced activation energy of CoBCu/Al2O3 compared to CoHCu/Al2O3 (40.0 vs. 63.5 kJ/mol), thus leading to an enhancement in catalytic performance in the selective catalytic oxidation of NH3 to N2.

 A microbe is pathogenic when it manages to survive in its host and, often, is able to proliferate. Thus, virulence entails coping with host defenses in parallel to dissemination and/or attack of the host. How the pathogen endures the attack by effectors of the immune response remains insufficiently understood. Here, we report that planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not immediately virulent in a Drosophila model of acute infection. Bacteria undergo a maturation step called priming, which is required for transition to virulence. Primed bacteria switch to a bacillus shape, only in vivo, proliferate and resist the action of a specific combination of antimicrobial peptides. This priming mechanism requires an interplay between two major effectors of the type IV pili (T4P), FimV and Vfr, which enhance lateral cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Interestingly, N-acetyl-muramic acid (NAM) abolishes the virulence of the injected bacteria, which become round, and prevents the localization of the T4P hub protein FimV at bacterial poles, and cAMP signaling. In contrast, N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) counteracts the action of NAM by promoting FimV polar placement. In fact, NAG alone accelerates the speed of P. aeruginosa priming in a PilJ-dependent manner. This suggests that the NAG sensed by microorganisms is a common signal that promotes virulence through a morphological switch, both in bacteria and pathogenic dimorphic yeasts.

Here, the authors report that covalent nanopore sensing enables the targeted detection of aldehydes in mixtures through reversible thiol–aldehyde chemistry, offering a route to portable and low-cost analysis. 
 Volatile organic compounds are choice analytes in a variety of contexts. For example, humans release over 4000 volatile organic compounds, many of which are diagnostic of life-threatening medical conditions. The analysis of combinations of a large number of potential analytes requires the application of costly, cumbersome technology. In this work, we show that covalent nanopore sensing can be used for the targeted detection of a reduced set of analytes in a mixture. In this case aldehydes, which constitute ~5% of human volatiles, can be selectively detected by using reversible thiol-aldehyde chemistry. Further, nanopore engineering permits high-resolution detection, which allows closely related aldehydes, including isomers, to be distinguished. Differential sensing of members of other chemical classes, such as mono alcohols, is also demonstrated by leveraging their enzymatic conversion into aldehydes. Our approach is compatible with the use of low-cost, portable, user-friendly diagnostic devices applicable to a wide variety of objectives, including pollutant monitoring, food and beverage testing and the quality control of pharmaceuticals, as well as disease diagnostics.

 Sea levels respond to climate change on timescales from decades to millennia. To isolate the sea-level contribution of historical and near-term GHG emissions, we use a dedicated scenario and modelling framework to quantify global and regional sea-level rise commitments of twenty-first century cumulative emissions. Under current climate policies, emissions until 2050 lock in 0.3 m (likely range 0.2–0.5 m) more global mean sea-level rise by 2300 than historical emissions until 2020. This additional commitment would grow to 0.8 m (0.5–1.4 m) for emissions until 2090, of which 0.6 m (0.4–1.1 m) could be avoided under very stringent mitigation. Resulting regional commitments would be around 10% higher than the global signal for the vulnerable Pacific region, mainly due to higher relative Antarctic contributions. Our work shows that multi-century sea-level rise commitments are strongly controlled by mitigation decisions in coming decades.

Nearly half of global maize and wheat-growing regions receive a substantial share of rainfall from terrestrial water sources and are at greater risk of water scarcity. 
 Water availability critically influences crop phenology and agricultural productivity. Here we use satellite-derived water isotope observations and physical models to trace atmospheric moisture origins for major global rain-fed crops from 2003 to 2019, distinguishing between oceanic and terrestrial sources. Our analysis shows that the fraction of rainwater originating from land (f) varies both geographically and seasonally, with an important threshold at ~36%. Regions with higher f, that is, more dependent on land-originating water, are more prone to insufficient rainwater supply and soil moisture deficits during the main growing season. Crops in these regions show higher sensitivity to hydroclimate—with reduced productivity in lower-rainfall years—and a higher likelihood of drought. Notably, more than 40% of global maize and 60% of winter wheat is grown in regions where rainfall depends heavily on land-originating moisture (f ≥ 36%), underscoring the vulnerability of key staple crops to hydroclimate stress. Our results highlight the importance of managing local land moisture sources and reveal where targeted water management strategies would be most expected to enhance agricultural resilience.

 Water scarcity, exacerbated by climatic variability and human activities, poses a significant challenge in northern Bangladesh. This study presents a comprehensive water scarcity map by integrating drought and groundwater potential maps using advanced deep learning techniques. A deep learning model with optimizer is employed to predict current and future water scarcity under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). The primary focus is on how integrating these datasets with deep learning and climate projections enhances the prediction and management of water scarcity, enabling innovative resource planning. Findings reveal that SSP1-2.6 significantly reduces water scarcity and drought risks, particularly during Kharif-1 and Rabi seasons, while SSP5-8.5 intensifies water scarcity, especially in Rabi. Model validation using total operating characteristic and area under the curve metrics confirms strong predictive performance. This study advances water scarcity assessment, offering a detailed and actionable framework for sustainable water resource management and climate adaptation strategies."

 Landforms created by flowing water with sediment have left deposits on the surface of Mars, allowing study of the ancient environment. These features could provide constraints on surface water activity and past habitability. However, only a few lab studies have investigated the appearance and behavior of sediment-rich flows at relevant Mars surface conditions. We conducted experiments in a Mars environment chamber to understand the rheology and deposit morphology of mud under atmospheric pressures from 5 to 1000 mbar and surface temperatures between 248 and 297 K. We found that sediment flows in the Noachian era, when most aqueous activity occurred, could behave similarly to Earth analogs, but only under certain climate conditions. However, in the Hesperian and Amazonian periods, the dominant physical regime changed due to global atmospheric loss. Sediment flows during these eras would not have been similar to Earth analogs, and would have been dominated by freezing, evaporative cooling, and boiling depending on the microclimate (local pressure and temperature). Thus, regional climate and compositional context are important factors for interpreting satellite remote sensing images of these features on Mars. The results suggest we may be able to discover the paleo-atmospheric pressure record on Mars by analyzing sediment flow morphology.

 Detecting biomolecules in rocks is vital for understanding life’s evolution on Earth and its possible existence on Mars. The Curiosity rover measured Total Organic Carbon (TOC) levels of 201–273 ppm in 3500 million years (Ma)-old Martian mudstones exposed to radiation for 78 ± 30 Ma. Here we investigate whether deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a unique biological polymer, can be recovered under comparable conditions. We extracted and sequenced DNA from terrestrial sedimentary rocks with TOC ranging from 182 to 63,000 ppm, yielding 184,000 to 3.8 million nucleobases from a 0.5 g rock sample. After exposure to 10.45 MGy of gamma radiation, equivalent to 136 Ma on the Martian surface, we measured a radiolytic constant of K = 0.17 MGy⁻¹ in microbialite (2800-year-old) and oxide iron formation (2930 Ma old) samples.

 Risk assessments of oil spills in the marine environment typically only address dissolved oil. However, oil droplets may adhere to some organisms and result in prolonged exposure not disrupted by diverging dispersal trajectories. Here, we present a framework for quantifying exposure of dissolved and droplet oil on adhesive fish eggs and implement the framework in a well-established numerical model for ocean, oil and fish eggs. Utilizing the model for a case study with an oil spill in the habitat of the world’s largest haddock stock, Northeast Arctic haddock, shows that droplets for a given concentration cover a much larger domain than dissolved oil. Impact assessments not taking oil droplets into account may therefore severely underestimate the impact of oil spills and result in decisions with inappropriate weighting of societal benefits to ecosystem impacts. Finally, our results call for more experimental work on the impact of oil droplets on marine species.

 As a dominant component of the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNSFP) in the Three-North Region of China (TNR), farmland shelterbelts (FSs or windbreaks) play crucial roles in reducing wind erosion and soil degradation. However, large-scale FS products are currently unavailable, posing challenges for their monitoring and optimization. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning-based framework to extract FSs from Sentinel-2 data and analyze their spatial patterns in the TNR. This study produced the first 10-m resolution FS map and the first vectorized FS network for the TNR in 2022. Our results indicated that the total length of FSs was 915.09 ± 21.45 thousand km, while the total area was 1575.18 ± 58.75 thousand ha. Both FS length and area were highest in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, whereas the lowest values were observed in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qinghai. The average FS to farmland ratio, connectivity, and FS deviation angle were 2.83 % (± 0.11 %), 0.34, and 26°, respectively, highlighting potential for structural optimization. FSs were more concentrated, with well-structured spatial patterns in Northeast China and Xinjiang, while further construction efforts were needed in the Hetao Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and Hexi Corridor. The final FS map demonstrated robust performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the pixel-based user's accuracy was 79.20 % and the producer's accuracy was 79.39 %.

 Cloud and cloud shadow (CCS) detection is an integral pre-processing step in optical remote sensing workflows. Residual CCS can distort subsequent analyses, such as land use and land cover classification. The accuracy of operational cloud masks varies across ecoregions, with tropical regions being among the most error-prone. This study evaluates the performance of the EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) mission’s operational CCS masks over tropical western Kenya and proposes an improvement framework. Our assessment reveals shortcomings in the delineation of CCS objects and a frequent omission of small clouds. Additionally, pixels along the water-land interface and in wetlands are frequently misclassified. To address these shortcomings, we developed EnICCS (EnMAP’s Improved Cloud and Cloud Shadows), an open-source tool that improves upon operational masks using band indices, thresholding, and masking, followed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and a post-processing routine that enforces the physical positional relationships between clouds and their shadows. EnICCS outperforms EnMAP’s operational CCS masks for the given region. It achieves F1 scores of 0.93 for clouds and 0.79 for shadows compared to 0.80 and 0.58, respectively. Object delineation is improved by up to 30%. The lightweight framework is designed for execution on standard end-user machines.

 The Asian-Pacific Oscillation (APO), a seesaw teleconnection in upper-tropospheric temperatures over the Asian-North Pacific sector, significantly influences the Northern Hemispheric climate. Thus, it is important to explore factors affecting the APO variability and associated mechanisms. Using the reanalysis data from 1980 to 2020, this study reveals that the interannual variability of spring APO is significantly correlated to the preceding autumn sea ice concentration over the Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (CBSIC), with a correlation coefficient of −0.44. Namely, a reduction of autumn CBSIC is followed by a strengthened spring APO, and vice versa. This relationship is suggested to be linked by the North Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The reduced CBSIC in autumn can induce a low-level dipole pattern with an anomalous cyclonic circulation over the Bering Sea and an anomalous anticyclonic circulation to its south, conducive to SST cooling (warming) in the central-eastern (northwestern) Pacific. These SST anomalies persist and evolve into a horseshoe-shaped pattern in spring. The enhanced mid-latitude meridional SST gradient favors a northward shift of the subtropical jet stream, increasing (decreasing) the upper-tropospheric geopotential height over the mid-low latitudes of Asia (central-eastern Pacific), which aligns with the atmospheric situation of positive APO. Meanwhile, cold central-eastern Pacific SSTs induce anomalous subsidence, which links to anomalous ascent over Asia via a zonal vertical circulation. This configuration reduces (enhances) atmospheric heating over the central-eastern Pacific (Asia), resulting in a strengthened APO. This physical process derived from the reanalysis is visible in the ensemble simulations of Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Earth System Model version 1.5 (ACCESS-ESM1.5) that can reproduce the significant inverse relationship between autumn CBSIC and spring APO."

 The Mediterranean region is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change, which is expected to significantly impact densely populated coastal areas and alter the distribution and dynamics of its ecosystems. Recent research highlights an increasing frequency of extremes that are related to air temperature and precipitation. Taking into consideration that surface air temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century and mean precipitation is distinctly possible to decrease in dry, mid-latitude regions, we faced the challenge of analyzing four compound extreme climate indices over the Mediterranean region, during the period 1950–2018. These compound extreme climate indices – Cold/Dry (CD), Cold/Wet (CW), Warm/Dry (WD) and Warm/Wet (WW) - are defined by the exceedances of joint modes of air temperature and precipitation thresholds, using the 25th and 75th percentile to capture a broader range of extreme events. In this work, the means and the trends of the examined indices over the entire study period and for consecutive 30-year periods were quantified and evaluated.

 Ocean temperature anomalies can drive anomalous atmospheric circulation, further impacting High Mountain Asia’s glacier dynamics, but this teleconnection remains underexplored. Here we present robust interannual and multidecadal relationships between glacier mass balance over the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and the North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies, after removing anthropogenic warming trends. The annual sea surface temperature tripole pattern explains 33.6% of the interannual glacier mass variability, mediated by the atmospheric wave train. On multi-decadal timescales, the average glacier mass loss of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau accelerates from −0.16 ± 0.14 m w.e. yr−1 (1965–2000) to −0.25 ± 0.10 m w.e. yr−1 (2000–2020), coinciding with a phase shift of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Anomalous North Atlantic warming triggers mid-latitude Rossby waves and an anticyclone over the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, amplifying early-21st-century regional warming through reduced clouds and albedo to enhance glacier mass loss. These results emphasize the crucial role of natural variability in the North Atlantic ocean alongside anthropogenic forcing in comprehensively understanding glacier response to future climate changes.

 Excessive tree mortality is a global concern and remains poorly understood as it is a complex phenomenon. We lack global and temporally continuous coverage on tree mortality data. Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived from national inventories, are very sparse, and may not be standardized or spatially explicit. Earth observation data, combined with supervised machine learning, offer a promising approach to map overstory tree mortality in a consistent manner over space and time. However, global-scale machine learning requires broad training data covering a wide range of environmental settings and forest types. Low altitude observation platforms (e.g., drones or airplanes) provide a cost-effective source of training data by capturing high-resolution orthophotos of overstory tree mortality events at centimeter-scale resolution. Here, we introduce deadtrees.earth, an open-access platform hosting more than two thousand centimeter-resolution orthophotos, covering more than 1,000,000 ha, of which more than 58,000 ha are manually annotated with live/dead tree classifications. This community-sourced and rigorously curated dataset can serve as a comprehensive reference dataset to uncover tree mortality patterns from local to global scales using space-based Earth observation data and machine learning models. This will provide the basis to attribute tree mortality patterns to environmental changes or project tree mortality dynamics to the future. The open nature of deadtrees.earth, together with its curation of high-quality, spatially representative, and ecologically diverse data will continuously increase our capacity to uncover and understand tree mortality dynamics."

 Accurate estimates of precipitation time-series data are critical for governing multiple dimensions of water security, including water availability, disaster management and climate impact assessments. Reanalysis datasets have gained attention as promising alternatives to sparse gauge networks and satellite products, offering consistent and continuous spatio-temporal coverage. However, their fidelity over large, monsoon-influenced, and hydro-climatically diverse regions like India, remain insufficiently explored. Where such evaluations have been conducted, they are often limited to specific events, lacking the integration of decision-support systems for gaining deeper insights into their effectiveness. This study presents a systematic multi-scale evaluation of well-known state-of-the-art reanalysis precipitation datasets, ERA5, IMDAA, MERRA-2, and CFSR/CFSv2 across entire India over each grid as well as 25 basins. Using 34 years of data (1990–2024), we evaluate their performance rigorously through a set of 11 statistical metrics at daily, monthly, and seasonal scales. Key metrics include the linear correlation coefficient (CC), Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE; integrating correlation, variability, and bias), Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE; predictive skill), and Percent Bias (PBIAS; mean deviation). In addition, distributional differences are analyzed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a nonparametric approach for quantifying distributional shape. We introduce a spatially adaptive Multi-Criteria Decision-Making framework, combining Shannon Entropy and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to develop a hierarchical ranking of these datasets at the grid-scale and basin-scale. Our results reveal ERA5 as the most consistent dataset across all timescales (mean monthly CC: ∼0.81, KGE: ∼ 0.56, NSE ∼ 0.53, PBIAS: +6%). IMDAA aces in monsoon and mountainous basins (seasonal CC: 0.74, KGE: 0.49, and KDE shows widest IQR among all). Both CFSR/CFSv2 and MERRA-2 display low performance (KGE: 0.01 and 0.09) and significant bias (PBIAS: –29 % and –22 %). The study proposes a scalable evaluation framework transferable to other regions, providing actionable insights for hydrological applications and climate-resilient water management."

 Quality image input is fundamental to the quality of derived land cover products. Substantial time and effort are usually required to prepare images. Here, we present a novel and streamlined compositing algorithm that ingests Landsat Collection 2 Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and outputs cloud-free and gap-free composite imagery, which can be directly used for classification. This method leverages and improves the previous National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Virtual Median Value Point (VMVP) compositing method, the first part of the image preparation for NLCD 2019 operational production. The NLCD 2019 image preparation approach includes a second part, a residual cloud and cloud shadow detection and gap-filling method, to produce final cloud-free and gap-free composite imagery. The second part requires one clear reference image for each target year. Additional reference images are needed for producing reasonable observations for perennial ice/snow areas because Pixel QA (Quality Assessment) from ARD has difficulties differentiating ice/snow areas from clouds. Unlike the NLCD 2019 image preparation approach, our new compositing method, which is referred to as Automated VMVP (AVMVP), uses Landsat ARD as the only input and does not require reference images and extra steps. In this method, we developed new spectral filter criteria coupled with counts of clear observations using Pixel QA to identify potential cloud and cloud shadow observations on initially selected observations from the NLCD VMVP compositing algorithm. We also automate “gap-filling” using clear observations retrieved from a maximum of ±2 years around the target year when needed. Finally, a percentile-filtered compositing method was developed for the perennial ice/snow areas. All these steps are streamlined, pixel-based, and directly run on Landsat Collection 2 ARD. We have run successful tests on the conterminous United States (CONUS). Composite images derived from our innovative method were used to produce the CONUS Annual NLCD Collection 1 product suite that covers the period from 1985 to 2023."

 Accurate estimation of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) in ecologically and topographically complex regions remains a major challenge. This study evaluated four global GPP products—BESS, GOSIF, MOD17, and VPM—against eddy covariance (EC) observations from 11 flux towers in Southwest China. The region spans diverse vegetation types and climatic gradients, making it an ideal testbed for satellite-based GPP assessment. Site-level evaluation showed that GOSIF had the strongest correlation with GPP-EC (R2 > 0.61) but consistently overestimated GPP, especially during summer. BESS achieved the lowest RMSE (2.02 g C/m2/d) and better captured interannual variation, including drought impacts. MOD17 and VPM tended to underestimate summer peaks, particularly in evergreen broadleaf forests. Seasonal analysis revealed that all four products performed better in the non-growing season, with BESS showing the highest growing-season accuracy (R2 = 0.39, RMSE = 2.44 g C/m2/d). GOSIF notably overestimated seasonal totals, especially in shrubland and grassland ecosystems. Spatially, mean annual GPP estimates varied by over 30 % among products, with GOSIF being the highest (1497.32 g C/m2) and BESS being the lowest (1109.73 g C/m2). The vegetation-type analysis revealed the highest level of agreement in deciduous broadleaf forests, while the greatest discrepancies were observed in open shrublands. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current GPP products in a mountainous, heterogeneous region. Incorporating physiological indicators such as solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), improving model parameterization of phenology, and accounting for local environmental stressors are essential for enhancing GPP estimation in Southwest China and similar landscapes."

 Impacts of local circulations and their interactions on ozone in north Hangzhou Bay area on June 5, 2019 were investigated using surface observations and three-dimensional air quality simulations. The results indicated that although emission levels in cities such as Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou were relatively low, their annual ozone concentrations remained significantly higher than the average across the Yangtze River Delta. In addition to the influences of temperature and emissions, variations in pollutant dispersion conditions played a critical role in shaping the ozone concentration characteristics in this region. Local circulations and their interactions were identified as the primary causes of the episode. The coupling of lake-land breeze circulation, sea-land breeze circulation (SLBC), and urban heat island circulation (UHIC) resulted in the formation of a significant wind convergence zone in North Hangzhou Bay area, particularly in cities such as Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, located near Lake Taihu. This interaction notably influenced the spatiotemporal distribution of ozone in the boundary layer. During the daytime, the lake breeze played a dominant role in maintaining the wind convergence zone. It transported pollutants to the surrounding regions of Lake Taihu, resulting in reduced pollution concentrations over the lake and worsened air quality in surrounding areas. The stronger SLBC at noon contributed to a reduction in pollution in upwind regions but hinders downwind dispersion. The role of the UHIC is to maintain and enhance the surface convergence zone, making it easier for the accumulation of ozone pollutants in areas in North Hangzhou Bay area."

Our results help to improve understanding of the secondary species formation under decreasing anthropogenic emissions. 
 Long-term data on PM2.5 chemical composition provide essential information for evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution control measures and understanding the evolving mechanisms of secondary species formation in the real atmosphere. This study presented field measurements of PM2.5 and its chemical composition at a regional background site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) from 2007 to 2020. PM2.5 concentration declined significantly from 87.1 ± 15.5 to 34.0 ± 11.3 µg m−3 (−4.0 µg m−3 yr−1). The proportion of secondary species increased from 57 % to 73 % with the improvement in air quality. Among these species, sulfate (SO42-) showed a sharp decline, while nitrate (NO3-) exhibited a moderate decrease. Consequently, the proportion of NO3- in 2020 doubled relative to 2007. In addition, we further found that SO42- reduction (−10 % yr−1) lagged behind SO2 reduction (−13 % yr−1), while NO3- reduction (−6 % yr−1) outpaced that of NO2 (−3 % yr−1). These contrasting trends were associated with an increase in sulfur oxidation rate (SOR) and a decrease in nitrogen oxidation rate (NOR). Changes in PM2.5 chemical composition also influenced aerosol physicochemical properties, such as aerosol pH (0.04 yr−1), aerosol liquid water content (ALWC, −1.1 µg m−3 yr−1), and the light extinction coefficient (−21.44 Mm−1 yr−1). Given important roles of aerosol acidity and ALWC in the heterogeneous reactions, these changes may further inhibit the formation of secondary species in the atmosphere, particularly secondary organic aerosols."

The correlation coefficient between early autumn BKS SIC and the EAWM index dropped from −0.521 during 1979–2007 to −0.101 during 2008–2023. This dramatically weakened linkage is attributed to the continuous and substantial reduction in BKS SIC that has led to nearly ice‐free conditions and a marked decrease in its interannual variability. Compared to 1979–2007, the associated atmospheric circulation anomalies during 2008–2023 show a diminished tropospheric response and a fundamental reversal in the stratospheric pathway.

In this study, the potential link of Eurasian snow with TP snow is detected. Excessive October–November (ON) north Asian snow cover can boost the upward wave activity and thus heat the stratospheric polar atmosphere, which subsequently gives rise to an attenuated stratospheric polar vortex (SPV). Meantime, the downward propagation of this SPV anomaly in boreal winter when the troposphere–stratosphere interaction is active induces an anomalous horizontal wave train in the middle troposphere. Such a wave train generates an anomalous anticyclone around the TP, facilitating the decreased local snowfall and snow depth in January. These processes indicate a connection of the mid‐latitude Asia–Arctic–TP via the vertical and horizontal wave activity and effectively supply a predictive indicator for the mid‐winter TP snow depth."

Elevated dissolved Ge/Si signatures relative to bedrock in this young system are associated with formation of high‐Si amorphous phase(s) that preferentially exclude Ge. Over several years, dissolved Ge/Si ratios decrease, approaching those of natural watersheds, consistent with a shift toward formation of Ge‐enriched secondary phases. Our study points to the critical control of secondary phase speciation on Ge/Si partitioning, while in contrast, stable silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) in the same samples show fractionation comparable to natural systems. Paired consideration of Ge/Si and δ30Si tracers may thus offer a previously unrecognized means of interrogating the progression of secondary phase speciation in young landscapes, for example, following deglaciation, volcanism, and landslides, and in engineering applications such as enhanced weathering."

We demonstrate the persistence of the strong‐field branch, preserving the expected force balance of Earth's core, and provide scaling laws governing its onset as parameters move toward values appropriate for the Geodynamo. We introduce a new output parameter, based on dynamically important parts of rotational and magnetic forces, that captures expected O(1) $O(1)$ values of strong‐field solutions throughout input parameter space.

This study focuses on forest and grassland ecosystems and uses theoretical recovery rate as a measure to assess climate impacts on their resilience over China. Our findings reveal that vegetation resilience varies across aridity‐dependent climate zones, with each zone showing different resilience–aridity relationships. Particularly, semi‐arid zones exhibit the lowest vegetation resilience, where the forest resilience declines as inter‐annual temperature and precipitation variability increases. In zones with sufficient water, the forest resilience remains stable. Grassland resilience decreases with increasing precipitation variability, but is insensitive to inter‐annual temperature variability. Future projections highlight the potential threat of climate change to regions encompassing more than 20% of vegetated areas, particularly in the forest‐grassland ecotones of North China.

We classified 812 historical AR events into Gusty‐Wet, Gusty‐Dry, Calm‐Wet, and Calm‐Dry groups to evaluate differences in precipitation behavior. ARs with stronger winds and higher moisture content exhibit higher precipitation efficiency (PE) and greater integrated water vapor (IWV). Regionally, Calm ARs show higher IWV accumulation due to slower inland transport and reduced PE. Projections indicate increases in storm‐total (sub‐Clausius‐Clapeyron (CC) scaling) and maximum 3‐hourly precipitation (super‐CC scaling) across all groups, with the most pronounced changes in Gusty‐Wet and Calm‐Wet ARs.

Global P‐wave back‐projection captures the overall rupture extent and energy evolution, while fault‐limited regional Rayleigh‐wave back‐projection using data from the dense Southern Yunnan array in China resolves finer segmentation and timing. The event's low apparent stress and its occurrence along a long, straight, strain‐accumulated fault segment are consistent with a mature fault system and supershear rupture behavior.

To understand the radiation and related source processes, we investigate rupture behaviors of four nearby M5+ events. We find that the 5 May 2023 MW 5.7 event exhibits similar characteristic radiation, resulting in a relatively low source spectral decay rate. Apparent moment‐rate functions and dynamic rupture simulations, constrained from near‐source waveform data, consistently suggest a northeastward rupture with multiple asperities.

The underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely elusive. Analyzing observations and model outputs, we find the decadal ATL originates in the South Atlantic. During its positive phase, the cold tongue warming, triggering atmospheric Rossby wave train, weakens the St. Helena anticyclone, which enhances wind and cools sea surface temperature over the Southwestern Atlantic, leading to the positive phase of the South Atlantic Ocean Dipole. Meanwhile, the weakened anticyclone reduces the transport of the subtropical cell, suppressing the equatorial upwelling, which amplifies the initial cold tongue warming. The phase shift of the decadal ATL is attributed to an eastward propagation of thermocline displacements at 3°S–15°S, induced by a propagation of local wind stress curl anomalies in response to combined effects of the equatorial and mid‐latitude air‐sea coupling."

We compiled Archean and Paleoproterozoic microbialite occurrences and depositional environment information to assess how microbialite development and preservation changed across settings. Microbially induced sedimentary structures formed a significant part of the record, but may be undercounted as they were identified mostly in units that also contained stromatolites. While broad trends in abundance resembled previous compilations, critically, we found that more microbialites formed in tidal environments than subtidal marine. The proportion of terrestrially influenced (including tidal) microbialites peaked during periods of craton development and following the Great Oxidation Event and Huronian Glaciations. These findings highlight the importance of continental landmasses and tectonic processes in defining the distribution and preservation of early life."

Logarithmic reflectivity has also been used for data assimilation without being questioned or well validated. However, fundamental limitations exist with directly assimilating logarithmic reflectivity, such as strong nonlinearity of the observation forward operator and the fact that the impacts of small reflectivity values are amplified, leading to exaggerated increments when mapped back into physical space. In this study, we power‐transform both reflectivity and hydrometeor mixing ratios to alleviate the aforementioned issues with using conventional logarithmic reflectivity. Forecast evaluation across eight severe convection events demonstrates that applying the Box‐Cox power transformations to both reflectivity and hydrometeor mixing ratios effectively reduces the nonlinearity between the observations and control variables. This approach significantly improves analyses of model hydrometeor variables and forecasts of composite reflectivity and hourly precipitation."

These isotope patterns are thought to reflect oscillations in atmospheric and shallow‐marine O2, which promoted animal diversification events. However, the driver for oxygenation pulses is unclear. Here we show that these synchronous carbon‐sulfur isotope cycles and marine oxygenation pulses can be driven by long‐period orbital forcing through effects on continental weathering and nutrient delivery. The impact of orbital forcing is explored using a combined climate‐biogeochemical model. When forced with latitudinally‐resolved insolation signals, the model produces long‐term variations in nutrient weathering and carbon burial, which reproduces the co‐variation of carbon‐sulfur isotopes. We conclude that the oxygen‐driven evolutionary changes in the early Cambrian can be explained by recurrent nutrient inputs to the ocean, resulting from climate change caused by long‐period orbital cycles."

The nighttime CI occurrence over Hainan Island requires warm and moist environmental winds, which primarily generate strong convergence in the southwestern‐to‐eastern offshore region, where nighttime CI occurrence is first locked. Concurrently, the intrinsically phase‐locked inertial oscillation of sea breezes over the South China Sea causes strong convergence between sea breezes and land breezes in the southern‐to‐eastern offshore region, where nighttime CI occurrence is second locked. Ultimately, the coupling between upper‐level easterlies and low‐level environmental winds induces strong vertical wind shear over the southwestern and southern sides of the island, where CI development is highly suppressed.

Here, we extend this analysis to the Alaska subduction zone, using 2,567 high‐quality teleseismic SWS measurements from 195 broadband stations. As was found in Japan, the observed SWS patterns in Alaska depend on earthquake backazimuth. The fast‐S polarization directions are either trench parallel or perpendicular in southeastern Alaska and form a prominent circular pattern in central Alaska. We found that a dipping anisotropic slab following the Slab 2.0 geometry, with 30% shear anisotropy, and exhibiting tilted transverse isotropy with a symmetry axis normal to the slab interface, predicts both the fast‐S polarizations and delay times (δt = 1.0–1.5 s).

However, understanding of how these actors interact with the institutions and infrastructure systems in which they are embedded to drive change is still limited. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to understand factors shaping actors' political behavior and how power dynamics influence their ability to create change. This study addresses this gap by combining analysis of actors' narratives about water issues and governance with dynamical systems modeling of the socio‐hydrologic system in the context of California's San Joaquin Valley. Through interviews and focus groups with growers, advocacy groups, and rural residents, distinct narratives emerge around water issues and power dynamics. Modeling strategies that would maximize each actor's water access reveals that existing structures incentivize strategies that would mainly benefit larger growers, and thus conflict with the goals of environmental justice narratives. Comparing these modeled strategies with actors' actual strategies also reveals disparities in different actors' ability to pursue the “optimal” strategy. These findings highlight how system structures entrench certain interests as well as the potential of narratives for shaping strategies aimed at long‐term transformation."
10.1029/2024GH001099,False,GeoHealth,该研究主要关注加州学龄儿童中，因PM2.5暴露导致的哮喘发病率的社会经济差异。它分析了不同社会经济背景的社区中PM2.5的暴露水平，以及这种暴露对儿童哮喘发病率的影响。研究发现，弱势社区的儿童PM2.5暴露水平更高，导致更高的哮喘发病率。虽然研究涉及空气质量（PM2.5），但它更侧重于公共卫生和社会公平问题，而不是大气环境遥感技术本身，如卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['PM2.5', 'Air Quality', 'Health Disparities', 'Emission Sources', 'Vulnerable Communities']",Hyung Joo Lee;Keita Ebisu;Hye‐Youn Park,Socioeconomic Disparities of Asthma Incidence Attributable to PM2.5 Exposures for Schoolchildren in California,"This study investigated the socioeconomic disparities of asthma incidence attributable to ambient particulate matter in aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) exposures among schoolchildren in California, U.S. We found that schoolchildren attending public schools in more vulnerable communities, characterized by higher proportions of people of color, low educational attainment, and poverty, experienced elevated PM2.5 exposures by 2.07–2.96 μg/m3. The disproportionate PM2.5 exposures were likely driven by higher traffic‐related emissions and point‐source facility emissions in these communities. Using school‐specific PM2.5 concentrations, student enrollment numbers, and model‐estimated (not directly observed) baseline age‐specific asthma incidence rates, we calculated that the asthma incidence rate attributable to 2016 PM2.5 exposures was 562 new cases per 100,000 schoolchildren [95% confidence interval (CI) = 311–854]. In absolute terms (i.e., asthma incidence), it was equivalent to 34,537 PM2.5‐related new asthma cases (95% CI = 19,090–52,493) among all schoolchildren. On average, more vulnerable communities experienced 140 excess new asthma cases per 100,000 schoolchildren (i.e., the difference in average asthma cases per 100,000 schoolchildren between more and less vulnerable groups) across all demographic factors considered. Examining health disparities separately by each demographic factor revealed that race/ethnicity was associated with the largest disparities (209 new cases per 100,000 schoolchildren), followed by educational attainment (128) and poverty (85). Our findings indicate the substantial socioeconomic disparities of asthma incidence attributable to PM2.5 among schoolchildren in California. Addressing these health disparities could benefit from sustained and long‐term emission reduction strategies, such as adopting zero‐emission vehicles, which contribute to lower PM2.5 levels."

This study investigates the spatiotemporal changes in water features and quality of three key drinking water source lakes‐Rawal, Simly, and Khanpur (RSK), located in and around Islamabad, Pakistan. Using Level 2 Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data from 1991 to 2020, changes in lake surface area were assessed through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Thresholding and geospatial analysis in ArcGIS 10.8 were used to extract and visualize water bodies and surface feature changes. The study found that lake surface areas were directly linked to rainfall levels and decreased with rising temperatures especially during 1991, 2000 2010, and 2020. Water quality was assessed using standard laboratory procedures. Notably, higher bacterial counts were recorded during the wet season, indicating increased microbial contamination likely due to surface runoff. Among the heavy metals analyzed (Fe, F, As, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Pb, Ni, B, Cd, P, Hg), only boron (B), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) were detected above background levels, though within permissible limits. The study highlights the significant influence of climatic variables on both the physical extent and microbial quality of drinking water lakes. These findings offer critical insights for policymakers and water resource managers, providing a replicable framework for monitoring and managing similar reservoirs in other climate‐sensitive regions."

 Decarbonizing global shipping is crucial to achieving international climate goals. However, efforts in this field may be inhibited by geopolitical risks that profoundly affect global shipping. Here, we use natural language processing on an over 500-million-word corpus to quantify the shipping decarbonization attitudes of 52 countries. Using a causal inference approach, we provide evidence that geopolitical risks exert a substantial and statistically significant negative impact on national decarbonization willingness. This dampening effect threatens to delay the International Maritime Organization’s timeline for zero-carbon shipping. Causal evidence also reveals that countries facing geopolitical tend to prioritize economic efficiency over environmental concerns, particularly those with high levels of maritime trade, economic development, and carbon intensity. We further validated these shifts by analyzing carbon dioxide emissions of global vessel navigation. This study highlights the urgent need to bridge geopolitical divides to achieve the ambitious target of zero-carbon emissions in global shipping by mid-century.

Wuite;T. Nagler;M. Hetzenecker;H. Rott,Ten years of polar ice velocity mapping using Copernicus Sentinel-1,"•Sentinel-1 provides ice velocity at unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage. •We developed enhanced processing lines to generate optimized ice velocity products. •The processing includes combinations of offset tracking and SAR interferometry. •Examples from a 10-year portfolio of Sentinel-1 ice velocity products are shown. •These range from single glaciers to full ice sheet extent at various timescales. 
 The Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, launched in 2014, has provided a step change in the capabilities of polar satellite earth observation, addressing the challenge of limited Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data availability over ice sheets that existed previously. Since its launch, S1 has provided regular acquisitions every 6 to 12 days in Greenland, Antarctica, and other polar regions. This has enabled the set-up of an operational monitoring system for generating time series of key glaciological variables, such as ice velocity and ice discharge, with high spatial and temporal resolution. Leveraging the extensive S1 SAR archive, we have developed algorithms to generate detailed maps and dense time series of glacier and ice sheet velocity now spanning more than 10 years. Here we describe the processing pipeline and highlight some of the key results. The velocity maps can be and have been used for a wide range of applications in various studies. Our results demonstrate the S1 mission's exceptional ability for comprehensive monitoring of flow velocities on glaciers and ice sheets, thereby providing crucial data for ice dynamics and climate modelling."
