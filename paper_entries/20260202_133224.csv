In this study, an ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]), was introduced to regulate the interfacial polymerization between hydrazine (Hz) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC). This approach successfully fabricated an Hz-based polyamide RO membrane with superior structural characteristics and a significant antifouling performance. Compared to conventional polyamide membranes prepared with m-phenylenediamine, the Hz monomer, featuring a linear molecular structure and higher reactivity, generated a smoother and more hydrophilic membrane surface. Meanwhile, the IL effectively retarded the diffusion of Hz through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, achieving a more controllable polymerization process and, thereby, the formation of an ultrathin selective layer with low surface roughness and narrow pore size distribution. The resulting membrane exhibited significantly enhanced water permeability while maintaining an excellent salt rejection. Due to both favorable surface properties and uniform microstructure, the membrane exhibited universal resistance to various types of organic foulants, such as surfactants with opposite charges, demonstrated by minimal flux decline during fouling and high permeability recovery after simple cleaning. This membrane design strategy and the revealed antifouling mechanisms provide new avenues for developing high-performance RO membranes adequate for complex wastewater systems."

Cloud controlling factor analysis can observationally constrain cloud feedback. For the first time, we use separate rather than unified frameworks to assess high‐ and low‐cloud feedbacks and constrain the net cloud feedback and subsequently, the ECS. We find a robustly positive cloud feedback (i.e., a negative feedback is <0.5 ${< } 0.5$% probable), indicating that clouds amplify global warming. We assess the individual and combined impacts of our cloud feedback constraints on ECS using three approaches. Two indicate an upward ECS shift with reduced uncertainty, preserving ECS–feedback correlations but using cloud feedback as a single line of evidence. The third, a Bayesian framework combining multiple lines of evidence, also suggests a higher ECS but with a smaller increase and broader confidence range."

Stallard,Atmospheric Ion‐Neutral Coupling as a Potential Driver for Saturn's Magnetospheric Antisunward Electric Field,"Saturn's inner magnetosphere contains a weak antisunward electric field that has influenced a wide array of different aspects of the magnetospheric conditions in that region. Previously, these currents have been explained as being caused by magnetospheric drivers. Here, we identify an alternative source for the currents, showing that the antisunward electric field could originate within Saturn's upper atmosphere. Because Saturn's auroral region is offset toward midnight, this also offsets sub‐corotating ions from Saturn's rotational pole, creating a differential flow with the surrounding thermosphere, with ions super‐rotating relative to the neutral atmosphere near noon and sub‐rotating relative to the neutral atmosphere near midnight. These ion motions generate antisunward ionospheric Pedersen currents that close via antisunward magnetospheric currents. The location of our sketch ion flows match with past measurements of magnetospheric ion flows, confirming the atmosphere as a potential driver, and suggesting the antisunward currents cannot explain Saturn's secondary midnight auroral arc."

An AI Downscaling Framework for Local‐Circulation‐Dominated Flow Over Taiwan's Complex Topography,"Typical AI downscaling models ingest large data sets, obscuring physical insight and straining computational resources. Guided by meteorological theory, a compact yet physically informative input set alleviates these limitations. Analyses of TaiwanVVM simulations reveals that the synoptic‐scale upstream sounding largely controls the evolution of meso‐γ $\gamma $‐scale circulations over complex terrain. Accordingly, AI models are trained to reconstruct 2 km‐resolution near‐surface winds from a single upstream sounding. A sounding‐to‐image variational autoencoder reproduces the diurnal circulation with one‐third the mean square error (MSE) of previous architectures. Jacobian‐based sensitivity analysis quantifies the influence of each sounding element: the model depends primarily on wind speed near 560 m, lower‐level wind direction, and time of day when estimating winds at 100 m, confirming physically consistent learning. The lean input also enables a transformer‐based architecture, which further reduces MSE and improves generalization, especially in rugged mountain. These results demonstrate that compact, physically grounded inputs yield interpretable AI downscaling."

Typically, positive/negative SCs occur at low latitudes due to enhancements/reductions in SWDP. However, anomalous dawn‐side SCs of opposite polarity were recently reported during the 10 May 2024, superstorm [Nilam et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL117032]. This study examines SC responses to positive and negative pressure discontinuities on the May 10 and October 10 storms under similar storm phases and local times. Both events consistently revealed anomalous dawn‐side low latitude SCs opposite to those at other longitudes. We suggest the main impulse of the Disturbance Polar (DP) field extending equatorward as the most likely source. Under highly compressed background magnetosphere conditions, field‐aligned currents associated with DP fields can shift to lower L‐shells, producing such anomalous SCs at dawn‐side low latitudes. These findings provide new insights into dawn‐side magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling during intense storms."

Numerical modeling and satellite observations were used to examine the atmospheric and oceanic conditions leading to this extreme event. Sensitivity experiments show that warm SST anomalies enhanced moisture supply and intensified convection, producing larger and more intense convective storms. The warmer SSTs increased both moisture availability and storm intensity. The sensitivity model runs show higher precipitable water across much of the domain in the week preceding 16 April. Results indicate that, while atmospheric dynamics played a key role, SST‐driven moisture was the primary driver of the 16 April heavy precipitation. These findings underscore the role of ocean‐atmosphere interactions in driving extreme weather in arid regions."

However, the physical coupling between EEJ and Sq westward currents on the polar side of the vortex focus remains poorly understood. Here, we present observational evidence that there are significant correlations between EEJ variability and Sq westward currents variability in both morning and afternoon sectors, with correlation coefficients of −0.87 during March in the afternoon and −0.67 during May in the morning, respectively. The seasonal variations of the correlations exhibit a morning‐afternoon asymmetry. Specifically, the correlations in the afternoon are stronger during the hemispheric summer season, whereas in the morning correlations show a slightly semiannual variation that are stronger approximately during the equinoxes. The results are helpful for understanding of current closure and global ionospheric electrodynamics."

We apply rock surface luminescence dating to a bedrock scarp on the Huashan fault in central China, using OSL‐depth profiles (DPs) from multiple heights. Results reveal two coseismic displacements of 6.8 and >1.0 m. The two phases of exposure ages inferred from OSL‐DPs of the bedrock fault surface above ground (0.4 ± 0.3 and 1.1 ± 0.4 ka) are consistent with burial ages of slices from the fault surface covered by the colluvial wedge. These ages also correlate with historical earthquakes, including the 1556 Huaxian M ∼ 8.5 event with slip of 6.8 m, confirming rupture of the western Huashan fault. A magnitude of M8.3 inferred from multiple fault rupture lengths agrees with seismic intensity estimates. The fitted OSL‐DPs of bedrock samples buried or being buried by the colluvial wedge, together with the burial ages of slices, reveal the exposure and burial history of the wedge."

An important parameter for quantifying the ice volume contained in these deformation features is the keel shape. We use ice draft data collected by submarine sonar between 1960 and 2005 to classify keel geometry based on the cross‐sectional area, keel depth, and keel width to show that geometry varies with draft relative to the surrounding undeformed ice. Small, bummock‐sized features are more likely to be cusp‐shaped, while larger ridge keels are more likely trapezoids. This is consistent across decades, regions, and between first‐ and multi‐year ice. Though comparatively rare, the deepest keels (≥ ${\ge} $8 m) are more likely to be triangular or cusped with increasing maximum keel depth. These findings are valuable for quantifying the impact of sea ice ridging on volume retrievals."

Keevil,New Analytical Model for Forecasting Turbidity Current Run‐Up Heights: Implications for Risk Assessment of Seafloor Infrastructure on Submarine Slopes,"Turbidity currents are destructive flows that are hazardous to critical seafloor infrastructure on submarine slopes because run‐up heights can be 10–100s of meters, as their relative density is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than terrestrial flows. Currently, risk analysis is hindered by poor prediction of run‐up heights that are mainly derived from confined 2D experiments, and/or numerical models, and are restricted to a specific configuration whereby the flow strikes topographic barriers orthogonally. Here, a new analytical model is presented, informed by and validated against physical experiments, which predicts run‐up heights for flows encountering three‐dimensional slopes as a function of any slope angle, and incidence angle, of the impinging turbidity current. This has important implications for reducing geohazards by informing routing and positioning of seafloor infrastructure, and for more accurately interpreting submarine landscapes and their deposits."

We compared stability between monoculture RB and diverse tropical rainforests (RF) using 37 years of satellite‐derived gross primary productivity across three metrics: long‐term temporal stability, resilience, and resistance to climate anomalies. Despite intensive management driving growth in RB, RF remained superior long‐term temporal stability and resilience, particularly at higher latitudes, likely reflecting their biodiversity and structural complexity. RB exhibited stronger resistance to temperature anomalies through intensive management but lower water resistance. Systematic trade‐offs emerged among stability dimensions, with environmental gradients modulating these differences, temperature amplified disparities while precipitation reduced them. These findings indicate that ongoing conversion of RF to RB threatens regional ecosystem stability, especially in marginal areas, underscoring the importance of forests conservation and sustainable plantation management."

The FY‐3G hydrometeor retrieval algorithm utilizes the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) as its core module. It incorporates PMR‐derived graupel and rainwater data as first guess for retrieving cloud parameters from MWRI‐RM observations. Since the ARMS includes the graupel in its forward simulations, FY‐3G algorithm can retrieve more accurate distributions of graupel water and rain water through radar‐informed 1D‐Var retrieval (One‐dimensional variational). After incorporating the PMR results, it becomes evident that the profile of rainwater content has increased with the more detail vertical structures.

Detrital zircons of Triassic ages were derived from the Qinling Orogen. They show an increase in Eu/Eu* ratios and a marked decrease in εHf(t) values. These geochemical trends suggest an increase in crustal thickness from ca. 40−50 km to >60 km in the Late Triassic in the Qinling Orogen and reveal a strong mountain building event with surface elevations of up to 5,000 m.

Understanding historical trends in emissions and atmospheric concentrations is crucial for quantifying their impact. The first measurements of atmospheric CFCs were performed in‐situ by Lovelock in 1970. We have analyzed historical 1951 solar absorption infrared spectra, recorded at Jungfraujoch, to retrieve the CFC–12 $\text{CFC}\text{\mbox{--}}\,12$ surface mole fraction. We compare to routine solar absorption measurements starting at Jungfraujoch in 1986 and emission‐based forward models. The surface mole fraction derived from the historical spectra is (26.1±18.5) $(\mathrm{26.1}\pm \mathrm{18.5})$ pptv $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{v}$ compared to (9.2±0.2) $(\mathrm{9.2}\pm \mathrm{0.2})$ pptv $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{v}$ from a reconstructed history model, and (7.00±0.28) $(\mathrm{7.00}\pm \mathrm{0.28})$ pptv $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{v}$ from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment 12‐Box model. The 1951 measurement and model values agree within error bars although the models may be biased low due to unreported emissions.

However, the impacts of precipitation characteristics on wet deposition SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ and its hysteresis to precursor emission controls remain inadequately quantified. Multiyear (2010–2024) rainwater chemistry, air pollutants, and meteorological parameters were monitored in Wuhan. Random forest models were applied to weather‐normalized sulfur and nitrogen wet deposition. Trend analysis using the normalized data revealed that 1‐unit reduction in precursor emissions declined 0.14–0.48‐unit sulfur and nitrogen wet deposition. This hysteresis was driven partly by enhanced wet scavenging associated with increased light rain frequency, as the scavenging ratios of atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen compounds increased by 1.9%–10.5% yr−1 from 2016 (2019) to 2024. Light rain with a rate ≤16.5, 17.3, and 6.8 mm d−1 most strongly influenced wet deposition trends of NH4+, NO3−, and SO42−, respectively, identified by the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach.

Due to the approximate spectral invariance of scattering by clouds, this combination of measurements is sensitive to the mean number of scattering events experienced by visible radiation. Using a hierarchy of synthetic cloud fields ranging from idealized cloud geometries, stochastically generated cloud fields with idealized microphysics, and those produced by Large Eddy Simulations (LES), we demonstrate that the combination of visible reflectance and the mean number of scattering events skillfully predicts the in‐cloud mean of the optical depth at both 8 and 1 km resolution, with coefficients of determination exceeding 0.92 and 0.86, respectively. Further out‐of‐sample testing on LES cloud fields show that a multi‐linear regression trained on stochastically generated cloud fields reduces the relative root‐mean‐square error from 29% under the plane‐parallel homogeneous assumption to less than 14% at 6 km resolution. Biases in 1 km resolution retrievals of trade cumulus are reduced from −74% to −40%. Uncertainties from instrumentation and atmospheric correction add up to 20% additional uncertainty in cloud optical depth for the LES cloud fields. With this method, the PACE mission can provide the first global estimate of cloud optical depth that accounts for cloud heterogeneity."

The re‐initialization approach is used to constrain the background fields under the same parameterizations. The features analyzed here include mean spatial distribution, diurnal cycle, and evolution of every precipitation event. At coarser resolutions, MPAS‐A misrepresents precipitation duration, with excessive rainfall persistence due to overly strong instability and weak intensity. Finer resolutions (especially 3 km) markedly improve sub‐daily precipitation over the TP by resolving event durations, reducing the drizzle‐like overestimation of long‐duration rainfall at 60 km. These gains stem from sharper capture of onset‐time forcing peaks (surface heating and moisture convergence) and faster instability removal, together with a weaker, non‐linear dependence on moisture convergence and an enhanced representation of cessation. Overall, ∼10 km yields robust improvements with fewer artifacts, while 3 km offers the strongest sub‐daily benefits but demands additional high‐resolution observations for validation."

Between dark winter in late February/early March to completely sunlit conditions in May the δ13C of many organic acids increased: (a) oxalic acid (C2) from −23‰ to −5‰, (b) malonic acid (C3, a precursor of C2) from −28‰ to −17‰, and (c) glyoxylic acid (ωC2, −18‰ to −10‰), also a precursor of C2. In contrast, glyoxal, another precursor of oxalic acid and succinic acid, showed a wide variation from dark to light and no clear seasonal trend. Concentrations of C2, ωC2 and C3 declined when their δ13C increased in April to May. The enrichment of 13C occurred during the preferential breaking of 12C–12C over 12C–13C bond in oxalic and other acids as solar radiation increased during polar sunrise. Photochemically driven variations in the isotopic enrichment of 13C of C2 and related compounds that are a minor fraction of aerosol total carbon (TC), nevertheless they are the main source of variation in the δ13C values of TC during polar sunrise in the Arctic because the weakness of 12C–12C bond compared to 12C–13C bond is more pronounced for carboxylic acids than other species contributing to TC. This study on 13C signature of these species allows to gain information on their poorly known atmospheric budget in spite of the fact that they are ubiquitous in the atmosphere."

Currently, ethanolamine (MEA) is recognized as the most promising atmospheric organic amine for promoting the formation of MSA‐based clusters. Given the complexity of multi‐component aerosol nucleation mechanisms, it is essential to explore the potential of other gaseous substances participating in the MSA‐MEA‐driven NPF. Formic acid (FA), the most abundant organic acid in both the atmospheric gas phase and particulate phase, warrants urgent investigation regarding its potential role in aerosol nucleation. Herein, we investigate the enhancement potential of FA on MSA‐MEA‐driven NPF within the troposphere. The results indicate that the enhancing effect of FA emerges in the lower troposphere (T ≤ 278.15 K) when [FA] ≥ 1010 cm−3. The enhancement strength, RFA, increases with decreasing temperature and increasing FA concentration, reaching a factor of up to 21.54 at 258.15 K, and is most significant in regions with high MEA emissions.

The first mode exhibits a monopole pattern characterized by coherent AR enhancement, associated with a low‐level anomalous anticyclone and an intensified western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH). The anomalous anticyclone is maintained by the meridional wave train induced from the western tropical Pacific under the anomalous Indo‐West Pacific Walker circulation triggered by the negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the southern Indian Ocean (IO), which is closely linked to the IO Basin mode. The second mode presents a zonal dipole pattern featured by opposite AR anomalies, corresponding to a pair of low‐level anomalous cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and the northeastward WNPSH retreat. The dipole circulation is mainly sustained by the meridional wave train excited from the Maritime Continent (MC) when cold tropical eastern Pacific SSTAs and warm MC SSTAs generate an anomalous Pacific Walker circulation, accompanied by the combined effect of a wave train from the mid‐latitudes. The second mode is significantly modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Particularly, the dominant EA AR mode varied from the monopole to dipole modes around 1977/1978 due to changes in oceanic forcing from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean, leading to a shift in EA AR frequency from an increasing trend to a relatively stable state."

While precipitation has traditionally been considered the dominant driver, recent studies suggest an increasing influence of evaporative demand. However, it remains uncertain whether these findings represent individual regional cases or a boarder emerging global trend. To address this, we developed a systematic framework using a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) variant experiment to attribute drought drivers across 292 major global basins. Our historical analysis (1970–2024) reveals a widespread global transition: 48.1% of the global basin area (6.43 × 107 km2) transitioned from precipitation‐dominated to evaporative demand‐dominated drought. This transition, accelerating after 2000, originated in arid continental interiors and expanded outwards, leaving precipitation‐dominated areas only one‐tenth the size of evaporative demand‐dominated ones. Future projections from bias‐corrected coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 models indicate this transition is largely irreversible, as over 80% of historically transitioned basins are projected to maintain evaporative demand‐dominated through 2100. Basins that have not yet transitioned are also projected to transition toward either evaporative demand‐dominated or precipitation and evaporative demand co‐dominated drought states. Under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 5‐8.5 scenario, the global area of evaporative demand‐dominated droughts is projected to be 17.6% larger by 2100 than under SSP1‐2.6 scenario. These findings highlight the urgent need for both climate mitigation to slow these transitions and proactive adaptation to address the new reality of drought driven by evaporative demand."

 Accurately predicting disease progression remains a major challenge in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we show that a biomarker-integrated prognostic staging system can stratify progression risk across the disease course by jointly incorporating cognitive status, established risk factors, plasma biomarkers, and neuroimaging measures. In the K-ROAD cohort (N = 1,263), the dominant prognostic contributors varied by clinical context—GFAP in cognitively unimpaired individuals, hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment, and age in dementia—while plasma phosphorylated tau-217 provided consistent secondary prognostic information across stages. Outcome-specific staging captured clinically meaningful gradients of progression risk and informed construction of a unified six-stage framework (Stage 0–IVB) with distinct inflection points of accelerated decline. External validation in the ADNI cohort (N = 290) demonstrated consistent patterns of worsening prognosis, particularly in early and intermediate stages. This system provides a clinically interpretable approach to risk stratification and may serve as an exploratory framework for biomarker-integrated prognostic stratification in AD. This study develops and validates a prognostic staging framework for Alzheimer’s disease by integrating cognitive status with blood-based biomarkers, and neuroimaging data, to improve risk stratification across the disease continuum."

 Detecting solid waste dumps (SWDs) is crucial for a sustainable environment and public health. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant potential in detecting SWDs from high-spatial resolution remote sensing images (RSIs). However, training a SWD detection model necessitates annotated data that encompasses diverse geographical distributions and styles. Following the conventional approach of manually labeling data prior to model training is both costly and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework for the detection of SWDs. An initial model is trained using public datasets of Dumpsites, solid waste aerial detection (SWAD), and AerialWaste to identify potential samples from extensive unlabeled RSIs, which are then validated by experts for data expansion and model reinforcement. Specifically, multi-view inference is introduced to enhance the applicability of the model for real-world SWD detection tasks by integrating inference results from multiple style-transformed images. Moreover, we utilize adaptive thresholds that are dynamically calculated from inference results in each round to select potential SWDs, all while maintaining a low computational cost. With the proposed framework, we construct the LHRS-SWD dataset for SWD detection, derived from a random sampling of over 70 countries and encompassing 3,377 SWDs. The effectiveness of our framework is validated through experiments on LHRS-SWD, with a 20.26% improvement in AP50 versus initial iteration."

 Accurate mapping of salt pond systems is crucial for coastal resource management and ecological conservation. However, existing spectral indices for salt pond detection are mostly derived empirically, limiting their ability to differentiate pond subtypes or generalize across diverse coastal environments. This study proposes a big data-driven framework for constructing novel spectral indices that enhance the fine-scale classification of salt ponds in the Bohai Rim region of China. By systematically generating and screening over 390,000 candidate indices derived from Sentinel-2 bands, four new indices were identified to effectively discriminate salt pond subtypes: the Non-Water Body Detection Index (NWBDI), Crystallization Pond Index (CPI), Red-Green Concentration Pond Index (RGCPI), and Evaporation Pond Discrimination Index (EPDI). To rigorously evaluate their performance, three Random Forest configurations were compared, including a baseline model with original spectral bands, an expert-index-enhanced model, and a model incorporating the proposed novel indices. Across the Bohai Rim region, the model with proposed new indices achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 81.14%, demonstrating clear advantages over both original spectral bands (OA of 72.93%) and expert-index approaches (OA of 76.64%). The resulting fine-scale map revealed a total salt pond area of 2,214.33 km2 in 2020 across the Bohai Rim, consistent with national statistics. Beyond improving classification accuracy, the data-driven index discovery revealed physically meaningful spectral relationships linked to salinity gradients and hydro-biogeochemical properties, marking a methodological shift from expert-driven hypothesis testing to automated, data-driven feature discovery. This study demonstrates that the data-driven approach can provide a transferable solution for constructing task-specific spectral indices and advancing large-scale environmental monitoring."

 This study leverages the multi-year and multi-seasonal airborne ACTIVATE dataset over the northwest Atlantic to determine the relative importance of sub- and supermicrometer nitrate concentrations in aerosol particles and factors influential for their 3-dimensional spatial distribution and seasonal differences. Simultaneously collected data with an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (NO3,fine: <1 μm) and Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler (NO3,total: <5 μm) allowed for their difference (NO3,coarse) to be explored, representative of coarse nitrate. Seasonally, NO3,fine was most enhanced in winter months due to secondary ammonium nitrate formation coincident with favorable cold conditions. NO3,coarse was generally much higher in mass concentration than NO3,fine due to its association with coarse aerosol types, notably dust and sea salt. NO3,coarse was best correlated with non-sea salt calcium (i.e., dust) rather than sodium (i.e., sea salt), suggestive of how gaseous acids favor adsorption onto coarse surfaces that are alkaline. Consequently, NO3,coarse was higher farther offshore where air masses enriched with sea salt and dust were more prominent, whereas NO3,fine exhibited decreasing levels as a function of offshore distance (i.e., away from continental sources). These results emphasize the challenges of the vertical, spatial, and seasonal distribution of nitrate due to its varying formation pathways in fine and coarse modes."

 Coarse-resolution global climate models (GCMs) have limited capability to simulate mean and extreme precipitation over eastern China, thus requiring the use of downscaling techniques to improve model performance. This study evaluates two types of downscaled climate models: regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment Phase II for East Asia (CORDEX), which use a dynamical downscaling approach, and the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP, NEX), which apply a statistical downscaling method. CORDEX and NEX models are driven by CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCM outputs, respectively. For all precipitation indices (PRCPTOT, R95p, R99p, Rx5day, CWD, and SDII), the CORDEX ensemble mean marginally improves their representation south of 30°N compared to CMIP5. Among the four model groups, NEX models achieve the highest skill in reproducing PRCPTOT over eastern China. However, CORDEX models outperform NEX models in simulating extreme precipitation events, with NEX models systematically underestimating extremes, indicating that dynamical downscaling is generally more effective than statistical downscaling for capturing extreme precipitation. Both CORDEX and NEX models successfully capture the timing and peak of the annual precipitation cycle over eastern China, despite notable inter-model discrepancies. These results provide a comprehensive reference for selecting appropriate models to project mean and extreme precipitation over eastern China."
