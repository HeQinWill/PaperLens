Mahajan;Becky Alexander,Aerosol iodine recycling is a major control on tropospheric reactive iodine abundance,"Global chemical transport models previously treated aerosols as a sink for reactive iodine (Iy); however, aerosol iodide is also a source of Iy via heterogeneous reactions involving hypohalous acids and halogen nitrates. We implemented this chemistry into GEOS-Chem, in addition to explicitly representing three aerosol iodine types: soluble organic iodine (SOI), iodide, and iodate. We found that aerosol recycling of iodide to form Iy is more than twice as fast as the other Iy sources combined. 
 Tropospheric reactive iodine influences the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and serves as an important source of ultra-fine particles.  However, the paucity of observations of gas-phase and aerosol iodine, combined with incomplete understanding and representation of iodine chemistry in models, leads to substantial uncertainties in understanding iodine abundance, speciation, and impacts. Motivated by known gaps in previous modeling studies, we introduced speciated aerosol iodine and aerosol iodide recycling to the global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem.  Modeled aerosol iodine is speciated into fine and coarse mode soluble organic iodine (SOI), iodate, and iodide. Aerosol iodide is recycled into the gas phase via heterogeneous chemistry involving halogen nitrates and hypohalous acids to form I2, ICl, and IBr, which represents an additional source of gas-phase iodine to the atmosphere. Iodide dehalogenation doubles the tropospheric burden of reactive iodine (Iy) while reducing model-measurement bias for IO and aerosol iodine. The rate of aerosol iodine conversion to Iy is more than twice as fast as the combined rates of inorganic ocean emissions and the photolysis of organic iodine gases, suggesting that aerosols are important in mediating the abundance and lifetime of tropospheric Iy. The incorporation of SOI and iodate into the model prevents iodide dehalogenation by partitioning iodide into less reactive reservoirs, which has a stabilizing effect for reactive iodine chemistry. These findings have implications for reactive halogen abundances and global oxidant budgets in the troposphere."

We also discovered that humidity, acidity, inorganic sulfate and Ox mass concentrations play key roles in the formation of Aliphatic OSs. These findings improve our understanding of how air pollution forms in urban environments and are crucial for developing effective environmental policies. 
 Organosulfates (OSs) are important components of organic aerosols, which serve as critical tracers of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). However, molecular composition, the relationship between OSs and their precursors, and formation driving factors of OSs at different atmospheric conditions have not been fully constrained. In this work, we integrated OS molecular composition, precursor-constrained positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment, and OS-precursor correlation analysis to classify OS detected from PM2.5 samples according to their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) precursors collected from three different cities (Beijing, Taiyuan, and Changsha) in China. This new approach enables the accurate classification of OSs from molecular perspective. Compared with conventional classification methods, we found the mass fraction of Aliphatic OSs (including nitrooxy OSs; NOSs) increased by 22.0 %, 17.8 %, and 10.3 % in Beijing, Taiyuan, and Changsha, respectively, highlighting the underestimation of Aliphatic OSs in urban regions. The formation driving factors of Aliphatic OSs during the field campaign were further investigated. We found that elevated aerosol liquid water content promoted the formation of Aliphatic OSs only when aerosols transition from non-liquid state to liquid state. In addition, enhanced inorganic sulfate mass concentrations, and Ox (Ox= NO2+ O3) concentrations, as well as decreased aerosol pH commonly facilitated the formation of Aliphatic OSs. These results reveal a significant underestimation of OSs derived from anthropogenic emissions in wintertime, particularly Aliphatic OSs, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of SOA formation and composition in urban environments."

Korolev;R. Paul Lawson,Microphysics of Arctic Stratiform Boundary-layer Clouds during ARCSIX,"The International Panel on Climate Change has concluded that aerosols and clouds are significant contributors to the rate of warming in the Arctic, which is now shown to be more than twice that of the global average. Climate model predictions suggest that the Arctic Ocean will become ice-free sometime between 2030 and 2050. The research presented here increases our knowledge of how aerosols, clouds and surface properties contribute to warming and the melting of sea ice in the Arctic. 
 Clouds have a major impact on rapidly decreasing sea ice in the Arctic, yet much is still unknown how cloud microphysics influences cloud development. In situ and remote data were collected by the NASA P-3 and SPEC Inc. Learjet research aircraft in Arctic stratiform boundary-layer clouds over the oceans and sea ice bordering northern Greenland between 25 May and 15 August 2024 during the ARCSIX project. Both aircraft carried a suite of nearly identical state-of-the-art microphysical sensors. Additionally, the P-3 was equipped with aerosol and remote-sensing instrumentation and the Learjet was equipped with a zenith/nadir Ka-band radar. The length of clouds examined remotely and in-situ by the two aircraft totaled 12 417 km, with 6966 km of in-situ measurements. Mixed-phase clouds were sampled during 60.5 % of time in cloud, and all-liquid clouds were measured 39.5 % of the time. Cloud-top temperatures were ≥-9 °C during 90 % of the stratiform boundary-layer cloud investigations. Single-layer mixed-phase clouds sampled with cloud-top temperatures ≥-4 °C often contained concentrations of ice particles more than five orders of magnitude higher than measured concentrations of ice-nucleating particles. Despite the high ice concentrations, microphysical conditions supporting secondary ice production were seldom present. In contrast, in some clouds where environmental conditions met commonly accepted criteria for secondary ice production, ice particle concentrations were closer to what is expected from primary nucleation. The quality of measurements was unprecedented, but results from our preliminary analysis raise more questions about primary and secondary nucleation mechanisms than they answer."

Buculei;Jamie Ryan;Jon Helmore;Nigel Yarrow;David Butterfield;Fabrizio Innocenti;Rod Robinson,"Assessment of the Fugitive Emission Distributed Sampling (FEDS) system: a mobile, multi-inlet system for continuous emissions monitoring","The Fugitive Emission Distributed Sampling (FEDS) system is used to measure emissions from local-scale sources (up to ~1×1 km). FEDS uses a state-of-the-art gas analyser linked to many sampling locations. Controlled amounts of methane were released to test the accuracy of the FEDS system. Results were promising even when using different models to estimate the amount of methane released. Results were better when the wind was consistent. FEDS could be used for measuring emissions over many months. 
 The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has developed and trialled a mobile and remotely-operated Fugitive Emission Distributed Sampling (FEDS) system for continuous measurements of emissions at the facility spatial scale. FEDS is capable of both locating and quantifying emission sources over long-term periods and has been deployed at sites around the UK to monitor methane emissions from the natural gas network, landfill, and waste treatment. This work presents assessment activities using a controlled release facility (CRF) to test the performance of the measurement system and two reverse dispersion models (Airviro and WindTrax) for emission quantification. The CRF was used to simulate a simple single-point methane emission source with constant release rate of 1 kg h−1 over four separate experiments. Emissions were quantified using prior knowledge of release timings as well as in the absence of this knowledge. High variability in wind direction was shown to negatively impact emission quantification accuracy (especially for Airviro). Emission results were improved by removing periods of high wind variability (low wind persistence) from analysis. Both models performed better when using daily-averaging periods for emissions (Airviro RMSE = 0.37 kg h−1 (37 % relative); WindTrax = 0.29 kg h−1 (29 %)) over shorter averaging periods, such as hourly data (Airviro RMSE = 0.77 kg h−1 (77 %); WindTrax = 2.19 kg h−1 (219 %)). Estimated emission rates were shown to be sensitive to the specified source release height for both models, with discrepancies in model release height relative to the true release height of more than 0.5 m yielding less accurate results."

The cutoffs were determined at several ambient and internal pressures and sample flows. During the first aircraft campaign TPEx we were able to identify possible new particle formation events. 
 Field measurements of aerosol number concentration and aerosol size distribution in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UTLS) are crucial for understanding the influence of processes such as new particle formation (NPF) on aerosol budgets, cloud formation and climate. In this study, we present the multi-channel Condensation Particle Counter (mc-CPC) that was designed and set up for airborne measurements and tested during the TPEx campaign onboard a Learjet in 2024. The instrument uses FC-43 (C12F27N) as the working fluid and consists of three individual commercial CPCs (Grimm SKY-CPC), a pressure regulation system and a common inlet. By varying the temperature difference (ΔT) between each pair of saturator and condenser, the cutoff diameter (d50) of each CPC can be adjusted. For the cases presented here, we typically operated two of the CPCs at a ΔT of 36 °C for a direct comparison while the third CPC was set to a ΔT of 15 °C. Two independent calibration setups were used to determine the cutoff and size-dependent counting efficiency of the mc-CPC at various internal and external CPC pressure levels. The experiments in the laboratory showed that the cutoffs of the individual channels were rather independent of the external pressure pexternal and only slightly dependent on the internal CPC pressure pCPC, at least for a pCPC range between 200–350 hPa. A large fraction of flights during TPEx were conducted at an internal pressure of 250 hPa, and therefore the cutoff determined at 250 hPa was used as a fixed value for all internal pressures. For channel 1 and 2 that were operated at the same ΔT, this gave a d50 of 11.3 (±0.7) nm and 12.3 (±0.7) nm, respectively. Channel 3 was set to ΔT = 15 °C and a cutoff diameter of 14.9 (±0.9) nm was determined. In an internal pressure range between 200 and 400 hPa the cutoffs decreased slightly with increasing pCPC. Furthermore, our measurements also indicate that the cutoffs are not influenced by varying sample flows. The mc-CPC was operated for the first time on an aircraft during the TPEx campaign (TropoPause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) in June 2024. We present the first measurements of one research flight and discuss the uncertainties of the collected aerosol data."

The transfer-trained model shows superior performances compared to conventional algorithms and non-transfer trained mode. The model predicted more reliable diurnal behaviors, with daily amplitude and peak timing approaching radiosonde results. 
 Diurnal variations in planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is highly linked to weather, climate, and environmental processes. However, remaining challenges persist in estimating its diurnal behavior at a large scale due to insufficient observations and limitations of operational retrieval algorithms. This study proposed a deep learning framework based on an attention-augmented residual neural network to estimate diurnal variations in near-global PBLH, incorporating profiles from an non-sun-synchronous lidar (Cloud-Aerosol Transport System: CATS) and meteorological fields. The framework can largely address the issue of multi-layer structures in space-borne lidar signals, significantly improving the accuracy of PBLH retrieval during morning and evening (with accuracy improvement approach 30 % compared to traditional algorithm). Due to insufficient observations aligned with CATS orbits, a pre-train model was firstly trained using pseudo-labels from reanalysis, and then was transferred to observation-based target labels. The transfer model demonstrates superior performance in most regions and periods, outperforming classical algorithm in capturing PBLH magnitude and its diurnal variations. Further assessments over different land covers show that the transfer model estimated PBLH and diurnal patterns were highly consistent with those from radiosondes, surpassing reanalysis outputs. For model capability, wavelet covariance transformation derived potential PBLH and temperature profiles emerged as dominant factors, with contributions exhibiting diurnal patterns. Overall, this work proposes a novel framework for large-scale PBLH estimation and provides insights for improving retrieval algorithms, particularly through integrating remote sensing and machine learning."
10.5194/amt-19-1077-2026,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究涉及使用低成本传感器（PMS5003/6003）对沙尘天气下的PM2.5浓度进行校正，直接与空气质量监测和大气成分分析相关，属于大气环境遥感技术领域。,"['PM2.5', 'low-cost sensors', 'dust loading', 'air quality monitoring']",Kamaljeet Kaur;Tristalee Mangin;Kerry E. Kelly,Correction of PM2.5 underestimation in low-cost sensors under elevated dust loading using only sensor measurements,"We improved the accuracy of low-cost particulate matter sensor (PMS5003/6003) measurements under dust-dominated conditions common in arid regions. By applying sensor-specific particle mass ratios and a relative humidity cutoff, dust-influenced measurements were identified and PM2.5 concentrations corrected, reducing bias by ~ 50 % relative to regulatory monitors. This method enables real-time PM2.5 correction where reference data are unavailable. 
 The Plantower PMS5003/6003 sensor is widely used for low-cost monitoring of particulate matter (PM), but it substantially underestimates PM2.5 and PM10 during periods of elevated dust loading, when the particle size distribution is dominated by particles > 1 µm in diameter. This limitation is especially critical in the arid regions, such as the western United States, where windblown dust frequently degrades air quality, visibility, and public health. Accurate estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during periods dominated by dust typically relies on federal reference or equivalent methods (FRM/FEM), but these resources have limited spatial resolution. This study investigates whether PMS5003/6003 measurements alone can be used to detect and to bias correct for these dust-dominant PM conditions. We analyzed measurements from 109 PMS sensors collocated or near 75 U.S. EPA monitoring sites with hourly FEM PM2.5 and/or PM10 between January 2017 to May 2025. Two cutoff thresholds (threshold1 and threshold2) were developed using relative humidity and the sensor-reported ratio of coarse (2.5–10 µm) to submicron (0.3–1 µm) mass concentration to identify potential periods dominated by dust when the PMS sensor underestimated PM2.5 concentration. The thresholds can be used in real time, relying on the preceding 336 hourly measurements (consistent with PurpleAir's public archive display). To improve PM2.5 estimates from the PMS sensor (pm2.5_alt, a common correction for Plantower PMS measurements reported by PurpleAir), this study used pm2.5_alt measurements identified as potential dust-dominated periods to develop a correction factor through non-linear regression. This correction reduced the mean bias error between PMS PM2.5 estimates (pm2.5_alt) and FEM PM2.5 by approximately 50 % for 97 sensors, and reduced the root mean square error by approximately 30 % for 84 sensors. This framework enhances the utility of PMS5003/6003 measurements during periods of elevated dust loading, extending monitoring capabilities in regions where regulatory coverage is limited."

S. Newall;Anson W. Mackay;Natalia Piotrowska;Maarten Blaauw,A complete database of AMS radiocarbon estimates from Lake Baikal sediment cores with a lake-wide assessment of TOC age offsets,"Lake sediment cores are records of ancient climate change. Radiocarbon dates provide the records a timeframe. We present a database of radiocarbon data from Lake Baikal sediment cores to aid re-use of this data, and evaluate a key correction required to use radiocarbon data. Previous studies used corrections of 380–2100 years with an uncertainty of 90 years at most. Our results (1610 ± 760 years) highlight that age offset uncertainty has been underestimated and better estimators are needed. 
 We present a database of AMS radiocarbon dates from Lake Baikal sediment cores, encompassing 51 cores and 518 dates, providing a complete record from literature spanning 1992 to 2025 (with transcription errors corrected) and including 22 previously unpublished dates from cores CON01-603-5 and CON01-605-5. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.973799 (Newall et al., 2025). The most common material used for radiocarbon dating in our dataset is total organic carbon (TOC). Unfortunately, the interpretation of TOC ages in lake sediments is hindered by issues such as the reservoir effect, in situ contamination by old organic carbon, and/or the hardwater effect. These issues may culminate in age estimates thousands of years older than the true depositional age of that sediment, which we term the “age offset”. Linear regression of uncalibrated radiocarbon dates has previously been used to estimate the age offset in Lake Baikal, with results ranging from 0 to 1.5 14C kyr in different cores. Estimates from other methods have returned estimates of approximately 2 14C kyr. Despite this, most previous studies have not incorporated age offset uncertainty in their age depth modelling, or have included uncertainty of, at most, ±0.09 14C kyr. Furthermore, the varying age offset estimates have been interpreted by some as evidence that different regions of Lake Baikal have different age offsets, with implications as to the cause of the age offsets. We apply the linear regression age offset method to all suitable cores in our database, returning 21 estimates of age offset from throughout the lake. Our results return a lake-wide TOC radiocarbon age offset of 1.62 ± 0.76 14C kyr, suggesting previous studies in Lake Baikal have significantly underestimated the temporal uncertainty of radiocarbon ages from TOC. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant evidence for a systematic difference in age offset in different regions of Lake Baikal (specifically Academician Ridge and Buguldeika Saddle). Finally, our results are a caution that linear regression-based age offset estimates in lake sediments have a large uncertainty that might only be observable with multiple datasets."

 The ForestScan project was conceived to evaluate new technologies for characterising forest structure and biomass at Forest Biomass Reference Measurement Sites (FBRMS). It is closely aligned with other international initiatives, particularly the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) aboveground biomass (AGB) cal/val protocols, and is part of GEO-TREES, an international consortium dedicated to establishing a global network of Forest Biomass Reference Measurement Sites (FBRMS) to support EO and encourage investment in relevant field-based observations and science.

This study innovatively generated hourly, angular-normalized, all-weather, high-resolution (0.01°) LST data from 2018 to 2023 using FY-4A official data, which support better LST-related studies of earth system science. 
 Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable in geophysical, ecological, and environmental researches. Remote sensing provides a unique observation approach for obtaining large-scale LST products. However, current official LST datasets (such as FY-4A) are limited by the unaddressed thermal radiation directionality effect, and suffer the spatial discontinuities due to the pervasive presence of clouds. What’s more, the geostationary LST products have relatively coarser resolution than those of polar-orbiting satellites due to trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. Based on the official hourly FY-4A LST dataset, this study proposes a novel framework for generating angular-normalized, cloud-filled, and 0.01°-downscaled LST (ANCFDS-LST) product, encompassing directional (Tdir), nadir (Tnadir), and hemispherical (Themi) LST layers. First, the angular-normalized Tnadir and Themi were generated using a time-evolving kernel driven model (TEKDM) with the inputs of multi-temporal FY-4A Tdir. Subsequently, hypothetical clear-sky LST were predicted using a CatBoost model optimized via Bayesian methods. The cloudy-sky LST values were then derived through a cloud radiation force (CRF) correction. Finally, the 0.05° all-weather Tdir, Tnadir, and Themi values were downscaled to 0.01° resolution using an improved hybrid downscaling algorithm (IHDA) combining fusion and kernel-based methods. Taking the daytime clear-sky near-nadir VNP21A1 LST as reference, the 0.05° Tdir before angular-normalization has a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 6.21 K and a mean bias difference (MBD) of -4.04 K, whereas the angularly normalized Tnadir has a much smaller RMSD of 3.48 K and a better MBD of -2.13 K. For the all-weather Themi, temperature-based validation over 15 sites in the Heihe River Basin and the Tibetan Plateau shows a root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 2.99 K and -0.77 K under clear-sky conditions, 4.56 K and -1.56 K under cloudy-sky conditions. After the spatial downscaling, the 0.01° all-weather Themi with abundant texture details exhibits an RMSE (MBE) of 3.99 K (-1.32 K) over 15 sites. The generated LST products from 2018 to 2023 over the FY-4A disk exhibit enhanced angular consistency, spatial continuity, and finer resolution, offering valuable support for subsequent LST-related applications.

 While paleoclimate simulations have been a priority for Earth system modelers over the past three decades, little attention has been paid to the period between the mid-Holocene (6 ka) and the Last Millennium, although this is an important period for the emergence of complex societies. Here, we consider the climate of 2500 BP (before present or 550 BCE), a period when compared to late preindustrial time, greenhouse gas concentrations were slightly lower, and orbital forcing led to a stronger seasonal cycle in high latitude insolation. To capture the influence of land cover on climate, we asynchronously coupled the NASA GISS ModelE Earth system model with the LPJ-LMfire dynamic global vegetation model. We simulated global climate and assessed our results in the context of independent paleoclimate reconstructions. We also explored a set of combinations of model performance parameters (bias and variability) and demonstrated their importance for the asynchronous coupling framework. The asynchronously coupled model system shows strong vegetation-albedo feedback on climate and is comparatively more sensitive to the bias correction than the internal model variability and green Sahara conditions. In the absence of a bias correction, while driving LPJ-LMfire in the coupling process, ModelE drifts towards colder conditions in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in response to land cover simulated by LPJ-LMfire. A regional precipitation response is also prominent in the various combinations of the coupled model system, with a substantial intensification of the Summer Indian Monsoon and a drying pattern over Europe. Evaluation of the simulated climate against reconstructions of temperature from multiple proxies and the isotopic composition of precipitation (δ18Op) from speleothems demonstrated the skill of ModelE in simulating past climate. A regional analysis of the simulated vegetation-climate response further confirmed the validity of this approach. The NASA GISS ModelE was found to be particularly sensitive to the representation of shrubs and this land cover type requires particular attention as a potentially important driver of climate in regions where shrubs are abundant. Our results further demonstrate the importance of bias correction in coupled paleoclimate simulations. This study presents a generalized framework for incorporating biogeophysical responses into climate models without dynamic vegetation, for simulating past climates, in line with the recommendations of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP)."

The FCI samples the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral windows with a spatial resolution at nadir between 500 and 1000 m, and a 10 min temporal sampling interval. This configuration offers a potential for methane retrievals using multiband multipass retrieval (MBMP) methods, as shown with other multispectral missions. The potential of the MTG-FCI system for the detection and monitoring of single methane plumes is evaluated in this article through different approaches. End-to-end simulations using high-resolution WRF-LES methane plumes over Algeria showed that MTG-FCI can detect emissions as low as 30 t/h, where initial plume signals become visible, with a clearer detection above 50 t/h. Additionally, mass-balance modeling estimated a minimum detection limit of 20–30 t/h across the central MTG-FCI disk (GSD ≤ 1 km) under optimal conditions. We illustrate the use of the MTG-FCI for the monitoring and quantification of methane plumes using a real transient emission detection from a compressor station in Algeria (34.676° N, 6.191° E) on September 29, 2023, capturing its full evolution from 10:48 to 15:58 UTC. This event corresponded to an emission rate of 389 ± 81 t/h and a total methane release of ∼320 tons, with results broadly consistent with independent satellite estimates. These findings highlight MTG-FCI’s ability to track large transient methane plumes in near real-time, complementing polar-orbiting sensors."

Multiple radionuclides (210Pbex, 137Cs, 240Pu/239Pu) were used to establish an accurate age-depth model and show the occurrence of French nuclear weapon test fallout in this remote region for the first time. Environmental changes related to the retreat of the Cook Ice Cap since the 1960s were found to be one of the major factors dominating the dynamics of anthropogenic lead deposition flux in the fjord through the release of long-range transported legacy anthropogenic lead. The released legacy anthropogenic lead was likely transported across the proglacial Ampere Lake by a hypopycnal plume to the fjord. Backward trajectories and lead stable isotopic signatures suggest the southern part of South Africa as a major source of anthropogenic lead transported to the Kerguelen Archipelago. In contrast, contamination by arsenic, molybdenum, antimony, and POPs was found to be more recent (since 2001). Fractionation of rare earth elements was observed in the sediment due to the formation of proglacial Ampere Lake, which acts as a sediment trap."

We present a novel methodology for calculating the radiative efficiency of diverse fluorinated molecules with minimized error, adaptable to any electronic structure method and basis set. By incorporating full conformer populations and three scaling parameters, we approximate the experimental infrared spectra more effectively, enhancing the reliability of our predictions. The optimization of vibrational frequencies and intensities for a diverse data set of 38 fluorinated compounds enables us to refine radiative efficiency calculations and seamlessly integrate them into our lifetime calculating protocol. We obtain theoretical global warming potential (GWP) values with well-defined error bars, offering a significant improvement over existing computational methods. This enhanced framework provides a powerful tool for assessing the climate effects of fluorinated compounds, aligning with the objectives of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. By delivering robust and reliable GWP estimates, our methodology informs policy decisions on the phasedown of high-GWP hydrofluorocarbons and the search for sustainable alternatives. Our findings contribute to advancing theoretical approaches for quantifying radiative forcing, supporting global efforts to mitigate anthropogenic climate change."

In arid regions, gypsum dissolution is typically assumed to be the dominant sulfate source, but conventional sulfur and oxygen isotope systems (δ34S–SO42– and δ18O–SO42–) struggle to distinguish it from overlapping atmospheric and anthropogenic sources. Here, we apply the triple oxygen value (Δ′17O–SO42–) in the Yellow River Basin─characterized by widespread agriculture, abundant gypsum, and minimal atmospheric deposition─to resolve these ambiguities. We observe strongly negative Δ′17O–SO42– values (as low as −0.3‰) in upper basin waters during high-discharge periods, which we attribute to fertilizer-derived sulfate flushing from agricultural soils. These negative anomalies diminish downstream, where gypsum contributions become dominant. Isotopic modeling reveals that traditional approaches may overestimate gypsum inputs by up to 40%. Our results demonstrate that Δ′17O–SO42– is a powerful tracer of anthropogenic sulfate inputs in modern rivers. Moreover, its nonconservative behavior during transport challenges the assumption that negative Δ′17O values in paleo-sulfate archives strictly reflect contributions of atmospheric oxygen to sulfate."

In this study, the below-cloud scavenging of BC from biomass burning (BCbb) and fossil fuel combustion (BCff) was investigated, using year-round in situ measurements in Nanjing, China. A statistical approach was developed to quantify the source-specific mass absorption efficiency (MAE). Results showed that BCff was less susceptible to scavenging than BCbb, with wet scavenging ratios of 0.13 and 0.45, respectively. Additionally, BCff exhibited a stronger light-absorbing ability than BCbb, with MAE values of 8.0–12.0 and 3.4–8.0 m2 g–1 (25–75th percentiles), respectively. Consequently, the MAE of BC increased significantly with precipitation amount, driven by a combination of a rising BCff proportion, a higher intrinsic MAE of BCff, and enhancement of the MAE for both BC types due to high humidity. Neglecting the source-specific MAE could lead to substantial biases in the estimated direct radiative forcing, which can exceed 20% in regions with high BCbb contributions. This study strongly suggests that BCff and BCbb should be treated separately in models to improve the simulation of atmospheric loadings and climate impacts."

We investigate the contribution of crop residue burning to CHOCHO concentrations over northwest India, particularly in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi, using observations from TROPOMI, VIIRS, and Sentinel-3 satellites. These data sets are used to study the temporal and spatial patterns of CHOCHO and the influence of crop residue burning on CHOCHO levels. HYSPLIT back-trajectory simulations revealed the potential transport of pollutants from stubble-burning areas to Delhi. Large seasonal variations in CHOCHO concentrations were observed, with the highest levels occurring during the postmonsoon months (October–November) as a result of agricultural stubble-burning activities. During peak crop residue burning months, the mean CHOCHO VCD over Punjab exceeded 6 × 1014 molecules cm–2, about 3 × 1014 molecules cm–2 higher than the nonburning baseline. Over Haryana, the mean CHOCHO VCDs reached >5 × 1014 molecules cm–2, about 2 × 1014 molecules cm–2 above baseline. Delhi consistently shows elevated CHOCHO levels across all seasons, but a clear signal of agricultural stubble burning is still observed. We estimate that CHOCHO emissions from agricultural stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana average 1.19 ± 0.91 Gg yr–1, with ≈96.6% of the regional total emitted from Punjab. The contribution of stubble burning to CHOCHO concentrations over Delhi was validated using ground-based AMS measurements at Delhi. This study highlights the role of agricultural stubble burning in regional CHOCHO emissions and the need for effective management policies and strategies to mitigate air pollution in northwest India."

The study also reveals discrepancies between local flux measurements, basin‐scale inversions, and dynamical global vegetation model (DGVM) simulations, highlighting persistent challenges related to scale dependence, model structure, and representation of drought processes in DGVMs. Together, these findings underscore both the growing vulnerability of the Amazon carbon sink and the urgent need for sustained, integrated observing and modeling systems to constrain its response to future climate extremes."

Croplands showed the greatest variability, with mean δ15Nbulk, δ18O, and δ15NSP values of −15.0‰, 35.3‰, and 13.7‰; natural soils were slightly 15N‐enriched, consistent with less anthropogenic influence.

Our preferred model identifies a shallow spheroidal reservoir at ∼4 km depth that underwent ∼15 MPa of overpressure and a volume change increase of ∼0.23 km3. Seismicity clusters align with dilatational strain, and focal mechanisms are dominated by strike‐slip faulting consistent with the regional NE–SW tectonic stress regime. We distinguish two phases of unrest: 2013–2018, when seismicity concentrated in dilatational faults, and 2018–2024, when swarms became more energetic with increased magma flux and strain rates. These results demonstrate how magma input, crustal deformation, and faulting interact during prolonged volcanic unrest."

Nevertheless, superelevation has been studied primarily in the laboratory because field measurements are difficult to obtain. This study assesses whether the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite can detect superelevation in meander bends. Plots of lateral water‐surface slope (LWS) reveal distinct superelevation in three sets of Mississippi‐River bends. As expected, the magnitude and direction of LWS are strongly correlated with channel curvature. Superelevation can also be detected on comparatively narrow Wabash‐River bends, but levels of noise are more pronounced than for the Mississippi bends. Mean flow velocities estimated from LWS based on theoretical considerations agree closely with gauge‐based estimates (±7%–35%). These findings confirm that SWOT data can be used to reliably detect superelevation in large river bends, providing the basis for global assessments of hydrodynamics in large meandering rivers."

We present a simple model to explain this behavior: isotopic fluctuations respond to big and small “kicks” in the same way. We then use this to develop an expectation for the largest Cenozoic δ13 ${\delta }^{13}$C and δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O fluctuations. While the other hyperthermals of the early Cenozoic are encompassed the expected range, we quantify that the PETM isotopic signatures were larger than these expectations, by 1.15 ± $\pm $ 0.25‰ for δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O and 1.75 ± $\pm $ 0.24‰ for δ13 ${\delta }^{13}$C. This supports the view that the PETM is an extreme outlier amongst Cenozoic perturbations to the climate system and thereby was likely triggered by a large and unusual external perturbation."

At the network scale, 3D flume experiments show localized tracer retention caused by density‐induced convection and inertia‐driven vortices. Millifluidic experiments and simulations reveal that density contrast, flow imbalance, and fluid inertia govern these dynamics. Maximum trapping occurs when bottom fracture flow is ∼10% greater than the top, maximizing mass entry while minimizing loss. This imbalance promotes vortex‐driven retention and extended solute residence, leading to breakthrough curve tailing. Simulations in smooth and rough‐walled fractures confirm that roughness alters trapping locations but not the underlying mechanisms.

We find that AMOC weakening influences both vertical and inter‐basin heat redistribution. For a stronger AMOC decline, more heat is stored in the Indo‐Pacific Ocean and in the intermediate ocean layers above 700 m, while less heat accumulates in the deeper ocean layers, especially in the Atlantic.

These results suggest that ER waves are driven by the same mechanisms as TD‐type waves, whereas other processes not accounted for in this framework are also important for the MJO."

 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and have been targeted mainly through their orthosteric site, where the endogenous agonist binds1. However, allosteric modulation has emerged as a promising and innovative strategy in the realm of GPCR drug discovery1. Here, drawing inspiration from the natural regulation of GPCRs by transmembrane proteins, we have developed GPCR exoframe modulators (GEMs), de novo designed proteins that specifically target the transmembrane domain of GPCRs. Utilizing a hallucination-like design approach, we crafted GEMs with three strategic structural prompts to achieve the desired binding modes. We selected the dopamine D1 receptor as a prototypical model and systematically investigated four GEMs. Structural studies and functional assays revealed that these GEMs bind to the transmembrane domains and function as diverse allosteric modulators, including agonist-positive allosteric modulator, negative allosteric modulator and biased allosteric modulator. The ago-PAM GEM restores the activity of various D1 receptor loss-of-function mutants, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for GPCR-related disorders. Our work introduces GEMs that target the transmembrane domain as potent agents for allosteric GPCR modulation and highlights the potential of deep learning-based approaches in the design of function-oriented membrane proteins. De novo designed proteins that target the transmembrane domain of G-protein-coupled receptors, created using iterative structural predictions, are able to act as agonist-positive, negative or biased allosteric modulators of downstream activity."

Cryo-EM structures of ROS1 reveal how ligand activates the receptor and how monoclonal antibodies inhibit ROS1 signaling. 
 Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are key regulators of cellular signaling and are often co-opted in cancer. ROS1 is an orphan RTK aberrantly expressed in multiple tumors, yet no approved biologic therapies target it, and its activation mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present Cryo-EM structures of mammalian ROS1 in ligand-free and NELL2-bound states, revealing how trimeric NELL2 induces both receptor clustering and a conformational switch that relieves receptor autoinhibition – both mechanisms are required for ROS1 activation. These structures, along with biochemical characterization, reflect a striking evolutionary divergence in regulatory logic compared to the invertebrate ortholog Sevenless (dROS1), highlighting how conserved RTKs can adopt fundamentally different activation strategies. Guided by these structural insights, we develop monoclonal antibodies that either block ligand binding or trap ROS1 in an inactive conformation. These agents potently suppress ROS1 signaling, representing distinct mechanistic classes of biologics that directly target ROS1 activity. Our findings elucidate a distinct mode of RTK regulation and establish a therapeutic framework for cancers driven by ROS1.

 The luminescent and magnetic properties of trivalent lanthanides (Ln3+) are indispensable for many emerging technologies, but exacting fine control over these properties requires an understanding of how to purposefully engineer the coordination geometry and site symmetry of Ln3+ centres. Here, we use the Cambridge Structural Database to extract the structures of 12,670 eight-coordinate Ln3+ centres and use Continuous Shape Measures, Continuous Symmetry Operation Measures, and a new structural similarity-based network analysis to survey geometry and structure trends. This survey is then leveraged to deliver concrete strategies for controlling the coordination geometry of eight-coordinate Ln3+ centres using familiar concepts like Ln3+ metal size and ligand denticity, bite angle, flexibility, shape, symmetry, and size. Ultimately, we present a roadmap for targeting each of the six common eight-coordinate geometries – hexagonal bipyramidal, cubic, square antiprismatic, dodecahedral, bicapped trigonal prismatic, and snub disphenoid – which are each demonstrated to have unique use-cases in diverse research areas. The effects of crystal packing and non-covalent interactions are also illustrated, allowing fine-grained control over the geometry and symmetry of Ln3+ centres. This work ultimately serves to inform the deliberate design of Ln3+ coordination complexes and materials for applications including data-storage, quantum information processing, lighting, thermometry, and medical bioimaging.

Here, Sun et al. report light-controlled modulation of two distinct conductive pathways in single donor-acceptor Stenhouse adduct molecule with three thiomethyl anchoring sites. 
 Manipulating intramolecular electron transportation can fundamentally modulate the optical property, electromagnetic behavior and chemical reactivity of molecules. Achieving simultaneous control of multiple ( ≥2) transport pathways within a single molecule, however, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report light-gated modulation of two distinct conductive pathways in single donor-acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) molecules using the scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction (STM-BJ) technique. The donor and π-bridge pathways are separately controlled by designing DASAs with two thiomethyl anchoring sites. In the donor pathway, a side-chain modulation mechanism operates, where linear-to-cyclic isomerization induces electronic redistribution and increases the conductivity. In contrast, the π-bridge pathway is governed by a main-chain modulation mechanism, in which deformation of the π-conjugated backbone decreases the conductivity. By synthesizing DASAs containing three thiomethyl anchoring sites, these two conductive pathways are integrated within a single-molecule junction and can be simultaneously modulated under 635 nm red-light irradiation and dark relaxation. The π-bridge transport in the linear state exhibits mixed through-bond and through-space character, while photoisomerization leads to an increased through-space contribution in the cyclic state driven by cyclopentenone formation. These results highlight DASAs’ potential in understanding molecular electronics and developing photoresponsive molecular-scale devices.

 Surface precipitation phase transition is conducive to devastating snowstorms and avalanches yet remains a global challenge due to the scarcity of surface observations. Here, we present the Real-time Precipitation Phase-Intensity Collaborative Retrieval Network (RePPIC-Net), a hybrid AI framework that quantifies surface precipitation phase from satellite observations. By integrating real-time 3D atmospheric physics fields from the AI-driven FuXi model with operational geostationary satellite observations through a hierarchical architecture, our system enables real-time monitoring of surface precipitation phase, as opposed to at least 4-hour latency of current operational systems. Validated against ground stations in China, RePPIC-Net achieves a Critical Success Index for Phase and Detection of 0.1574 (snowfall) and 0.3147 (rainfall) for 0.1-5 mm/h precipitation, outperforming 4-hour latency operational products’ respective scores of 0.1001 and 0.3064. The real-time precipitation phase discrimination capability of RePPIC-Net allows the development of a satellite-based surface precipitation phase nowcasting system, meeting the need for 1-3 hour global surface precipitation phase transition warnings. RePPIC-Net provides a replicable blueprint for AI-powered real-time weather monitoring, filling a gap in wintertime weather disaster warnings.

Here the authors show that individual drainage basins have different thresholds and loss patterns, suggesting the need to consider the dynamical interactive nature of the basins and their individual tipping points. 
 The Antarctic Ice Sheet is subject to amplifying feedbacks which can accelerate ice loss and lead to effectively irreversible retreat. We here analyse the distinct nature and risk of long-term ice loss for each individual drainage basin under different levels of warming. Depending on topographic and climatic conditions, we find that ice loss in some basins unfolds gradually with warming, whereas other basins are characterized by a critical threshold or tipping point beyond which large parts eventually disintegrate. A first threshold, potentially as low as 1–2 °C above pre-industrial levels, triggers the long-term collapse of ~40% of marine ice volume in West Antarctica. Marine-based sectors in East Antarctica, representing ~5 m of potential sea-level rise, are at risk of losing stability at 2–5 °C. Our results imply that the Antarctic Ice Sheet does not act as one single tipping element, but rather as several tipping systems interacting across drainage basins. Climate change threatens the future of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here the authors show that individual drainage basins have different thresholds and loss patterns, suggesting the need to consider the dynamical interactive nature of the basins and their individual tipping points."

 The planetary boundaries framework sets precautionary limits to keep humanity within a safe operating space, aiming to maintain a stable, Holocene-like Earth system. Current methods for estimating these limits, however, create an imbalance by overstating biogeochemical risks relative to climate change. Here we propose a revised, flow-based, method for estimating the climate change boundary, aligned with the other biogeochemical flow boundaries. We find that under a consistent approach, climate change is in greater violation than nitrogen and phosphorus.

 Decadal climate prediction offers critical scientific guidance for policymakers and supports socioeconomic sustainability. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art dynamical models remain limited in predicting the intricate multidecadal variability in Eurasian surface air temperature (SAT) at mid-to-high latitudes several years in advance. Here, we present a hybrid deep learning model–Gated Recurrent Unit augmented with batch normalization and attention mechanism (GRUBA) –that significantly enhances decadal prediction skill through advanced postprocessing of multi-model ensemble outputs. By incorporating K-means temporal clustering, GRUBA sequentially refines each SAT cluster according to its distinct decadal variability. During the test period of 2004–2021, the averaged anomaly correlation coefficient skill improves from –0.23 to 0.83, and the mean square skill score from –0.37 to 0.68 compared to the unweighted multi-model ensemble mean. This substantial improvement arises in part from the attention mechanism, which effectively reduces model spread. Furthermore, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that GRUBA assigns higher weights to better-performing ensemble members."

 Aerosols act as ice nucleating particles (INPs) in mixed-phase clouds and cause uncertainties in climate prediction of the Arctic, which is warming faster than the global average. Primary biological aerosols (PBAs) are important INPs; however, their spatiotemporal variability, sources, and ice nucleation microphysics remain poorly understood. Here, we performed microscopic analysis, online and offline observations, and model simulations to investigate ambient aerosol particles related to INPs collected during the R/V Mirai Arctic cruise in 2022. We found that PBAs, particularly spores, were transported from terrestrial sources in Alaska and Canada to the Arctic Ocean and contributed to elevated INP concentrations. In addition, the ice-nucleating efficiency of PBAs was suppressed when fresh sea salt attached to or coated INPs. This study reveals an additional source of INPs over the Arctic Ocean, highlights the importance of alterations in INP mixing state during transport. These findings improve understanding of PBA contributions to Arctic cloud formation and their implications for climate feedbacks."

 Stromatolites record interactions of the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. The evolution of C-fixation via diverse metabolisms is linked to metal availability for enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase. Stable Cd isotopes fractionation during uptake into carbonic anhydrase by modern phototrophs is readily recorded in authigenic carbonates. Here we test whether this proxy can be expanded to trace carbonic anhydrase in the microbial rock record. We analyzed Cd isotopic compositions in stromatolite occurrences of Western Australia, spanning from the Archean ( ~ 3.35 Ga Strelley Pool and ~2.72 Ga Tumbiana formations) to the Holocene Hamelin Pool. We record fractionated Cd isotopic compositions correlating with macro and micro-nutrients P, Cd and Zn, suggesting enzymatic metal-cycling in the Paleoarchean. Meanwhile, Rayleigh-type Cd isotope fractionation indicates its use as a co-factor in carbonic anhydrase from the Meso- to Neoarchean onwards. Our study offers new insights into the evolution of the metallome and its role facilitating early microbial metabolisms.

We simulate an MCB strategy to offset the warming induced by anthropogenic aerosol reduction following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-1.9 carbon-neutral scenario. Injecting sea salt aerosol into four cloudy regions in the eastern Pacific Ocean every year from 2020 to 2100 effectively restrains the future global-mean surface air temperature and precipitation change to the 2020 level. Aerosol-cloud interaction dominates the cooling in this MCB strategy. However, this strategy does not fully offset the warming in Europe, the United States, northeastern China and downwind offshore oceans, partly related to the acceleration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation driven by the MCB-induced hemispherical asymmetric radiation gradients. Considering both the anthropogenic aerosol reductions and the MCB sea salt injection, some regions would face unintended climate change. Our study highlights the need for a more careful implementation strategy to produce both widespread cooling and fewer regional climate risks considering the effects are highly dependent on the strategy and seeding location.

 In the field of underground engineering, particularly in water conservancy, hydropower, and transportation tunnel projects, the high-resolution reconstruction of deep-buried long tunnels and other confined underground spaces serves as a fundamental data source for precise, efficient, and safe measurement of geological parameters. Due to the lack of control points and GNSS, important orientational data such as geological spatial attitude are difficult to be measured. Parallel photogrammetry can quickly acquire highly overlapping image data, but it still suffers from significant cumulative model drift and lack of absolute true geo-referenced pose in long tunnel reconstruction. To address these challenges, a novel sparse reconstruction method is proposed that integrates parallel photography with laser-coplanar directional control. First, an absolute orientation control system is established, in which the underground spaces with true directional geo-reference can be determined by combination of a geological compass and a laser level, i.e., a geological compass is used to measure absolute direction and a laser level is used to determine the vertical and horizontal pose angles parameters. Laser feature correspondences are extracted from both vertical and horizontal laser planars through a deep convolutional matching network guided by projected laser lines. These absolute orientation parameters, together with the global planar constraints, are incorporated as novel geometric constraints for the bundle adjustment optimization. The proposed method not only provides an absolute direction reference in constrained underground scenes without relying on GNSS, effectively mitigates model drift and enhances sparse reconstruction accuracy."
