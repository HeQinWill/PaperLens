10.1088/1748-9326/adeff7,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了气候变化背景下，高山地区永久冻土融化对水体化学成分的影响。研究地点位于欧洲阿尔卑斯山区，通过对有无永久冻土的两个池塘进行水化学成分的长期监测（2014-2022年），发现永久冻土融化会导致水体中某些离子（特别是硫酸根）浓度升高，主要是由于冻土融化暴露了更多含硫化物岩石颗粒，促进了硫化物的氧化。虽然化学风化增强，但由于硅酸盐和碳酸盐的溶解，水体的pH值得到了缓冲，没有出现酸化和水质恶化。论文强调，全球变暖会加速永久冻土融化，在酸中和能力较差的流域可能会出现水质问题。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析）关联不大，主要关注的是水体环境变化。,[],N Colombo;M Pettauer;S Brighenti;D Godone;F Salerno;R Balestrini;C A Delconte;E Pintaldi;A Benech;L Paro;M Martin;A Brunier;N Guyennon;M Freppaz,Permafrost thaw affects the chemistry of mountain ponds,"Permafrost is warming and thawing due to climate change. Among the related effects, water quality modification has gained increasing attention globally. Nevertheless, the impacts of diffuse permafrost thaw on water chemistry in high-mountain areas remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the seasonal and interannual variability of water chemistry of two close-by ponds located in high-elevation catchments (European Alps, NW Italy) with and without permafrost. We analyzed major ions and stable water isotopes (2014–2022; weekly to monthly sampling during the ice-free season) and leveraged ground thermal measurements in a 30-m deep borehole. We also used geochemical modeling to investigate the impacts of permafrost thaw on dominant weathering processes. Despite similar climatic conditions, lithological characteristics, and water sources contribution, we observed higher concentrations and more pronounced seasonal increases of most solutes in the pond located within the permafrost catchment compared to the pond in the permafrost-free catchment. This was particularly evident for sulfate, with mean concentrations approximately four times higher in the permafrost pond. In the permafrost catchment, progressive warming and thawing during the investigation period enhanced sulfide oxidation, likely due to increased exposure of unweathered, sulfide-bearing rock particles. However, enhanced weathering did not lead to acidification and water quality deterioration due to pH buffering capacity provided by dissolving silicates and carbonates. Global warming is expected to further accelerate permafrost thawing and related chemical weathering in transitional permafrost areas. Water quality issues may arise in catchments with poor acid neutralizing potential of rocks."
10.1088/1748-9326/adf07c,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注全球氮循环的成本效益分析，探讨了氮污染造成的损害和氮带来的益处（主要体现在农作物产量增加上）。文章估算了2010年全球氮污染造成的损失成本约为1.1万亿美元，并预测到2050年，氮相关成本的增长速度将超过氮带来的收益。虽然论文提到了氮污染与空气质量（PM2.5）有关，但其核心内容是经济学分析，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['nitrogen cycle', 'nitrogen pollution', 'cost-benefit analysis', 'air quality', 'eutrophication', 'PM2.5', 'nitrogen deposition']",Hans J M van Grinsven;Baojing Gu;Alfredo Rodríguez;Laurence Jones;Roy Brouwer;Lena Schulte-Uebbing;Felipe S Pacheco;Luis Lassaletta;Kentaro Hayashi;Jan van Dam;Nandula Raghuram;Markus Geupel;Peter Ebanyat;Xiuming Zhang;Steven Lord;Sander de Bruyn;Mark A Sutton,Valuing damages and benefits of the altered global nitrogen cycle; lessons for national to global policy support,"Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is increasingly used to inform environmental policy decisions by identifying interventions with the highest net societal benefits. Here we focus on CBAs for nitrogen (NCBA), explaining its history, presenting results of a recent first global NCBA and discussing opportunities and limitations. NCBAs have been conducted since the late 1990s for various geographic regions in Europe, the US, and China, primarily to support air quality and eutrophication policies. A first valuation of damages and benefits of the full nitrogen (N) cycle was conducted for the European Nitrogen Assessment in 2011, followed by NCBAs for the USA, the Netherlands and Germany. Here we present a first comprehensive global NCBA. Total global damage cost of N pollution in 2010 was estimated at US$1.1 trillion, primarily from increases in premature mortality by N derived PM2.5 (35%), terrestrial biodiversity loss by N deposition (33%), and marine eutrophication by N river loads (21%). Global benefits of N in 2010 were estimated at US$ 2.2 trillion with >95% from increased crop yields. By 2050, global N-related costs will rise faster than N benefits because underlying models project that economic growth (GDP) increases willingness-to-pay to prevent N pollution more than crop prices. The geographical distribution of N-related costs will also shift, with China and India surpassing Europe and North America as regions contributing most to global N-related costs. The estimated N cost range for 2010 was US$ 0.6–2.2 trillion with uncertainty largely in dose-impact and damage cost relations. Given the large uncertainties, when using valuation and NCBA to select a N mitigation option, the net benefits should be substantially higher than the costs and markedly better than for a rejected alternative option. Use of NCBA is discouraged to compare international policy options that involve regions with very different levels of GDP, cultures and political systems."

Currently constructed based on past data, IDF curves do not reflect the potential impacts of current and future changes in the hydrologic system, potentially leading to over- or under-design of structures. Different disaggregation approaches have been developed to obtain IDF curves for sub-daily durations from coarse daily climate model projections. Here, instead of starting from daily IDF curves to obtain sub-daily ones, we use thermodynamic global warming simulations, which directly provide hourly precipitation across the contiguous United States (CONUS) for low- and high-temperature sensitivity models and future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Our results indicate an amplification of precipitation extremes at different accumulation periods from 1–24 h in all scenarios across CONUS, especially towards the end of the 21st century. This is particularly true for the U.S. Northwest, where we report a statistically significant difference in the amplification of 1–6 h precipitation extremes compared to 24 h extremes. In general, we find the precipitation magnitudes are projected to increase with decreasing precipitation frequency (i.e. higher return period/lower annual exceedance probability), for higher emission scenarios, towards the end of this century, and for global climate models that exhibit a high sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing. For instance, in the northwestern United States under high emission scenarios and based on high-sensitivity models, the 100 year hourly precipitation extremes are projected to increase by over 200%, while the 5 year 24 h precipitation extremes are projected to increase by less than 50% by the end of the 21st century. Our results suggest that applying daily amplification factors to sub-daily extremes could lead to significant underestimation of sub-daily extremes. Therefore, a careful examination of changes in sub-daily extremes, and their regional variability is required to mitigate challenges with the design and operation of current and future urban infrastructure."
10.1088/1748-9326/adf07e,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了非洲地区沙尘和露天焚烧产生的PM2.5对空气质量和人类健康的影响。通过使用地球系统模型模拟了前工业时代、现代和未来情景下非洲地区的沙尘和露天焚烧PM2.5浓度，并评估了这些污染物对人类健康的潜在影响，包括死亡率。研究表明，目前沙尘和露天焚烧是导致非洲PM2.5相关死亡的主要因素，并且在未来可能会进一步增加。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术，但它对大气成分（特别是PM2.5）的分析，以及对空气质量和气溶胶污染的关注，使其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。遥感技术可以用于监测沙尘暴和野火，测量PM2.5浓度，并验证大气模型的模拟结果。,"['PM2.5', 'Dust', 'Open Fires', 'Air Quality', 'Mortality', 'Aerosol Pollution', 'Atmospheric Modeling']",Adwoa Aboagye-Okyere;Daphne Meidan;Douglas S Hamilton;Peter Hess;Olga Kalashnikova;Michael Garay;Natalie M Mahowald,The changing role of dust and open fires PM2.5 on Africa’s air quality and human health,"Aerosol pollution events pose serious threats to humans and ecosystems. Natural aerosols are much less studied than fossil fuel-sourced aerosols for their air quality impacts, even though ‘natural’ aerosols such as dust and wildfires are likely to have substantially changed because of anthropogenic activities. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 and the Community Atmospheric Model version 6 atmospheric model, we simulated dust and open-fire PM2.5 concentrations over Africa for preindustrial (PI), present-day, and future scenarios. Health impacts were assessed using the integrated exposure–response model applied to gridded population and disease-specific mortality data. Currently, we estimate that desert dust causes 30 000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 29 700–303 000) excess deaths annually in Africa (36% of the total excess premature mortality), while open fires result in 20 000 (95% CI: 19 500–22 500) excess deaths (24% of the mortality). All mortality estimates reported in this study represent annual excess deaths, calculated based on annual average PM2.5 concentrations. Concentrations of dust dominate aerosol concentration at the continental scale, and paleo records suggest dust loading has increased by 55% since PI times. Because of the lower population in dust-dominated regions, these do not affect health as much as combustion but are still important. In PI times, we estimate deaths due to dust as 6400 (95% CI: 6050–6750) (or 7000 if we keep the population at current levels), showing a large growth to the present day (over 400% increase). Excess deaths due to open fires have increased from 6900 (95% CI: 5800–7400) in the PI to 20 000 today (approximately 190% increase). For future scenarios in 2100, there is significant uncertainty; therefore, we present a high and low scenario, indicating that in the future, between 53 000 (95% CI: 49 000–55 000) and 67 000 (95% CI: 63 000–70 000) deaths will result from dust. Similarly, for future open fire excess deaths, we estimate a range of 19 000–40 000 (95% CI: 33 000–44 000) deaths, including population changes (−1% to +100% changes relative to today). In the current climate, as well as in the past and future, the amount and proportion of deaths attributed to ‘natural’ aerosols exceeds 50% of the total PM2.5 attributable mortality in Africa, showing that addressing possible changes in ‘natural’ aerosols is extremely important for improving air quality."

Despite projected desertification under the climate change, beginning in the early 21st century the Kalahari Desert and grasslands of South Africa, Lesotho–Drakensberg highland and Eswatini has experienced a trend of greening/Savannisation. Here, we find that the disparity is likely due to strong multidecadal variability. A positive phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation during this period has intensified the Hadley circulation and widened the Kalahari anticyclone, thereby facilitating moisture transport from the warm Angola–Benguela front to southern African landmasses. The advected moisture brought wetness at its periphery, which satisfied the water demand for cropland expansion (∼10%–15%) in southern Africa. A water-food-economy nexus is increasing Africa’s crop yields by approximately 25%, reducing food and economic insecurity through a nearly fourfold increase in agricultural exports and contributing approximately 26% to the continent’s total agricultural output. However, in the opposite phase of multidecadal variability, the superposition of greenhouse warming would exacerbate the drying trend that will amplify aridity."

Achieving the EU’s climate neutrality target requires not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also enhancing the current carbon dioxide removal through land-based solutions such as afforestation and sustainable soil management. The recently approved Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming Certification Regulation (EU) 2024/3012 aims to ensure transparency and reliability in carbon accounting, supporting carbon markets and land-based removals. However, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of these removals remain challenging due to ecosystem variability and land management complexities. While multiple technologies exist to support carbon accounting, selecting the most appropriate method for different contexts is not straightforward. This review evaluates five key carbon monitoring technologies: flux towers, satellite sensors, aerial light detection and ranging platforms, terrestrial laser scanning, and in situ internet of things devices. Their suitability for different application scenarios, specifically in forests and woody crops, is analyzed using an evaluation framework that takes into account spatial scale of observation, temporal resolution, accuracy, costs, and limitations. Although each technology offers specific advantages, no single method is universally optimal. By offering a comparative assessment of advantages and limitations of each technology, this review aims to assist land users, policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders in selecting the most effective solutions to ensure reliable MRV in carbon farming projects."

However, it remains unclear how the effects of different strategies on climate and non-climate externalities compare. This paper assesses the mitigation potential of a comprehensive set of transport transformation strategies from an integrated modeling perspective. In doing so, it goes beyond the assessment of climate change by including health-related externalities. We analyze transformation scenarios clustered along three interventions: lifestyle changes (LSCs), electrification, and efficiency improvements. All clusters yield significant climate mitigation potential, with electrification most effectively reducing CO2 emissions. LSCs allow for immediate emission reductions, are effective in hard-to-electrify transport modes, and facilitate the overall energy system transformation. They also have the strongest impact on overall transport externalities, especially due to activity-related health benefits. When compared on a monetarized basis to the REF in 2050, for the EU, LSCs lead to a total benefit of 70 bn EUR/yr by reducing adverse externalities of motorized transport by 30% and increasing positive externalities of active mobility by 50%. Based on this, we conclude that policymaking should both advance the electrification of road transport and promote mobility behavior towards shared and active modes to minimize CO2 emissions while maximizing co-benefits."

However, the global linkage between temperature extremes and total water storage (TWS) deficits remains insufficiently explored. Here, we analyzed 22 years (2002–2024) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-FO satellite data to examine the spatiotemporal coincidence of elevated temperatures and TWS deficits and explore their bidirectional predictability. We find that low TWS episodes frequently coincide with or lag temperature extremes by about one month in major land–atmosphere coupling hotspots, including equatorial, subtropical, and mid-latitude regions, possibly due to enhanced evapotranspiration and soil moisture reductions. Pre-existing TWS deficits appear to intensify and prolong temperature extremes by reducing latent heat flux and increasing sensible heat flux, potentially creating feedback processes that amplify drought and thermal stress; however, these mechanisms warrant further investigation. Statistical tests confirm that these co-occurrences are unlikely to be random, whereas Granger predictability analysis demonstrates that temperature anomalies improve forecasts of subsequent TWS extremes in critical regions. Overall, our results underscore the vulnerability of water-limited areas under climate change and highlight the value of continuous TWS monitoring to better predict and mitigate the impacts of temperature extremes. They further emphasize the urgency of integrated water-resource management and adaptation strategies in regions prone to prolonged compound extremes."

The O3 depletion events, while occurring most notably within the lowest few hundred metres above the Arctic Ocean, can induce a 5–7 % loss in the pan-Arctic tropospheric O3 burden during springtime. The study also found enhancements in O3 and NOy (mostly peroxyacetyl nitrate) concentrations in the Arctic due to northern boreal wildfires, particularly at higher altitudes. 
 Previous assessments on modelling Arctic tropospheric ozone (O3) have shown that most atmospheric models continue to experience difficulties in simulating tropospheric O3 in the Arctic, particularly in capturing the seasonal variations at coastal sites, primarily attributed to the lack of representation of surface bromine chemistry in the Arctic. In this study, two independent chemical transport models (CTMs), DEHM (Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model) and GEM-MACH (Global Environmental Multi-scale – Modelling Air quality and Chemistry), were used to simulate Arctic lower-tropospheric O3 for the year 2015 at considerably higher horizontal resolutions (25  and 15 km, respectively) than the large-scale models in the previous assessments. Both models include bromine chemistry but with different mechanistic representations of bromine sources from snow- and ice-covered polar regions: a blowing-snow bromine source mechanism in DEHM and a snowpack bromine source mechanism in GEM-MACH. Model results were compared with a suite of observations in the Arctic, including hourly observations from surface sites and mobile platforms (buoys and ships) and ozonesonde profiles, to evaluate models' ability to simulate Arctic lower-tropospheric O3, particularly in capturing the seasonal variations and the key processes controlling these variations.Both models are found to behave quite similarly outside the spring period and are able to capture the observed overall surface O3 seasonal cycle and synoptic-scale variabilities, as well as the O3 vertical profiles in the Arctic. GEM-MACH (with the snowpack bromine source mechanism) was able to simulate most of the observed springtime ozone depletion events (ODEs) at the coastal and buoy sites well, while DEHM (with the blowing-snow bromine source mechanism) simulated much fewer ODEs. The present study demonstrates that the springtime O3 depletion process plays a central role in driving the surface O3 seasonal cycle in central Arctic, and that the bromine-mediated ODEs, while occurring most notably within the lowest few hundred metres of air above the Arctic Ocean, can induce a 5 %–7 % of loss in the total pan-Arctic tropospheric O3 burden during springtime. The model simulations also showed an overall enhancement in the pan-Arctic O3 concentration due to northern boreal wildfire emissions in summer 2015; the enhancement is more significant at higher altitudes. Higher O3 excess ratios (ΔO3/ΔCO) found aloft compared to near the surface indicate greater photochemical O3 production efficiency at higher altitudes in fire-impacted air masses. The model simulations further indicated an enhancement in NOy in the Arctic due to wildfires; a large portion of NOy produced from the wildfire emissions is found in the form of PAN that is transported to the Arctic, particularly at higher altitudes, potentially contributing to O3 production there."

Using advanced wind lidar technology, we tracked how TKE varies with height and across seasons. We found that heat near the ground drives turbulence, while wind effects become stronger higher up. Our results help improve weather and climate models by providing better data on how turbulence behaves in the atmosphere, aiding understanding of climate change. 
 Due to the limitations of observations with meteorological towers and aircraft, there is a lack of research on the vertical characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer in relation to the budget terms of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). This study reveals the seasonal characteristics of the TKE budget and processes in Shenzhen using long-term observational data from coherent wind lidar. We found that the TKE variations in the region transition in behavior around 14:00 local time (LT), mainly because of changes in buoyancy generation. We determined that TKE is strongest in summer and has the highest impact at high altitudes in autumn in Shenzhen. Our results indicate that above 360 m, the daytime turbulent transport term in all seasons is positive, contributing up to 20 % of the total TKE budget, and the dissipation rate term is the only factor that dominates energy dissipation. We also found seasonal differences in the vertical characteristics of the dissipation rate in the region, with maximum values observed near the ground during spring, summer, and autumn. Our results indicate that near the ground, buoyancy is the main generation process of TKE, contributing up to 60 % of the total budget. Above 570 m, the role of shear generation gradually becomes more prominent, comparable to buoyancy generation. These findings not only enrich our understanding of the vertical structure of atmospheric turbulence but also provide new observational data and theoretical support for the parameterization of the turbulence energy budget in climate models, which can help improve atmospheric predictions."

This work provides a reliable modeling approach for recognizing causes of NAC pollution, enhances our understanding of variations of atmospheric NACs, and highlights the necessity of strengthening emission controls. 
 Nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs) are important atmospheric pollutants that impact air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and human health. Understanding the relationship between NAC formation and key environmental driving factors is crucial for mitigating their environmental and health impacts. In this work, we combined an ensemble machine learning (EML) model with the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to identify the key driving factors for ambient particulate NACs, covering primary emissions, secondary formation, and meteorological conditions based on field observations at urban, rural, and mountain sites in eastern China. The EML model effectively reproduced ambient NACs and recognized that anthropogenic emissions (i.e., coal combustion, traffic emission, and biomass burning) were the most important driving factors, with a total contribution of 49.3 %, while significant influences from meteorology (27.4 %) and secondary formation (23.3 %) were also confirmed. Seasonal variation analysis showed that direct emissions presented positive responses to NAC concentrations in spring, summer, and autumn, while lower temperatures had the largest positive impact in winter. By evaluating NAC formation and loss under various locations in winter, we found that anthropogenic sources played a dominant role in increasing NAC levels in urban and rural sites, while reduced ambient temperature, along with secondary formation from gas-phase oxidation, was the main reason for relatively high particulate NAC levels at the mountain site. This work provides a reliable modeling method for understanding the dominant sources and influencing factors for atmospheric NACs and highlights the necessity of strengthening emission source controls to mitigate organic aerosol pollution."

This study emphasises the spatial variability of water properties, nutrient distribution, and biological communities determined by oceanographic dynamics in a region influenced by sea ice melting, Atlantic Water inflow, and climatic teleconnections during a record low summer sea ice extent. 
 In September 2021, as part of the Italian Arctic research programme, a multidisciplinary cruise along the 75th parallel north through the Greenland Sea Gyre was conducted aboard the Italian icebreaker Laura Bassi in the framework of the CASSANDRA project, which also contributed to the Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) 2020/22. The cruise took place during the period of the lowest summer sea ice extent ever measured. The data show strong horizontal gradients with temperatures between 1.5 and 9.0 °C and salinity between 30 and 35. Warm and salty Atlantic Water (AW, θ > 3.0 °C, S around 35) dominates on the eastern side of the transect in the upper 500 m with surface temperatures of 4.5–9.0 °C, while Polar Water (PW, θ < 0 °C, S < 33) occupies the surface layer (50–80 m) in the west. The intermediate layer (100–500 m) consists of mixed water, and below 500 m the deep water of the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea predominates. The oxygen enrichment is higher in the intermediate layers, while the values in deep layers and western regions are lower (<300 µmol kg−1). A stratified upper layer (30–50 m deep) with low surface nutrients, especially nitrate, is observed, while an accumulation of silicate occurs in deep water masses. The surface water in the eastern part of the transect has high pHT and total alkalinity values due to photosynthesis and the presence of salty AW, while the fresh PW in the west has a lower alkalinity. Respiratory activity and organic matter concentrations (particulate/dissolved organic carbon) vary horizontally at the surface, decrease with depth, and increase slightly near the seafloor. A west–east gradient is also observed for δ18O and δD, with the ratios indicating the influence of freshwater at the surface near the Greenland coast. The abundance of prokaryotes decreases from the photic zone (<100 m depth) to the sea floor. Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids are identified as well-utilised polymers at every station and in every layer. Overall, the microbial enzyme patterns show a decrease from the surface to deeper layers, with some hotspots of metabolic activity at 20–40 m and in the aphotic layer. The enzyme patterns vary spatially, with activity peaks at the ends and in the middle of the transect. Phytoplankton biomass, expressed as chlorophyll a, varies across the transect, with higher values at the westernmost and easternmost stations. The micro-phytoplankton fraction dominates in PW, while the nano-phytoplankton fraction predominates in AW, even at the interface between the two water masses. Data of phytoplankton communities show low abundances and a dominance of nano-sized organisms, with diatoms being more abundant in the western part. Microzooplankton represents an important fraction of the planktonic community in this area, with tintinnids being the most important groups along the transect. Micrometazoans and aloricate ciliates are more abundant in the AW, resulting in higher biomass values at the eastern stations. Copepods are the most abundant mesozooplanktonic taxon both at the surface and in the upper 100 m water layer (97 % and 94 % of total mesozooplankton abundance, respectively), mainly represented by the genus Calanus.The data are publicly available at the Italian Arctic Data Centre (IADC), see https://doi.org/10.71761/c082c3ca-40bf-42b1-a61a-7b3697ab2c5a (Bensi et al., 2024), https://doi.org/10.71761/f7474404-3331-43e5-883b-25755e94956d (Azzaro et al., 2024)."

Reconstructing global change requires merging stratigraphic proxy records from many locations, each of which may be incomplete, time-uncertain, and influenced by both global and local processes. StratMC uses Bayesian modeling to see through this complexity, building more accurate and testable reconstructions of global change from stratigraphic data. 
 The chemistry of ancient sedimentary rocks encodes information about past climate, element cycling, and biological innovations. Records of large-scale Earth system change are constructed by piecing together geochemical proxy data from many different stratigraphic sections, each of which may be incomplete, time-uncertain, biased by local processes, and diagenetically altered. Accurately reconstructing past Earth system change thus requires correctly correlating sections from different locations, distinguishing between global and local changes in proxy values, and converting stratigraphic height to absolute time. Incomplete consideration of the uncertainties associated with each of these challenging tasks can lead to biased and inaccurate estimates of the magnitude, duration, and rate of past Earth system change. Here, we address this shortcoming by developing a Bayesian statistical framework for inferring the common proxy signal recorded by multiple stratigraphic sections. Using the principle of stratigraphic superposition and both absolute and relative age constraints, the model simultaneously correlates all stratigraphic sections, builds an age model for each section, and untangles global and local signals for one or more proxies. Synthetic experiments confirm that the model can correctly recover proxy signals from incomplete, noisy, and biased stratigraphic observations. Future applications of the model to the geologic record will enable geoscientists to more accurately pose and test hypotheses for the drivers of past proxy perturbations, generating new insights into Earth's history. The model is available as an open-source Python package (StratMC), which provides a flexible and user-friendly framework for studying different times and proxies recorded in sediments."

 For the hydromechanical coupling of solid–fluid porous media, this study presents an explicit stabilized two-phase material point method (MPM) formulation based on the one-point two-phase MPM scheme. To mitigate the spurious pore pressure and maintain the numerical stability, stabilized techniques, including the strain smoothing method and the multi-field variational principle, are implemented in the proposed formulation. The strain smoothing technique is used to smooth the volumetric strain rate, and the calculation of the pore pressure increment at particles is based on the multi-field variational principle. Four numerical examples are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed formulation. With its effective and easy-to-implement stabilized techniques, the proposed formulation provides stable and reliable outcomes that align well with analytical solutions and results from other approaches, offering extensive validation that the proposed two-phase MPM formulation is an effective and reliable approach for the simulation of solid–fluid porous media under both static and dynamic conditions."

In this study, we develop a novel steady-state theory to describe the atmospheric partitioning between gas and precipitation for SVOCs, improving upon the traditional equilibrium theory. We delve into the applications of this steady-state theory in predicting SVOCs’ phase distribution, deposition contribution, and scavenging efficiency. Our results demonstrate that steady-state theory outperforms equilibrium theory when compared to monitoring data, particularly in addressing the issue of overestimating scavenging ratios for certain SVOCs by equilibrium theory. The modeling outcomes reveal that, under steady-state theory, all SVOCs have upper limits in their phase distributions and deposition contributions. Most of these SVOCs are primarily found in the gas phase, with significant contributions from gaseous dry and wet deposition, which contrasts with predictions made using equilibrium theory. This advancement provides crucial insights into the atmospheric behavior and global fate of SVOCs."

This study assessed metal release from PMNs and its impact on picophytoplankton in the Clarion–Clipperton zone through laboratory and field incubation experiments. PMNs particles, particularly finer ones, released chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper more rapidly under light exposure, high salinity, and algal secretion. However, concentrations remained below the seawater quality criteria from multiple countries. In field incubation experiments, PMNs particles reduced surface chlorophyll-a by up to 61%, while inhibition was mitigated by sediment addition. Synechococcus showed no significant response PMNs, while Prochlorococcus was inhibited; sediment addition alleviated this due to nitrate and phosphate inputs. Sediment also promoted pico-diatom growth, presumably from increased silicate. Although copper concentrations in some sediment treatments exceed the EC10 threshold for sensitive species, overall metal pollution in seawater remains limited. Adjusting particle size and sediment content in discharge slurry can minimize adverse effects on picophytoplankton, potentially allowing the slurry to function as a “fertilizer.”"

While most studies focused on the selective suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, maintaining stable ammonia oxidation as the primary source of nitrite remains equally critical but largely underexplored. Herein, we identified Nitrosomonas eutropha as the keystone species dominating ammonia oxidation in free ammonia treatment-based PN systems, comprising over 40% of the nitrifier community. Combined metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses revealed that N. eutropha orchestrated multiple cellular processes and reallocated intracellular resources to adapt to the PN niche. Specifically, enhanced primary metabolism and stress response systems within N. eutropha were observed, alongside significant upregulation of the protein synthesis machine, such as ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Notably, overexpression of the cell division protein FtsA was detected, which is known to disrupt Z-ring formation and inhibit cell division. These results suggest a protein synthesis-centered survival strategy, wherein N. eutropha maintained robust protein synthesis capacity while retarding propagation. This strategy differs fundamentally from conventional microbial stress responses, which typically involve the downregulation of protein synthesis to conserve resources. These findings provide multidimensional insights into the survival strategies of Nitrosomonas in PN systems, with practical implications for both understanding molecular responses to environmental stress and optimizing engineering strategies for autotrophic nitrogen removal."

Herein, a graphitic carbon nitride-supported Fe and Cu dual-site catalyst with N4–Fe–Cu-N3 configuration (FeCu-CN) was designed and prepared, which promotes H2O2 activity through a sustainable dual-metal redox cycle and shows excellent pollutant degradation performance. The optimized FeCu-CN efficiently activates H2O2 to degrade sulfamethoxazole, with 23 and 4 times higher rates than Fe-CN and Cu-CN, respectively. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the Cu site of FeCu-CN optimizes the electronic structure of Fe site and provides electrons to facilitate the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle. The reduction of Cu(II) by H2O2 and •O2– could promote the Cu(II)/Cu(I) cycle, maintaining the catalytic activation stability of FeCu-CN. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Fe and Cu sites in FeCu-CN promotes the adsorption of H2O2 and reduces the dissociation energy barrier of H2O2. The FeCu/H2O2 system exhibits strong resilience to changes in pH (from 3.18 to 9.35) and the coexisting substances. In continuous flow experiments, it also shows a long-term degradation effect on water pollutants. The FeCu-CN/H2O2 system has excellent anti-interference ability and application potential.

Integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed ferroptosis as the primary mechanism of As-induced programmed cell death in hepatocytes. We discovered that oral As exposure triggers a cascade leading to ferroptosis: disruption of iron homeostasis, impairment of glutathione metabolism, and excessive lipid peroxide production. Mechanistically, As exposure decreased cysteine and glutathione levels while promoting iron accumulation, creating preferred conditions for ferroptotic cell death. These changes were accompanied by altered expression of key iron regulatory genes and disrupted antioxidant pathways, affecting glutathione-dependent defense systems. Our findings establish ferroptosis as critical in As-induced hepatotoxicity and provide insights for risk assessment and therapeutic development. This work advances our understanding of As toxicity mechanisms and offers potential targets for intervention strategies."

A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was adopted and compared with other machine learning (ML) models (i.e., Random Forest and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine) to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations. The DNN model (without the tropospheric emissions: monitoring of pollution (TEMPO); 1 year) estimated PM2.5 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 4.32 μg/m3, and outperformed ML models, with up to 44.68% better index of agreement (IOA) and 45.28% smaller relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE), particularly in high PM2.5 cases. The hourly estimated PM2.5 closely matched the observed PM2.5 in both temporal trend and spatial distribution across the eastern CONUS. ML modeling was further enhanced to include TEMPO Level 1b (L1b) data. The DNN model with TEMPO improved performance, with an 8% higher R2 and a 25% lower rRMSE than the DNN model without TEMPO. The more significant improvement was seen during high smoke events using the TEMPO data. For the first time, we demonstrate the use of TEMPO L1b spectrally resolved radiances data to capture high PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire events, enhancing our understanding of PM2.5 dynamics.

Unresolved congener coelutions add uncertainty in the interpretation of PCB exposures and associated health risks. To address this important data gap, we developed a quantitative approach to resolving PCB coelutions. In commonly used analytical methods, PCB congeners may coelute within the same analytical peak, with peaks typically containing 2–3 congeners. Importantly, the presence and composition of PCB congener coelutions varies across analytical and experimental methods. We leveraged this variation, creating a data set of 151 air studies from existing literature that reported measures for multiple individual PCB congeners. We then developed and applied a novel modeling framework that generates congener proportion estimates for each individual congener within 172 PCB coelution groupings identified in our review. This approach for resolving coelutions will be useful in a variety of applications, including exposure assessments and estimates of flux. More broadly, these data will be imperative for PCB risk and hazard assessments designed to address the potential differences in impacts to human health and the environment based on the individual congeners present in PCB mixtures."

In this study, the agonistic and antagonistic activities of 11 bisphenols on the estrogen receptor (ER) were screened using MVLN cells. Three distinct dose–response patterns were observed, namely, S-shaped, inverted S-shaped, and bell-shaped profiles, corresponding to the agonistic, antagonistic, and nonmonotonic effects on ERs, respectively. To further explore NMDRC, bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol AF (BPAF), as representative compounds, were specifically investigated for their antagonistic effects on ER under high exposure concentrations (10–50 μmol/L). Notably, the successive decline in cell viability suggested a subhealthy cell state upon high-dose chemical treatments, compromising cell response in ER transactivation. Unlike the specific effect induced by an ERα antagonist (4-hydroxytamoxifen, 4OHT), the nonspecific inhibitory effects of BPB and BPAF on ER transactivation were further confirmed with their identical antagonistic curves, with or without E2 cotreatment, due to hydrophobicity-related cellular baseline toxicity. Accordingly, the inhibitory effects on NR transactivation might not necessarily be considered as a specific antagonistic activity. Thus, a more cautious inspection is highly encouraged in screening NR antagonism-centered endocrine-disrupting effects of emerging chemicals by carefully reviewing the specificity of signal reduction or inhibition."

In this study, we developed an air sampling system based on the TEA technique using fast‐response mass flow controllers. The TEA system collects updrafts and downdrafts at sampling flow rates proportional to the vertical wind speed, unless the wind speed exceeds a certain threshold. We evaluated the TEA system above a temperate forest in Japan from May to December 2022 by comparing CO2 fluxes measured by the TEA system with those measured using EC. The comparison showed a moderate correlation (R = 0.86) with a small but significant negative bias in the TEA system (2%), likely because of the wind threshold.

TEMPO achieves high accuracy at 5% cloud‐filtering threshold: correlation coefficient (R) of 0.86, index of agreement (IOA) of 0.91, mean absolute bias (MAB) of 1.423 × 1015 molecules/cm2, and a percentage MAB (MABP) of 23.1%, corresponding to a 12% underestimation. Accuracy decreases when pixels with greater cloud‐cover are included. Solar zenith angle (SZA) of 10–20° yields the highest accuracy (R: 0.87, MABP: 22.7%), whereas SZAs of 70–80° yield the lowest (R: 0.71, MABP: 35.2%). Consequently, early‐morning or near‐sunset observations are less reliable than midday. This discrepancy could stem from inaccurate simulation of diurnal variations in the boundary‐layer height in the a‐priori, and from larger uncertainties in radiative transfer at high SZAs. TEMPO overestimates TOTNO2 at low NO2 levels and underestimates at high levels, with maximum biases of +16% (low) and −31% (high), respectively. Station‐to‐station performance varies considerably, with R ranging from 0.29 to 0.84 and MABP from 14.9% to 49.3%. Stations situated at higher altitudes relative to the ground show reduced agreement with TEMPO, as Pandora cannot detect NO2 below the instrument's altitude, whereas TEMPO retrieves the full column. Validation of TEMPO TOTNO2 at TROPOMI overpass time indicates that TEMPO's performance relative to Pandora (IOA: 0.93, MABP: 22.3%) closely matches that of TROPOMI (IOA: 0.92, MABP: 20.1%)."

But a more extreme climate allows for improved predictions and enables advisory services that allow farmers, ranchers and consumers to respond effectively. To date, there is limited uptake of forecasts. How can we make sure these predictions are valued by and valuable for users of agro‐climatic forecasts? Over the past two years, we held over 40 interviews with food system stakeholders to identify their needs and shortcomings of existing decision support. In this Commentary, we combine these findings and nascent modeling efforts with existing literature to characterize five lessons for improving the uptake and utilization of predictive tools for last mile users in the agrifood system. Given the explosion of machine learning prediction efforts across many applications, we believe our lessons are broadly applicable to forecasting models intended for decision support.

Danielli;M. Lengaigne;K. Sadhvi;S. Gopika;J. Vialard,Drivers of CMIP Tropical Pacific Warming Pattern Diversity,"Anthropogenic changes in sea surface temperature relative to the tropical mean (relative SST) play a pivotal role in influencing atmospheric stability and circulation. In the tropical Pacific, CMIP5/6 multi‐model mean (MMM) projections by the end of the 21st century show a southeastern relative cooling and a reduced equatorial SST gradient, although individual models exhibit considerable diversity. Using a simplified heat budget framework, we analyze the processes driving these relative SST changes across 63 CMIP5/6 models under historical and most pessimistic future scenarios. In the southeastern tropical Pacific, MMM relative SST cooling is driven by intensified winds that enhance latent heat flux, with inter‐model diversity explained by variations in clouds and winds. Conversely, the MMM equatorial SST gradient reduction arises from reduced evaporative cooling efficiency in the climatologically cold eastern Pacific. A heat budget covariance analysis reveals that inter‐model diversity in equatorial Pacific warming is predominantly driven by ocean dynamical processes, challenging previous studies that emphasized cloud feedback mechanisms. Clouds instead mitigate inter‐model spread. The inter‐model spread in ocean dynamics is linked to two factors: trade wind relaxation and the cold tongue bias. Stronger trade wind relaxation amplifies western Pacific warming, while a weaker cold tongue indicates a less effective ocean thermostat, enhancing eastern Pacific warming. During the present‐day period, only a subset of models captures the observed equatorial SST gradient strengthening, but the mechanisms vary across these models, complicating the identification of robust drivers of this observed trend."

Keenan,Widespread underestimation of rain-induced soil carbon emissions from global drylands,"Eddy-covariance observations suggest that rain pulses over global drylands drive substantial soil carbon emissions, which are underestimated in current measurement and modelling approaches. 
 Dryland carbon fluxes, particularly those driven by ecosystem respiration, are highly sensitive to water availability and rain pulses. However, the magnitude of rain-induced carbon emissions remains unclear globally. Here we quantify the impact of rain-pulse events on the carbon balance of global drylands and characterize their spatiotemporal controls. Using eddy-covariance observations of carbon, water and energy fluxes from 34 dryland sites worldwide, we produce an inventory of over 1,800 manually identified rain-induced CO2 pulse events. Based on this inventory, a machine learning algorithm is developed to automatically detect rain-induced CO2 pulse events. Our findings show that existing partitioning methods underestimate ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis by up to 30% during rain-pulse events, which annually contribute 16.9 ± 2.8% of ecosystem respiration and 9.6 ± 2.2% of net ecosystem productivity. We show that the carbon loss intensity correlates most strongly with annual productivity, aridity and soil pH. Finally, we identify a universal decay rate of rain-induced CO2 pulses and use it to bias-correct respiration estimates. Our research highlights the importance of rain-induced carbon emissions for the carbon balance of global drylands and suggests that ecosystem models may largely underrepresent the influence of rain pulses on the carbon cycle of drylands.

 Model simulations project that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will weaken in response to global warming, but with large uncertainty. The past 20 kyr are a prime target for model validation, as boundary conditions are reasonably well known, and the AMOC and climate experienced dramatic changes during this period. Here we present eight subsurface Atlantic temperature reconstructions based on benthic foraminiferal magnesium-to-lithium ratios, and compare the timing and amplitude of reconstructed changes with those in two coupled climate model simulations. We show that compared with the last glaciation and the past 8 kyr, the shallow (~500–1,100 m water depth) tropical North Atlantic was anomalously warm during most of the last deglaciation and early Holocene, which the models suggest is due to a relatively weak AMOC that reduced advection and allowed heat to accumulate. Our temperature reconstructions imply that the AMOC strengthened ~14.7 kyr ago and during the early Holocene (from ~12 to 8 kyr ago), suggesting that enhanced northward heat transport contributed to Northern Hemisphere warming and deglacial melting at these times. The transient model simulations predict features of temperature reconstruction with varying success, possibly because deglacial and Holocene AMOC strength are poorly constrained, and not accurately simulated.

 Current integrated photonics typically utilizes the dynamical phase associated resonant on-chip components, leading to bandwidth-limited devices with perturbation-sensitive performance. Multi-mode geometric phase matrix, arising from the non-Abelian holonomy which is a non-resonant and global effect, has been recently introduced to integrated photonics for the design of broadband and robust on-chip photonic devices. Achieving reconfigurable on-chip non-Abelian photonic devices is a crucial step towards practical applications, which however remains elusive.

We implement this concept in double-layered polymer integrated platforms, experimentally demonstrating a four-mode non-Abelian braiding device comprising six sets of tunable two-mode braiding building blocks. Through modulations, the device can be reconfigured to generate up to 24 unitary matrices belonging to the braid group B4.

 Portable wearable robots offer promise for assisting people with upper limb disabilities. However, movement variability between individuals and trade-offs between supportiveness and transparency complicate robot control during real-world tasks. We address these challenges by first developing a personalized ML intention detection model to decode user’s motion intention from IMU and compression sensors. Second, we leverage a physics-based hysteresis model to enhance control transparency and adapt it for practical use in real-world tasks. Third, we combine and integrate these two models into a real-time controller to modulate the assistance level based on the user’s intention and kinematic state. Fourth, we evaluate the effectiveness of our control strategy in improving arm function in a multi-day evaluation. For 5 individuals post-stroke and 4 living with ALS wearing a soft shoulder robot, we demonstrate that the controller identifies shoulder movement with 94.2% accuracy from minimal change in the shoulder angles (elevation: 3.4°, depression: 1.7°) and reduces arm-lowering force by 31.9% compared to a baseline controller. Furthermore, the robot improves movement quality by increasing their shoulder elevation/depression (17.5°), elbow (10.6°) and wrist flexion/extension (7.6°) ROMs; reducing trunk compensation (up to 25.4%); and improving hand-path efficiency (up to 53.8%).

 Nuclear loss and cytoplasmic buildup of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is a hallmark of ALS and related disorders. While studies using artificial TDP-43 depletion in neurons have revealed changes in gene expression and splicing, their relevance to actual patients remained unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons (iPSNs) from 180 individuals, including controls, C9orf72 ALS/FTD, and sporadic ALS (sALS) patients were used to generate and analyze ~32,500 qRT-PCR data points across 20 genes which identified variable, time-dependent signatures of TDP-43 loss of function in individual lines. Notably, the same changes were also seen in postmortem brain tissue from the same patients, confirming that iPSNs accurately model disease. Inducing damage to the nuclear pore complex, specifically by reducing the nucleoporin POM121 in healthy iPSNs, was enough to replicate the molecular changes associated with ALS/FTD TDP-43 dysfunction. This directly links nuclear pore integrity to TDP-43-related pathology. Encouragingly, repairing nuclear pore injury in sALS iPSNs restored normal gene processing disrupted by TDP-43 loss. This study (1) provides a valuable population-scale resource for studying TDP-43 dysfunction in ALS, (2) confirms that patient-derived iPSNs closely reflect disease processes seen in the brain, and (3) demonstrates that targeting nuclear pore injury may offer a promising therapeutic strategy in ALS.

 The demand for mining metals via electrodeposition drives the need for high-performance electrodes. Traditional adsorbents are electrically insulating, limiting efficiency due to poor electrical contact. We overcome this by infiltrating conductive polymers into adsorbent pores, enhancing electrical connectivity and aligning chelators. This improves electrical pathways, enabling rapid nucleation and high space-time efficiency. Electrochemical uranium uptake from spiked seawater reaches 26.5 g uranium per gram of adsorbents, four times higher than electrodes mixing adsorbents with carbon black, and two orders of magnitude higher than physicochemical methods. The system also achieves uranium mining from natural seawater at 17.4 mg g−1 with an enrichment index of 1.1 × 10⁷. This strategy offers a blueprint for designing electrodes with better electronic access to active sites, boosting performance in electrically driven processes.

 Increased aerosols can modify the shape of the cloud Particle Size Distribution (PSD), thereby influencing the radiative properties of clouds, known as the Dispersion Effect (DE). However, a global, observation-based quantification of its impact on Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (ACI) is lacking, leading to DE being typically ignored in satellite-based estimates of ACI forcing. Here we propose a physics-based method that combines polarimetric satellite data on cloud PSD to achieve global observational quantification of DE’s impact on ACI in liquid-phase stratiform clouds. Globally, DE offsets ACI changes induced by droplet number concentration variation and liquid water path adjustment by 7% and −1.4%, respectively. Furthermore, a parameterization based on the global dataset of PSD shape parameters is developed to improve DE estimation in large-scale models. Both the quantification and parameterization enhance our understanding of DE and facilitate the inclusion of this non-negligible impact of DE on ACI in estimating aerosol climate forcing.

Here, Zhu et al. reports a strategy using peptide-based rigid nanorods for increased hydrogel toughness and compressive strength while preserving biocompatibility, demonstrating enhanced osteochondral repair and compatibility with additive manufacturing. 
 Enhancing the toughness of hydrogels for biomedical applications remains a challenge, as many toughening approaches often sacrifice biocompatibility or in situ applicability, thereby restricting their broader utility in biomedical contexts. Inspired by the intervertebral disk, here, we introduce a biocompatible toughening strategy using peptide-based rigid nanorods (PRNs) as backbone supports within gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. PRNs are short polymers with exceptional rigidity, capable of covalent cross-linking with GelMA molecules at both ends. Photocuring nanorod-supported GelMA (NSG) molecules yields NSG hydrogels, which demonstrate great improvements in compressive strength (1018%) and toughness (508%) compared to untreated GelMA hydrogels, alongside enhanced structural integrity and fatigue resistance. We further demonstrate that NSG hydrogels are ideal for in situ repair of damaged osteochondral tissues and are highly compatible with additive manufacturing, owing to their good biocompatibility and photocurable properties. This strategy provides a potential pathway for developing highly biocompatible and tough hydrogels, significantly expanding their potential for biomedical applications.

 An emerging class of two-dimensional semiconductor materials, metal-organic chalcogenolates (MOCs), have garnered significant attention due to the strong excitonic effects arising from their intrinsic soft, hybrid multiquantum-well structures. However, modifying excitonic transitions that strongly couple to the argentophilic networks and constructing their structure-property relationships in MOCs remain daunting challenges. Here, we use silver phenylselenolate (AgSePh) as a model system to manipulate excitonic behavior and uncover the fundamental photophysical mechanisms through pressure engineering. A bright broadband Stokes-shifted emission is observed in AgSePh crystals along with the disappearance of blue narrow emission upon compression, which is attributed to the pressure-induced carrier transformation from free exciton to self-trapping exciton states. The considerable compressibility of the Ag-Se inorganic monolayer, driven by weakly bound argentophilic interactions, generates pronounced argentophilic intralayer distortion while simultaneously enhancing exciton-phonon coupling and excitonic oscillator strength. This work demonstrates the remarkable tunability of excitonic properties in layered MOCs.

 Terrestrial and marine ecosystems constitute the primary components of the Earth’s biosphere, yet their photosynthetic productions are typically studied separately, which limits understanding of planetary carbon uptake and biosphere health. Here, using multiple satellite-derived products, we identify contrasting net primary production (NPP) trends between land and ocean, probably reflecting their differential sensitivity to climate warming, especially in tropical regions. Planetary NPP shows an overall increase of 0.11 ± 0.13 PgC yr−1 (P = 0.05) from 2003 to 2021, driven by a significant terrestrial enhancement of 0.20 ± 0.07 PgC yr−1 (P < 0.001) and partially offset by an oceanic decline of −0.12 ± 0.12 PgC yr−1 (P = 0.07). While land contributes to the strong upwards NPP trend, the interannual variability in global NPP is predominantly driven by the ocean, especially during strong El Niño–Southern Oscillation events.

 The infrastructure available to a nation for the management of its solid waste not only affects its population and environment, it plays a role in addressing global challenges of greenhouse gas emissions and ocean plastics. Several approaches attempt to address this purpose, but their adoption is dependent on available resources. While nations in the global south struggle with waste collection and rely heavily on open dumping, those in the global north invest in more advanced technologies to divert materials from disposal to recovery. To address cross-border waste concerns, a more in-depth understanding of the cost–benefit relationship of different strategies is required. Here we show that investment in advancing the waste infrastructure of the global south achieves a higher mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and marine plastics than further upgrades in the global north. Basic collection is the essential step to reducing marine plastics, and a transition from open dumps and burning to controlled landfills does more to reduce methane and black carbon emissions than upgrading existing systems to advanced technologies. Our results demonstrate how targeted expenditures towards basic infrastructure components in those areas with the least investment are a more efficient use of global resources for mitigating climate change and reducing marine plastics.

Seasonal features of the Antarctic haze appearance were that they were maximal in August and were associated with strong wind conditions and sea-ice extent. Aerosol enhanced layers (AELs) appeared in the surface – free troposphere (ca. 4 km). AELs were identified also in mid-April – October.

 Most countries have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 °C–2 °C above pre-industrial levels. However, the response of Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface temperatures respond under net-zero CO2 remains uncertain. Using climate model simulations, we have found that NH temperatures exhibit either early or delayed warming following the achievement of net-zero emissions. These divergent responses are driven by differences in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which begins to diverge ~50 years prior to net-zero. In cases of early warming, increased salinity in the subpolar Atlantic leads to earlier AMOC recovery. Conversely, delayed AMOC recovery postpones NH warming. These results highlight the critical role of pre-net-zero conditions in the subpolar North Atlantic in determining the divergent responses of NH warming after net-zero emissions."

 The Amundsen Sea Undercurrent, off West Antarctica, transports warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf, driving basal melting when it reaches the ice shelves through troughs. However, vertical heat loss from the warm inflow to the cold upper ocean remains understudied. Here we use observations and numerical modeling to investigate mixing-induced vertical heat flux in a major trough, finding: (1) turbulent mixing transfers 1.7 W m−2 of heat to the upper ocean during observational period, potentially reducing sea ice growth by 0.2 m yr−1; and (2) mixing is modulated by undercurrent strength, with stronger undercurrent enhancing vertical shear across the on-shelf thermocline, promoting internal wave breaking and mixing. This flux is non-negligible in the on-shelf heat budget, particularly on annual and longer timescales.

 Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) is critical for global climate change mitigation and sustainable soil management. However, information on long term dynamics of SOC over large area is lacking. Supported by soil samples collected over years and environmental covariates, space and time digital soil mapping (ST-DSM) has become an important and effective method to reveal the spatio-temporal changes of SOC. The contiguous United States (CONUS) has abundant and well-documented soil samples with time labels, which lays the groundwork for us to estimate the long-term SOC dynamics in multiple soil layers over that region with high resolution. Specifically, we propose leveraging time-series soil data from World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) and International Soil Carbon Network (ISCN) to build ST-DSM models at different soil depths based on matching environmental covariates and machine learning techniques (random forest framework). Then, multi-depth ST-DSM models are employed to generate spatial prediction of SOC in different layers (0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–100 cm) from 1955 to 2014 at 250 m resolution and 5-year intervals (1955–1959, 1960–1964,…., 2010–2014). Meanwhile, predictive uncertainties are quantified via Quantile Regression Forest (QRF). Furthermore, we analyze the dynamic trends in SOC stocks across various depths and land uses. The results indicate that over 60 years, overall SOC stocks in 0–100 cm demonstrate a multi-stage change of “rising-fluctuating”. SOC stocks in 0–100 cm rose from 68.40 Pg (1 Pg = 10^15 g) to 70.33 Pg with an increase rate of 32.25 Tg (1 Tg = 10^12 g) per year. SOC stocks in 0–15 cm layer declined slightly before 1970 and increased thereafter; the 15–100 cm layer fluctuated with an overall rising trend; notably, the 60–100 cm layer exhibited a steady upward trend with minimal fluctuations since 1980s, suggesting a greater SOC accumulation potential in soil beneath 15 cm. Across different land uses, the topsoil of cropland may be a source of carbon, while forests are important carbon sinks. SOC stocks in surface soil (0–15 cm) in cropland areas notably decreased, and subsurface and deep soil in cropland (15–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–100 cm) showed a fluctuating rising trend. SOC stocks in forest show an overall fluctuating rising trend. Pastureland, unmanaged natural grasslands and sparse/no vegetation areas once showed some carbon sequestration capacity in the past, but they have transitioned to slower accumulation. This research enhances our understanding of soil carbon dynamics at a national scale and provides references for the development of effective soil management and climate mitigation strategies. Soil organic carbon stocks above 1 m increased from 68.40 Pg to 70.33 Pg, exhibiting a multi-stage change of “rising-fluctuating” for the last 60 years across the Contiguous United States, according to a spatial-temporal analysis of soil organic carbon dataset spanning from 1955 to 2014."

 InSAR measurements reveal widespread and high-amplitude permafrost-related solifluction movements across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). This raises questions about the mechanisms driving these slope processes and, more specifically, the relationships between cyclic soil expansion during freezing and irreversible downslope motions during thawing. In this study, we develop and apply a methodology to map solifluction motions using multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data and characterize their amplitudes and spatial distributions at a regional scale. This method decomposes line-of-sight InSAR time series into pluri-annual velocities and seasonally reversible surface displacements that are then inverted into motions parallel and normal to the local steepest slope. Pluri-annual downslope and subsidence velocities in the northeastern QTP are analyzed and cross-correlated with slope-normal seasonal cycles and the slope across unconsolidated sediments and indurated bedrock colluvium separately. Our analysis indicates significant downslope velocities (> 4 mm/yr), with varying sensitivities to slope. Overall, downslope velocities exceed those expected from seasonal frost creep alone and are likely triggered by basal soil shearing during the thawing of the ice-rich layers. Downslope velocities are particularly high for indurated bedrock colluvium, which exhibit low-amplitude slope-normal seasonal cycles compared to unconsolidated sediments. We explain these differences by variations in regolith layer thicknesses, which impact the downslope deformation depths. Measurements of subsidence and amplified seasonal cycles through time indicate ongoing permafrost degradation and ice loss within the QTP, directly impacting slope stability, primarily by intensifying seasonal basal solifluction processes."

 Land surface albedo (LSA) plays a fundamental role in the terrestrial energy-water‑carbon nexus, with its variability primarily driven by contributions from bare soil (SL), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and photosynthetic vegetation (PV). However, current global land surface models (LSMs) primarily rely on temporally static maps or simplified look-up tables of the albedo components, which inadequately capture their spatiotemporal dynamics. While satellite-derived LSA products provide dynamic LSA observation information, they do not explicitly provide separate individual surface albedo components, and existing unmixing models struggle to isolate NPV impacts from bare soil backgrounds. To bridge these gaps, this study develops a generalized parameterization scheme and global albedo component datasets across three broadbands (visible, near infrared, and shortwave) and seven MODIS spectral bands. Following the mathematical form of the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse (RTLS) model, we explicitly parameterize the surface albedo components using cubic and exponential polynomial equations, incorporating the effects of soil/vegetation types, soil moisture, terrain roughness, and solar zenith angle (SZA). Furthermore, a pixel-wise optimization model refines the parameterization, enabling the generation of global gap-free albedo component maps at 500 m and 0.05° resolutions.Global site validation yields RMSEs of 0.043 for SL albedo, 0.051 for NPV albedo, and 0.029 for PV albedo, outperforming existing methods. Cross-validation indicates that the albedo components are consistent with the reference product, while preserving high spatial resolution and accounting for illumination geometry effects. Additionally, the derived maps exhibit reasonable spatiotemporal variability at both regional and global scales. Excluding the impact of NPV increases the SL albedo magnitude, thereby introducing decreases in soil net radiation by 7.80 W m-2 (11 %) over semi-arid regions. Evapotranspiration partitioning suggests that the SL albedo update helps mitigate the common overestimation of soil evaporation in drylands by improving surface energy representation. Vegetation albedo analysis underscores the critical role of illumination geometry in modeling circadian rhythms across diverse ecosystems. The open-source albedo component parameterization framework and maps will facilitate research on diurnal albedo asymmetry, water and carbon fluxes, and biophysical effects of vegetation components, with broad implications for high-resolution climate and ecohydrological modeling."

 Estuarine mudflats are colonized by biofilm-forming microphytobenthos (MPB), which support primary production, stabilize sediment, and provide critical food for benthic invertebrates and shorebirds. MPB biomass fluctuates intra-daily, peaking post-emersion and declining before tidal immersion. Understanding these dynamics requires high-resolution monitoring, yet traditional methods, including sediment sampling and satellite imagery, lack the necessary spatial and temporal precision. We used unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) to map MPB distribution, biomass, and mudflat morphology at shorebird-relevant scales. Hourly multispectral surveys over two 12-hour tidal emersion cycles at the Fraser River Estuary, British Columbia—an internationally significant shorebird stopover—captured diel MPB dynamics. Optical imagery was processed using a photogrammetric co-alignment approach to generate continuous chl-a maps (via the normalized vegetation index), digital surface models, and topographic position index layers. UAV-derived data were integrated with climate variables to model MPB variability and quantify diel biofilm patch dynamics. A modified Z-score normalization of pseudo-invariant features stabilized reflectance data, allowing fine-scale analysis of MPB distribution. Our diel model explained 31.6 % of MPB variation, with biomass peaking seven hours post-emersion, consistent with vertical migration of microalgae. Mudflat morphology significantly influenced MPB biomass, and spatial metrics revealed interactions between MPB dynamics, microtopography and shorebird foraging ecology. The study demonstrates the efficacy of high-temporal-resolution UAV imagery for monitoring MPB and mudflat morphology, enabling detailed examination of MPB diel vertical migration in response to emersion timing and light availability. Such new insights into estuarine ecology provide a framework for advancing conservation strategies and habitat management in intertidal environments."

 Semantic segmentation of ultra-large remote sensing images faces substantial memory challenges, with virtually no previous work successfully addressing the preservation of global context in such large-scale imagery. Despite the critical importance of maintaining long-range relationships, GPU memory limitations have forced researchers to process these massive images as small disconnected patches. Our novel framework represents a breakthrough, being the first approach (with only one prior incomplete attempt in literature) to efficiently process large 4K patches on a single 24 GB GPU while preserving crucial large-scale image context. Unlike conventional tiling methods, our approach maintains global context through an innovative two-stage process: first extracting features from smaller 1K patches using encoders from powerful segmentation models (SegFormer and the Segment Anything Model), then assembling these embeddings to train a 4K decoder.

 Beach slope is critical for monitoring coastline erosion and assessing coastal vulnerability. However, accurately estimating beach slopes at large scales remains a great challenge due to the dynamic nature of tidal exposure, the limited availability of in-situ topographic data, and the coarse resolution or coverage gaps of traditional DEM products. This study proposed a novel method driven by the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) ATL03 product for estimating coastal slopes of sandy beaches by considering ICESat-2 photon characteristics and beach morphology. First, we corrected the ICESat-2 photons along satellite trajectories to the direction perpendicular to the coastline, and then preliminarily eliminated sea surface photons. Second, we combined the adaptive threshold OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) algorithm and the moving window filter to accurately extract sandy beach photons. Third, horizontal ranges of sandy beaches were determined by the quadratic polynomial model, and coastal slopes were estimated using a linear regression model. The proposed large-scale method for deriving beach slopes relies primarily on ICESat-2 photon counting light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and auxiliary vector data, which does not require in-situ measurements. We applied this method to calculate coastal slopes for 212 sandy beaches with 1,297 profiles in New Zealand and conducted a validation using 1 m high-accuracy airborne Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Our results indicate that the inverted beach slopes from our method exhibit a high accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.06, determination coefficient (R2) = 0.76). In the future, this method has a large potential for global applications using ICESat-2 data, serving as a valuable tool for estimating coastal slopes for sandy beaches worldwide."

 The seasonal characteristics of aerosol number concentration (NCN) and cloud condensation nuclei number concentration (NCCN) in Seoul from 2019 to 2021 were analyzed. The average NCN and NCCN at 0.6 % supersaturation (SS) were 12,612 cm−3 and 2,829 cm−3, respectively, representing significant decreases of approximately 30 % and 50 % compared to the values from 2004 to 2010. Despite these reductions, diurnal and seasonal patterns remained consistent over time. However, distinct seasonal differences were noted, particularly in the relationship between NCN and NCCN: in winter, NCN and NCCN exhibited similar trends in both diurnal variation and back trajectory analysis, whereas in summer, their trends frequently diverged. To account for these pronounced seasonal differences, predictions of NCN and NCCN were conducted separately by season using the Random Forest Regression Model. The seasonally tailored predictions provided improved performance compared to the Multiple Linear Regression Model used as a baseline. Analysis of importance of each predictor revealed that NCN was the most significant predictor of NCCN at 0.4–1.0 % SS in winter, while particulate matter (PM10) played a more critical role across all supersaturation levels in summer and at 0.2 % SS in winter. These results suggest seasonally distinct mechanisms driving CCN formation in Seoul. Overall, this study highlighted recent trends in aerosols and CCN reflecting the rapid changes of air quality at a representative urban region in East Asia, and the data presented in this study can be used as representative values of aerosol and CCN in East Asian urban region for aerosol–cloud interaction studies in climate models."

 The gas-particle (G-P) partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds has been commonly investigated by simultaneously measuring their concentrations in the gas and particle phases, but the effects of coarse particles were not well known. In this study, collocated gas-PM2.5 and gas-TSP samples were collected in the suburbs of Nanjing, a typical megacity in the Yangtze River Delta in China, and analyzed for non-polar organic molecular markers (NP-OMMs), including n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated PAHs (oxy-PAHs), and steranes and hopanes. Except for low-volatility n-alkanes (vapor pressure < 10−10 atm), all other groups of NP-OMMs in paired PM2.5 and TSP samples had comparable median concentrations, and the concentration time series of PAHs, oxy-PAHs, and steranes and hopanes were strongly correlated (r > 0.80, p < 0.01). Based on the collocated measurements of gaseous samples, the relative uncertainties for the concentrations of grouped n-alkanes and oxy-PAHs (17.3 %–27.7 %) are greater than for the PAHs (12.4 %–21.3 %). The mean particulate fractions of the grouped NP-OMMs were almost identical between gas-PM2.5 and gas-TSP samples, indicating a weak influence of coarse particles on the distribution of NP-OMMs in the gas and particle phases in Nanjing. Whenever the gas-PM2.5 or gas-TSP data were used to validate the prediction of G-P partitioning coefficients, the partitioning of gaseous n-alkanes and PAHs into the particle phase was majorly driven by absorption and adsorption mechanisms, respectively. When coarse particles were considered for the prediction of the G-P partitioning of PAHs, less liquid-like sorption had to be assumed."

 This article harnesses data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) to explore global diurnal cycles of lightning (DCL) spanning the period from 1998 to 2015. Lightning parameters—frequency, radiance, and footprint—were standardized to a 0.5° × 0.5° resolution grid and segmented into distinct diurnal patterns using the Bisecting K-Means algorithm. Across these patterns, significant differences emerge between ocean and land lightning activity. Globally, lightning frequency demonstrates a unimodal variation, reaching a peak at 16:00 and a valley at 10:00, driven by solar heating of the landmass and contributed to predominantly by lightning over land. The land/ocean frequency ratio shifts dynamically throughout the day, ranging from 0.70 to 11.36. Ocean lightning consistently shows higher radiance and footprint than land. The ocean/land radiance and footprint ratio follow a similar diurnal trend as frequency, ranging from 1.33 to 2.22 and from 1.16 to 1.39, respectively. Clustering analysis underscores the contrasting dynamics of land and ocean, with ocean lightning concentrated during nighttime hours, while land lightning peaks in the afternoon and evening. Transitional zones with distinct clusters are observed along the coastline. Furthermore, DCLs reveal differences across the three lightning parameters: frequency trends are more temporal concentrations, whereas radiance and footprint clusters span broader time periods. DCLs exhibit pronounced spatial heterogeneity across latitude, distance from coastline, and elevation. The clustering patterns shift at different critical latitudes for each parameter, with hemispheric asymmetry in distribution patterns. Clusters exhibit distinct distance-variation patterns over land and ocean, with nocturnal activity patterns becoming dominant with increasing elevation. This study fills a pivotal gap in global DCL research and provides important clues for studying lightning mechanisms, thereby contributing to the development of effective global lightning protection strategies."

 This transboundary study evaluates the ability of the new high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis ALADIN to simulate sub-daily precipitation totals in the Czech Republic, Germany and, the Netherlands during 18 warm seasons (April–October) from 2002 to 2019. Specifically, the evaluation is performed separately for two numerical weather prediction (NWP) model runs. The first, ALADIN/Reanalysis, includes the full assimilation of the observed data every 6 h using a digital upper-air filter, which combines the high-resolution ALADIN guess with ERA5, the result of a global 4D variational analysis. The second, ALADIN/Evaluation Run, is also driven by ERA5 but uses no surface data assimilation. The evaluation is performed on an hourly basis with a horizontal grid spacing of 2.3 km (total = 215,169 km2) compared with observational data represented by gauge-adjusted radar precipitation measurements. The results show that simulated seasonal precipitation sums are overestimated by an average of 20 % (ALADIN/Reanalysis) and 23 % (ALADIN/Evaluation Run) compared to observations. The overestimation is usually greater in higher-elevation areas such as the Alps and the Black Forest in southern Germany or the Ore Mountains and the Giant Mountains in the Czech Republic. On the other hand, precipitation sums for the Netherlands appear to be the most accurate, with overestimations of less than 20 % for both NWP model runs. The main reason for higher seasonal precipitation sums is the large number of very low hourly precipitation totals (i.e., < 0.1 mm) in the reanalysis. Once filtered out, the mean precipitation totals are typically underestimated throughout the diurnal cycle, especially in higher-elevation areas. In addition, maximum values of convective precipitation in mountainous regions are simulated in the morning, while their actual occurrence prevails in the afternoon when the warming of the Earth's surface culminates. In contrast, the frequency of high hourly precipitation totals is underestimated in both model runs, as evident from the frequency of 24 mm precipitation totals in the ALADIN/Reanalysis and 29 mm in the ALADIN/Evaluation Run. The underestimation is less evident in the ALADIN/Evaluation run, which can produce higher hourly precipitation totals than the ALADIN/Reanalysis run. Additionally, the results show that reanalysis can more plausibly simulate long-term stratiform precipitation events than purely convective events or stratiform events with embedded convection."

This depletion is a consequence of the local temperature decreasing as a function of heliocentric distance before planetesimal accretion.

Furthermore, BACH2 ablation compromised the functionality of ILC2s, resulting in a resolution of allergic airway inflammation. Notably, the different binding sites of BACH2 in ILC2s and TH2 cells suggested that BACH2 binds to IRF4 to control the function of ILC2, underscoring its context-specific effects on allergic airway inflammation.

Rye,GTP hydrolysis triggers membrane remodeling by AMPH-1,"Membrane-enclosed transport carriers return biological molecules from the recycling endosome to the plasma membrane using a mechanism that is not well understood. InCaenorhabditis elegans, the formation of carriers from the recycling endosome requires the amphiphysin protein AMPH-1. Recently, we found that purified AMPH-1 is sufficient for tubulation and vesiculation of liposomes in a mechanism that is regulated by guanine nucleotides. Here, we propose a model linking guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis to the membrane binding and tubulation required for transport carrier formation. We find that GTP binding stabilizes interactions between AMPH-1 and the membrane through amphipathic, amino-terminal α helices, which are found at the tips of the arc-shaped, homodimeric structure. By contrast, in the posthydrolysis, guanosine diphosphate–bound state, these helices are repositioned to interact with the amino-terminal helices of other homodimers, to form an oligomeric AMPH-1 lattice that tubulates the membrane, in preparation for carrier formation by membrane fission."

However, strategies for manipulating ferroelectric dipoles in elemental ferroelectrics remain underexplored, limiting their broader applications. Here, we introduce a universal flexoelectric manipulation strategy to tune the ferroelectric and piezoelectric polarization of one-dimensional self-strained tellurium (Te) ferroelectrics. A substantial flexoelectric field of 9.55 microcoulombs per square centimeter was observed in self-strained Te, inducing a polarization rotation of 18°, comparable to the typical 15° rotation in ferroelectric PbTiO3compounds. This substantial polarization rotation enhances ferroelectric coercivity by 165% and piezoelectric responses by 75% compared to unstrained Te. Moreover, the flexoelectric manipulation of ferroelectric polarization demonstrated improved energy harvesting performance at the device level, surpassing most existing counterparts. Our findings highlight the crucial role of flexoelectricity-ferroelectricity coupling in developing high-performance single-element electromechanical devices and ferroelectronics."

Transcription factors are essential for motor neuron development, regulating their specification, migration, and axonal targeting. While transcriptional regulation of the early stages of motor neuron specification is well established, much less is known about the role of transcription factors in the later stages of maturation and muscle targeting. Defining the molecular mechanisms of these later stages is critical for elucidating how motor circuits are constructed. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation. Moreover, we find that NFIA is required for proper mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production, providing an important link between transcription factors and metabolism during motor neuron development. Together, these findings underscore the critical role of NFIA in instructing the assembly of spinal circuits for movement."

It causes prolonged pain that persists beyond the usual expected time for tissue healing. Mechanisms underlying pain chronicity of CRPS-I remain unknown. Here, we identified the presence of long-lasting infiltration of macrophages in local dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat model of CRPS-I. We demonstrate that regenerating islet-derived 3β (Reg3β) is specifically produced by DRG neurons upon model establishment and functions as an important signaling molecule to drive proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in local DRG. Infiltrated macrophages produce TNF-α, which causes hyperexcitability of nociceptive DRG neurons and reciprocally promotes Reg3β overexpression and secretion from DRG neurons to recruit more macrophages. Our work reveals a positive feedback signaling conveyed by neuronal Reg3β/macrophage TNF-α that contributes to neuroinflammation in DRG, resulting in persistent pain in a rat model of CRPS-I.

To develop a molecular understanding of the differences underlying transducer coupling and activation, we performed structure-activity relationship studies of 5-HT1A with distinct G proteins.

We further investigated the differences in G protein engagement at 5-HT1A with cryo–electron microscopy, determining structures of 5-HT1A bound to distinct ligands and G protein subtypes.

We present a diffusion model–based virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with periodic acid–Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite using IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach uses optimized noise sampling during the diffusion model’s inference to achieve reliable and repeatable virtual staining.

DPP4i-BP differs from typical BP in its genetic, clinical, and immunological features, but methods to specifically detect DPP4i-BP autoantibodies have been unavailable. This study used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with “domain-swapped BP180” proteins to identify autoantibodies in DPP4i-BP, which targeted BP180 regions from the seventh noncollagenous domain to the fourth collagenous domain (NC7-Col4). These epitopes were associated with DPP4i-BP–specific human leukocyte antigen class II peptide epitopes. Notably, the duration of DPP4i intake before BP onset was significantly shorter in patients with anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies than those without them. Measuring the autoantibodies enabled the early diagnosis of DPP4i-BP before epitope spreading. Furthermore, anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies were detected in some patients with diabetes taking DPP4i without BP, suggesting that these assays may offer potential tools for early identification of at-risk individuals."

Hybridization between the metal’s surface d orbitals and molecular p orbitals profoundly alters both the interfacial molecular layer and adjacent metal interface atomic layers, causing substantial changes in the magnetic properties of metal/molecule heterostructures. While magnetic modifications within the metallic layer are relatively well understood, the interfacial magnetism remains elusive. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, we investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures and identify a distinct interfacial magnetic component that appears universal across various cobalt/molecule combinations. Our findings reveal a highly anisotropic magnetic layer localized at the interface, which has remained undetected in static measurements. This interfacial layer likely originates from strong chemical modifications in the cobalt surface induced by chemisorbed molecules.

We compare DNA methylation rates in wild-type cells and chromatin remodeler mutants by normalizing nuclear methylation rates to the nonnucleosomal mitochondrial DNA methylation rate in each strain. Depletion of both Isw1 and Chd1 increases the normalized methylation rate, suggesting that these remodelers act together to suppress nucleosome dynamics. Separate depletion of Isw1, Chd1, or Rsc8 has little effect. A decaying sine wave model used to fit nucleosome phasing data shows that nucleosome dynamics decrease with distance from the promoter in an Isw1/Chd1-dependent manner.

Here, we strategically enhance perovskite TFT performance by incorporating 2-thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) into 3D tin-based perovskites. The induction of the pseudo-halide SCN−into a bilayer quasi-2D perovskite intermediate phase, combined with the strong interaction between sulfur-bearing thiophene rings (TEA+) and Sn-I octahedra, effectively reorients perovskite crystallization while inhibiting Sn2+oxidation and reducing trap density. Consequently, TEASCN-based TFTs achieve an average hole mobility of more than 60 square centimeters per volt per second and an on/off current ratio surpassing 108, standing out among state-of-the-art p-type perovskite TFTs. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices preserve 84% of their initial mobility after 30 days in an N2atmosphere, underscoring their remarkable stability.

Thirumalai,Static three-dimensional structures determine fast dynamics between distal loci pairs in interphase chromosomes,"Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure–function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer–promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains. Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts."

Here, we developed glutamate-linked upconversion nanoparticles (Glu-UCNP) to facilitate optogenetic control of axonal sprouting in SCI mice. After being specifically uptaken by the postsynaptic interneurons innervated by corticospinal tract (CST) axons, Glu-UCNP not only serves as internal light transducers that convert near-infrared light to visible light but also acts as nanobeacons that guide axonal sprouting toward postsynaptic neurons of glutamatergic synapses. This in situ optogenetic modulation successfully demonstrated the restoration of spinal motor circuits by rebuilding functional connections between CST axons and postsynaptic interneurons. It was corroborated by live-cell recording, immunofluorescence staining, in vivo Ca2+imaging, and pellet-reaching tests. Transcriptome sequencing further elucidated the molecular network changes underlying this optogenetic modulation. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic applications of optogenetic modulation in the reassembly of neural circuits after SCI."

No broad-spectrum antiviral is currently available. However, most respiratory viruses use sialic acid or heparan sulfates as attachment receptors. Here, we report the identification of a pan-respiratory antiviral strategy based on mimicking both glycans. We synthesized a modified cyclodextrin that simultaneously mimics heparan sulfate and sialic acid. This compound demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against important human pathogens: parainfluenza virus 3, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus H1N1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, the compound is active against avian strains of influenza virus, revealing its importance for pandemic preparedness. The compound retains broad-spectrum activity in ex vivo models of respiratory tissues and in vivo against respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, using prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. These findings contribute to the development of future treatments and preventive measures for respiratory viral infections."

Wang;Rubem Mondaini,Observation of quantum Darwinism and the origin of classicality with superconducting circuits,"The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of quantum Darwinism and the underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a computationally and experimentally inexpensive quantifier to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem."
