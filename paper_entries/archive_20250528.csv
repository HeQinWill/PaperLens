10.1021/acsestair.5c00053,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究论文探讨了小型公务机使用传统航空煤油和30%可持续航空燃料（SAF）混合燃料时的气体和颗粒物排放情况。研究重点是非挥发性颗粒物（nvPM）、气态污染物和挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的排放。研究结果表明，SAF混合燃料可以减少nvPM的排放，并对气候和空气质量产生积极影响。虽然该研究没有直接涉及遥感技术，但其对大气成分的分析和对空气质量影响的评估与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如，这些排放数据可以用于验证或改进大气传输模型，这些模型通常使用卫星观测数据进行校准。,"['air quality', 'particulate matter', 'gaseous emissions', 'sustainable aviation fuel', 'atmospheric composition']",Lukas Durdina;Zachary C.

Brem;Frithjof Siegerist;Theo Rindlisbacher,Gaseous and Particulate Emissions from a Small Business Jet Using Conventional Jet A-1 and a 30% SAF Blend,"Small turbofan engines (<26.7 kN thrust) are unregulated for gaseous and particulate emissions, with emissions data largely absent from public databases. Yet, their environmental impact is likely increasing. This study examines emissions from a representative small turbofan engine on a Cessna Citation 560XL. It focuses on nonvolatile particulate matter (nvPM), gaseous pollutants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Ground-level measurements were conducted using a standardized system with conventional Jet A-1 and a 30% blend of synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK). This sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend reduced the nvPM mass and number emission indices (EIs) by ∼35% and ∼20% at idle, with diminishing effects at higher thrust. Estimated nvPM number EIs at cruise decreased by ∼10%, suggesting a similar reduction in contrail ice particle concentrations at the predicted nvPM number EIs. While CO, HC, and NOx emissions remained unchanged, SO2 emissions decreased proportionally to the fuel sulfur content. VOC analysis showed lower emissions of complex unsaturated hydrocarbons. These findings highlight SAF’s potential to mitigate climate and air quality impacts. They also reveal discrepancies in estimated emissions from small turbofan engines and underscore limitations in existing models that predict fuel composition effects on nvPM emissions."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00165,True,ACS ES&T Air,该研究论文探讨了异戊二烯衍生的羟基RO2自由基（ISOPOO）在潮解颗粒物上的非均相吸收，以及过渡金属离子（Fe2+和Cu2+）对该吸收的影响。作者使用了一种化学转化技术，将RO2转化为OH自由基，并通过激光诱导荧光技术检测OH自由基。研究结果表明，掺杂FeCl2和CuCl2的潮解NaCl颗粒物对ISOPOO的吸收系数显著高于未掺杂的NaCl颗粒物。初步的模拟结果表明，在西日本地区，ISOPOO在潮解颗粒物上的非均相吸收对ISOPOO损失过程的贡献相对较小，但在高PM2.5事件期间，在偏远的森林和山区，这种贡献可能会增加到5%。虽然该研究没有直接使用遥感技术，但它研究了大气中重要物质的转化过程，并使用模型来评估其对空气质量的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测和大气成分分析）密切相关，因为这些过程影响着遥感观测的结果和解释。,"['atmospheric composition', 'isoprene', 'RO2 radicals', 'heterogeneous uptake', 'deliquesced particles', 'air quality modeling', 'PM2.5']",Yosuke Sakamoto;Rikudai Mikami;Jiaru Li;Nanase Kohno;Yu Morino;Kei Sato;Yoshizumi Kajii,Heterogeneous Uptake onto Deliquesced Particles as an Atmospheric Fate of Isoprene-Derived Hydroxy-RO2,"We integrated a chemical conversion technique to transform RO2 into OH radicals with a method combining laser photolysis radical generation and time-resolved OH radical detection by laser-induced fluorescence (LP-LIF). This approach allowed us to investigate the uptake coefficient of an isoprene-derived hydroxy–RO2, ISOPOO (HOC5H8OO·), onto deliquesced NaCl particles and the effect of transition metal ions (Fe2+ and Cu2+) on this uptake. We measured the uptake coefficients, γ, of ISOPOO on deliquesced NaCl particles doped with FeCl2 and CuCl2, each added at 5 wt % of NaCl, at 301 K and 84% relative humidity (RH). The results were 0.45 ± 0.01 for FeCl2 and 0.19 ± 0.01 for CuCl2. These values were 5 and 2 times greater than the uptake coefficient for deliquesced undoped NaCl particles, which was 0.09 ± 0.01. Preliminary simulation results for the western Japan domain, using a value of γ = 0.09 from a three-dimensional chemical transport model, indicate that the heterogeneous uptake of ISOPOO onto deliquesced particles contributed, on average, less than 3% of the ISOPOO loss process. This contribution increased to as much as 5% in remote forest and mountain areas during high PM2.5 events."
10.1029/2024JD043022,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇研究论文主要关注2000年以后平流层水汽的半球不对称性变化。研究利用卫星数据和模型模拟，发现北半球平流层水汽增加趋势更为明显。这种变化与Brewer-Dobson环流的减缓以及南半球臭氧恢复有关。论文强调了长期监测南半球平流层水汽的重要性，以更好地理解全球水汽动态。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来分析大气成分的变化。,"['Stratospheric water vapor', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Hemispheric asymmetry', 'Brewer-Dobson circulation', 'Ozone recovery']",Jingyuan Xu;Mengchu Tao;Jianchun Bian;Dan Li;Paul Konopka;Felix Ploeger,Recent Changes in Hemispheric Asymmetry of Stratospheric Water Vapor,"Stratospheric moistening after 2000, with a more pronounced trend in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), has been detected through satellite, in situ observations, and model simulations. This study aims to provide an updated analysis of the hemispheric asymmetry of stratospheric water vapor (SWV) for the period from 2000 to 2020 based on merged satellite data set and Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) simulations driven by ERA5. Over post‐2000 decades, significant changes were identified in comparison to the pre‐2000 period, notably a reversal in the SWV difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, particularly in the midlatitudes. This shift is largely attributed to a slowdown in the deep branch of Brewer‐Dobson circulation (BDC) in the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere after about year 2000. The cooling‐induced dehydration is the primary driver of the significantly lower SWV values in the Antarctic stratosphere than the Arctic stratosphere. This asymmetry increased before 2000 at a rate of 0.1–0.2 ppmv per decade. After 2000, however, this difference has decreased, primarily due to ozone recovery in the Southern Hemisphere, despite the enhanced northward transport of water vapor driven by the changes in the BDC. The study emphasizes the growing need for long‐term SWV monitoring in the Southern Hemisphere to better understand global water vapor dynamics."

Jacob,Global Rice Paddy Inventory (GRPI): A High‐Resolution Inventory of Methane Emissions From Rice Agriculture Based on Landsat Satellite Inundation Data,"Rice agriculture is a major source of atmospheric methane, but current emission inventories are highly uncertain, mostly due to poor rice‐specific inundation data. Inversions of atmospheric methane observations can help to better quantify rice emissions but require high‐resolution prior information on the location and timing of emissions. Here we use Landsat satellite data at 30 m resolution to map the global monthly distribution of rice paddy fractional areas on a 0.1° × 0.1° (∼10 × 10 km) grid by optimizing an algorithm for flooded vegetation and combining it with a 30 m global cropland database and rice‐specific data. We validate this global rice paddy map with an independent US rice database and with seasonal flux measurements from the FLUXNET CH4 network, estimating errors on rice area fraction of 31% on the 0.1° × 0.1° grid and 10% regionally. We combine the rice paddy map with an extensive global data set of emission factors (EFs) per unit of rice paddy area. The resulting Global Rice Paddy Inventory (GRPI) provides methane emission estimates at 0.1° × 0.1° (∼10 × 10 km) spatial resolution and monthly resolution. Our global emission of 39.3 ± 4.7 Tg a−1 for 2022 (best estimate and error standard deviation) is higher than previous inventories that use outdated rice maps and IPCC‐recommended EFs now considered to be too low. China is the largest rice emitter in GRPI (8.2 ± 1.0 Tg a−1), followed by India (6.5 ± 1.0 Tg a−1), Bangladesh (5.7 ± 1.2 Tg a−1), Vietnam (5.7 ± 1.0 Tg a−1), and Thailand (4.4 ± 0.9 Tg a−1). These five countries together account for 78% of global total rice emissions. Seasonality of emissions varies considerably between and within individual countries reflecting differences in climate and crop practices. We define a rice methane intensity (methane emission per unit of rice produced) to assess the potential of mitigating methane emission without compromising food security. We find national methane intensities ranging from 10 to 120 kg methane per ton of rice produced (global mean 51) for major rice‐growing countries. Countries can achieve low intensities with high‐yield cultivars, upland rice agriculture, water management, and organic matter management."

 The artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecast foundation models can infer and generate precise global atmospheric state forecasts on the user’s device and with speed over 10,000 times faster than the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and it is making increasingly significant contributions to geodetic applications represented by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, existing studies on the investigation of these AI models are typically carried out by concentrating on specific one or several meteorological events in certain regions or by comparison with physical models, and the evaluation results obtained in this manner are not comprehensive and universal. Additionally, we find that the results obtained by the foundation models through the “rollout” method for forecasting are not uniform in terms of time and space. This temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of accuracy and accuracy degradation are related to AI algorithms and attributes of training data, etc., but these characteristics have not been thoroughly explored and analyzed. In this study, we obtained the global forecast results of foundation models for 2022 and subsequently derived the GNSS tropospheric delay through numerical integration. We calculated the mean deviation, mean absolute error, and root mean square error of these data. Using these metrics, we analyzed the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity in the accuracy degradation of foundation models, represented by Huawei Cloud Pangu-Weather, Google DeepMind GraphCast, and Shanghai AI Lab FengWu. We evaluated how this inhomogeneity changes with forecast time and identified the best-performing models across different regions and forecast durations. From the results, we find that taking topography into account when training the model enhances its accuracy at high altitudes, and the facilitating influence between the high related atmospheric variables such as precipitation and water vapor. The contributions of this study are twofold: it serves as a valuable reference for geodetic and remote sensing users employing foundational models, and offers insights and case supports for AI practitioners aiming to develop more accurate models for weather forecasting."
10.5194/amt-18-1927-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种基于静止气象卫星图像的雾和低云（FLS）连续监测算法。该算法利用Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) 卫星上的SEVIRI仪器的红外波段数据，通过梯度提升树机器学习模型，结合地面METAR气象站的观测数据进行训练，从而实现对欧洲地区雾和低云的检测。虽然该研究主要关注雾和低云的检测，而不是直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但它利用了卫星观测技术来监测大气现象，属于大气环境遥感技术的范畴。,"['Fog and Low Stratus (FLS)', 'Geostationary satellite imagery', 'Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)', 'SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager)', 'Infrared remote sensing', 'METAR (METeorological Aerodrome Report)', 'Fog detection']",Babak Jahani;Steffen Karalus;Julia Fuchs;Tobias Zech;Marina Zara;Jan Cermak,Algorithm for continual monitoring of fog based on geostationary satellite imagery,"Fog and low stratus (FLS) are both persistent clouds close to the Earth's surface. This study introduces a new machine-learning-based algorithm developed for the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellites that can provide a coherent and detailed view of FLS development over large areas over the 24 h day cycle. 
 This study presents an algorithm for the detection of fog and low stratus (FLS) over Europe based on the infrared bands of the SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) instrument on board the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellites. As the method operates based on the SEVIRI infrared observations only, it is expected to be stationary in time and thus can provide a coherent and detailed view of FLS development over large areas over the 24 h day cycle. The algorithm is based on a gradient boosted tree machine learning model that is trained with ground truth observations from METeorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) stations and the SEVIRI observations at bands centered at 8.7, 10.8, 12.0, and 13.4 µm wavelengths. The METAR data used here comprise a total number of 2 544 400 data points spread over the winters (i.e., 1 September to 31 May) of the years 2016–2022 and 356 locations across Europe. Among them, the data points corresponding to 276 stations and the winters of 2016–2018 and 2019–2021 (∼ 45 % of all data points) were used to train the algorithm. The remaining data points comprise four independent datasets which were used to validate the algorithm's performance and applicability to time spans and locations within the study area (i.e., Europe) that extend beyond those covered by the data points used for the algorithm training, as well as to compare the algorithm's accuracy at the locations of METAR stations with that of the existing state-of-the-art daytime FLS detection algorithm Satellite-based Operational Fog Observation Scheme (SOFOS). Validation of the algorithm against the METAR data showed that the algorithm is well suited for the detection of FLS. Specifically, the algorithm is found to detect FLS with probability of detection (POD) values ranging from 0.70 to 0.82 (for different inter-comparison approaches) and false alarm ratios (FARs) between 0.21 and 0.31. These numbers are very close to those achieved by SOFOS for differentiating FLS from other sky conditions at the tested locations and time spans. These results also showed that the technique's applicability in the study region extends beyond the particular locations and time spans covered by the data points used for training the algorithm."

 In this study, we used a two-and-a-half-decade dataset (1998–2023) of cirrus cloud properties obtained from a ground-based LIDAR located at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), Gadanki (13.5°N, 79.2°E), India. The percentage occurrence of cirrus clouds during the observational period is 42 %, and the most probable altitude is around 14.2 km. Significant seasonal variability in cirrus clouds is observed, with the highest frequency (74 %) during the monsoon season and the lowest (31 %) in winter. A detailed analysis was conducted on cirrus macro-physical, thermodynamic, and optical properties. Additionally, we investigated the long-term trends of the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) to better understand its relationship with cirrus cloud properties. We observed a significant increasing trend in TTL thickness (0.003 ± 0.0005 km year−1) and Cold point Tropopause Height (CPH) (0.003 ± 0.0003 km year−1) while cirrus base (−0.003 ± 0.001 km year−1), top (−0.005 ± 0.001 km year−1), and geometrical thickness (−0.01 ± 0.0005 km year−1) showed a decreasing trend over the observational period. We also analysed long-term trends of sub-visible, thin and thick cirrus clouds. A significant decreasing trend was found in the mid-cloud altitudes of sub-visible (−0.003 ± 0.001 km year−1), thin (−0.006 ± 0.0009 km year−1), and thick cirrus (−0.008 ± 0.0009 km year−1) clouds, along with an increasing trend in mid-cloud altitude temperatures (0.035 ± 0.008 km year−1, 0.03 ± 0.007 km year−1, 0.05 ± 0.009 km year−1) over the last 25 years. Additionally, a significant decreasing trend was noted in the geometrical thickness of sub-visible cirrus clouds and in the optical thickness of thin and thick cirrus clouds. The ground-based climatology obtained from the NARL lidar was compared with 18 years (2006–2023) of data obtained from the Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite. Both datasets generally exhibit good agreement but differ in the magnitudes of several cirrus cloud properties, an important factor for understanding the radiative impacts of these cirrus clouds."

We found aerosol loadings generally decreased globally, and aerosols became more scattering. These changes are closely related to variations in aerosol compositions, such as decreased anthropogenic emissions over East Asia, Europe, and North America; increased anthropogenic sources over northern India; and increased dust activity over the Arabian Peninsula. 
 Over the past 2 decades, remarkable changes in aerosol concentrations and compositions have been observed worldwide, especially over developing countries, potentially resulting in considerable changes in aerosol properties. The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) offers high-precision measurements of aerosol optical parameters over about 1700 stations globally, many of which have long-term measurements for 1 or more decades. Here we use AERONET Level 2.0 quality-assured measurements to investigate long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE) trends and quality-controlled Level 1.5 inversion products to analyse trends in absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) at stations with long-term records. We also classify the aerosol properties in these sites into six types and analyse the trends in each type. Results reveal decreases in AOD over the majority of the stations, except for northern India and the Arabian Peninsula, where AOD increased. AE (computed from the AOD within the range of 440–870 nm) decreased in Europe, eastern North America, and the Middle East but increased over South Asia and western North America. The decreased AE over Europe and eastern North America is likely due to decreased fine-mode anthropogenic aerosols, whereas that over the Arabian Peninsula is attributed to increased dust activity. Conversely, increased AE over northern India is probably attributed to increased anthropogenic emissions and decreased dust loading. Most stations in Europe, North America, East Asia, and South Asia exhibit negative trends in AAOD, whereas Solar_Village in the Arabian Peninsula has positive trends. SSA at most stations increases and exhibits opposite trends to AAOD but with several stations in North America and central Europe showing decreased SSA values. Trend analysis of different aerosol types further reveals the changes in different aerosol components that are related to AOD, AE, AAOD, and SSA trends. The reductions in aerosols in eastern North America mainly result from non-absorbing species. Reductions in both fine-mode absorbing species and non-absorbing aerosols are found over Europe and East Asia, but the reduction in absorbing species is stronger than that of non-absorbing species. Increased aerosols in Kanpur over northern India should be mainly comprised of fine-mode scattering species, whereas those in Solar_Village over the Arabian Peninsula are mainly dust. The majority of stations exhibit consistent monotonic trends across different seasons for these parameters."

 Water is a precious resource and is important for human health, agriculture, industry, and the environment. When water is in short supply, monitoring and predicting the current and future occurrence of precipitating clouds is essential. In this study, we investigate the cloud microphysical features in several convective cloud systems in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using multiple data sources, including aircraft measurements, satellite observations, weather radar observations, and reanalysis data. The aircraft observation dataset is from an airborne research campaign conducted in August 2019 in the UAE. The cloud cases were identified through analysis of cloud spectrometers mounted on the aircraft. Then, we investigated the microphysical features of those cloud cases, with a focus on precipitation microphysics. The effective radius of the cloud particles retrieved from geostationary satellite data was compared with the aircraft in situ measurement. Using the effective radius retrieved from satellite data, we developed a framework to identify five microphysical zones: the diffusional droplet growth zone, droplet coalescence growth zone, supercooled-water zone, mixed-phase zone, and glaciated zone. The identified zones were verified using the aircraft observations, and the transferability of the five-zone concept was tested using additional cloud cases. The results show that our five-zone concept successfully detects the microphysical features related to precipitation using satellite data in the UAE. This study provides scientific support for the development of an applicable framework to examine cloud precipitation processes and detect suitable cloud features that could be tracked for further precipitation analysis and nowcasting."

Verstraeten,Improved consistency in solar-induced fluorescence retrievals from GOME-2A with the SIFTER v3 algorithm,"Long-term records of plant fluorescence offer vital insights into changing vegetation activity. The GOME-2A sensor provides extensive global observations but suffers from calibration and instrument degradation, which affects data consistency. This study presents the SIFTER v3 algorithm, which effectively resolves these issues and includes other improvements, resulting in robust, accurate, and consistent GOME-2A fluorescence measurements from 2007 to 2017. 
 Space-based observations of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) provide valuable insights into vegetation activity over time. The GOME-2A instrument, in particular, facilitates SIF retrievals with extensive global coverage and a record extending over 10 years. SIF retrievals, however, are sensitive to calibration issues, and instrument degradation complicates the construction of temporally consistent SIF records. This study introduces the improved Sun-Induced Fluorescence of Terrestrial Ecosystems Retrieval (SIFTER) v3 algorithm, designed to obtain a more accurate and reliable long-term SIF record from GOME-2A for the 2007–2017 period, building upon the previous SIFTER v2. The SIFTER v3 algorithm uses newly reprocessed level-1b Release 3 (R3) data, which provide a more homogenous record of the reflectances by eliminating spurious trends from changes in level-0 to level-1 processing. This improved consistency supports detailed analysis and correction of the reflectance degradation across the SIF retrieval window (734–758 nm). To address the reflectance degradation accurately, SIFTER v3 incorporates an advanced in-flight degradation correction that accounts for time, wavelength, and scan angle dependencies throughout the entire record. Additionally, algorithm revisions have consistently reduced the retrieval residuals by around 10 % and reduced sensitivity to water vapor absorption by better capturing the atmospheric and instrumental effects. A revised latitude bias adjustment resolves unrealistic values of GOME-2A SIF over desert areas. The SIFTER v3 dataset demonstrates improved robustness and consistency, both spatially and temporally, throughout the 2007–2017 record, and aligns closely with NASA GOME-2A SIF data and independent gross primary productivity (GPP) measurements from the global FluxSat and FLUXCOM-X products."

 Measurement of total peroxy nitrates (ΣPNs) and alkyl nitrates (ΣANs) by instruments that use thermal dissociation (TD) inlets to convert the organic nitrate to detectable NO2 may suffer from systematic bias (both positive and negative) resulting from unwanted secondary chemistry in the heated inlets.

We show that the commonly used commercial C3 alkyl nitrate (isopropyl nitrate, IPN) for characterising the chemistry of ANs is not appropriate for real-air samples that contain longer-chain nitrates. Mixing ratios of ANs generated in the NO3-induced oxidation of limonene are strongly positively biased in the presence of NO. By detecting NOx rather than NO2, we provide a simple solution to avoid the bias caused by the conversion of NO to NO2 by primary and secondary peroxy radicals resulting from the complex chemistry in the thermal degradation of long-chain, alkyl nitrates in air at TD temperatures. We also show that using a photochemical source of PAN to characterise the TD inlets can result in a much stronger apparent bias from NO to NO2 conversion than for a diffusion source of synthesised (“pure”) PAN at similar mixing ratios, especially if high acetone concentrations (and thus radical concentrations) are involved. This is explained by the presence of thermally labile trace gases such as peracetic acid (CH3C(O)OOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)."

Creamean,Airborne Bacteria over Thawing Permafrost Landscapes in the Arctic,"Rapid warming in the Arctic, outpacing global rates, is driving significant changes in cryospheric landscapes, including the release of long-preserved microorganisms. This study focuses on thawing permafrost in Northern Alaska, where microbes previously preserved in frozen soils are introduced into thermokarst lakes, rivers, and coastal waters and may also become airborne as bioaerosols. We present the first microbial composition measurements of bioaerosols in Alaska, identifying their local sources, such as soils, water bodies, and vegetation. Although sea/brackish water is the dominant bioaerosol contributor, we provide the first evidence of permafrost microbial signatures in bioaerosols from permafrost-laden regions. Permafrost is highly enriched with ice nucleating particles (INPs), which play a crucial role in cloud formation, precipitation processes, and radiation budget despite their relatively low atmospheric concentrations. With rising Arctic temperatures, increased permafrost thaw could result in higher levels of airborne permafrost-derived microbes and biological INPs active at warmer subzero temperatures. This, in turn, could enhance precipitation, further accelerating the permafrost thaw. Our findings emphasize the complex interactions between terrestrial changes and atmospheric processes, revealing a potential feedback loop that could intensify permafrost thaw and its broader environmental impacts."

Quantifying methane emissions and understanding the attributes driving these emissions are important for evaluating the scale of the environmental risks and informing mitigation strategies. With our national-scale direct measurement database of 494 non-producing wells across Canada, we find total annual methane emissions from non-producing wells in Canada to be 230 kt/year (51–560 kt/year) for 2023, which is 7 (1.5–16) times higher than estimated in Canada’s National Inventory Report (34 kt/year) and accounts for 13% of total fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems in Canada. We show that the role of well attributes in methane emissions is best evaluated by considering the emitting component (wellhead/surface casing vent) and the spatial scale (e.g., national, provincial, subprovincial). Large uncertainties in methane emissions from non-producing wells can be reduced not only with additional measurements but also with detailed well attribute analysis using direct measurements. Identifying attributes linked to high emitters can also be used to prioritize mitigation, thereby reducing methane emissions and broader environmental risks."

However, emerging evidence suggests that TCs also transport pollutants over long distances, with their full impact on pollutant dynamics still underexplored. In this study, aerosol transport and chemical transformation during Hurricane Matthew (2016) are analyzed using high-resolution WRF-Chem simulations. The Hurricane-Driven Aerosol Transport Analysis Framework (WHDA-TAF) is developed to assess aerosol behavior under both current and future climate scenarios. Simulations based on Pseudo Global Warming (PGW) projections indicate that aerosols, such as sea salt, particulate matter, and carbonaceous aerosols, are lifted to higher altitudes and dispersed far from the storm’s core. Photochemical reactions within the cyclone generate secondary pollutants such as ozone and nitrates, which can worsen air quality even after the hurricane has dissipated. Copula-based analysis reveals that stronger hurricanes in high-emission scenarios (SSP585) are likely to increase the frequency and severity of extreme compound pollution events, even in regions distant from the storm’s direct impact. These findings challenge the view of TCs as mere atmospheric cleansers, highlighting their significant role as carriers and reactors of pollutants. Enhancing model resolution is crucial to better capture such TC-aerosol interactions and address the risks of cyclone-driven aerosol transport under climate change."

Here, by mixing dry air into an aerosol flow reactor, we examine whether droplet evaporation may affect wildfire BrC by studying the aqueous nitration of catechol by HONO and darkening of the soluble component of wood smoke. Using online aethalometry and offline UV–vis analysis of particle filter extracts, we observe for the catechol/HONO system that droplet evaporation leads to significantly increased mass absorption coefficients and enhanced ratios of visible to UV absorption compared to bulk solutions, consistent with offline mass spectrometric analysis of dried particles that indicates aromatic nitration and oligomer formation. Differences between the aethalometer and UV–vis filter measurements are attributed to reactions on the dry filter that enhance BrC formation. Evaporation of wood smoke extract droplets also leads to darkening reactions but much less significantly than with catechol/HONO, as expected if only a select fraction of the wood smoke molecules react via concentration enhancement. These findings underscore droplet evaporation/drying as important to BrC atmospheric evolution and suggest that dryer usage may affect particle composition in field measurements."

Simulated tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) are generally higher over areas with large NOx sources when compared with retrievals, while an opposite bias is found over low NOx regions. Artificial (i.e., numerical) dilution in the model, where emissions are mathematically dispersed uniformly within the originating CTM grid, can impact modeled NO:NO2 ratios, while lower CTM VCD levels often observed over rural areas can be attributed to missing emission sources of NOx or flawed horizontal/vertical transport. Potential causes of both low and high biases are assessed in this study using CMAQ and Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 retrievals. It was found that more detailed modeling of NOx plumes to assess the NO:NO2 ratio in two power plant plumes can mitigate the effect of artificial computational dilution, reducing the bias and overall differences in the observed vs modeled plumes (errors reduced by 30%). Adjustments of upper tropospheric NO2 led to overall improvements, with a reduction in CMAQ bias (−43% to −29%) and improved spatial correlation (0.81 to 0.86). This study highlights the importance of having accurate modeled NO:NO2 ratios when comparing models to retrievals and the impact of unintentional numerical dilution."

However, accurately simulating PM2.5 concentrations on the TP remains challenging. This study investigates the uncertainties in PM2.5 underestimation, including meteorological conditions, dust emissions, regional transport, and emission inventories. Results show that discrepancies in various anthropogenic emission inventories significantly hinder accurate PM2.5 concentration reproduction on the TP, overwhelming meteorological predictions, dust emissions, and regional transport contributions. With meteorological simulations showing similar discrepancies to those in other regions, limited improvement from increased dust, and a relatively high proportion of regional transport, it becomes evident that local emissions are underestimated. Modeling with adjusted anthropogenic emissions reveals a seasonal underestimation of 82.6%–92.6% of local anthropogenic emissions on the TP.

 The influence of local meteorology on the atmospheric electric field (potential gradient, PG) is examined using 10 years of measurements (January 2012 to December 2021) at Xanthi, northeastern Greece. Seven meteorological parameters that influence PG are examined using a multiple linear regression model to estimate the relationship between these parameters and fair-weather PG. The parameters analyzed for their influence are wind speed, specific humidity, temperature, pressure, aerosol optical depth (AOD), cloud cover (CC), and water vapor column (WV). Data for AOD, CC, and WV were retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Significant influence of specific humidity and wind speed on fair-weather PG is found. During two sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events, it is found that the predicted fair-weather PG by the meteorological parameters, was significantly lower than the observed fair-weather PG, indicating a possible influence of SSW on the global electric circuit. In addition, rain, hail, and snow events were examined on how they affect PG over time as they occur. It is found that the frequency distribution of PG changes non-monotonically during these events."

We investigate the chemical kinetics of hot magmatic gases mixing with air. Our model reproduces and explains observations of volcanic plume BrO at Mt.

Nitrous acid (HONO), nitryl chloride (ClNO2), and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) are important sources of radical oxidants (e.g., •OH, •Cl, •NO3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere, driving the chemistry that leads to air quality degradation. Discrepancies between measurements and model predictions indicate that there are significant unknown sources of these species, particularly HONO, where the contributions of different formation processes have been controversial since the first ambient observations in the 1970s. We report the generation of these reactive nitrogen species during automotive braking using chemical ionization mass spectrometry configured with iodide reagent ion. Substantial HONO levels are observed from ceramic and semi-metallic brake pads, and smaller quantities of ClNO2 and N2O5 were also detected. We propose that HONO is formed in the hot plume emanating from the brake rotor via abstraction by NO2 of allylic and aldehyde hydrogen atoms found in the complex mixture of volatile organic compounds emitted simultaneously.

We call the muted increases or reductions at these altitudes the “double dip.” The double dip results from surface warming (not stratospheric cooling). Using an idealized photochemical‐transport model, surface warming is found to produce the double dip via tropospheric expansion, which converts ozone‐rich stratospheric air into ozone‐poor tropospheric air. The lower dip results from expansion of the extratropical troposphere, as previously understood. The upper dip results from expansion of the tropical troposphere, low‐ozone anomalies from which are then transported into the extratropics. Large seasonality in the double dip in CCMs can be explained, at least in part, by seasonality in the stratospheric overturning circulation.

Wilson,Coupling of Lipid Peroxidation and Criegee Intermediate Mediated Autoxidation in the Heterogeneous Oxidation of Linoleic Acid Aerosols,"Autoxidation is an established mechanism for the degradation of organic molecules, which is relevant in the atmosphere, combustion processes, the environment, and the rancidification of lipids (commonly known as lipid peroxidation). Autoxidation proceeds via radical chain reactions involving hydroxyl (•OH), peroxy (RO2•), and alkoxy radicals, which are also prominent oxidants in the atmosphere. Recent reports have provided evidence for an alternative autoxidation mechanism driven instead by Criegee intermediates (CIs), which are produced from the reaction of β-hydroxy peroxy radicals (β–OH-RO2•). This work evaluates the contributions of these two mechanisms in the •OH initiated heterogeneous oxidation of linoleic acid (LA) aerosols. Reaction kinetics and product distributions are monitored using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer. To explain the observed kinetics, a kinetic model is developed that incorporates both the conventional peroxidation and alternative CI-mediated autoxidation mechanisms. We observe that the CI-mediated autoxidation pathways enhance the heterogeneous autoxidation rate, while the peroxidation reactions, although present, contributes less to the overall oxidation rate. α-Acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs) are identified as key indicators for bimolecular reactions of CI with LA, highlighting the role of LA as a CI scavenger. Moreover, the measured functionalized LA products with hydroxyl or carbonyl group(s), serve as markers for the peroxidation reactions. In summary, this work presents a quantitative framework to understand the coupled reaction network of •OH, RO2•, β–OH-RO2• radicals, and CI in driving heterogeneous autoxidation, which is crucial for understanding degradation mechanisms of organic molecules in the environment and atmosphere."

This study presents direct observations of liquid–liquid phase separation and the morphologies of PM2.5 filter extracts collected from Seoul, Beijing, and Noto during autumn 2023. The PM2.5 samples covered both polluted and clean environments and were predominantly organic-rich. Optical microscopy revealed that real-world samples from these cities underwent phase transitions with changing relative humidity and primarily existed in either two-liquid or three-phase states, while fully homogeneous or nonliquid states were rare. Moreover, a core–shell morphology, consisting of an organic shell and inorganic core, was frequently observed in the PM2.5 samples. Calculations confirmed that the viscosity of the organic shell ranges from ∼101 Pa s in Seoul (liquid-like) to ∼106 Pa s in Beijing (semisolid). As the shell becomes more viscous, the diffusivity of N2O5 decreases, thereby lowering the N2O5 uptake coefficient by 1–3 orders of magnitude and significantly restricting N2O5 uptake. These results highlight the crucial role of aerosol morphology in heterogeneous chemistry, as the organic-rich outer phase can significantly modify the reactive uptake coefficients and gas–particle interactions."

However, conventional wisdom says that the contribution of NO2 reduction on soot to HONO formation is limited due to the rapid deactivation of surface reductive sites in the atmosphere. On the contrary, we show that adsorbed anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), collectively called exogenous VOCs (EVOCs), can persistently promote the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 to HONO on soot. The surface uptake of NO2 driven by H2O, coupled with the hydrogen reduction of NO2 supported by EVOCs on elemental carbon (EC), is proposed to be the key pathway causing the persistent production of HONO. Furthermore, field observation conducted during biomass burning seasons in the North China Plain also showed that the presence of EVOCs promotes HONO production significantly. Our results imply that the continuous adsorption and conversion of EVOCs on soot surfaces may have a remarkable enhancing impact on the persistent conversion of NO2 to HONO in the atmosphere."

 The explosive January 2022 Hunga submarine eruption in Tonga injected unprecedented water volumes into the upper atmosphere, generating widespread climatic impacts. However, it ejected anomalously little sulfur compared with other eruptions of similar volume. We explain the missing sulfur with volatile budgets calculated from volcanic ash samples spanning the eruption. We show that magma was stored in a weakly stratified reservoir at 2.1 km to >5.6 km depth. Magma rose within <3 min and fragmented at 400–1,000 m below sea level. This preserves microscale chemical mingling including ~1 wt% contrasts in magmatic water concentrations. The 11-h eruption released a total of 319 Tg of magmatic water, which is <10% of that derived from magmatic seawater interaction. Comparing magmatic and residual glass sulfur concentrations shows a total release of 9.4 TgS, but >93% of this entered the ocean during submarine magma fragmentation. These results raise the concern that satellite SO2 monitoring underestimates the magma output of submarine explosions and they are probably near invisible in ice-core records, despite their climate influence caused by water injection into the upper atmosphere.

 Climate change has increased forest fire extent in temperate and boreal North America. Here, we quantified the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to human mortality and economic burden from exposure to wildfire particulate matter at the county and state level across the contiguous US (2006 to 2020) by integrating climate projections, climate-wildfire models, wildfire smoke models, and emission and health impact modeling. Climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 wildfire particulate matter deaths over 15 years with interannual variability ranging from 130 (95% confidence interval: 64, 190) to 5100 (95% confidence interval: 2500, 7500) deaths and a cumulative economic burden of $160 billion. Approximately 34% of the additional deaths attributable to climate change occurred in 2020, costing $58 billion. The economic burden was highest in California, Oregon, and Washington. We suggest that absent abrupt changes in climate trajectories, land management, and population, the indirect impacts of climate change on human-health through wildfire smoke will escalate.

The RMSE (root mean square error between model and observation) improvements for ceilometer AExtC, and PM2.5 persist for at least 18 forecast hours, with the mean RMSE decreasing by 13% and 8%, respectively. Moreover, the contributions of different observation systems (ceilometer profiles versus ground PM2.5) to predicting three‐dimensional (3D) aerosol structures are also investigated. The contribution of ceilometer DA is comparable to that of direct PM2.5 DA to the PM2.5 predictions in HZ and its environs, with RMSE decreased by 8% and 10%, respectively. In areas far from the assimilation stations' locations (HZ city), ceilometer DA showed an even better performance. The performance of ground PM2.5 DA is inferior to that of the direct ceilometer DA experiment in predicting ceilometer AExtC vertical profiles.

 Low clouds are essential to the energy budget and the hydrological cycle, but simulation of low clouds in most AGCMs (atmospheric general circulation models) remains a challenge. The critical relative humidity (RHc) has great significance for cloud parameterization. Based on diagnostic results of CloudSat/CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite data, we propose a fourth-order curve-fitting formula for RHc with respect to temperature (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.9659). The method was implemented in CAM6 (Community Atmosphere Model, version 6). Compared with the original scheme, the dynamic RHc significantly reduces the negative bias of low clouds over mid- and low-latitude oceans, increases the low cloud fraction by 20 %. Furthermore, the dynamic RHc has an impact on the vertical distribution of cloud amount, significantly increasing the cloud fraction below 700 hPa and reducing it above 400 hPa. The increase in low clouds is accompanied by an increase in liquid water path, which helps reduce the shortwave cloud forcing bias in the subtropics. Besides, the change in cloud fraction caused by the dynamic RHc has an impact on the simulation of precipitation. Finally, the simulation results at 1° and 2° indicate that the method is insensitive to the choice of model resolution."

Much of this research has been dedicated to the development of predictive models of varying complexity to calculate the spatiotemporal magnitude of the effect. This manuscript presents results which show that significant variability can be accounted for by addressing the combined impacts of atmospheric water vapor and solar zenith angle on both the spectral distribution of insolation energy at the water surface and its subsequent absorption within the water column. Comparisons with satellite‐observed diurnal amplitudes on the basin‐scale show that the new scheme provides notable improvements over one with a fixed insolation parameterization. One implication is that addressing the heat source term within the water column is a key first step when developing and tuning models of the diurnal layer.

Sudheer;Arvind Singh,Processes Controlling DMS Variability in Marine Boundary Layer of the Arabian Sea During Post‐Monsoon Season of 2021,"Ship‐borne high time‐resolution in situ measurements of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the marine air of the Arabian Sea reveal large spatiotemporal variations (20−709 ppt) during the post‐monsoon season. The DMS mixing ratios in the southeast (98 ± 87 ppt) and northeast (116 ± 120 ppt) coastal regions were higher than in the oligotrophic central Arabian Sea (62 ± 53 ppt). The frequent DMS peaks over the coastal regions were associated with calm winds, lower salinity, higher SST, and elevated chlorophyll concentrations. The time series of DMS along the coastal regions exhibits stronger diurnal variability with higher values during early morning and evening hours compared to the open ocean. The lower daytime DMS throughout the campaign is attributed to the predominance of OH‐oxidation loss, while nighttime radical chemistry was modulated by polluted air masses in coastal regions. The DMS levels showed a noticeable response to changes in meteorological and oceanic physiochemical parameters, including salinity gradients (−0.3 to 0.2 psu hr−1), mostly associated with localized upwelling events. A weak negative correlation between DMS and seawater nitrate concentrations indicates the role of nitrogen availability in seawater DMS production. Despite relatively low phytoplankton biomass in the post‐monsoon, the estimated DMS fluxes of ∼11 μmol m−2 d−1 were ∼3‐times higher than the values determined two decades ago. Strong spatiotemporal variations and high levels of DMS could have significant implications for regional atmospheric chemistry, including the formation of sulfate aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei in the marine boundary layer over the Arabian Sea."

 Vertical profiles of aerosol and black carbon (BC) play a critical role in the evolution process of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure, and pollutant transport. Eleven aircraft observations of aerosols and BC were launched in the North China Plain (NCP) in the autumn of 2019 and 2020. The aerosol number concentration (Na) and BC concentration (MBC) below 2000 m in NCP have obvious diurnal variation characteristics. From 11:00 to 16:00, Na exhibited double peaks, with one peak identified near the top of PBL (8380.57 cm−3) and the second peak occurring near-surface (9692.13 cm−3), a downward Na gradient exists below the top of the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) (850m–1400m) and increases with time (3.93 cm−3/m to 9.64 cm−3/m). During 17:00–21:00, Na and MBC exhibited a peak concentrated near the surface (the maximum values were 10077.74 cm−3 and 14.03 μg m−3), an upward Na gradient (17.73 cm−3/m) is present at the top of PBLH (100 m–280 m) well above the daytime level. The aerosol spectral distribution was bimodal with predominant particle diameters at 0.14 μm and 0.20 μm, and aerosols of 0.14 μm showed stronger vertical dispersion from 19:00 to 21:00. Aerosol and BC transport between the PBL and the free troposphere (FT) was bidirectional. Transport from the FT to PBL from 11:00 to 16:00, transport from PBL to FT from 17:00 to 21:00. 11:00 to 14:00, as the PBLH rose (1000m–1400m), aerosols and BC were transported to 1000–1500 m and accumulated within the PBL. 14:00 to 16:00, the combination of, the inversion layer and the downdraft air over the PBL resulted in a peak Na in the top of PBL from 14:00 to 16:00, Na gradient from the FT to PBL expands between 11:00 and 16:00. From 19:00 to 21:00, the height of the PBL was the lowest (300m–100m). Due to the decrease of PBLH, aerosol and BC were confined within the near-surface, leading to a significant increase in near-surface Na and MBC, which were elevated by factors of 1.82 and 4.04, compared to their levels during 11:00–14:00, upward Na gradient from the top of PBLH increased at night, allowed for upward aerosol transport at night. The direction of air mass origins affects aerosol and BC behavior at different altitudes."

 Criegee intermediates (CIs), formed from the ozonolysis of alkenes, are highly reactive species with diverse reaction pathways, with important roles in atmospheric chemistry. This study focuses on the formation of accretion products through reactions of thermally stabilized CIs (sCIs) from the ozonolysis of three different terpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene) with malonic and oxalic acids. Our experimental results demonstrate that these reactions efficiently produce the expected accretion products, though with apparent variations in yields depending on the specific terpene and acid involved. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report direct gas-phase observations of expected adducts from several different terpene-derived sCIs and carboxylic acids, paving the way for a better understanding of the importance and atmospheric implications of these reactions, especially in terms of the aerosol-forming capabilities of these large product molecules."

The model's performance was evaluated, demonstrating its potential for high-resolution mapping in other cities with well-characterized urban structures and diverse in situ monitoring stations. 
 High-resolution mapping of pollutants based on mobile observation facilitates deep understanding of air pollutant distributions within a city. This approach fosters science-based decisions to improve air quality, by adding to the existing but not optimally distributed permanent monitoring stations. In this study, we developed high-resolution concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10) and ultrafine particles (UFP) for Bucharest, Romania, to evaluate the spatial variation of pollutants across the city during the warm and cold seasons. Maps were generated using a mixed-effects method applied to a land-use regression (LUR) model. The approach relies on multiple land-use and traffic predictor variables and assimilation of data collected by mobile measurements over 30 d in the periods May–July 2022 and January–February 2023. Cross-validation was done against in situ data extracted from the same collection, while validation was organized by comparison with standard measurements at fixed reference sites. Our study shows that this combined method has a good performance for all pollutants (R2>0.65), the highest performance being observed for the cold season. PM10  concentration maps indicate multiple sources of particles during the warm season, the most important source being traffic. During the cold season, PM10 concentration maps show a more uniform distribution of sources in Bucharest. The city's principal roads, particularly the Bucharest ring road, are also highlighted in the NO2 maps, with a higher gradient during the warm period."

Ortega,Late Winter Ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS Exceedance in the Northern Colorado Front Range in Relation to Oil and Natural Gas Emissions,"There has been a notable increase in winter and early spring ozone exceedance occurrences in enclosed air basins that contain abundant oil and natural gas (O&NG) activity. High ozone levels can arise from emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combined with enhanced photochemical reactions. The wintertime temperature inversions trap these emissions near the ground and cause their concentrations to increase, and the high albedo of snow accelerates the photochemical reactions. Although these events have been noted in rural high elevation O&NG development basins in the western United States, here, we report on and analyze a late winter high ozone and particulate matter (PM) event in the densely populated Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR) in an unenclosed air basin with abundant O&NG production. On 19–20 March 2021, the 8‐hr average ozone reached 82 ppb, and 24‐hr‐averaged PM 2.5 concentrations reached 77 μg m−3, resulting in the year's highest PM pollution event. Using a combination of in‐situ chemical and meteorological measurements, we show that the buildup of ozone precursors was likely attributable to O&NG emissions in a stable boundary layer in conjunction with Denver Cyclone conditions, a mesoscale feature common in the NCFR that recirculates pollutants. The concurrent PM pollution was likely driven by animal feedlot emissions and diverse sources of NOx, including O&NG. This event raises concern about the potential of wintertime air quality standard exceedances and cumulative adverse health effects considering an expanding O&NG industry within a densely populated urban and suburban area."

Nehrir,Improving Planetary Boundary Layer Height Estimation From Airborne Lidar Instruments,"The height of the planetary boundary layer (PBLH) influences processes such as pollutant distributions, convection, and cloud formation within the troposphere. Aerosol observables play a critical role in deriving the mixed layer height (MLH) using retrieval techniques like the Haar wavelet covariance transform (WCT), which employs gradients in aerosol backscatter to estimate MLH. Currently, backscatter‐only approaches struggle with identifying very shallow stable boundary layers, distinguishing PBL from lofted residual or other aerosol layers, and profiles with very low aerosol loading. Here, we reflect on the WCT method's performance and evaluate different approaches to improve PBLH estimations. We aggregate lidar observables from recent NASA airborne field campaigns and compute MLHs based on the WCT method. Machine learning (ML) approaches are explored to produce PBLH estimates by training lidar information on thermodynamically derived PBLHs over marine and land settings. A linear model is found suitable for producing PBLH estimates in marine settings (improving mean bias by 71 m), while an ensemble tree method proves more suitable for PBLH types over land, as indicated by improved biases (13 m mean bias), errors (179 m mean error and 391 m RMSE), and correlations (+0.3) for the models explored. The algorithms are additionally tested on “unseen” data to gauge differences between MLH and PBLH estimates produced from each of the models. The PBLH estimates, composed of information from lidar and thermodynamic profiles, further support the use of ML for an automated method of PBLH prediction. Overall, these improved predictions will help evaluate models and deepen our understanding of PBL‐aerosol interactions."

The research site is located at the exit of the valley combined with desert, lake, and the Yellow River, which result in the diurnal variation and inconsistency of three types of PBL. Convective boundary layer (CBL) reaches 3,500 m in daytime while the top of stable boundary layer (SBL) reaches 1,500 m at night. The depth of surface layer, mixing layer (ML), residual layer (RL), entrainment zone (EZ), and temperature inversion are closely correlated with diurnal temperature variation. Substantial variability in CBL and SBL heights up to hundreds of meters was observed in high spatiotemporal resolution. Dynamic PBL representing dynamic stability from Ri fluctuates around 1,000 m during nighttime and rises to about 1,500 m during daytime. Material PBL, representing the distribution of atmospheric substances driven by solar heating, is classified into residual height of material boundary layer and accumulation height of material boundary layer to describe the capacity of dispersion and accumulation affected by CBL and SBL, respectively.

Employing globally resolutions of below 5 km, the models from the Dynamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non‐hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) project do not require a parameterization for deep convection. This can be expected to lead to a better representation of cloudiness, particularly in the tropics where most of the total ice water path (TIWP) results from convection. We study the inter‐model variability of TIWP simulated by the DYAMOND models during boreal summer, compare to the TIWP from a lower‐resolution numerical weather prediction model and evaluate using satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. We disentangle dynamical reasons for the inter‐model variability in monthly and daily mean TIWP from reasons connected with the cloud response to convective forcing. As expected, we find that differences in the models' cloud response are mainly responsible for the inter‐model variability. The ratio of TIWP to TIWP plus total liquid water path (TLWP), which is controlled by convective de‐ and entrainment, and the models' microphysical scheme lead to a large inter‐model variability in TIWP. Differences in convective dynamics also impact cloudiness with some models compensating a low TIWP in areas of low vertical ascent by an increased probability of large TIWP connected with large vertical velocities. Finally, the spatial distribution of convective events varies with models that parameterize convection simulating a larger fraction of the tropical TIWP in areas of high sea surface temperature."

Evaluating the SR of sites at a national scale and its long‐term trends is particularly important for countries like China, where both air quality and monitoring networks have changed dramatically over time. Here, we used 1‐km daily air pollutant concentrations from the China High Air Pollutants dataset to assess the yearly SR of state‐controlled sites in China from 2013 to 2022 for multiple pollutants. With the number of sites increasing from 460 in 2013 to 1,590 in 2022, our results showed that the total SR area of sites increased by 89% for PM2.5, 149% for PM10, and 2,190% for O3. While the number of sites mainly drove these increases, its impact varied at different phases. Interestingly, the rise in sites from 2020 to 2022 actually led to a decrease in the total SR area for PM2.5 (−18,300 km2) and PM10 (−14,200 km2). Additionally, we found that applying SR to pollution exposure assessments did not improve their accuracy at national and city levels when compared to the official method, which involves exposure calculation using arithmetic mean aggregation of monitoring sites. This was related to poor SR performance, with more than half of the population being uncovered by SR areas in more than 85% of Chinese cities. Nevertheless, we demonstrated the benefits of applying SR for city‐level air quality attainment."

This study employs a boundary layer mass balance (MB) method (also known as the hypothetical box model) to calculate the nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) emission fluxes based on the ground surface and tower measurements between September and November 2018 in the urban core of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China. The MB method estimated the propane, toluene, n‐butane, m,p‐xylene, and i‐butane as the major species, which are in reasonable agreement with the estimates by mixed layer gradient technique. The physical dispersion term explained over 80% of the emission flux variations for most species while the chemical loss term took up nearly 60% for the highly reactive species (e.g., isoprene and styrene). Higher emission fluxes were identified during daytime than nighttime, well reflecting the daily activities. The flux‐based positive matrix factorization (FLU‐PMF) and traditional concentration‐based apportionment both revealed that vehicular emissions and oil and gas evaporation were the dominant sources of NMHC emissions. FLU‐PMF attributed a higher contribution to biogenic emissions and a reduced contribution to fuel combustion by accounting for chemical loss and atmospheric dilution. Higher NMHC emission flux was found by MB estimates than EI grids near the measurement sites. It was suggested that EI underestimated the emission fluxes due to missing information for the residential fugitive emissions, while industrial contributions were overestimated. The findings provide useful information for policy‐makers and government to better constrain volatile organic compound emissions and improving the source apportionment in urban areas."

The climate effect of an eruption may last for about a decade and is nonlinearly tied to the amount of injected SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ from the eruption. We investigate the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions, ranging from Mt. Pinatubo‐sized events to supereruptions. The study is based on ensemble simulations in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) climate model applying the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6) atmosphere model, using a coupled ocean and fixed sea surface temperature setting. Our analysis focuses on the impact of different levels of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ injections on stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD), effective radiative forcing (ERF), and global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies. We uncover a notable time‐dependent decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency (ERF normalized by SAOD) for all eruption SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ levels during the first posteruption year. In addition, it is revealed that the largest eruptions investigated in this study, including several previous supereruption simulations, provide peak ERF anomalies bounded at −65Wm−2 ${-}65\,\mathrm{W}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$. Further, a close linear relationship between peak GMST and ERF effectively bounds the GMST anomaly to, at most, approximately −10K ${-}10\,\mathrm{K}$. This is consistent across several previous studies using different climate models."

First, we derive a proxy estimate for CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ enhancements from NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$ observations through linear regression near the plume cross‐section. Then, we fit a Gaussian function to the resulting NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$‐based CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ enhancement data. We apply this method to data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) and the Sentinel‐5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) starting from May 2018. The method is tested on the Matimba and Medupi power stations in South Africa, as well as the cities of Madrid (Spain), Las Vegas (USA), and Baghdad (Iraq). The corresponding mean CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emission estimates are 49 ± $\pm $ 17 Mt/yr, 22 ± $\pm $ 10 Mt/yr, 30 ± $\pm $ 8 Mt/yr, and 41 ± $\pm $ 19 Mt/yr, respectively. The results show that the method is robust and can be applied to challenging cases where NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$ data helps constrain the fit. The proxy approach allows evaluation of 17 additional scenes (out of 53), reducing the average error of individual emission estimates from approximately 30%–40% to 22%–25% compared with the traditional method. Furthermore, we highlight the significant potential of satellite data to uncover discrepancies in reported emission estimates, for example, by identifying under‐reported or missing emission sources. The proposed approach can be extended to other case studies and applied to future satellite missions with joint CO2/NO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}/{\text{NO}}_{2}$ observations, such as CO2M, GOSAT‐GW, TanSat‐2, and TANGO."

 Studies related to vertical probing of dust aerosols during an active episode of a dust storm will enable quantification of the dust load and unleash the mechanics of dust transport. Space-borne sensors, especially LiDAR-based sensors, are proven to detect the vertical concentration of dust aerosols; practically, essaying the suspended aerosols in the troposphere has been well recorded by the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, which retired in 2023. This research is motivated to utilize NASA ICESat-2's photon data as a substitute for the CALIPSO mission to study the vertical structure of an active dust storm. This research suggests using photons from ICESat-2's weak beam over the strong beam to successfully profile aerosols suspended in the atmosphere. Technical validation by comparing the heights of the dust aerosols retrieved by attenuated photons from ICESat-2 and 532 nm total attenuated backscatter of Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) sensor yielded a good agreement of the results from both sensors. Further, analyzing the vertical wind profiles from ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data for the ten test sites with active dust storms confirms that the lift force of wind speed is greater than 5 m/s, while the drag force of the wind speed above the vertical structure having the dust aerosols is always greater than the lift force."

 Aerosol particles are an important part of the Earth climate system, and their concentrations are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, as well as being variable in size and composition. Particles can interact with incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation, change cloud properties, affect photochemistry, impact surface air quality, change the albedo of snow and ice, and modulate carbon dioxide uptake by the land and ocean. High particulate matter concentrations at the surface represent an important public health hazard. There are substantial data sets describing aerosol particles in the literature or in public health databases, but they have not been compiled for easy use by the climate and air quality modeling community. Here, we present a new compilation of PM2.5 and PM10 surface observations, including measurements of aerosol composition, focusing on the spatial variability across different observational stations. Climate modelers are constantly looking for multiple independent lines of evidence to verify their models, and in situ surface concentration measurements, taken at the level of human settlement, present a valuable source of information about aerosols and their human impacts complementarily to the column averages or integrals often retrieved from satellites. We demonstrate a method for comparing the data sets to outputs from global climate models that are the basis for projections of future climate and large-scale aerosol transport patterns that influence local air quality. Annual trends and seasonal cycles are discussed briefly and are included in the compilation. Overall, most of the planet or even the land fraction does not have sufficient observations of surface concentrations – and, especially, particle composition – to characterize and understand the current distribution of particles. Climate models without ammonium nitrate aerosols omit ∼ 10 % of the globally averaged surface concentration of aerosol particles in both PM2.5 and PM10 size fractions, with up to 50 % of the surface concentrations not being included in some regions. In these regions, climate model aerosol forcing projections are likely to be incorrect as they do not include important trends in short-lived climate forcers."

Krummel;William Vizuete;Andrew R. Babbin,Marine emissions and trade winds control the atmospheric nitrous oxide in the Galapagos Islands,"We present the initial 15 months of nitrous oxide measurements from the Galapagos Emissions Monitoring Station. The observed variability in atmospheric mole fractions during this period can be linked to several factors: seasonal variations in trade wind speed and direction across the eastern Pacific, differences in the transport history of air masses sampled, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in regional marine nitrous oxide emissions from the coastal upwelling systems of Peru and Chile. 
 Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas emitted by oceanic and terrestrial sources, and its biogeochemical cycle is influenced by  both natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Current atmospheric N2O monitoring networks, including tall-tower and flask measurements, often overlook major marine hotspots, such as the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. We present the first 15 months of high-frequency continuous measurements of N2O and carbon monoxide from the newly established Galapagos Emissions Monitoring Station in the region. Over this period, N2O mole fractions vary by approximately 5 ppb, influenced by seasonal trade winds, local anthropogenic emissions, and air masses transported from marine N2O emission hotspots. Notably, between February and April 2024, we observe high variability linked to the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone and weakened trade winds over the Galapagos Islands. Increased variability during this period is driven by stagnant local winds, which accumulate emissions, and the mixing of air masses with different N2O contents from the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The remaining variability is primarily due to differences in air mass transport and heterogeneity in surface fluxes from the eastern tropical Pacific. Air masses passing over the Peruvian and Chilean upwelling systems – key sources of oceanic N2O efflux – show markedly higher N2O mole fractions at the station."

Agricultural fires dominated emissions, while forest and grassland emissions decreased. Seasonal peaks occurred in late spring, with hotspots in northeast, southwest, and east China. The model emphasizes the importance of using localized emission factors and high-resolution fire estimates for accurate assessments. 
 During the past decades, wildfires have undergone rapid changes while both the extent of fire activities and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wildfires in China have remained inadequately quantified. We established a wildfire emission model to generate the China Wildfire Emission Dataset (ChinaWED), which can be used to explore the recent dynamics at a national scale. This dataset is constructed at a monthly and kilometer scale under a consistent and quantifiable calculation framework, providing average annual estimates of wildfire-induced GHG emissions of 78.13 ± 22.46 Tg CO2, 279.47 ± 82.01 Gg CH4, and 6.26 ± 1.67 Gg N2O (Tg denotes teragrams and Gg gigagrams) for the past decade. We observed significant decreases in both wildfire occurrences and emissions within forests and grasslands. This trend, however, is counteracted by variations in agricultural fires, which constitute the primary type of fire, accounting for at least half of the national total fire emissions. The seasonal cycle of wildfire GHG emissions shows an evident apex that occurs during the transition from mid-spring to early summer. At the regional scale, northeast China, southwest China, and east China emerge as hotspots of wildfire-induced emissions. Our study offers new insights into China's wildfire dynamics and provides a detailed regional model for wildfire greenhouse gas emissions over China."

However, whether aerosols affect the fog trends and, if so, through what mechanisms remains unclear. Using long‐term observations, we find that aerosols substantially intensify the nighttime fog and lead to a 36% increase in fog duration in India. Aerosol‐coupled simulations show that high aerosols activate more fog droplets during the formative stages and increase the longwave cooling. Cooling affects supersaturation and enhances the condensational growth of the fog droplets. This aerosol‐longwave cooling‐condensational growth relationship enhances fog water content during nighttime. The subsequent morning, intense fog and aerosol‐radiative effects reduce incoming radiation and promote stagnation under high aerosol loading, delaying fog dissipation.

 Investigations across five fire-impacted regions worldwide show that smoke consistently increases precipitation rates at elevations above the 0 °C isotherm. This enhancement persists despite regional differences in atmospheric circulation fields associated with precipitation events. Upon limiting dynamic variations, the enhancement of upper-level precipitation rates by smoke aerosols remained evident. Generally, wildfire emissions were estimated to augment the global mean annual Aerosol Optical Depth by 0.0358, with a variation of 0.56%, and to lower the mean annual global precipitation top temperature by 0.32 °C, with a variation of 3%. It suggests that on the global stage, smoke aerosol acts as an effective cloud condensation and ice nucleating agent, diminishing cloud particle sizes at the lower layer, facilitating the formation of ice-phase hydrometeors, and triggering augmented latent heat release at the upper layer, which delay the rain formation from low to high altitude, and enhance the upper-level rain intensity and elevate precipitation tops."

 Addressing the challenges of climate change requires accurate and high-resolution mapping of geospatial data, especially climate and weather variables. However, many existing geospatial datasets, such as the gridded outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand. Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images and have shown great promise in improving geospatial datasets. This paper describes a conditional GAN-based stochastic geospatial downscaling method that can accommodate large scaling factors. Compared to most existing methods, the method can generate high-resolution accurate climate datasets from very low-resolution inputs. More importantly, the method explicitly considers the uncertainty inherent to the downscaling process that tends to be ignored in existing methods. Given an input, the method can produce a multitude of plausible high-resolution samples instead of one single deterministic result. These samples allow for an empirical exploration and inferences of model uncertainty and robustness. With a case study of gridded climate datasets (wind velocity and solar irradiance), we demonstrate the performances of the framework in downscaling tasks with large scaling factors (up to 64×) and highlight the advantages of the framework with a comprehensive comparison with commonly used and most recent downscaling methods, including area-to-point (ATP) kriging, deep image prior (DIP), enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN), physics-informed resolution-enhancing GAN (PhIRE GAN), and an efficient diffusion model for remote sensing image super-resolution (EDiffSR)."

 Methane emissions reduction has become a high priority due to its tractability relative to other greenhouse gases, and the potential for climate and air-quality benefits. However, regional methane sources have been difficult to ascertain, with discrepancies between top-down and bottom-up estimates. We combined mobile surveys with continuous atmospheric measurements at two fixed locations (one urban and one rural) in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California, USA, using ethane:methane (C2:C1) content and stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13CH4) as tracers for source type. In 6483 km of road surveys conducted over five field campaigns, 108 methane source events from 74 unique locations were sampled. C2:C1 was characteristically low for dairies and wastewater facilities, but was also near zero for many oil and gas sources, notably within a northeastern arc of high-density oil and gas fields. Natural gas sources within the Bakersfield urban area fell consistently within 2.3–4.2 % C2:C1. δ13CH4 was effective at separating dairy (−51.6 ± 3.1 ‰), wastewater (−45.4 ± 3.2 ‰), and thermogenic natural gas (−42.9 ± 1.8 ‰) sources. Oil and gas production sources were less consistent, with 50 % of observations within −45.8 to −42.7 ‰ (median: 43.8 ‰), but with the largest spans of δ13CH4 and C2:C1. The urban location experienced frequent methane enhancements attributed to both thermogenic and biogenic origins, whereas methane enhancements at the rural location enhancements were almost exclusively attributed to biogenic sources. Our results demonstrate considerable utility of diagnostic ethane and δ13CH4 measurements in partitioning several methane source types, with the caveat that oil and gas sources may contain wide-ranging C2:C1 and δ13CH4 due to thermal maturities and secondary processes (microbial and oxidation)."

We analyze model simulations aimed at detection and attribution to compare and contrast the processes that affect the energy budget and water cycle in the presence of aerosols to those associated with land-use/land-cover change (LULCC) over the Indian subcontinent. We find that the response of the water cycle to these external forcings is remarkably similar: precipitation decreases in the presence of either aerosols or LULCC. We also find that this occurs despite opposite responses in the surface energy budget, manifest in surface temperature: aerosols cool the continent, while LULCC warms it. Consequently, the temperature contrast set up by the difference in thermal inertia between land and ocean at peak insolation is weakened in the aerosol case, but it is strengthened in the LULCC case. These results therefore support the perspective that has forcefully emerged in tropical climate dynamics in the past couple decades that the temperature contrast between land and ocean alone is not sufficient to explain variation in monsoon rains. In line with this perspective, we find that viewing humidity as an expression of energy on par with temperature, that is, considering the moist static energy contrast, is critical to explaining outcome. In the simulations analyzed here, the presence of either aerosols or LULCC coherently reduces moist static energy over land, weakening the contrast between land and ocean, and results in reduced precipitation, confirming the monsoon’s sensitivity to external forcing."

However, current models that predict this process vary greatly due to different methods and inaccuracies. We examined how nitrate forms in a global model, focusing on how gases condense on dust, the lifespan of different particles, and the impact of alkalinity. Our findings show that models work best when they consider reversible gas condensation with alkalinity. This should lead to better estimates of climate impacts. 
 Desert dust undergoes complex heterogeneous chemical reactions during atmospheric transport, forming nitrate coatings that influence hygroscopicity, gas partitioning, optical properties, and aerosol radiative forcing. Contemporary atmospheric chemistry models show significant disparities in aerosol nitrogen species due to varying parameterizations and inaccuracies in representing heterogeneous chemistry and dust alkalinity. This study investigates key processes in nitrate formation in the presence of dust and evaluates their representation in models. We incorporate varying levels of dust heterogeneous chemistry complexity into the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH)  model, assessing sensitivity to critical processes. Our analyses address the condensation pathways of gas species onto dust (irreversible and reversible); the influence of nitrate representation on species burdens, lifetimes, and size distribution; and the role of alkalinity. Using annual global simulations, we compare particulate and gas species surface concentrations to observations and evaluate global budgets and spatial distributions. Findings show significant outcome dependence on methodology, particularly on reversible vs. irreversible gas condensation on dust, with wide ranges for particulate nitrate burdens (0.66 to 1.93 Tg) and correlations with observations (0.66 to 0.91). In contrast, particulate ammonium burdens show lower variability (0.19 to 0.31 Tg). Incorporating dust (together with sea-salt) alkalinity improves consistency with observations, with reversible condensation along with alkalinity representation yielding the best agreement, while showing consistent gas and particle partitioning. In contrast, irreversible uptake reactions overestimate coarse particulate nitrate formation. Our findings offer guidelines for integrating nitrate heterogeneous formation on dust in models, paving the road for improved estimates of aerosol radiative effects."

A new method to derive the size-resolved chemical composition of particles from ρeff is proposed. 
 The effective density (ρeff) is closely associated with the aging process and can serve as a tracer of chemical composition. Recently, studies investigating the effect of particle size on density have been limited. In this study, size-resolved ρeff was characterized using a tandem aerodynamic aerosol classifier (AAC) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system during 1 month of observations in Hangzhou. The results indicate that the ρeff values of the particles exhibit a unimodal distribution, with average values ranging from 1.47   to 1.63 g cm−3, increasing as the particle diameter increases. The diurnal variation is more pronounced for small particles (dae < 350 nm), which generally exhibit lower density during the day and higher density at night. The relationship between ρeff and particle diameter varies under different pollution conditions due to differences in the chemical composition of the particles. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values revealed good relationships between ρeff and the bulk composition of particles with diameters smaller than 350 nm, while the relationship with larger particles was weak. As determining the size-resolved chemical composition of particles remains challenging, a new method to investigate the size-resolved chemical composition was proposed, in which the size-resolved composition can be derived from the ρeff and fixed material density of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs), organic aerosols (OAs), and black carbon (BC)."

 This study focuses on the information content for retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its components from satellite measurements. We utilise an optimal estimation retrieval algorithm with data from three satellite-based instruments: the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) on MetOp-A, MetOp-B and MetOp-C. Data are averaged to a common 40×80 km2 grid, temporally aligned within a 60 min window and cloud masked. A simulation study has been carried out to analyse the information content of the instrument combination, identify retrievable parameters, and initiate the development of a uniform retrieval algorithm for the AOD and aerosol components. The simulation study for the information content analysis is implemented using the radiative transfer model SCIATRAN and MERRA-2 reanalysis data for AOD and mass mixing ratios of different aerosol components. The study shows 6 to 15 degrees of freedom for the determination of aerosol components dependent on AOD and the underlying surface. The results will be used for the development of a synergistic multi-sensor retrieval algorithm for AOD and its components in cloud-free atmospheres across various surface types."

 We present a 14-year, 12 km, hourly air quality dataset (https://doi.org/10.5065/cfya-4g50, Kumar and He, 2023) created by assimilating satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and carbon monoxide (CO) in an air quality model to fill gaps in the contiguous United States (CONUS) air quality monitoring network and help air quality managers understand long-term changes in county-level air quality. Specifically, we assimilate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD and the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) CO observations in the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) every day from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2018 to produce this dataset. Meteorological fields simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are used to drive CMAQ offline and to generate meteorology-dependent anthropogenic emissions. Both the weather and air quality (surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone) simulations are subjected to a comprehensive evaluation against multi-platform observations to establish the credibility of our dataset and characterize its uncertainties. We show that our dataset captures regional hourly, seasonal, and interannual variability in meteorology very well across the CONUS. The correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated surface ozone and PM2.5 concentrations for different regions defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) across the CONUS are 0.77–0.91 and 0.49–0.79, respectively. The mean bias and root-mean-square error for modeled ozone are 3.7–6.8 and 7–9 ppbv, respectively, while the corresponding values for PM2.5 are −0.9–5.6 and 3.0–8.3 µg m−3, respectively. We estimate that the annual CONUS-averaged maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone and PM2.5 trends are −0.30 ppb yr−1 and −0.24 µg m−3 yr−1, respectively. Wintertime MDA8 ozone shows an increasing but statistically insignificant trend at several sites. We also found a decreasing trend in the 95th percentile of MDA8 ozone but an increasing trend in the 5th percentile. Most of the sites in the Pacific Northwest show an increasing but statistically insignificant trend during summer. An ArcGIS air quality dashboard has been developed to enable easy visualization and interpretation of county-level air quality measures and trends by stakeholders, and a Python-based Streamlit application has been developed to allow the download of the air quality data in simplified text and graphic formats."

By measuring the particle-resolved mixing state of BCc in the residues of orographic clouds downstream of a ground-based counter-flow virtual impactor, we found that a fraction of 30–90% of BCc could be in clouds by a collision/coalescence process without satisfying the conventional Köhler theory for CCN activation. These non-CCN BCc in clouds occupied a larger fraction of total in-cloud BCc when cloud droplets were larger, e.g., the non-CCN BCc fraction in clouds increased from 40% to 80% when the effective diameter of droplets increased from about 7.6 to 15.8 μm. This collision/coalescence process among droplets and BCc tended to be more efficient for larger droplets, which is also supported by microscopy images that one droplet could capture more than one BC cores. Larger droplets corresponded to lower ambient water supersaturation, under which conditions the removal of BCc in clouds by collision/coalescence may override CCN activation. By in situ measurements, the results here for the first time separated and quantified the BCc in clouds between activation and nonactivation processes, which provides insights into evaluating the wet removal and aging of atmospheric BC."

BC particles, upon deposition, darken the snowpack and subsequently accelerate snowmelt and disrupt spring water resource availability. While the impact of BC in snow (BCS) on snowmelt is widely recognized, its competitive effect relative to climate warming has been less studied, a critical knowledge gap given Northeast China’s heavy reliance on snowmelt for agricultural and residential water use. This study, utilizing comprehensive field measurements across Northeast China, reveals alarmingly high BCS concentrations with a mean of 1100 ± 810 ng g–1, 17 times greater than the global average. These high BCS levels contribute to 72% (0.82 cm d–1) of accelerated snowmelt rates (ASR), surpassing the effects of climate warming (28%, 0.32 cm d–1). Importantly, the observation-constrained CMIP6 projections under the SSP245 scenario indicate an 82% reduction in BCS by 2080–2100. This decline could offset 40% of the projected ASR increase by future warming, slowing the total ASR of 2080–2100 to 71% above that of 2000–2020. In contrast, the offset effect (3.6%–15%) is less pronounced in other regions of the Northern Hemisphere, highlighting the unique effectiveness of clean air policy implementation across Northeast China for mitigating snowmelt acceleration."

In this study, suspect screening was performed to identify emerging PFAS in gas, particles, and dust both inside and outside a large FMF in China. A total of 74 emerging PFAS were tentatively identified with a confidence level of 3 or higher, 32 of which were reported in the environment for the first time. The semi-quantitative concentrations of the emerging PFAS, with perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) and Cl-PFECAs being predominant, accounted for 21–95% (mean: 46%) of the combined concentrations of emerging and legacy PFAS. Although the PFAS concentrations in the atmosphere decreased rapidly by more than 95% within 5 km, short-chain PFAS in PM2.5 were transported farther, especially C4 and C5 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, which decreased by 66% and 79% within 5 km, respectively. Emerging PFAS with an ionic terminal group are mainly distributed in the particle phase, while alcohol-related PFAS are found in the gas phase. The ratios of PFAS in the gas phase inside the FMF were much higher than those outside, which could be reasonably explained by the condensation of gaseous PFAS onto fine particles shortly after being emitted."

To support accurate investigations into environmental and climatic impacts of dust from these deserts, we analyzed over sixty thousand individual dust particles, generated by sandblasting from their primary surface types: Gobi soils and sand dunes. TGD particles were generally smaller, rounder, and smoother than UBD's. The Gobi soil and sand dune particles of the TGD exhibited the largest number fractions at 0.5 μm and 0.5–0.6 μm in size and those of the UBD at 0.7 and 0.6 μm, respectively. Aspect ratios were similar across particles, around 1.3 roundness varied, with TGD particles averaging 0.55 (Gobi soils) and 0.50 (sand dunes) compared to UBD particles at 0.40–0.45 (Gobi soils) and 0.45 (sand dunes). Mineral analysis revealed both deserts produced particles rich in clay minerals, quartz, and other silicate particles. TGD particles contained more kaolinite and quartz, whereas UBD particles had higher chlorite and other silicates. Gypsum and halite were identified in 3.13% and 3.63% of UBD Gobi particles, respectively, indicating salt abundance in some particles; but these two salts were rarely detected in TGD particles. Comparison with data from the Taklamakan Desert revealed distinctive differences in morphology, mineral composition, and salt content.

During the 2022 Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical and CLimate Impact Project (ACCLIP) campaign, in situ measurements of OCS in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) at the eastern edge of the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASM), showed significant OCS enhancements (>750 ppt) near the tropopause from convectively influenced air parcels. Here, we compare these novel Asian UTLS measurements with long‐term satellite observations and regional measurements to broaden understanding of OCS trends and its transport by the ASM. Trajectory analysis identifies northern China as the main source region for deep convective lofting of OCS‐enriched parcels and demonstrates ASM entrainment in the UTLS, allowing evaluation of global model predictions for OCS's stratospheric influence. The ACCLIP data set provides vital in situ validation of limited vertically resolved OCS data in a region of significant anthropogenic emissions, which serves to enhance our understanding of the global sulfur budget."

Accordingly, compound extreme events associated with EDEs shift from EDE‐ECEs to EHE‐EDEs. By strengthening East Asian anomalous high pressure, enhanced Arctic Oscillation during the pre‐EDE periods and weakened Eurasian teleconnection during EDEs increases EHEs and decreases ECEs, respectively, and combined drive the shift in the compound extreme events. This study reveals a new feature of compound extreme weather events in the context of climate change, which manifests as the shift from EDE‐ECEs to EHE‐EDEs in the GD. The occurrence of more EHE‐EDEs will put already fragile ecosystems of the GD at even greater risk. Therefore, the containment of global warming, especially in arid and semiarid regions, is necessary and urgent."

The present study offers an insight into the consistency of convective rain observations from spaceborne active (KuPR)/passive (GPM Microwave Imager [GMI]) microwave sensors and ground‐based radar network (GV‐MRMS). Findings over CONUS suggest a strong agreement in convective rain detection between the three products for the deep convective regime—the storms exceeding 10 km in height and characterized by low brightness temperature at ice‐sensing channels. In contrast, a poor agreement occurs for shallow‐broken rain systems with storm tops below 5 km. Compared to the GV‐MRMS product, GMI and KuPR tend to classify shallow‐broken rain as convective. Globally, at the midlatitudes, GMI recognizes less than 20% of KuPR‐detected convective rain, while showing a better agreement in the tropical regions. Linear trends of GMI and KuPR convective rain, calculated for the period 2014–2023, reveal agreement in cold (ice phase present in the hydrometer column) and disagreement in warm (no ice phase present) rain cases, with −0.022 (GMI) and −0.019 (KuPR) mm day−1 decade−1 for cold and −0.010 (KuPR) and 0.002 (GMI) mm day−1 decade−1 for warm rain, respectively. Trends observed over the ITCZ in the mid and east Pacific Ocean oppose those over the west Pacific and tropical Atlantic Ocean. All variations are successfully linked to the environmental conditions, known to reflect atmospheric convective preference and offer a valuable proxy to the users."

 Air pollution and climate change are urgent global concerns, with urban areas contributing heavily to both air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we calculate fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone concentrations and fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions per capita in 13,189 urban areas worldwide from 2005 to 2019 and analyze correlations between trends for these pollutants, leveraging recently-developed global datasets. Globally, we found significant increases in ozone (+6%) and small, non-significant changes in fine particulate matter (+0%), nitrogen dioxide (−1%), and fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions (+4%). Also, over 50% of urban areas showed positive correlations for all pollutant pairs, though results varied by global region. High-income countries with strong mitigation policies experienced decreases in all pollutants, while regions with rapid economic growth had overall increases. This study shows the impacts of urban environmental initiatives in different regions and provides insights for reducing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions simultaneously.

 A top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance model based on the temporal characteristics of stable land surface targets, such as pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICSs), was developed to monitor the stability of satellite visible imagers without requiring ground measurements. This model accounts for variations in the viewing zenith angle, solar zenith angle, and atmospheric parameters. To better represent multiple scattering contributions between the surface and atmosphere, we introduced the scattering angle and applied a sinusoidal function with a 365-day period to model seasonal atmospheric variations. Notably, the model does not rely on long-term temporal stability of PICSs, as it primarily characterizes angular and atmospheric variations rather than site-inherent stability. A comprehensive uncertainty analysis, based on a metrology-driven approach, indicates that the model achieves an average uncertainty of better than 4 %. Furthermore, the modeled TOA reflectance maintains long-term radiometric consistency with observations from the Sentinel-2 A/B MSI and Landsat-8/OLI sensors. Across 177 matching observations, the relative difference between observed and modeled values is mostly within 3 %, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. The proposed model is further applied to calibrate the GF6/WFI sensor, with cross-validation conducted using Sentinel-2/MSI and Terra/MODIS observed TOA reflectance as references, while constraining imaging time and viewing geometry. The TOA reflectance calibrated using the proposed model shows improved consistency with the reference TOA reflectance compared to that obtained using official calibration coefficients."

Our results showed that notable reductions of the average ozone concentration (2.0 to 12.2 parts per billion by volume) were observed during the 12 dust storm events from 2016 to 2023, relative to predust storm levels. The chemical interactions of dust particles with ozone production processes played crucial roles in explaining approximately 13 to 35% of the observed ozone reduction, alongside the impact of intense meteorological disturbances on transport and formation of ozone. Among these interactions, the uptake of ozone, reactive nitrogen, and hydroperoxyl radical by dust particles could substantially contribute to the ozone suppression.

Our study reveals rising levels of both pollutants from 1995 to 2014, leading to increased premature mortality. While anthropogenic emissions play a significant role, biomass burning also impacts air quality, in particular seasons and regions in India. This study underscores the urgent need for localized policies to protect public health amid escalating environmental challenges. 
 Anthropogenic (ANTHRO) and biomass burning (BB) emissions are major contributors to ambient air pollution, with the latter playing a particularly dominant role in nonurban regions. India has experienced a dramatic deterioration in air quality over the past few decades, but no systematic assessment has been conducted to investigate the individual contributions of ANTHRO and BB emission changes over the long term in India, particularly in nonurban areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the long-term trends in particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in India and their mortality burden changes from 1995 to 2014, using a state-of-the-art high-resolution global chemical transport model (CAM-chem). Our simulations reveal a substantial nationwide increase in annual mean PM2.5 (6.71 µg m−3 per decade) and O3 (7.08 ppbv per decade), with the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and eastern central India serving as hotspots for PM2.5 and O3 trend changes, respectively. It is noteworthy that substantial O3 decreases were observed in the northern IGP, potentially linked to nitric oxide (NO) titration due to a surge in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Sensitivity analyses highlight ANTHRO emissions as primary contributors to rising PM2.5 and O3, while BB emissions play a prominent role in winter and spring. In years with high BB activity, the contributions from BB emissions to both PM2.5 and O3 changes were comparable to or even exceeded ANTHRO emissions in specific areas. We further estimate that the elevated air pollutant levels were associated with increased premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 and O3, leading to 97 830 and 73 911 deaths per decade. Although there has been a decrease in premature mortality per capita in the IGP region, population increase has offset its effectiveness."

Pandey;David S. Stevenson;Alcide Zhao;Richard J. Pope;Ryan Hossaini;Krishan Kumar;Martyn P. Chipperfield,Evaluating tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in UKCA using OMI satellite retrievals over south and east Asia,"Nitrogen dioxide is an air pollutant largely controlled by human activity that affects ozone, methane, and aerosols. Satellite instruments can quantify column NO2 and, by carefully matching the time and location of measurements, enable evaluation of model simulations. NO2 over south and east Asia is assessed, showing that the model captures not only many features of the measurements, but also important differences that suggest model deficiencies in representing several aspects of the atmospheric chemistry of NO2. 
 We compare tropospheric column nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (UKCA) model version 11.0 with satellite measurements from NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) to investigate the seasonality and trends of tropospheric NO2 over south and east Asia (S and E Asia). UKCA is the atmospheric composition component of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). UKCA was run with nudged meteorology, producing hourly output over S and E Asia for 2005–2015. OMI averaging kernels have been applied to the model hourly data sampled at Aura's local overpass time of 13:45 LT ± 15 min to allow for consistent model–data comparison. Background UKCA and OMI tropospheric column NO2 typically ranges between 0×1015 and 2×1015 molec.cm-2. Diurnal cycles and vertical profiles of the tropospheric NO2 column in UKCA show that the daily minimum tropospheric column NO2 occurs around the satellite overpass time. UKCA captures the seasonality but overestimates NO2 by a factor of ∼ 2.5, especially during winter over eastern China and north India, at times and locations with high aerosol loadings. Heterogeneous chemistry is represented in the version of UKCA used here as uptake of N2O5 on internally generated sulfate aerosol. However, aerosol surface area may be underestimated in polluted locations, contributing to overestimation of NO2. In addition, the model may underestimate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and associated peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) formation, leading to insufficient long-range transport of oxidised nitrogen and also contributing to overestimation of NO2 over polluted regions and underestimation over remote regions. Quantifying and understanding discrepancies in modelled NO2 warrant further investigation as they propagate into modelling of multiple environmental issues."

 The Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (Daqi 1 or DQ-1) was successfully launched in April 2022, with the capability of providing continuous multi-sensor spatial and optical simultaneous observations of carbon dioxide, aerosols, and clouds. The primary payload carried on DQ-1 is an Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL). The instrument comprises a high-spectral-resolution channel at 532 nm, polarization channels at 532 nm, an elastic scattering channel at 1064 nm, and an integrated-path differential absorption (IPDA) channel at 1572 nm. The optical properties of aerosols and clouds measured by the ACDL promote a quantitative characterization of the uncertainties in the global climate system; hence, precise calibrations for the ACDL are necessary. This paper outlines the algorithms employed for calibrating the nighttime 532 nm measurements for the first spaceborne high-spectral-resolution lidar with an iodine vapor absorption filter. The nighttime calibrations of the 532 nm data are fundamental to the ACDL measurement procedure, as they are utilized to derive the calibrations over daytime orbits and the calibrations of the 1064 nm channel relative to the 532 nm channel. This paper provides a review of the theoretical foundations for molecular normalization techniques as applied to spaceborne lidar measurements and includes a detailed discussion of auxiliary data and theoretical parameters used in ACDL calibrations, as well as a comprehensive description of the calibration algorithm procedure. To mitigate large errors stemming from high-energy events during calibration, a data filter is designed to obtain valid calibration signals. The paper also assesses the results of the calibration procedure by analyzing the errors of calibration coefficients and validating the attenuated backscatter coefficient results. The results indicate that the relative error of the calibrated attenuated backscatter coefficients is lower than 1 % in the calibration area, and the uncertainty of the clear-air scattering ratio was within an anticipated range of 7.9 %."

Nitrate-driven pollution has long been recognized as a primary contributor to haze formation at the ground surface in Beijing. Here, comprehensive observations of N2O5 and related species were conducted using a unique 528 m platform in Beijing. Elevated N2O5 concentrations (1.3 ppb, 1 h average) were recorded. The average nighttime nitrate production rate from N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis was 5.8 μg·m–3·h–1, while the partitioning of HNO3 at night significantly contributes to nitrate with an average production rate of 7.6 μg·m–3·h–1. As a result, chemical processes dominated by N2O5–NO3 contribute approximately 65% of the total nitrate source. Using a large eddy simulation model, peak nitrate transfers of 14.1 μg//m3 from the residual layer to the surface were found, with a contribution of up to approximately 43% during the nitrate morning peak compared to simultaneous surface measurements. Entrainment effects even persisted into the afternoon, highlighting the vital contribution from thermal shear turbulence mixing. Sensitivity tests further suggest that reducing NOx emissions during boundary-layer mixing could effectively mitigate nitrate formation, thereby improving the ground-level air quality."

Hammerling,Investigating Aerial Data Preanalysis Schemes and Site-Level Methane Emission Aggregation Methods at Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities,"Methane observations at liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities play an important role in characterizing methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. The large size and complexity of LNG facilities make quantifying emissions with ground-based monitoring systems challenging, making aerial platforms one of the preferred methods for detecting and estimating methane emissions at these sites. However, aerial measurements typically provide a snapshot of emissions at a given instance, necessitating further analytical steps to infer both annualized emissions and the range of possible emissions at different instances in time. This study uses aerial measurements at two U.S. LNG facilities from a Quantification, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification project to characterize the distribution of temporally averaged emissions (i.e., annualized inventories) and possible site-level emissions at any given point in time (“instantaneous emissions”). The former provides uncertainty on the aerial measurement component of measurement-informed annual inventories, while the latter helps contextualize future snapshot measurements, such as those from aerial surveys or high-resolution satellite platforms, at LNG facilities. We find that instantaneous emissions may fall well outside of the distribution describing uncertainty in the annual inventory. We also compare different preanalysis schemes for aerial data, as existing literature does not provide a clear consensus on methods for doing so, especially at LNG facilities. We find the persistence assumption to be the most critical preanalysis factor."

Two DA experiments were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model: the first (DA1) assimilated temperature and humidity profiles from a microwave radiometer (MWR) using 3DVar/GSI‐based system, while second (DA2) extended DA1 by incorporating fine‐gridded initial soil fields from the High‐Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS). The effectiveness of these data sets in improving the forecast accuracy of wintertime meteorological parameters within the boundary layer was evaluated. MWR profiles were validated against simultaneous radiosonde (RS) measurements during the winter seasons of 2017–2019, and bias correction using RS data was implemented to enhance MWR profile accuracy. The results indicated that the assimilation of MWR profiles (DA1) improves the accuracy of near surface temperature and humidity forecasts, conducive for fog conditions. The inclusion of soil state assimilation (DA2) further improves the representation of soil states, thereby better capturing the physical processes associated with fog formation. With DA2, biases in near‐surface meteorological and soil variables were significantly reduced (50% in T2, 16% in RH2, 66% in SM, 46% in ST) compared to DA1. DA2 also improved the representation of surface fog heterogeneity and lifecycle across the IGP, with a spatial skill score of 0.36, versus 0.29 for DA1 and 0.24 without assimilation. Additionally, DA2 achieved a higher critical success index (CSI) of 0.75, compared to 0.50 for DA1."

Possible evolution of the morphology of these cloud shields with climate change remain poorly understood. In this study, the sensitivity of the cloud shield to environmental conditions is therefore investigated using a large data set of atmospheric profiles from reanalysis and satellite observations. The initial environmental conditions in stability, thermodynamics, and dynamics are explored. Multilinear regression between morphology and environment is used in a 2D phase space linked to the life cycle of the systems, namely the time to reach the maximum area and the associated maximum area. Dynamical drivers show stronger morphological control than the thermodynamic factors. The result reveals an overwhelming role for wind shear over a deep tropospheric layer in explaining the scale dependence of cloud shield morphology. In particular, the variability of the shield growth rate is very well explained by deep layer shear (R2 > 0.8). The depth of the systems is also strongly related to dynamics and secondly to water vapor loading. These results feed the debate on the relative role of deep‐ versus low‐level shear in influencing deep convection and extend previous precipitation‐centric considerations to the cloud shield of the systems. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed, and the need to extend previous theoretical considerations on idealized convective geometry toward the whole spectrum of deep convective systems populating the tropical oceans is emphasized."

 Carbon monoxide is a primary pollutant in energy-rich regions. Here we use a space-based mass-conserving framework based on observed carbon monoxide and formaldehyde columns to quantify carbon monoxide emissions over the energy-driven province of Shanxi, China. Annualized total emissions are seven times higher on average compared with some existing datasets, partly due to the fractional increase in low-emitting area’s energy consumption, resulting in a spatial mis-alignment. This induces a net 7% increase in CO2 emissions. Substantial forcings include atmospheric lifetime (10th and 90th percentile of carbon monoxide and formaldehyde are [1.0, 5.7] days and [0.2, 2.3] hours) and transport. Carbon monoxide decreased year-by-year, although only obvious at the two/three peak emission months. Cross-border transport is important during the same months, including sources from central Shaanxi and western Hebei. Carbon monoxide to nitrogen oxides ratios show obvious differences and give source attribution over industrial areas (including cement, power, iron/steel, and coke).

 In the background of global climate change, the trend of atmospheric pollution of the Tibetan Plateau region (TP), where ecosystem is susceptible to their synergistic effects, requires prompt attention. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as an important air pollutant of the TP with a profound social and ecological effect, lacks sufficient investigations. Current assessments on NO2 greatly rely on machine-learning models based on NO2 column derived by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), which provides observations over 20 years. Meanwhile, an unexpected overestimation in non-urban areas of the TP due to the coarse spatial resolution of OMI strongly impacts the long-term assessment. Consequently, this study proposes a fusion strategy to improve the long-term OMI NO2 column based on the recent available fine-scale NO2 column from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Besides the fine resolution and extended applicability to periods long before available TROPOMI observations, the improved NO2 column obtained by fusion strategy retrieves ground-level NO2 concentrations with enhanced accuracy (with R2 0.831–0.880) and approximately 20% mitigated overestimation. Based on the improved dataset, the urban–rural contrast is revealed, as ground-level NO2 in non-urban regions declines by 0.88 μg/m3 per year, while 14% lower rate is observed in urban regions. It further indicates that previous exposure to NO2 exceeding WHO health standards is significantly overestimated (by 49 % pollution days). The results contribute to understanding the different impacts of human activities and climate change on air quality of urban–rural areas."

For the first time, state-of-the-art aerosol and cirrus observations with lidar and radar, presented in this paper (Part 1 of a series of two articles), are closely linked to the comprehensive modeling of gravity-wave-induced ice nucleation in cirrus evolution processes, presented in a companion paper (Part 2).  We found a clear impact of wildfire smoke on cirrus evolution. 
 The potential impact of wildfire smoke on Arctic cirrus formation is discussed based on lidar and radar observations during the winter half year of the 1-year MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition. Aerosol and ice cloud observations were performed aboard the icebreaker Polarstern at latitudes > 85° N. Aged Siberian wildfire smoke polluted the tropopause region over the central Arctic during the entire winter half year of 2019–2020. The smoke particle surface area concentration at the tropopause was of the order of 5–15 µm2 cm−3 and indicated considerably enhanced levels of aerosol pollution for more than 6 months. Numerous cirrus systems with cloud-top temperatures between −60 and −75 °C developed in the polluted upper troposphere. We analyzed all MOSAiC winter cirrus layers with respect to their geometrical and optical properties and a subgroup of 20 cirrus events with respect to their ice water content (IWC) and ice crystal number concentration (ICNC). In individual ice fallstreaks that are connected to individual ice nucleation events, ICNCs typically ranged from 1 to 10 crystals L−1 but were frequently also as high as 20–50 L−1; however, observations > 100 L−1 were rare. Three observational facts corroborate our hypothesis that smoke significantly influenced Arctic cirrus formation: (1) the occurrence of a long-lasting, persistent smoke pollution layer in the upper troposphere so that favorable conditions for heterogeneous ice nucleation on smoke particles were always given and, at the same time, homogeneous freezing of background aerosol was probably widely suppressed; (2) the high smoke particle surface area concentrations, which were high enough to significantly trigger ice nucleation on smoke particles (as shown in Part 2, the companion paper to this article; Ansmann et al., 2025); and (3) the frequently found maximum cirrus ice saturation ratios of 1.3–1.5, which point to the dominance of heterogeneous ice nucleation processes, initiated by inefficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs), as expected when aged smoke particles (i.e., organic aerosol particles) serve as INPs. The studies are continued in the simulation portion of this work (Part 2; Ansmann et al., 2025)."

 A simulation study of the potential impact of wildfire smoke on Arctic cirrus formation is presented. The simulations complement the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) field observations, discussed in Part 1 (Ansmann et al., 2025) of this work. The observations suggest that Siberian wildfire smoke had a strong impact on Arctic cirrus formation in the winter of 2019–2020. Via simulations, a detailed insight into the potential of wildfire smoke to influence Arctic cirrus formation as a function of observed meteorological and environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, large-scale and gravity-wave-induced lofting conditions, and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentration) is provided. Lidar-derived values of the INP concentration serve as input, and ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) values retrieved from combined lidar–radar observations are used for comparison with the simulation results. The simulations show that the observed smoke pollution levels in the upper troposphere were high enough to trigger strong ice nucleation. The simulations also corroborate the hypothesis stated in Part 1 (Ansmann et al., 2025): the persistent smoke layer, continuously observed over the central Arctic during the winter half year 2019–2020, was able to widely suppress homogeneous freezing so that the smoke aerosol most probably controlled cirrus formation and properties. The observations suggest that the INP reservoir was continuously refilled from the lower stratosphere.  Furthermore, the simulations confirm that the observed high ice saturation ratios of 1.3–1.5 over the North Pole region at cirrus tops (with top temperatures of −60 to −75 °C) point to inefficient INPs, as expected when wildfire smoke particles (organic particles) serve as INPs. Finally, the simulations revealed that ice nucleation in widespread and frequently occurring shallow updrafts (with low amplitudes) seems to be responsible for the observed low ICNC values of typically 1–50 crystals L−1 in the Arctic cirrus virga."

 In order to study aerosols in environments influenced by anthropogenic and biogenic emissions to variable extents, PM1 samples were collected during summer 2022 in the greater Paris area (ACROSS campaign, Atmospheric Chemistry Of the Suburban Forest, 14 June to 25 July) at two locations that represent the urban Paris and the suburban forested areas. They were analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) together with total carbon (TC) with a thermo-optical method. Both sites are compared here to explore differences in aerosol composition from urban and forested environments. The TC analysis shows similar organic carbon (OC) concentrations at both sites (3.2 ± 1.8 µg m−3 for Paris and 2.9 ± 1.5 µg m−3 for Rambouillet) and higher elemental carbon (EC) values in the urban area. Both OC and EC concentrations did not show significant variations for daytime and nighttime conditions. This work highlights the influence of anthropogenic inputs on the chemical composition of urban and forested areas, derived from the presence of CHO and CHON compounds but also the detection of two sulfur-containing compounds (C5H12SO7 and C10H17NSO7), which could be tentatively assigned as organosulfates. A smaller number of aromatic compounds were observed for clean periods that better represent the local biogenic and anthropogenic contributions in Rambouillet and Paris, respectively."

In this paper, we use the measurements from the Atmospheric Chemistry of the Suburban Forest (ACROSS) campaign, conducted in the Paris area in June–July 2022, along with observations from existing networks, to evaluate a 3D chemistry transport model (WRF–CHIMERE) simulation. Results are shown to be satisfactory, allowing us to explain the gas and aerosol variability at the campaign sites. 
 Understanding the interaction of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions around large urban agglomerations remains an important question for atmospheric research and the key question of the ACROSS (Atmospheric Chemistry of the Suburban Forest) project. ACROSS is based on an intensive field campaign in the Paris area, including ground-based measurements in the urban inner centre and suburban and forested sites and measurements made on board aircraft, during the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 2022. In addition, 3D modelling represents an important tool in ACROSS, and here we use the available measurements from the campaign together with observations from air quality and meteorological networks to evaluate the WRF–CHIMERE model simulation for the ACROSS period. We find that the WRF model is able to reproduce the meteorological variability during the campaign, in particular during two heatwaves. The model reproduces the daily ozone maxima well but overestimates PM2.5 by a factor of 1.5–2, partly due to an overestimation of secondary aerosol, both organic and inorganic. For organic aerosol in the Île-de-France area, the biases are reduced to about ±20 %. These differences are in contrast with those of the existing literature and might have been increased by the hot conditions of summer 2022. For case studies during two heatwave days, the model shows the sources for two organic aerosol peaks above 20–30 µg m−3, on one occasion due to biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation in different forests around Paris and on another occasion due to the advection of wildfire aerosols in combination with secondary formation mainly from forest-emitted biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)."

In this study we investigate, using an atmospheric chemistry model, how this indirect climate effect differs with different amounts of leakages and with where the hydrogen leaks and if this effect changes in the future. The effect is largest for emissions far from areas where hydrogen is removed from the atmosphere by the soil, but these are not relevant locations for a future hydrogen economy. 
 The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier and reactant in metal production can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuel usage. When hydrogen is used, some hydrogen will leak during production, storage, transport, and end use. Via OH-induced reactions in the atmosphere, the hydrogen will enhance methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour in the atmosphere and hence will increase the radiation imbalance. A recent multi-model study found the global warming potential over a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) for hydrogen to be 11.6±2.8 (1 standard deviation). Here, we use a chemistry transport model to investigate the sensitivity of GWP100 to the magnitude and the location of the hydrogen emission and the chemical composition of the background atmosphere. We show that the hydrogen GWP100 is independent of the size of the emission perturbation; is not dependent on where emissions occur, except for sites far from soil sink active areas; and is not very different for possible future chemical compositions of the atmosphere. The methane GWP100 increases by up to 3.4 for different future atmospheric compositions compared to the present day. Overall, the changes in the hydrogen GWP100 are within 1 standard deviation of the multi-model GWP100, except for emission perturbations at two distant sites not relevant for a future hydrogen economy. Therefore, when assessing emissions at different locations or for a future with a different atmospheric composition compared to the present day, it is not necessary to adjust the multi-model GWP values."

A weak constraint applied when estimating gradients in the GNSS data processing, enhancing short-lived gradient tracking but increasing noise, which can be mitigated by averaging gradients from the eight stations. This approach may enhance GNSS-based atmospheric monitoring for use in weather nowcasting. 
 We  used eight co-located global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations with different antenna mounts to estimate atmospheric signal propagation delays in the zenith direction and linear horizontal gradients. The gradients are compared with the results from a water vapour radiometer (WVR). The water drops in the atmosphere have a negative influence on the retrieval accuracy of the WVR. Hence, we see better agreement using WVR data with a liquid water content (LWC) less than 0.05 mm compared to when LWC values of up to 0.7 mm are included. We  used two different constraints when estimating the linear gradients from the GNSS data. Using a weak constraint enhances the GNSS estimates to track large gradients of short duration at the cost of increased formal errors. To mitigate random noise in the GNSS gradients, we adopted a fusion approach, averaging estimates from the GNSS stations. This resulted in significant improvements for the agreement with the WVR data, a maximum of 17 % increase in the correlation, and a 14 % reduction in the root mean square (RMS) difference for the east gradients. The corresponding values for the north gradients are both 25 %. Overall, no large differences in terms of quality are observed for the eight GNSS stations. However, one station shows slightly poorer agreement for the north gradients compared to the others. This is attributed to the station's proximity to a radio telescope, which causes data loss of observations at low-elevation angles in the south-south-west direction."

A consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists synthesise and update the budget of the sources and sinks of CH4. This edition benefits from important progress in estimating emissions from lakes and ponds, reservoirs, and streams and rivers. For the 2010s decade, global CH4 emissions are estimated at 575 Tg CH4 yr-1, including ~65 % from anthropogenic sources. 
 Understanding and quantifying the global methane (CH4) budget is important for assessing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. CH4 is the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing after carbon dioxide (CO2), and both emissions and atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have continued to increase since 2007 after a temporary pause. The relative importance of CH4 emissions compared to those of CO2 for temperature change is related to its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger radiative effect, and acceleration in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in quantifying the factors responsible for the observed atmospheric growth rate arise from diverse, geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the uncertain magnitude and temporal change in the destruction of CH4 by short-lived and highly variable hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to improve, synthesise, and update the global CH4 budget regularly and to stimulate new research on the methane cycle. Following Saunois et al. (2016, 2020), we present here the third version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal CH4 budget, integrating results of top-down CH4 emission estimates (based on in situ and Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) atmospheric observations and an ensemble of atmospheric inverse-model results) and bottom-up estimates (based on process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). We present a budget for the most recent 2010–2019 calendar decade (the latest period for which full data sets are available), for the previous decade of 2000–2009 and for the year 2020.The revision of the bottom-up budget in this 2025 edition benefits from important progress in estimating inland freshwater emissions, with better counting of emissions from lakes and ponds, reservoirs, and streams and rivers. This budget also reduces double counting across freshwater and wetland emissions and, for the first time, includes an estimate of the potential double counting that may exist (average of 23 Tg CH4 yr−1). Bottom-up approaches show that the combined wetland and inland freshwater emissions average 248 [159–369] Tg CH4 yr−1 for the 2010–2019 decade. Natural fluxes are perturbed by human activities through climate, eutrophication, and land use. In this budget, we also estimate, for the first time, this anthropogenic component contributing to wetland and inland freshwater emissions. Newly available gridded products also allowed us to derive an almost complete latitudinal and regional budget based on bottom-up approaches.For the 2010–2019 decade, global CH4 emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (top-down) to be 575 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 553–586, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble). Of this amount, 369 Tg CH4 yr−1 or ∼ 65 % is attributed to direct anthropogenic sources in the fossil, agriculture, and waste and anthropogenic biomass burning (range 350–391 Tg CH4 yr−1 or 63 %–68 %). For the 2000–2009 period, the atmospheric inversions give a slightly lower total emission than for 2010–2019, by 32 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 9–40). The 2020 emission rate is the highest of the period and reaches 608 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 581–627), which is 12 % higher than the average emissions in the 2000s. Since 2012, global direct anthropogenic CH4 emission trends have been tracking scenarios that assume no or minimal climate mitigation policies proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (shared socio-economic pathways SSP5 and SSP3). Bottom-up methods suggest 16 % (94 Tg CH4 yr−1) larger global emissions (669 Tg CH4 yr−1, range 512–849) than top-down inversion methods for the 2010–2019 period. The discrepancy between the bottom-up and the top-down budgets has been greatly reduced compared to the previous differences (167 and 156 Tg CH4 yr−1 in Saunois et al. (2016, 2020) respectively), and for the first time uncertainties in bottom-up and top-down budgets overlap. Although differences have been reduced between inversions and bottom-up, the most important source of uncertainty in the global CH4 budget is still attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and inland freshwaters.The tropospheric loss of methane, as the main contributor to methane lifetime, has been estimated at 563 [510–663] Tg CH4 yr−1 based on chemistry–climate models. These values are slightly larger than for 2000–2009 due to the impact of the rise in atmospheric methane and remaining large uncertainty (∼ 25 %). The total sink of CH4 is estimated at 633 [507–796] Tg CH4 yr−1 by the bottom-up approaches and at 554 [550–567] Tg CH4 yr−1 by top-down approaches. However, most of the top-down models use the same OH distribution, which introduces less uncertainty to the global budget than is likely justified.For 2010–2019, agriculture and waste contributed an estimated 228 [213–242] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the top-down budget and 211 [195–231] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the bottom-up budget. Fossil fuel emissions contributed 115 [100–124] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the top-down budget and 120 [117–125] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the bottom-up budget. Biomass and biofuel burning contributed 27 [26–27] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the top-down budget and 28 [21–39] Tg CH4 yr−1 in the bottom-up budget.We identify five major priorities for improving the CH4 budget: (i) producing a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting CH4 based on a robust classification of different types of emitting ecosystems; (ii) further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii) intensification of CH4 observations at local (e.g. FLUXNET-CH4 measurements, urban-scale monitoring, satellite imagery with pointing capabilities) to regional scales (surface networks and global remote sensing measurements from satellites) to constrain both bottom-up models and atmospheric inversions; (iv) improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v) integration of 3D variational inversion systems using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane as well as information in the bottom-up inventories on anthropogenic super-emitters detected by remote sensing (mainly oil and gas sector but also coal, agriculture, and landfills) to improve source partitioning.The data presented here can be downloaded from  https://doi.org/10.18160/GKQ9-2RHT (Martinez et al., 2024)."

Existing machine learning studies for ozone prediction rarely incorporate the spatiotemporal evolution of regional meteorological fields (STRMFs), limiting the explanatory power of meteorological drivers in ozone variability. Thus, a sequential convolutional long short-term memory network framework (CNN-LSTM) was designed to utilize the STRMFs for ozone prediction. Scenarios incorporating STRMFs across multiple spatiotemporal scales were constructed using Global Forecast System (GFS) data sets. Model performance was evaluated in terms of ozone concentration prediction accuracy (AOCP) and precision in forecasting high-ozone pollution events (PHOE) across key Chinese regions. Appropriate expansion of meteorological data spatiotemporal scale enhanced AOCP, with notable improvements in PHOE, demonstrating ozone variability’s dependence on multiscale meteorological processes. Leveraging meteorological data that better represent real atmospheric conditions improved AOCP. The CNN-LSTM framework explained over 85% of daily ozone variability through STRMF integration, successfully resolving how ozone concentration variations in key regions responded to typhoon positional shifts. This methodology enables timely pollution alerts while elucidating the critical role of regional meteorological processes in ozone pollution."

ARE is the dominant factor, promoting the formation of O3 and ·OH (increases by 36.7% and 106.3%), enhancing high‐altitude oxidation, and shifting parts of the VOC‐limited regimes to the NOx‐limited regimes (VOCs/NOx ratio decreases by 21.1%). Additionally, rapid NOx depletion with altitude leads to stronger NOx limitation aloft, amplifying ARE's effect on O3‐NOx‐VOC sensitivity (ratio decreases by 28.1%).

The single-pollutant model showed cognitive scores decrease with higher pollutant concentrations: PM1 (−0.53 points/0.1 µg/m3), PM2.5 (−0.30), PM10 (−0.14), organic matter (−1.44), ammonium (−1.55), sulfate (−1.70), and black carbon (−7.23).

 Biomass burning is a significant source of atmospheric pollution. While existing studies have largely focused on the comprehensive analysis of biomass burning particulate matter (PM), the variations in particle size, morphology, and mixing characteristics under different burning conditions remain to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we collected PM emitted from poplar wood burning in a quartz tube furnace at three different ignition temperatures (400, 600, and 800 °C), aiming to analyze the chemical composition and single-particle characteristics of PM under varying ignition temperatures. OC/EC analysis revealed that the OC emission factor at 400 °C (35.05 ± 2.11 g/kg) was an order of magnitude higher than those at 600 °C (1.00 ± 0.21 g/kg) and 800 °C (1.57 ± 0.93 g/kg), while the EC emission factor increased by an order of magnitude with rising temperature, from 0.41 ± 0.03 g/kg at 400 °C to 4.03 ± 0.94 g/kg at 800 °C. Further observation under TEM-EDS showed that carbonaceous particles were the predominant components of PM emitted from poplar wood burning at all temperatures. At 400 °C, over 95 % of the particles were primarily amorphous organic matter, with only a small number of EC particles formed. At 600 °C, 72.6 % of the emitted particles were aggregated black carbon particles, 17.5 % were tar-balls, and the remaining 9.9 % were monomeric organic matter particles with extremely small particle sizes. At 800 °C, 93.8 % of the particles were two types of black carbon particles with varying monomer particle sizes and nearly bare surfaces. Our experimental results indicate that burning temperature is a crucial factor leading to differences in the composition, morphology, and elemental composition of biomass-emitted particles. Furthermore, they serve as a reminder that the significant variations caused by different burning temperatures should be considered when estimating biomass burning, especially the increasingly widespread wildfire burning."

 Temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been increasing over the past 50 years, with the warming trend accelerating from +0.16 °C/decade between the mid-1980s and 1990s to +0.36 °C/decade from 2000 to 2022. However, the elevation-dependent warming (EDW) on the TP remains controversial, and the driving mechanisms are poorly understood. Utilizing the ERA5-Land dataset, we investigate EDW patterns across both the Endorheic and Exorheic basins on the TP, focusing on cloud cover characteristics and quantifying the influences of clouds at different levels on EDW through the Random Forest analysis. Our findings reveal distinct EDW patterns, with more pronounced warming occurring at night. Between 2000 and 2022, changes in cloud cover, particularly the increase in high cloud cover at night and middle cloud cover during the day, played a crucial role in modulating temperature trends. The effect of diurnal net cloud radiative forcing (CRF) from 1984 to 2022 is characterized by daytime heating in the western TP, cooling in the eastern TP, and uniform nighttime warming across the TP. The reduction in middle and high cloud cover from 1984 to 2000 was associated with overall warming, while from 2000 to 2022, albedo diminished from middle clouds and increased longwave radiation from high clouds contributed to continued warming, particularly at higher elevations. These findings highlight the role of CRF in amplifying EDW and emphasize the significance of cloud radiative processes in driving regional warming.

While volcanic ash (VA) has been shown to nucleate ice crystals efficiently in laboratory settings, its importance for ice formation in the atmosphere remains elusive. Here, we show evidence of cirrus modification by volcanic eruptions through ice nucleation on VA, revealed by abrupt changes in cirrus properties following volcanic eruptions based on satellite measurements. The distinct changes captured are a phenomenal decrease in number, an increase in size of ice crystals in cirrus clouds, and an increase in cirrus occurrences after ash-rich volcanic eruptions. Conversely, no such changes were detected following the ash-poor eruption. We propose a cirrus formation mechanism where VA nucleates ice heterogeneously, suppressing homogeneous freezing and resulting in fewer but larger ice crystals. This suppression of homogeneous freezing by VA is supported by process-level cloud microphysical simulations. Our findings advance the understanding of aerosol–ice cloud interactions and illuminate cirrus geoengineering."

This suggests that changes in mean rainfall are primarily controlled by the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of Earth’s main greenhouse gases: water vapor and carbon dioxide. Consistent with comprehensive general circulation models, our results explain why mean rainfall increases with surface warming at about 2% per kelvin, why this rate is largely unchanged over numerous doublings of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and why mean rainfall decreases in hothouse climates."

Given the use of such models in planning and forecasting for wildland fires, coupled with the adverse health and climate impacts of smoke, there is a need to understand the sensitivity to model inputs and processes, evaluate smoke production, and identify critical uncertainties. In this work, FOFEM was applied to a series of prescribed burns at the Blodgett Forest Research Station (BFRS), a western mixed coniferous forest in northern California, adapted to a frequent low-severity fire regime. We evaluated the sensitivity of predicted smoke emissions to parametric uncertainty in model inputs, including fuel characteristics (composition, loading, and moisture) and emission factors (EFs), and structural uncertainty in the consumption model. The results of the modeling simulations and comparison with a unique and comprehensive suite of fuel and emissions measurements suggest that in this application of FOFEM, fuel loadings based on land cover maps had the highest uncertainty and resulted in the largest sensitivity in predicted smoke emissions. The use of land-cover-based fuel loading values significantly underpredicted gas and particle emissions from the prescribed burns by up to ∼80% for carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and by up to ∼85% for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Improvement in the predicted smoke emissions could specifically be achieved by more accurate fuel loading data, particularly for duff and coarse wood, the consumption of which generated the majority of gas (∼50–70%) and particle (∼65%) emissions. For individual gaseous nonmethane organic compounds (NMOCs), predicted emissions were additionally sensitive to uncertainty in EFs, demonstrating that the accurate prediction of these NMOCs requires accurate representation of fuel consumption as well as representative EFs."

Previous studies have shown that, while chemistry‐climate models reproduce the negative ozone trend in the tropical lower stratosphere as a response to increased upwelling, they fail to capture the ozone decline in northern midlatitudes. This study revisits recent lower stratospheric ozone trends over the period 1998–2018 using two types of simulations from the new Chemistry Climate Model Initiative 2022 (CCMI‐2022): REF‐D1, with observed sea surface temperatures, and REF‐D2, with simulated ocean. The observed negative trend in midlatitudes falls within the range of model trends, especially when considering simulations with observed boundary conditions. There is a large spread in the simulated midlatitudes ozone trends, with some simulations showing positive and others negative trends. A multiple linear regression analysis shows that the spread in the trends is not explained by the different linear response to external forcings (solar cycle, global warming, and ozone‐depleting substances) or to the main variability modes (El Niño‐Southern Oscillation and the quasi‐biennial oscillation) but is instead attributed to internal atmospheric variability. Moreover, the fact that some models show very different trends across members, while other models show similar trends in all members, suggests fundamental differences in the representation of the internal variability of ozone transport across models. Indeed, we report substantial intermodel differences in the ozone‐transport connection on interannual timescales and we find that ozone trends are closely coupled to transport trends."

 Smoke from wildfires across North American high latitudes can travel long distances, degrading regional air quality. Hourly fire emissions are a crucial input of air quality models. However, they are unavailable for fires at high latitudes. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-R Series satellites detects fires across North America every 10 min at a nominal resolution of 2 km, offering a good opportunity to estimate hourly fire emissions. At high latitudes, the polar-orbiting Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor provides 375 m fire observations up to six times a day for the same locations. In this study, we estimated hourly fire emissions at high latitudes for the first time by blending the high-temporal resolution ABI fire radiative power (FRP) and fine-spatial resolution VIIRS FRP. First, we corrected the parallax issue in ABI active fire data by considering land surface elevation. Next, FRPs from ABI and VIIRS fire pixels were separately aggregated into 3 km grids, and ABI FRP was calibrated against VIIRS FRP to correct for underestimation at large view angles. Then, the calibrated ABI FRP and VIIRS FRP were fused to reconstruct FRP diurnal cycles with the help of FRP diurnal climatologies. Finally, hourly emissions for eleven species were estimated using the reconstructed FRP diurnal cycles for two years (2021 and 2022). The results suggest that fires emitted a total of ∼0.54 Tg and 0.4 Tg PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 μm) in 2021 and 2022, respectively, with over 86 % of emissions released from summertime boreal forest fires. Moreover, hourly emissions revealed a general diurnal pattern: emissions were limited in the early morning, peaked around 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM local time, and decreased in the evening. Notably, the diurnal pattern of emissions varied by region and season in timing of peak emission and emission magnitude. Furthermore, we evaluated hourly emissions estimates using carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over 29 fresh smoke plumes. Evaluation results show that the hourly ABI-VIIRS CO estimates were significantly correlated with the TROPOMI-based CO estimates (R2 = 0.94, P < 0.001) and both were generally comparable, with a difference of 17.5 %. The proposed algorithm in this study has been integrated into the near real-time hourly Regional ABI and VIIRS fire Emissions (RAVE) product and is expected to improve air quality forecasting."

Wright;Ke Li;Tao Geng;Qiurun Yu,Estimation of aerosol and cloud radiative heating rate in  the tropical stratosphere using a radiative kernel method,"The aerosol in the upper troposphere and stratosphere is highly variable, and its radiative effect is poorly understood. To estimate this effect, the radiative kernel is constructed and applied. The results show that the kernels can reproduce aerosol radiative effects and are expected to simulate stratospheric aerosol radiative effects. This approach reduces computational expense, is consistent with radiative model calculations, and can be applied to atmospheric models with speed requirements. 
 A layer of aerosols has been identified in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere above the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region, typically referred to as the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). This layer is fed by atmospheric pollutants over southern and eastern Asia lifted to the upper troposphere by deep convection in summer. The radiative effects of this aerosol layer change local temperature, influence thermodynamic stability, and modulate the efficiency of air mass vertical transport near the tropopause. However, quantitative understanding of these effects is still very poor. To estimate aerosol radiative effects in the upper troposphere and above, a set of radiative kernels is constructed for the tropical upper troposphere and stratosphere to reduce the computational expense of decomposing the different contributions of atmospheric components to anomalies in radiative fluxes. The prototype aerosol kernels in this work are among the first to target vertically resolved heating rates, motivated by the linearity and separability of scattering and absorbing aerosol effects in the ATAL. Observationally derived lower boundary conditions and satellite observations of cloud ice within the upper troposphere and stratosphere are included and simplified in our Tropical Upper Troposphere–Stratosphere Model (TUTSM). Separate sets of kernels are derived and tested for the effects of absorbing aerosols, scattering aerosols, and cloud ice particles on both shortwave (solar) and longwave (thermal) radiative fluxes and heating rates. The results indicate that the kernels can reproduce aerosol radiative effects in the ATAL well. Similarly, these aerosol kernels could be used to simulate radiative effects of biomass burning and volcanic eruption above the troposphere. This approach substantially reduces computational expense while achieving good consistency with direct radiative transfer model calculations, and it can be applied to models that do not require high precision but have strict requirements for computing speed and storage space."

Two extreme events preceded this anomaly: the Australian Black Summer fires and the 2019 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), raising the question of how these disruptions influenced Southern Hemisphere ozone. Here, we investigate the dynamical and chemical contributions to the ozone anomaly using a chemistry‐climate model and satellite observations. We find that downward transport of polar ozone‐enriched air due to the SSW later spread equatorward. Such transport together with photochemical ozone production from emissions of wildfires (fueled by dry and hot conditions previously attributed to the SSW) increased tropopause‐level ozone by up to 30 ppb, with transport as the dominant factor (around 80%). While chemical ozone production from wildfires is well‐recognized, our results highlight that SSWs can greatly influence mid‐latitude ozone through dynamical effects."

The concentrations of aromatic VOCs were lower than in winter (January 2014), whereas acetaldehyde and acetone levels were almost the same during both seasons. Higher isoprene (2.14 ± 0.66 ppb(v)) and monoterpenes (0.34 ± 0.13 ppb) concentrations in summer than in winter indicate enhanced biogenic emissions. Automotive emissions were the major sources of anthropogenic VOCs, with higher emission ratios of oxygenated and aromatic compounds for heavy‐duty and light‐duty vehicles, respectively. Daytime oxygenated VOC levels in summer were 2–3 times higher than in winter, indicating greater contributions from the secondary sources. The daytime relative contributions of acetone, acetaldehyde, and isoprene in summer increased by ∼35%–45% compared to winter. The OH‐reactivity of isoprene was highest among the measured VOCs, with much higher summer contributions than winter. Oxygenated VOCs contribute significantly to the ozone formation potential in both seasons, while biogenic VOCs only in summer. The box model results at different NOx‐VOC combinations, using observed and simulated VOC data, show that the reductions of VOC levels can effectively reduce the daytime ozone formation rates at higher NOx concentrations. The study reveals that with the reduction of anthropogenic VOC emissions, biogenic/secondary sources become increasingly important in atmospheric processes in tropical urban regions. Our analysis will be valuable in developing mitigation policies to control primary and secondary pollutants in urban areas in India."

In the southwestern plains passing cold fronts are the primary cause of dust; in the understudied northern plains, summertime patterns and southerly pre-frontal winds are most important in the west and east, respectively. These results are valuable to understanding and forecasting dust in this complex source region. 
 The North American Great Plains is a semi-arid and windy environment prone to dust events that produce a variety of hazards to public health, transportation, and land degradation.  Dust has substantial spatial variability across the plains, and the weather responsible for that dust is understudied in most of the plains, especially the northern and eastern plains.  Here we identify specific weather patterns associated with dust occurrence across the plains. We make use of an atmospheric classification that defines 21 weather patterns for the Great Plains that includes various stages of warm and cold frontal passages, northerlies, anticyclones, and summertime patterns not associated with mid-latitude cyclones.  We use the time series of weather pattern to composite satellite and station daily dust observations from 2012–2021. We calculate average dust occurrence for each weather pattern, calculate the contribution of each pattern to local dust loads, and identify the specific weather patterns most important to each location and subregion.  We find no single weather pattern is responsible for dust occurrence in the plains but that different patterns are responsible for dust in different subregions of the Great Plains.  Passing cold fronts are most responsible for dust events in West Texas and New Mexico, southerlies are responsible for those in the northeastern plains of Iowa and the Dakotas, and summer weather patterns produce the majority of dust in the High Plains from Colorado to Canada.  Identifying the dust-producing weather patterns of particular subregions is a valuable step toward understanding dust variability and improving dust predictions, both present and future."

It identifies 25 sources, including agriculture, wetlands, and fossil fuels, enhancing India’s global data representation. Emissions peak in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and coastal states, highlighting mitigation priorities. Urban emissions are lower, suggesting underestimation. This dataset helps policymakers design targeted reduction strategies, supporting India’s climate goals and global efforts. 
 Methane (CH4) is a predominant climate-forcing agent and has become a focal point of global climate discussions, owing to its significant contribution to atmospheric warming. The ambiguity surrounding the relative contributions of various natural and anthropogenic sources, coupled with associated uncertainties, poses significant challenges to assessing methane emissions in developing nations like India. To address these challenges and better understand the methane-emitting sources, this study presents a comprehensive high-resolution gridded (0.1°×0.1°) inventory of CH4 emission by including 25 distinct anthropogenic and natural sources in India for 2023 by adopting the IPCC bottom-up approach. The estimated CH4 over India is 37.79 Tg/yr, which will redefine the contribution of various sources. The agriculture sector contributed ~50 % followed by wetlands (8.6 %), fossil fuel and waste management. This study reports the first-ever comprehensive emissions from natural sources like wetlands and termites. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and coastal states show elevated emissions with Uttar Pradesh contributing the highest (10.8 %) followed by Gujarat (9.4%), and Maharashtra (8.6 %). However, surprisingly cities exhibit lower CH4 as compared to other semi-urban/rural regions. This developed dataset can be a valuable input to optimize the climate study by filling the data gap, enabling policymakers to formulate various mitigation measures.

Here, we utilized two Chinese cohorts with repeated follow-up visits to address this knowledge gap and explored the underlying DNA methylation mechanisms. We first conducted a multistate modeling analysis in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS), a nationwide cohort with 21,654 older adults who had participated in at least two survey waves. An interquartile range reduction in PM2.5 exposure increased the likelihood of improvement for frail/prefrail individuals by more than 50% while lowering their risks of worsening frailty or mortality. A quasi-experimental study within a CLHLS subcohort of 1816 adults, leveraging the implementation of China’s Clean Air Act, further validated these findings. Additionally, in the Guangxi Eco-Environmental Health and Aging Study─a regional prospective cohort based in Guilin, China─we included 235 older adults with follow-up data and identified three frailty-related CpG sites that were associated with PM2.5 exposure. The CpG site cg25453797 mapped to the PRKCE gene was robustly associated with the change in frailty. These findings demonstrate that air quality improvement benefits older adults by alleviating the frailty burden. DNA methylation may serve as a potential biomarker to capture the health benefits of environmental policy interventions."

However, the predictive capability to capture the impact on solar electricity production still needs to be improved. For example, in the summer of 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfires spread to the northeastern U.S., impacting solar PV output in the region. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) day-ahead forecasts for this period significantly overpredicted PV output. This paper presents novel machine learning-based models for predicting the hourly solar capacity factor, focusing on improving predictive performance during periods of severe wildfire smoke. The results demonstrate a R2 value of up to 0.85 for the severe wildfire periods (aerosol optical depth (AOD) above the 99.99th percentile) from our models, significantly outperforming NYISO’s R2 value of 0.50 across six load zones included in the analysis. The greatly enhanced performance arises from two innovations. First, we adopted a series of data products, newly available in the public domain, from the high-resolution rapid refresh smoke (HRRR-Smoke) weather forecasting system. These include predictions of the AOD and the downward shortwave radiation flux incorporating aerosol impacts. Our study marks the first time the HRRR-Smoke wildfire AOD product has been used in solar electricity forecasts. Second, we employed upsampling strategies to address the data imbalance issues due to the inherently infrequent nature of wildfire events. As the data products are publicly available, our methodology can be readily adopted by power system operators to enhance predictions of solar electricity production during periods of wildfire smoke, ensuring the reliability of power grids with high penetration of solar energy."

Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble Community Project, we investigate the impact of BB variability on the tropical climate response. High BB variability leads to increased precipitation and a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the central Pacific (CP) and western Pacific (WP), but reduces precipitation and causes a northward ITCZ shift in the eastern Pacific (EP) and the Atlantic Ocean (AO). This ITCZ displacement is associated with the north–south tilt of the Walker circulation. High variability increases cloud cover over the CP and WP, which induces negative outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere. Lower OLR values cause cross-equatorial heat transport and lead to a southward ITCZ shift. Conversely, cloud thinning corresponds to higher OLR values and a northward ITCZ shift in the EP and AO.

It quantifies the absorption and scattering properties of gases in radiation, highlighting the crucial balance between accuracy and efficiency that affects model performance. The proposed scheme builds on the alternate mapping correlated K‐distribution method. A more efficient algorithm is implemented, which reduces the need for manual intervention in determining the number of subintervals required for pseudo‐monochromatic calculations in the gaseous transmittance scheme. We propose a variant alternate mapping method, that restores the monotonicity of Rayleigh scattering in the cumulative probability space after extracting strong absorption wavenumbers. This modification improves the accuracy of the simulated upward radiation flux in visible bands. Additionally, by incorporating a wider range of atmospheric profiles into the optimization of the gas‐optics look‐up table, our scheme demonstrates improved generalization capability. Moreover, we offer a clear physical interpretation of the optimization process. Evaluations using realistic profiles from the Correlated K‐Distribution Model Inter‐Comparison Project demonstrate that our shortwave gaseous transmittance scheme, which requires only 80 pseudo‐monochromatic spectral points, offers significant advantages in calculating radiation flux and heating rates across various scenarios."

 Atmospheric aerosol nucleation is an extremely complex chemical process that produces aerosols directly from gas phase species, impacting air quality, human health, and climate. Current understanding of urban aerosol nucleation processes is based on the findings made mostly in Chinese mega-cities, but it is not clear the proposed sulfuric acid-amine nucleation process can be applied to all urban sites worldwide. Here, we conducted comprehensive measurements of nucleation precursors in Houston, the 4th most populated and polluted urban site in the United States. Our observations and box model simulations show that rapid aerosol nucleation and growth can be explained by the measured sulfuric acid, base, and low-volatility organics formed from oxidation of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds. Given rapid global urbanization and increasing emissions of emerging chemical pollutants in the United States and Europe, this multicomponent nucleation process will be crucial for mitigating air pollution in the evolving urban climate.

 Although tree restoration, including reforestation and afforestation, can enhance carbon sequestration and help mitigate climate change, this negative forcing can be strengthened or weakened through non-carbon cycle biogeophysical factors, including atmospheric chemistry. Here, we conduct climate modeling experiments with and without atmospheric chemistry driven by a high-end tree restoration scenario. Under both frameworks, the biogeophysical effects drive global mean warming due to surface darkening. This warming is muted in the Southern Hemisphere due to enhanced evapotranspiration. Furthermore, there is less warming—especially in the Southern Hemisphere—under interactive atmospheric chemistry, largely due to enhanced organic aerosol and cloud effects. Biogeophysical effects mute 45% of the biogeochemical cooling associated with enhanced land carbon storage, which decreases to 24% with atmospheric chemistry (including methane). Thus, higher climate change mitigation potential of tree restoration results from atmospheric chemistry effects, which are not usually considered.

 Aerosols significantly influence high cloud microphysical properties, playing a crucial role in Earth's radiation budget. This study introduces an innovative analytical framework that integrates multi-meteorological constraints through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with derivative expansion to disentangle aerosol and ice water content (IWP) effects on high cloud properties. Analyzing satellite and reanalysis datasets (2014–2020), we investigate aerosol-cloud interactions at two mid-latitude continental sites with distinct aerosol compositions: the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) and the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory. By combining multiple meteorological factors into a single indicator, our approach enables an effective quantification of aerosol impacts. We find that aerosols enhance IWP at both sites, with SGP showing markedly higher susceptibility (1.22) than SACOL (0.89). Initial unconstrained analysis of ice particle radius (IPR) revealed opposing trends: decreasing with aerosols at SACOL but increasing at SGP. Through partial correlation analysis, we identified IWP as a key modulator of the IPR-aerosol relationship. After constraining both meteorological and IWP conditions, the increased aerosol concentrations consistently reduce IPR at both sites, resolving the apparent contradiction. Further investigation revealed distinct nucleation mechanisms: sulfate aerosols may dominate homogeneous nucleation, producing numerous smaller ice particles, while dust aerosols facilitate heterogeneous nucleation, forming fewer but larger ice particles when sufficient water vapor is present. These findings advance our understanding of regional variations in aerosol-cloud interactions and provide essential insights for improving cloud microphysics parameterization in climate models."

Northern China contributes a large proportion of CH4 emissions, yet large observation gaps exist. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset, which is publicly available, that includes ground-based, satellite-based, inventory, and modeling results to show the CH4 concentrations, enhancements, and spatial–temporal variations. The data can benefit the research community and policy-makers for future observations, atmospheric inversions, and policy-making. 
 Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 28–36-fold higher than that of CO2 at the 100-year scale. Northern China notably contributes to CH4 emissions. However, high uncertainties remain in emissions, and observation gaps exist in this region, especially in urban areas. Here, we compiled a comprehensive dataset (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10957950) (Han et al., 2024b), including ground- and satellite-based observations, inventory data, and modeling results, to study the CH4 concentration, enhancement, and spatiotemporal variation in this area. High-precision in situ observations from Beijing and Xianghe revealed that obvious seasonal cycles and notable enhancements (500–1500 ppb) occurred at a regional background site (Shangdianzi). We found significant increasing trends in the CH4 concentration over time in both the ground- and satellite-based observations and positive correlations between these observations. Anthropogenic emissions largely contributed to surface concentration variations and their increases in middle and southern Shanxi Province and Hebei Province. The posterior concentrations generally agreed well with the surface in situ observations (mean biases ranging from −2.3 to 80.7 ppb), and the RMSE ranges from 110 to 185 ppb, which is in the range from 5 % to 10 % of the XCH4. Moreover, a generally spatially consistent pattern was observed between the results of posterior results and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) column CH4 observations in four seasons. The posterior surface CH4 concentrations (with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625°) revealed that southern Shanxi, northern Henan, and Beijing exhibited relatively high levels (an increase of ∼ 300 ppb), which were positively correlated with the PKU-CH4 v2 emission inventory data. The inversion results using TROPOMI observations was 24.0 Tg, a decrease of 15.6 %, or 4.4 Tg, compared with the prior EDGARv4.3.2 (28.5 Tg). This study provides a comprehensive dataset of CH4 concentrations and enhancements in high-emission areas, which can benefit at the level of the research community and policy-makers in designing future observations, conducting atmospheric inversions, and formulating policies and at the city level, where high-spatial-resolution atmospheric inversions are highly needed at the kilometer scale."

While the magnitude, spatial distribution, and trend of the estimated CH4 emissions align with some previous studies, our results reveal an unexpected seasonal cycle in CH4 emissions from the oil and gas sector, where wintertime emissions are about 40 (20–50, 2σ) % higher than summertime. This seasonality is supported by methane and propane measurements at these same sites, as well as methane isotope measurements made from an independent aircraft campaign over the U.S. Although the exact cause of this emission seasonality is unclear, its spatial distribution indicates that the enhanced CH4 emissions are primarily from natural gas production regions, and to a lesser extent, from natural gas consumption in winter."

Our results reveal that HPE frequency increased significantly globally. HPE PM2.5 intensity in the Global North continuously increased, overpassing the Global South after 2010, indicating a recurred risk of air pollution under climate change in the Global North after several years of emission control endeavors. Globally, we estimated approximately 694,440 (95% CI: 687,996–715,311) total mortalities associated with acute PM2.5 exposure during HPEs from 1990 to 2019, with the Global South accounting for around 80% of these deaths.

 Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is a critical meteorological variable, and obtaining its precise spatiotemporal distribution is essential for numerous scientific domains beyond meteorology and hydrology. Despite the promising advancements in Ta mapping using machine learning, these models often suffer from inadequate generalization capabilities due to their heavy reliance on data. A critical limitation is that their “free” learning style fails to deeply uncover the intricate spatiotemporal patterns of Ta. Addressing this problem, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented deep fusion method (KADF), designed to enhance the accuracy of Ta mapping through integrating prior knowledge. KADF integrates three categories of prior knowledge concerning Ta: spatial autocorrelation, temporal autocorrelation, and temporal heterogeneity in the relationship between Ta and predictive variables. This tailored strategy enables the model to more efficiently explore the intricate spatiotemporal relationships between grounded Ta observations and satellite-derived auxiliary variables, culminating in accurate Ta estimates through the deep fusion of these datasets. The efficacy of KADF was thoroughly evaluated over Chinese mainland. The validation results show that KADF accurately mapped the spatiotemporal distribution of daily Ta, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 1.0 °C for mean Ta (Tmean), 1.22 °C for maximum Ta (Tmax), and 1.33 °C for minimum Ta (Tmin). Moreover, the integration of prior knowledge regarding Ta significantly enhanced the generalizability of the data-driven mapping model. Compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning-based estimation method, KADF reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) values by 23–31 % and RMSEs by 24–29 %. Furthermore, this method considerably improved the ability to capture spatial and temporal variations in Ta across various environmental conditions. Finally, a 1 km daily Ta dataset for the time frame spanning from 2010 to 2018 was produced. Overall, KADF holds great promise for accurately estimating Ta and can be easily adapted to other regions. The source code of KADF has been made publicly available at https://github.com/Henu-frch/KADF."

This leads to the diurnal variation in the convection-producing anvil clouds, which in turn can influence the radiative energy budget. 
 The behavior of convection producing anvil clouds is neither well derived from current available observations nor well represented in models. In this work, a novel convective cloud data product is designed to capture the convective anvil outflow. Convective organizations and life stages are derived from the images of infrared brightness temperature (BT) of geostationary (GEO) satellites based on a variable-BT segment-tracking algorithm, which allows the possibility for quantifying the convective anvil outflow. Vertical structures of convection are measured by sensors of the A-Train constellation, which provides the cross section of convective outflow. Here, GEO-based convective tracking and A-Train-detected cloud vertical profiles are combined to develop a novel comprehensive GEO–A-Train Merged (GATM) convective cloud data product for investigating the process of convective anvil outflow.On the basis of this novel Lagrangian-view GATM data, the anvil production for mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) can be quantified. The results show that daytime MCSs can produce more anvil clouds than nighttime MCSs. During the daytime, shortwave radiative heating strongly destabilizes the MCS top to promote the anvil outflow with strong divergence, whereas the nighttime divergence driven by the longwave radiative cooling through radiative destabilization and circulation is weak. Moreover, the assessed sensitivity of the radiative budget to the diurnal-cycle phase shift of the convective anvil outflow is approximately −1 W m−2 h−1 when the phase shift is in the range between −4 and 8 h (otherwise the sensitivity has the same magnitude but positive). Stronger diurnal-cycle amplitude can further amplify this sensitivity. Overall, this work presents the observed anvil–radiation diurnal interaction process: radiative heating determines the diurnal variation of anvil outflow; in turn, the diurnal variation of anvil outflow determines the Earth's radiative budget."

This article helps fill the current lack of commercially available options for aerial VOC sampling and serves to support and encourage researchers to build and develop custom samplers. 
 Situated at a land–sea interface, Houston, Texas, is a national hub for the petrochemical industry and has the second-fastest-growing metropolitan population in the United States. Addressing air quality in this region is uniquely challenging, due in part to its wide range of meteorological conditions (e.g., convection systems and temperature inversions) and continuum of volatile organic compound (VOC) and aerosol sources (e.g., anthropogenic and biogenic). As a result, Houston was chosen as the location for the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)-program-led Tracking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment (TRACER), which investigated cloud and aerosol interactions in the deep convection over the area. Deployed as a key asset, ARM's tethered balloon system (TBS) was used to investigate questions related to the vertical distributions of aerosols and their formation, including their precursor species volatile organic compounds. Platforms like TBSs and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can bridge the vertical gap between ground-based and crewed airplane measurement platforms to focus on near-surface characterization. However, there has been limited effort to modularize and integrate VOC samplers into instrument payloads on both aerial systems. In this study, lightweight and robust VOC samplers were designed and deployed on the TBS and a UAV to collect VOCs in flight. The modular design allowed for scalable adjustments to meet the unique platform requirements and enabled multiple flights per sampling day. Each sampler can autonomously collect VOCs on up to four sorbent tubes for subsequent thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. The low sampler mass (2.2 kg and 800 g, TBS and UAV, respectively) enables the combination of these VOC samplers with trace gas, aerosol, and meteorological sensors on aerial platforms. These profiles allow us to assess temporal changes in VOC magnitude and composition at multiple locations. Observations from TBS and UAV flights during TRACER are presented and future considerations for sampler design and deployments are discussed."

In the highly populated and heavily polluted South Asian region, the wintertime modeled atmospheric abundance of BC has remained underestimated relative to surface observations. We hypothesize this is linked to underestimated (i) atmospheric lifetime (τBC) and/or (ii) regional emission fluxes of BC. To address this hypothesis, we developed a novel inversion framework combining multiwinter (2018–2020) hourly resolved BC and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements from a wide footprint site in the North Indian Ocean, intercepting wintertime South Asian outflow. The average ΔBC/ΔCO ratio in this continental outflow of 14 ± 5 ng m–3 ppb–1 was 2–3 times higher than in East Asian outflow and shows a profound regional wintertime presence of BC. The empirically derived τBC of 8 ± 0.5 days was higher than global-mean τBC of 5.5 days employed in climate models and suggests greater regional longevity of wintertime BC. The ΔBC/ΔCO inversion-estimated ‘top-down’ BC emission flux of ∼200 Gg/month was in fact higher by a factor of ∼1.5 than wintertime monthly BC emission flux from scaled ‘bottom-up’ emission inventory (∼125 Gg/month). Taken together, assimilating higher BC emissions with greater longevity seems promising to reconcile the model-observation offset of wintertime BC abundance for South Asia."

 In April 2024, the United Arab Emirates experienced unprecedented rainfall, triggering severe flooding and widespread disruption. Here we investigate the driving mechanisms, localized impacts, and potential influence of human-driven climate change on this extraordinary event. Our findings strongly suggest that anthropogenic climate change is amplifying the frequency of extreme events like that of 16 April 2024. The event was primarily fueled by the interaction of a potential vorticity streamer with an active Red Sea Trough, a powerful upper-level jet, and the advection of warm, moisture-laden air from a warmer Arabian Sea. High-resolution satellite data reveal a clear link between urbanization, population density, and the severity of flood impacts in major cities, alongside a remarkable greening of the desert that lingered into the summer months."

 Despite the global ban on leaded gasoline, environmental lead pollution remains a concern, especially in developing countries. Asia, and particularly China, has emerged as a major emission center, yet long-term records of atmospheric lead emission are scarce and often inconsistent. Here we reconstruct a 60-year history of lead concentration (lead/calcium) and isotopic composition in a coral from Dongsha Atoll in the northern South China Sea. The record shows a fourfold increase in lead level from 1953 to the mid-2000s, followed by a ~60% decline over the next decade. Shifts in lead isotopic composition suggest a transition from local automotive emissions to more distant industrial emissions, primarily from coal combustion in mainland China after 2000. This industrial source has declined significantly after the mid-2000s in response to stricter air pollution controls. Our findings highlight both the lasting legacy of leaded gasoline and the effectiveness of recent environmental policies in reducing atmospheric lead exposure.

We unravel the evolution of real-time mixing states and the aging timescale of size-resolved particles based on field measurements in urban Beijing. This study provides an observational basis for accurately parameterizing the aging timescale of aerosol particles in climate models. 
 The mixing states and aging timescale of aerosol particles play a vital role in evaluating their climate effects. Here, by using field measurements at a site in urban Beijing, we have identified four different real-time mixing patterns of size-resolved particles, which are defined as less hygroscopic (LH) internally mixed, externally mixed, transitional externally mixed and more hygroscopic (MH) internally mixed particles, with atmospheric fractions of 0 %–10 %, 20 %–46 %, 17 %–24 % and 27 %–56 %, respectively. The fraction depends on particle size, with the maximum fraction of MH internally mixed particles at 80 and 110 nm and the minimum fraction of LH internally mixed particles across all sizes, implying rapid mixing and aging of ambient particles during the observational period. The diurnal variations of the mixing states of particles in all sizes investigated (40, 80, 110, 150 and 200 nm) present an apparent aging process from externally mixed to MH internally mixed, which typically spans a duration of approximately 5–10 h from 08:00–10:00 to 15:00–17:00 local time (LT), revealing the mixing (aging) timescale of aerosols in a polluted urban atmosphere. Additionally, our results suggest that those fine aerosol particles experience aging through both the photochemical process and non-photochemical growth during the campaign. Furthermore, through a comprehensive review of the mixing–aging timescale of particles adopted in current models and derived from observations, we show a great discrepancy between observations and models, highlighting the importance of parameterizing their aging timescale based on more field campaigns."

We provide meteorological and cloud transition stage context, allowing us to identify days that are most suitable for Lagrangian modeling and analysis. Surveyed cloud properties show signatures of cloud microphysical processes, such as cloud-top entrainment and secondary ice formation. 
 Postfrontal clouds, often appearing as marine cold-air outbreaks (MCAOs) along eastern seaboards, undergo overcast-to-broken cloud regime transitions. Earth system models exhibit diverse radiative biases connected to postfrontal clouds, rendering these marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds a major source of uncertainty in projected global-mean temperature. The recent NASA multi-year campaign Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) therefore dedicated most of its resources to sampling postfrontal MCAOs, deploying 71 flights from 2020 through 2022. We provide an overview of (1) the synoptic context within the parent extratropical cyclone, (2) the meteorological conditions with respect to the season, (3) the suitability of case data and measurements for Lagrangian analysis and modeling studies, and (4) the encountered cloud properties. A proposed subset of flights deemed most suitable for Lagrangian modeling case studies is highlighted throughout. Such flights typically cover a greater fetch range, were better aligned with the MBL wind direction, and revisited sampled air masses when key instruments were operational. Like many other flights, these flights often probed cloud formation and some cloud regime transitions. Surveying cloud properties from remote sensing and in situ probes, we find a great range in cloud-top heights and a relatively large concentration of frozen hydrometeors, which suggest strong free tropospheric entrainment and secondary ice formation, respectively. Both processes are expected to leave marked signatures in cloud evolution, such as strongly ranging cloud droplet number  concentrations. ACTIVATE data combined with satellite retrievals can establish observational constraints for future model improvement work."

Jenkins;William H. Brune,Spatially separate production of hydrogen oxides and nitric oxide in lightning,"Both the atmosphere's primary cleaner, the hydroxyl radical, and nitric oxide are generated in extreme amounts by lightning, and laboratory and modeling experiments demonstrate that these molecules are generated in different places in lightning flashes. Thus the hydroxyl radical is not immediately consumed by the nitric oxide and instead is available to remove other pollutants in the atmosphere. Additionally, substantial nitrous acid is also likely generated by lightning. 
 The atmosphere's most important oxidizer, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is generated in abundance by lightning, but the contribution of this electrically generated OH (LOH) to global OH oxidation needs to be better quantified. Part of the uncertainty in this contribution is due to the abundant nitric oxide (NO) also generated in lightning, which rapidly removes the LOH before it can oxidize other pollutants in the atmosphere. However, atmospheric observations and a previous laboratory study show extreme LOH coexists with extreme NO. The only way this electrically generated HOx (LHOx) can possibly survive is if LOH production is spatially separated from the NO production in lightning flashes and laboratory sparks. This hypothesis of spatially separate OH and NO production is further tested here in a series of laboratory experiments, where the OH decays were measured from spark discharges in air which had increasing amounts of NO added to it. The LOH decayed faster as more NO was added to the air, indicating that the LOH was reacting with the added NO and not the spark NO. Thus, LOH from lightning flashes is not immediately consumed by the electrically generated NO but is available to oxidize other pollutants in the atmosphere and contribute to global OH oxidation. Subsequent modeling of the laboratory data also supports the spatially separate production of LOH and NO and further suggests that substantial HONO may also be produced by sparks and lightning in the atmosphere."

Both satellite observations and bottom-up estimates identify significant NH3 emission hotspots in China. However, bottom-up NH3 emission inventories are highly uncertain due to the lack of localized emission factors, while large and uncertain errors in IASI satellite NH3 columns have hindered their direct application in top-down emission inversion methods. In this study, we perform a top-down optimization of monthly NH3 emissions over China using IASI-derived surface NH3 concentrations with well-evaluated error estimates, combined with the CAMx model at a 36 km resolution. Our posterior NH3 emissions for 2020 (12.3 [10.9–13.6] Tg N yr–1) are significantly higher than prior estimates from the MEIC inventory (7.6 Tg N yr–1), which primarily underestimates emissions during the warm months in hotspot areas (e.g., NCP and MLYR). We employ multiple approaches to comprehensively evaluate our inversion results. Our study highlights that error estimates for low-value observations are a particularly critical factor in the inversion setup, significantly influencing the reliability of emission optimization."

In this study, we precisely extracted ionospheric Lamb waves originating from the epicenter of the 15 January 2022 Tonga eruption, propagating upward in a conical structure. This was achieved by using line‐of‐sight observations from the BeiDou geostationary satellites, which eliminated the spatiotemporal ambiguity introduced by the relative motion of Global Positioning System satellites, enabling the clear extraction of the Lamb signal in the ionosphere. The observed L0 mode speed (∼323 m/s) and period (∼30 min) were consistent with those of the tropospheric Lamb wave. It suggested that the ionospheric Lamb wave is likely driven by the surface Lamb wave, leading to a conical wave‐front that extends in altitude. This study highlights the significant role of Lamb waves in transmitting energy from epicenters through Earth's atmosphere and plasma systems."

 The impact of biogenic emissions on ozone (O3) has significant implications for air quality management. We analyze biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions resulting from urban greening in three major Chinese cities, and impacts on tropospheric ozone. Urban greening BVOCs contributed 1.9 ppb (2.5%), 1.9 ppb (3.3%), and 3.6 ppb (5.9%) to O3 formation in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, respectively. Temperature-driven enhancement in urban BVOCs produces significantly enhanced O3 on hot days. Guangzhou shows the highest summer temperatures, and the impact of the BVOC isoprene on O3 is more significant. The urban BVOC contribution to O3 is concentrated downwind of each city, due to transport processes. Estimated O3-related mortality in the cities was 900–2000 people during summertime, with 6–14% of the O3-related deaths attributable to urban BVOC emissions. The potential contribution of urban isoprene-emitting vegetation to air quality should be considered alongside the potential benefits of urban greening in future policy-making decisions."

 Due to the complicated characteristics of secondary aerosols (SAs), their study requires research into their formation and oxidation processes under diverse atmospheric conditions and reactions. Moreover, the increasing atmospheric pollution in Korea has been attributed to factors such as long-range transport of pollutants from China and emissions from domestic sources like cities, power plants, and industrial complexes. In this study, an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) was utilized to assess the chemical characteristics of potential SAs in Korea's background atmosphere. Sampling was conducted from 2019 to 2021 on Baengnyeong Island (37.967° N, 124.630° E), located west of the Korean Peninsula and approximately 180 km from China's Shandong Peninsula. The OFR, coupled with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and various gas monitors (SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, CO, NH3, and O3), facilitated the analysis of the chemical composition of potential SAs. Additionally, to analyze long-range transport from Baengnyeong Island to Seoul, data on SAs and gaseous pollutants from the island were compared with those from Seoul. Results indicate that the potential SAs generated by the OFR were influenced by ozone (O3) and relative humidity (RH) levels. The concentration of these potential SAs increased with aging time and varied depending on O3 and RH levels. During spring, elevated PM1 concentrations in Seoul were noted, driven by additional SAs from photochemical reactions in inland regions. In contrast, during winter, the formation of certain SAs was predominantly due to long-range transport or the accumulation of domestic pollutants in the atmosphere."

 Northeastern British Columbia is a rural and remote region in Western Canada that is experiencing rapid growth in unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) and increasingly severe wildfire impacts. Air quality is a concern for the communities in the region, but there is very limited air pollution monitoring. To address this gap, this study explores the application of machine learning to the satellite-based estimates of aerosols and meteorology from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) to estimate daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at a spatial and temporal resolution relevant for ongoing health studies. The random forest model was trained and validated on the ground-level air quality monitoring network from 2013 to 2022 and then used to predict and backcast daily concentrations in the study area at a 50-km resolution from 2005 to 2022. The predictions were then compared to global and provincial health guidelines and analyzed for annual trends. Our model achieved a 10-fold cross validation root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 of 3.89 μg/m3 and 0.77, and test scores of 3.02 μg/m3 and 0.78. Between 2006 and 2021, the number of days exceeding PM2.5 guidelines increased by 122 %, and the person-days exceeding the guideline increased by 166 %. At our spatial resolution, we find that wildfire is a more important variable in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations compared to UOGD.

 Due to the scarcity of measured precipitation data in arid zones and the numerous factors affecting the uncertainty of precipitation data from multiple sources, understanding precipitation patterns is limited, and drought monitoring is constrained. Whereas water vapor content is closely related to precipitation, changes in water vapor can be an important indicator of drought development. Therefore, this paper takes Xinjiang as the study area, introduces precipitable water vapor, and constructs two new drought indices, the standardized and nonparametric standardized precipitable water indices (SPWI and NSPWI), using parametric and nonparametric kernel density estimation methods. Aiming at the drought characteristics of long duration and intensity in the study area, an identification method for long-duration and high-severity drought (LHD) events was proposed using the three-dimensional clustering method and the Copula function. The three-dimensional evolution characteristics and centroid migration patterns of LHD events were then analyzed.The results indicate that: (1) The newly constructed drought index can be used for drought monitoring in Xinjiang, and the performance of SPWI is better than that of NSPWI. (2) Based on the three-dimensional clustering method, which can better identify the drought events in the study region, it was found that the droughts were mostly concentrated in 1960–1987, and there was a trend from dry to wet. (3) The LHD events were identified based on the joint distribution probability of drought duration and severity greater than 75 %, and it was found that droughts originated in the southern and died out in the western part of the study region, that droughts were likely to be more frequent the deeper inland and farther away from the ocean, and that droughts lasted for longer periods and had a wider impact area; mountainous areas are more profoundly affected by the LHD events than plains and deserts areas. (4) LHD events have a wider centroid migration distance, and their drought development process is more complex, with spatial and temporal distributions. The drought index that introduces precipitable water vapor and the LHD event identification method proposed in this study can provide some guidance for the enhancement of drought prevention and mitigation capabilities in arid regions."

Their price, size, and power consumption are lower than those of traditional OPCs. We tested the ability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alphasense to estimate dust emission flux during erosion events in Jordan. N3 estimated the dust flux well, with differences of less than 30 % compared to a traditional OPC. Our results confirm the potential of low-cost OPCs for dust erosion research. 
 The recent development of low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs) presents new opportunities for improving spatial coverage of particle concentration in the atmosphere as they are more affordable, compact, and energy efficient than traditional OPCs. In particular, these OPCs could improve our ability to quantify dust emissions in complex environments during aeolian soil erosion. The high-frequency sampling capacity (1 Hz) of some sensors may make them suitable for estimating dust emissions using the eddy-covariance method. Here, the capability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alphasense to estimate size-resolved dust flux using the eddy-covariance method is evaluated. During the Jordan Wind erosion And Dust Investigation (J-WADI) experiment, we tested one OPC-N3 against two traditional reference OPCs, the Promo and Fidas,  from Palas GmbH. The N3 and Promo OPCs were located in close proximity to a sonic anemometer, enabling the correlation of dust concentration and vertical velocity fluctuations for estimating dust fluxes. Despite the high-temperature and dusty wind conditions of the campaign, the N3 monitored the dynamics and magnitude of dust concentration with reasonable precision. The turbulence characteristics of the dust concentration fluctuations measured by the N3, including variance, skewness, kurtosis, and energy spectrum, were similar to those from the Promo. However, the N3 flow rate exhibited variations under these outdoor conditions that affected the concentration of fine dust particles, and certain particles around 1 µm appeared to be misclassified in the upper size bin. After correcting the N3 dust concentration to address these discrepancies and after calibrating it against a reference OPC, the N3 accurately estimated the dust emission flux, with differences of less than 30 % compared to the reference OPC. Our results confirm the potential of low-cost OPCs for dust erosion research. Nonetheless, further evaluation of low-cost OPCs is still needed across different environments and weather conditions."

 This paper presents an extensive investigation of the signal fringe profile for the Fizeau interferometer used in the first spaceborne wind lidar Aeolus and considers the fundamental implications for the wind measurement accuracy in Aeolus and future systems. The early Aeolus design phase considered that the basic fringe would be made up of a Fizeau instrumental component of ≈100 MHz (full width at half maximum, FWHM), folded with the laser pulse spectral width of ≈50 MHz (FWHM), both of Lorentzian form. Fringe anomalies observed before the mission and related to surface defects in the interferometer plates triggered the development of wave-optic methods for analysis of the fringe formation. These methods, herein described in an instructional appendix, were subsequently found to be essential for rigorous modelling of complex fringes for different physical and optical arrangements. Initial signal returns from Aeolus suggested that the Fizeau fringe profile was in fact broadened with a large Gaussian component. The laser pulse was subsequently shown to have a profile close to Gaussian of ≈45 MHz (FWHM) and thus provided a partial contribution. However, detailed examination of experimental Aeolus fringes constructed from ground return signals showed a large Gaussian component up to ≈130 MHz (FWHM). Wave-optic modelling established that Fizeau “aperture broadening”, of this form and magnitude, would be generated for the input signal beam of 500 µrad field of view (FOV) set at a large angle of incidence (AOI) of 300 µrad. These findings have strong implications for fringe shift and wind measurement accuracy, as given in the quantum-limited Cramér–Rao expression and the paramount importance of minimizing line width. Extensive modelling and simulation for the broadened profiles calculated above shows good agreement with measured Aeolus global wind measurement accuracies and indicates that loss of signal could be due to beam clipping at the field stop for such a large AOI. It is established that optimization of the present Aeolus Fizeau parameters could lead to a factor of 2.5 improvement in wind measurement precision. Future upgrades of the Fizeau interferometer and the laser within reasonable parameters suggest the potential for an factor of 7.6 improvement on the in-orbit performance."

This study leverages a unique set of in situ aircraft observations from the NASA Convective Processes – Aerosols and Winds (CPEX‐AW) field campaign and a high‐resolution, fully coupled atmosphere‐wave‐ocean model simulation to examine the complexity of compound dry‐dusty air intrusions during the genesis of Tropical Storm (TS) Kate (2021). The suite of CPEX‐AW observations, featuring a multifrequency lidar, a precipitation radar and GPS dropsondes, provides a unique perspective of the interplay between multiple air masses in the environment surrounding TS Kate. We complement CPEX‐AW observations with atmospheric tracers from the high‐resolution coupled‐model simulation to better understand the origins and transport of these air masses and their impacts on TS Kate. Two distinct intrusions are observed: one within the precursor easterly wave and one during the Tropical Depression (TD) stage. Within the precursor wave, low‐θe ${\theta }_{e}$ marine air associated with subsidence within the subtropical high undercuts the SAL as both air masses are entrained along two pathways: (a) lateral entrainment following the wave‐relative inflow and (b) vertical entrainment downward into the boundary layer and subsequently upward within deep convection. Later, mid‐tropospheric dry air from the subtropical high merges with the remnant SAL, resulting in strong radial ventilation of the TD above the boundary layer likely limiting any further intensification."

Doskey,Optimizing Source Apportionment of OVOCs With Machine Learning‐Enhanced Photochemical Models,"The photochemical age parameterization model is widely used to analyze primary and secondary sources of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs). However, a key challenge lies in selecting appropriate tracers chemicals used to estimate contributions from different emission sources. Accurate tracer selection is crucial for improving source apportionment accuracy, yet it is often constrained by local emission inventories and may not fully capture rapid atmospheric chemical transformations introducing uncertainty in OVOC apportionment. This study presents a novel approach integrating eight different machine learning methods to identify optimal tracers for OVOCs during extreme summer temperatures (experimental group) and average spring temperatures (control group). Our results demonstrated notable differences in tracer effectiveness between these two groups. In the spring, toluene and carbon monoxide (CO) were identified as the most effective tracers for OVOCs with high and low reactivity, respectively. In the summer, acetylene or CO were better suited for moderate and low reactivity OVOCs. By incorporating machine learning for tracer selection, we significantly improved the accuracy of the photochemical age parameterization model. The machine learning outputs correlated well with the model's performance particularly in terms of fitting accuracy of OVOCs. However, extremely high temperatures during summer disrupted the usual patterns of OVOC production and removal, which led to inconsistencies in matching high reactivity OVOCs with their tracers. Future research involves collecting more data on OVOC behavior under high‐temperature conditions and applying Fourier transformation techniques. This will help in identifying characteristic patterns and improving the dynamic accuracy of our model."

 The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the highest plateau in the world, plays an important role in climatic systems, making it a focus region for the monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In this study, a ground-based portable Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was used for atmospheric CO2 and CH4 column observations in Nyingchi (94.44°N, 29.46°E, 3128 m a.s.l.) from March 29 to May 1, 2021. The mean and standard deviation of the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) and CH4 (XCH4) were 415.58 ± 0.81 ppm and 1859.23 ± 8.41 ppb, respectively. Ground-based observations in Nyingchi were compared with simultaneous measurements at the Hefei site, revealing an average difference of 2.82 ± 0.97 ppm for XCO2 and 34.42 ± 7.64 ppb for XCH4. This difference is likely due to the fact that measurements in Nyingchi were less influenced by human activities than those in Hefei, which is geographically located within one of China's most densely populated and industrially intensive metropolitan areas. To identify CH4 sources and local emissions, the ratio of anomalous XCH4 (ΔXCH4) to XCO2 (ΔXCO2) was calculated for both Nyingchi and Hefei. The ΔXCH4/ΔXCO2 ratio was found to be 5.51 ± 0.11 and 3.93 ± 0.14 (ppb/ppm) in Nyingchi and Hefei, respectively. Compared to the Hefei site, the ΔXCH4/ΔXCO2 ratio in Nyingchi was higher than the corresponding value observed in eastern China, which is one of the most industrialized and polluted regions in the country. The calculated FLEXPART backward trajectories showed that the lower ratios of XCH4 and XCO2 in Nyingchi were influenced by anthropogenic emissions from northern India. However, the concentrations of XCH4 and XCO2, which were likely affected by conditions in northern India, were lower than the background results in Nyingchi, suggesting that surface sources, vertical convection within the boundary layer, and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport may have an influence on these values. Ground-based FTIR observations of XCO2 and XCH4 in Nyingchi, Tibet, provide insights into the background concentrations of these greenhouse gases and their variations in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau."

 To classify prevailing synoptic patterns on the Korean Peninsula during the seasonal PM2.5 management from 2015 to 2019, K-means clustering analysis was performed using 925 hPa geopotential height from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) data. Additionally, we analyzed synoptic patterns based on the PM2.5 pollution standards for each cluster to understand the differences in high and low PM2.5 concentrations under similar synoptic meteorological conditions. The synoptic patterns were classified into five types. Clusters (C1, C3, C4) with a west-high, east-low pressure distribution experienced worsened PM2.5 levels due to a reduction in the east-west pressure gradient. This weakening caused the northwesterly winds to slow down, leading to the accumulation of pollutants. Clusters (C2, C5) with a south-high, north-low pressure pattern were characterized by conditions of high PM2.5, when a high-pressure system over the southeastern region of the Korean Peninsula approached or receded from the Korean Peninsula, accompanied by a reduction in the pressure gradient. This study confirms that the intensity and location of high pressure can lead to variations in air quality under similar synoptic meteorological conditions."

 Arctic marine fog is a severe disastrous weather characterized by drastically reduced visibility, and its occurrence often poses great challenges to navigation and aviation. Accurate measurement of the characteristics of the Arctic marine fog plays a significant role in improving the accuracy of marine fog forecasts in the Arctic region. The Vaisala CL31 ceilometer, with its high sensitivity to liquid water content (LWC), is an effective means of detecting and obtaining the vertical structure of marine fog. In this work, a method to detect fog and retrieve fog thickness based on the ceilometer's backscatter coefficient profile has been proposed. The dataset collected at the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition from September 2019 to September 2020 is analyzed. Results indicate that compared with fog detection results of present weather detector (PWD22), the average deviation of marine fog occurrence probability of the proposed algorithm is within 5 %. Meanwhile, Arctic marine fog has obvious seasonal cycle, with the probability of high-concentration large-particle Arctic marine fog reaching up to 40 % in summer, accompanied by the thickness basically below 300 m. The distribution of marine fog thickness in summer is more concentrated and can last longer, with an average duration of about 6.24 h. In addition, there is an obvious correlation between the marine fog and the atmospheric boundary layer, with the correlation coefficient (CC) between the boundary layer height and the marine fog thickness being 0.7. However, the marine fog is generally shallower than boundary layer height in most cases."

 Large uncertainties still exist in the estimation of black carbon (BC) radiative forcing due to incomplete representation of BC optical properties. To address this, this study employed the AI-based nonspherical aerosol optical scheme (AI-NAOS), coupled with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), to comprehensively estimate the optical properties of the aging BC and its direct radiative effect (DRE). The AI-NAOS was obtained from a database of accurate optical properties of encapsulated fractal aggregates computed from the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (IITM). With this scheme, the aging progress of BC in the CAM6 can be explicitly resolved by the volume fraction and the optical properties can be efficiently inferred from the deep neural network (DNN) in real time. Based on decadal-long simulations from 2010 to 2020, the BC DRE of fractal aggregates was estimated to be +0.3 w/m2 globally and +1.3 w/m2 over East Asia, representing decreases of 40.0% and 38.1%, respectively, compared to spherical assumptions. Additionally, an idealized scenario was considered where BC quantities were increased tenfold. In this scenario, the aging process was minimized due to insufficient hygroscopic aerosols for encapsulating BC aerosols. Compared to the normal scenario, the incremental ratio of radiative effects based on the fractal aggregate model was 11.1 globally and 9.1 over East Asia, whereas it was 7.6 globally and 5.3 over East Asia based on spherical assumptions. These results indicate that, compared to spherical assumptions, stronger enhancement of BC DRE could be produced using more realistic models in scenarios with higher BC emission. Whether the radiative effect is reduced or enhanced using realistic particle models depend on the competing roles of particle nonsphericity and encapsulation (lensing effect) in influencing BC absorption capabilities."

 High-resolution urban air temperatures are indispensable for analysing excess mortality during heatwaves. As a crucial method for obtaining high-resolution data, multi-source data integration has been widely used in urban temperature estimations. However, current research predominantly focuses solely on integrating official weather station observations, satellite products, and reanalysis datasets. Despite the significant cooling effect of rainfall on air temperatures, no studies have explored the contribution of rainfall-related variables to high-resolution air temperature estimations. Additionally, due to the scarcity of official weather stations, quantifying the impact of station density remains an underexplored research direction. To tackle these challenges, we innovatively integrated satellite products, reanalysis datasets, and weather radar data with air temperature observations from crowdsourced weather stations. Using genetic programming, we developed statistical downscaling models to estimate high spatiotemporal resolution (1-km, hourly) air temperatures in London during the summers of 2019 and 2022. The models achieved RMSEs of 1.694 °C (2019) and 1.785 °C (2022), R-squared values of 0.867 and 0.862, and MAEs of 1.276 °C and 1.278 °C, respectively. Notably, the accuracy of the models was found to improve with increased weather station density, particularly when the density was below 0.5 stations per 100 km2. Moreover, high-resolution rainfall observations significantly impacted the accuracy of air temperature estimations, second only to elevation, highlighting the potential of integrating radar data. These findings can provide valuable insights for scholars aiming to improve data integration for enhancing urban air temperature estimations."

We demonstrate that the illumination of brown carbon can rapidly form HOOH within particles, even under the low-sunlight conditions of Fairbanks, Alaska, during winter. This in-particle formation of HOOH is fast enough that it forms sulfate at significant rates. In contrast, the formation of HOOH in the gas phase during the campaign is expected to be negligible because of high NOx levels. 
 The high levels of sulfate in wintertime particles in Fairbanks, Alaska, are a subject of keen research interest and regulatory concern. Recent results from the 2022 Alaska Layered Pollution And Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field campaign indicate that roughly 40 % of wintertime sulfate in Fairbanks is secondary, with hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) the dominant oxidant. Since formation of HOOH in the gas phase should be negligible during ALPACA because of high levels of NOx, we examined whether reactions within particles could be a significant source of HOOH. To test this, we collected particulate matter (PM) samples during the ALPACA campaign, extracted them, illuminated them with simulated sunlight, and measured HOOH production. Aqueous extracts showed significant light absorption, a result of brown carbon (BrC) from sources such as residential wood combustion. Photoformation rates of HOOH in the PM extracts (PMEs; normalized to Fairbanks winter sunlight) range from 6 to 71 µM h−1. While light absorption is nearly independent of pH, HOOH formation rates decrease with increasing pH. Extrapolating to the concentrated conditions of aerosol liquid water (ALW) gives an average rate of in-particle HOOH formation of ∼ 0.1 M h−1. Corresponding rates of sulfate formation from particle-produced HOOH are 0.05–0.5 µgm-3h-1, accounting for a significant portion of the secondary sulfate production rate. Our results show that HOOH formed in particles makes an important contribution to sulfate formation in ambient wintertime particles, even under the low actinic flux conditions typical of winter in subarctic locations like Fairbanks."

McDonald;Colin Harkins;Owen R. Cooper,Surface ozone trend variability across the United States and the impact of heat waves (1990–2023),"Exposure to high levels of ozone can be harmful to human health. This study shows consistent and robust evidence of decreasing ozone extremes across much of the United States over the period from 1990 to 2023, previously attributed to ozone precursor emission controls. Nevertheless, we also show that the increasing heat wave frequencies are likely to contribute to additional ozone exceedances, slowing the progress of decreasing the frequency of ozone exceedances. 
 This paper outlines a comprehensive trend assessment of surface ozone observations across the conterminous USA over 1990–2023. A change point detection algorithm is applied to evaluate seasonal trends at various percentiles. We found that highly consistent and robust negative trends in extreme values have occurred in spring, summer, and fall since the 2000s across the eastern USA. A less strong but similar picture is found in the western USA, while increasing winter trends are commonly observed in the Southwestern and Midwestern regions of the country. The impact of a potential climate penalty that might offset some of the improvement in the ozone extremes is also investigated based on various heat wave metrics. By comparing ozone threshold exceedances, we found that the exceedance probabilities during heat waves are higher than those under normal conditions; moreover, the differences have decreased over time, as the effectiveness of emission controls has led to a great reduction in ozone extremes under both heat wave and normal conditions. When the increasing heat wave trends are accounted for, we find evidence that decreases in exceedances during heat waves have likely halted at 20 %–40 % of sites, depending on heat wave definitions. By identifying monitoring sites with (1) reliably decreasing ozone exceedances and (2) reliably increasing co-occurrences of ozone exceedances and heat wave events, we can show that several sites in California have been impacted by the ozone climate penalty (1995–2022). These findings are limited by the availability of long-term continuous ozone records, which are sparsely distributed across the USA and typically less than 30 years in length."

 Weighted positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been used by scientists to find small sets of underlying factors in environmental data. However, as the size of the data has grown, increasing computational costs have made it impractical to use traditional methods for this factorization. In this paper, we present a new external weighting method to dramatically decrease computational costs for these traditional algorithms. The external weighting scheme, along with the randomized hierarchical alternating least squares (RHALS) algorithm, was applied to the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS 2013) dataset of gaseous highly oxidized multifunctional molecules (HOMs). The modified RHALS algorithm successfully reproduced six previously identified interpretable factors, with the total computation time of the nonoptimized code showing potential improvements of the order of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to competing algorithms. We also investigate rotational ambiguity in the solution and present a simple “pulling” method to rotate a set of factors. This method is shown to find alternative solutions and, in some cases, lower the weighted residual error of the algorithm."

We introduce measurements from a new satellite instrument and show that, in most places globally, these on their own sufficiently constrain the emissions. This alleviates the need for additional datasets, which could shorten the delay for future carbon monoxide source estimates. 
 Carbon monoxide in the atmosphere adversely affects air quality and climate, making knowledge about its sources crucial. However, current global bottom-up emission estimates retain significant uncertainties. In this study, we attempt to reduce these uncertainties by optimizing emission estimates for the second half of the year 2018 on a global scale with a focus on the Northern Hemisphere through the top-down approach of inverse modeling. Specifically, we introduce observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) into the TM5-4DVAR model. The emissions are further constrained using NOAA surface flask measurements. We conducted six experiments to investigate the impact of data use in our inversions, varying the a priori emissions and observational datasets.Notably, the inversion driven by satellite observations alone agrees with flask measurements south of 55° N almost as well as the inversions that included those measurements. This indicates that our method could be suitable for inversions based purely on satellite observations. Compared to the bottom-up estimates, all experiments result in strong (up to 75 %) broad-scale emission reductions in China and India throughout the entire inversion period. Part of the reduction in China can be attributed to policy and technology changes (e.g., coal to gas). Additionally, the OH climatology used to simulate chemical loss appears to be underestimated in that region, which also skews the inversions towards lower emissions. In the experiments that include the surface flask measurements, we find strong localized emission increments over Europe and the Sahara, which are traced back to limitations of the model in reproducing point measurements on mountain tops."

Comprehensive measurements and chemical box model analysis conducted in Hangzhou, China reveal that the formation of O3  is strongly attributed to the increased atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). The observed OVOCs contribute 46.5 ± 8.3% to the AOC, especially during the pollution periods, with formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) accounting for 19 ± 3.8% and 13.8 ± 4.1%, respectively. Various OVOCs (especially CH3CHO) act as  key precursors for the initial production of the crucial radicals. These include the hydroperoxy radical (HO2), methyl peroxy radical (CH3O2), and acetyl peroxy radical (CH3CO3), accounting for 53.7 ± 5.0%, 13.9 ± 2.5%, and 10.0 ± 2.4% of the daytime O3 production (P(O3)), respectively. HCHO acted as the key accelerator of HO2 radical production and subsequently speeded up O3 production. Model simulation and observational evidence reveal that the OVOC initiated secondary channel dominates the HCHO formation. The radical propagation chain of CH3CO3 → CH3O2→ CH3O→ HO2 accounts for 62.4 ± 6.9% of HCHO production. CH3CHO chemistry can account for 14.0% of the production of O3,  and degradation of secondary HCHO derived from CH3CHO accounts for 5.2% of total HO2 production. These findings underscore the significant effect of OVOCs, particularly CH3CHO, on AOC and O3 production in the urban atmosphere in eastern China. Given the decreasing trend of NOX concentration, model simulations under different NOX levels further imply that reducing anthropogenic emission sources of OVOCs is a crucial strategy for current O3 control, and excessive reduction of NOX emissions (the daytime average concentration of NOX decreases to below ∼ 2 ppb) may affect the effectiveness of reducing VOCs and promote a radical self-reaction."

 Satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide have been used to infer nitrogen oxide emissions, a critical component in tropospheric chemistry and pollution. New observations from the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer offer a breakthrough by providing a daytime record of nitrogen dioxide over Asia. Here we present the summertime diurnal patterns of nitrogen dioxide at major cities, power plant regions, and the Strait of Malacca. The Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer data across various regions show high nitrogen dioxide in the morning which decrease in the afternoon, with varying hourly peaks, troughs, and amplitudes reflecting diurnal characteristics of local emissions and chemistry. Nitrogen oxide emissions inferred from Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry also show distinct patterns among regions: early morning peaks occur over Hanoi, Guangzhou, and Bangkok; mid-to-late morning peaks appear over Seoul and Beijing; and late afternoon peaks are noted in the Yangtze River Delta region. Top-down emissions incorporating temporal changes in the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer nitrogen dioxide yield the most accurate nitrogen dioxide simulations.

Motivated by the surmounting evidence that high ambient humidity worsens the perception of heat during these events, we analyse the general, net radiative impacts of humidity on pre-monsoonal surface temperatures using reanalysis and satellite data. Surprisingly, we find that there exists an indirect, radiative surface-cooling effect of water vapor within extended regions in the tropics during periods of high ambient humidity relative to drier periods in the pre-monsoonal season. This observation is contrary to the strong greenhouse effect generally associated with water vapor. We show that this radiative surface-cooling is associated with a previously unreported large positive correlation between lower tropospheric humidity and cloud cover in these regions bordering the ITCZ. These clouds are predominantly low-level and altocumuli, known to have a negative surface-radiative forcing, possibly causing the surface-cooling observed during periods of high ambient humidity. Therefore, periods of lower ambient humidity—or equivalently lesser low-to-mid-level cloud cover—lead to strong surface warming. We find that these pan-tropical regions, where heat stress is negatively correlated with ambient humidity, border the ITCZ and are co-located with the horizontal branch of the Hadley cell, moving north-to-south with the seasonal cycle. Hence, this indirect negative radiative effect of water vapor is particularly relevant for heat stress during the pre-monsoons. We demonstrate this with case studies of some recent major heat waves over the Indian sub-continent when this indirect water vapor effect is found dominantly active throughout the season and in its warming phase during the period of the heat wave. The evolution of this indirect, radiative effect of water vapor, under future climate warming, needs further investigation, considering its crucial importance for heat stress in the tropics."

GWPs are widely used to compare emissions of different greenhouse gases and to compute CO2 equivalent emissions as reported by governments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The GWP of any gas x is the absolute GWP of gas x Absolute and relative Global Warming Potential (AGWPx) divided by AGWP of CO2. Ideally, AGWP and GWPx would be independent of atmospheric CO2 and climate. However, AGWP , and, in turn, GWPx change under rising atmospheric CO2 and global warming, affecting the emission reporting under the UNFCCC. Here, we apply perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, constrained in a Bayesian approach by observational data, to investigate how AGWP and IRF vary under different atmospheric background CO2 levels (CO ). We provide analytical formulations to compute AGWP and IRF for CO2, ocean and land carbon uptake, global mean surface air temperature, steric sea level, and ocean heat content, and to adjust these metrics to different CO . AGWP , given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 101.8(±13.5) 10−15 yr W m−2 kg-CO for CO = 425 ppm and decreases by 7% for CO = 500 ppm. The decrease is driven by a decrease in the radiative efficiency of CO2, partly canceled by a concomitant increase of IRF due to muted ocean and land carbon uptake under higher CO2 levels. We recommend regularly adjusting AGWP and, in turn, GWPs of long-lived gases to contemporary atmospheric CO2 and climate."

The chemical sink of atmospheric methane is not constant but depends on the temperature and on the abundance of its reaction partners. In this study, we use a global chemistry–climate model to assess the feedback of atmospheric methane induced by changes in the chemical sink in a warming climate and its implications for the chemical composition and the surface air temperature change. 
 The chemical sink of atmospheric methane (CH4) depends on the temperature and on the chemical composition. Here, we assess the feedback on atmospheric CH4 induced by changes in the chemical sink in a warming climate using a CH4-emission-flux-driven set-up of the chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry), in which the chemical feedback of CH4 mixing ratios can evolve explicitly. We perform idealized perturbation simulations driven either by increased carbon dioxide (CO2) mixing ratios or by increased CH4 emission fluxes. The CH4 emission flux perturbation leads to a large increase of CH4 mixing ratios. Remarkably, the factor by which the CH4 mixing ratio increases is larger than the increase factor of the emission flux, because the atmospheric lifetime of CH4 is extended.In contrast, the individual effect of the global surface air temperature (GSAT) increase is to shorten the CH4 lifetime, which results in a significant reduction of CH4 mixing ratios in our set-up. The corresponding radiative feedback is estimated at −0.041 and −0.089 W m−2 K−1 for the CO2 and CH4 perturbation, respectively. The explicit response of CH4 mixing ratios leads to secondary feedbacks on the hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O3). Firstly, the OH response includes the CH4–OH feedback, which enhances the CH4 lifetime change, and, secondly, the formation of tropospheric O3 is reduced. Our CH4 perturbation induces the same response of GSAT per effective radiative forcing (ERF) as the CO2 perturbation, which supports the applicability of the ERF framework for CH4."

Taking a wintertime O3 surge episode over the Sichuan Basin (SCB) as an example, we find SI contribute 47.8% to near‐surface O3 levels and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Tropopause folding nearly extends to the deep atmospheric boundary layer over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to topographic forcing, driving stratospheric O3 penetration into the TP's near‐surface. The intruded O3 is subsequently transported into the downstream SCB by strong downdrafts along the TP's leeward slope. Interestingly, the mountain‐plains solenoid between the TP and the SCB strengthens the downward intrusions of O3 during both daytime and nighttime, further amplifying the contribution of SI to the SCB's near‐surface O3 levels. This unique mechanism of O3 surges could provide new insights for the forecast of unexpected nocturnal high‐O3 episodes."

 The unprecedented water vapor amount (WV, 150–160 Tg) injected by the 2022 eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai not only directly cooled the stratosphere, but also facilitated the formation and growth of sulfate particles, indirectly heating it. Here, we developed analytical models constrained by satellite observations to quantify these contrasting roles of WV in stratospheric temperature perturbations. Our analysis revealed that condensation and nucleation processes facilitated by abundant WV accounted for ~90% of the observed particle radius growth, from 0.1–0.2 µm to 0.35–0.45 µm. Despite increased aerosol extinction due to particle growth, a cooling of up to −4 K was observed in the mid-stratosphere, persisting for over a year since February, with over 60% attributed to WV radiative cooling.

 With rapid urbanization, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region has experienced intensifying greenhouse effects due to increases in global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Therefore, studying the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CO2 concentrations and understanding the causes of regional climate change have become crucial. Although previous studies have focused on calculating regional carbon sources and sinks, explicit and directly interpretable analyses targeting CO₂ concentrations per se remain limited. Based on multi-source satellite data, this study systematically analyzed changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of CO2 concentrations in the BTH region and its dynamic relationship with environmental factors from 2003 to 2021 using long short-term memory network and interpretability theory models. The results showed that CO2 exhibits a high value area with spatiotemporal flux that shifts from northwest to southeast and has a seasonally fluctuating growth rate of 2.29 ppm/year. Nightlight (NTL) data were highly correlated with the CO2 concentration (0.98), whereas the correlation coefficient between the two centers of gravity was 0.57, indicating a moderate effect on CO2 concentration increases and spatial changes. Moreover, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) (0.92) was most strongly correlated with interannual changes in CO2, followed by precipitation (0.51), temperature (0.44), and solar radiation (0.14), and the contributions of diurnal variations in these parameters to the spatiotemporal characteristics of CO2 are ordered temperature (6.79) > NDVI (6.36) > solar radiation (2.20) > precipitation (1.66). Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of CO2 concentrations in the BTH region and reveals the driving effects of different factors, especially with regard to natural factors that present nonlinear change characteristics. Moreover, our findings have theoretical and practical significance for reducing CO2 concentrations and mitigating greenhouse effects in the BTH region and other industrial city clusters."

Results show that in the North American region, the SML model reduces the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of PWV estimates by 58.05 %, 36.99 %, and 33.05 % compared to conventional linear, exponential, and global PWV vertical adjustment (GPWV-H) models, respectively. In the region of China and Southeast Asia, the RMSE of PWV estimates is reduced by more than 42.9 %.

Notably, the SML model outperforms conventional models across various latitudes and longitudes, making it well-suited for complex terrain and different climatic conditions. This study also examines the SML model performance for different climate types and extreme weather and proposes incorporating these factors in future work to improve model adaptability.

Paradoxically, the flux inversion using the ML (machine-learning) model outperforms the full-physics model in our case study. We attribute this to the ML model mitigating transport errors in the GHG flux inversion. 
 Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is critically important for projecting future climate and assessing the impact of environmental policy. Estimating GHG emissions using atmospheric observations is typically done using source–receptor relationships (i.e., “footprints”). Constructing these footprints can be computationally expensive and is rapidly becoming a computational bottleneck for studying GHG fluxes at high spatio-temporal resolution using dense observations. Here, we demonstrate a computationally efficient GHG flux inversion framework using a machine learning emulator for atmospheric transport (FootNet) as a surrogate for the full-physics model. The footprints generated by FootNet are at approximately 1 km resolution. We update the architecture of the deep-learning model to improve the performance in a GHG flux inversion. We find that the posterior fluxes estimated with FootNet footprints are in good agreement with the posterior fluxes estimated with STILT footprints. We observe that the more simplistic representation of transport in the machine learning model helps to mitigate transport errors. This flux inversion using a machine learning surrogate model requires only meteorological data, GHG measurements, and prior fluxes. Constructing footprints using FootNet is 650 times faster than the full-physics atmospheric transport model on similar hardware. This speedup allows for the computation of footprints “on the fly” during the GHG flux inversion (i.e., computed as needed, rather than archiving for future use) and makes near-real-time emission monitoring computationally possible. This work alleviates a major computational bottleneck with inferring GHG fluxes with next-generation dense observing systems."

Sheese;Kaley A. Walker;Chris D. Boone;David A. Plummer,Quantifying the sources of increasing stratospheric water vapour concentrations,"Observations from Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) are used to examine global stratospheric water vapour trends for 2004–2021. The satellite measurements are used to quantify trend contributions arising from changes in tropical tropopause temperatures, general circulation patterns, and methane concentrations. While most of the observed trends can be explained by these changes, there remains an unaccounted-for and increasing source of water vapour in the lower mid-stratosphere at mid-latitudes, which is discussed. 
 According to satellite measurements from multiple instruments, water vapour (H2O) concentrations, in most regions of the stratosphere, have been increasing at a statistically significant rate of ∼1 %–5 % per decade since the early 2000s. Previous studies have estimated stratospheric H2O trends, but none have simultaneously quantified the contributions from all main sources (temperature variations in the tropical tropopause region, changes in the Brewer–Dobson circulation, and changes in methane (CH4) concentrations and oxidation) at all latitudes. Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) measurements are used to estimate altitude-/latitude-dependent stratospheric H2O trends from 2004–2021 due to these sources. Results indicate that rising temperatures in the tropical tropopause region play a significant role in the increases, accounting for ∼1 %–4 % per decade in the tropical lower mid-stratosphere and in the mid-latitudes below ∼20 km. By regressing to ACE-FTS N2O concentrations, it is found that, in the lower mid-stratosphere, general circulation changes have led to both significant H2O increases and significant H2O decreases on the order of 1 %–2 % per decade depending on the altitude/latitude region. Making use of measured and modelled CH4 concentrations, the increase in H2O due to CH4 oxidation is calculated to be ∼1 %–2 % per decade above ∼30 km in the Northern Hemisphere and throughout the stratosphere in the Southern Hemisphere. After accounting for these sources, there are still regions of the mid-latitude lower mid-stratosphere that exhibit significant residual H2O trends increasing at 1 %–2 % per decade. Results indicate that these unaccounted-for increases could potentially be explained by increases in upper-tropospheric molecular hydrogen."

Using the developed model, our findings highlight a dual trend: a decrease in the overall deposition of soluble iron from dust but an increase in the solubility of the iron itself due to the enhanced atmospheric processing. The study underscores the critical roles of both dust emission and atmospheric processing in soluble iron deposition and marine ecology. 
 Recent shifts in dust emissions and atmospheric compositions in East Asia may have a significant impact on the deposition of soluble iron from dust over the Northwest Pacific (30–50° N, 140° E–160° W). This study investigates the trends and driving factors behind this phenomenon during the spring of 2001–2017 using an enhanced version of the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 with comprehensive stratospheric chemistry (CAM6-Chem). We improved the model to account for desert dust mineralogy and atmospheric chemical processes that promote iron dissolution, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the evolution of dust iron. Our findings indicate a decreasing trend in dust-soluble-iron deposition from East Asia to the Northwest Pacific by 2.4 % yr−1, primarily due to reduced dust emissions driven by declining surface winds over dust source regions. Conversely, the solubility of dust iron showed an increasing trend, rising from 1.5 % in 2001 to 1.7 % in 2017. This increased iron solubility is linked to the acidification of coarse-mode aerosols and in-cloud oxalate-promoted dissolution. Sensitivity model simulations reveal that the increase in anthropogenic NOx emissions, rather than the decrease in SO2, plays a dominant role in enhancing dust aerosol acidity. This study highlights a dual trend: a decrease in the overall deposition of soluble iron from dust but an increase in the solubility of the iron itself. It underscores the critical roles of both dust emission and atmospheric processing in promoting iron dissolution, which further influences soluble iron deposition and marine ecology."

Our research successfully identified 19 groups of halogenated pollutants in the air samples. These include a range of chlorinated and brominated anisoles, as well as a previously undocumented polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) that was confirmed with a synthesized standard. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated organophosphate esters (OPEs) and various agricultural contaminants were also tentatively identified based on mass spectral interpretation. The study revealed significant differences in the pollutant profiles between the two cities, reflecting their distinct industrial influences. The application of non-target screening techniques also highlighted the complex nature of air pollution and the necessity for broader monitoring strategies to protect public health and the environment."

However, retrievals fail for liquid clouds when the re ${r}_{\mathrm{e}}$ observation exceeds the maximum threshold of 30 μ ${\upmu }$m in MODIS's solution space, leading to a sampling bias. Here, we quantify this bias by reconstructing pixels with failed retrievals using two methods: a conservative approach assigning a fixed minimum re ${r}_{\mathrm{e}}$ threshold to failed pixels, and a representative approach modeling failed re ${r}_{\mathrm{e}}$ using CloudSat radar measurements. We show that MODIS overestimates cloud droplet number concentration by 8%–9% and underestimates liquid water path by 8%–11% globally. We demonstrate that this bias can introduce erroneous correlations between cloud properties that may be misinterpreted as causal processes. Accordingly, we show that accounting for this bias increases the cloud water adjustments by 24%–36%, highlighting the crucial need to expand the solution space in MODIS and similar sensors."

Further, we show that US Environmental Protection Agency–codified techniques for measuring total PM2.5fail to quantify the AN component, while low-cost optical sensors demonstrate good agreement. While previous studies suggest that declining NOxhas reduced AN, we show that HNO3formation is still substantial and leads to the formation of many tens of micrograms per cubic meter of AN aerosol.

Furans might also react with aqueous photooxidants, such as singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*), to form aqueous SOA (aqSOA), but this has not been studied. To investigate the aqueous reactivities of furans and their potential to make low-volatility products, we first measured the reaction kinetics for singlet oxygen with 17 furans. The resulting second-order rate constants vary widely with chemical substitution, ranging from 105 to nearly 109 M–1 s–1. Inorganic salts can decrease or enhance the first-order loss of furans by singlet oxygen. To investigate whether furan-1O2* reactions might produce particulate matter, we measured SOA mass yields for three furans: furoic acid, furfuryl alcohol, and 2-methylfuran-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (MFDCA). The resulting mass yields span a huge range, with values of ∼0, 51, and 125%, respectively. Finally, we estimated rates of gas- and aqueous-SOA formation from reactions of MFDCA over a range of conditions, from cloud and fog drops to aerosol liquid water.

However, most HONO observations so far are on the ground level, while HONO chemistry at higher altitude remains largely unknown. Through one-month observations at a 450 m platform of Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China, we have identified two distinct regimes of nocturnal HONO chemistry. One is dominated by heterogeneous reactions on the ground surface, likely corresponding to the period when the platform was within the stable nocturnal boundary layer. Another regime, occurring in the residual layer, is dominated by in situ formation from oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) by OH. During the daytime, HONO from emissions and heterogeneous sources at the ground undergoes ∼60% loss through photolysis before reaching 450 m. A detailed HONO budget analysis considering chemistry and vertical transport suggests that on average 32% of the observed HONO at 450 m is from OH oxidation of NO, while there remains 51% unidentified. These findings emphasize the increased contribution of NO + OH to the overall HONO budget throughout the urban boundary layer, in contrast to the diminished role of ground-related processes, and warrant future continuous measurements at high altitudes to supplement data at the ground to develop a complete understanding of HONO chemistry in the urban boundary layer."

By comparing the observed O3 chemical budgets with those simulated by GEOS‐Chem, a global chemical transport model, we identified a 60% underestimation in the O3 production rate by GEOS‐Chem. Detailed budget analysis of O3 and radicals revealed that this discrepancy primarily arose from GEOS‐Chem's inadequate representation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), followed by oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs).

 Gaseous ammonia, while influential in atmospheric processes, is critically underrepresented in atmospheric measurements. This limits our understanding of key climate-relevant processes, such as new particle formation, particularly in remote regions. Here, we present highly sensitive, online observations of gaseous ammonia from a coastal site in Antarctica, which allows us to constrain the mechanism of new particle formation in this region in unprecedented detail. Our observations show that penguin colonies are a large source of ammonia in coastal Antarctica, whereas ammonia originating from the Southern Ocean is, in comparison, negligible. In conjunction with sulfur compounds sourced from oceanic microbiology, ammonia initiates new particle formation and is an important source of cloud condensation nuclei. Dimethylamine, likely originating from penguin guano, also participates in the initial steps of particle formation, effectively boosting particle formation rates up to 10000 times. These findings emphasize the importance of ecosystem processes from penguin/bird colonies and oceanic phytoplankton/bacteria on climate-relevant aerosol processes in coastal Antarctica.

 Atmospheric microplastics (MPs) have emerged as novel atmospheric pollutants, with the potential to impact ecosystems and human societies in numerous ways. As aerosols, MPs can both absorb and scatter radiation, influencing atmospheric flux and possibly contributing to global climate change. In this study, we quantify the direct radiative effects (difference of atmospheric flux with and without MPs) (DREs) of MPs by integrating an atmospheric transport and radiative transfer model. The results reveal a global annual mean shortwave radiation DRE of −9.07 (−40.57–2.04) μW m−2 and a longwave radiation DRE of +2.73 (0.61–12.21) μW m−2. Our findings suggest that the total DRE of MPs is concentrated in densely populated and arid regions, driven by high emission rates and favorable atmospheric conditions. The contribution of ocean sources to the DRE is relatively low compared to land-based sources. We find that MPs exert stronger radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere, comparing to at the Earth's surface, as the magnitude of net DRE decreases from −6.34 (−28.36–1.43) μW m−2o −1.93 (−8.68–0.44) μW m−2. Additionally, the DRE is size-dependent, with larger effect as MP size increases. As plastic pollution continues to rise, the contribution of MPs to radiative effect and climate change is expected to grow. We emphasize the urgent need for early actions to control atmospheric MPs to mitigate potentially severe climate impacts."

 Rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of hydroxyl radical with first-generation oxidation products of monoterpenes, namely nopinone, ketolimonene, myrtenal and limononaldehyde have been measured using a relative rate technique over the temperature range 298–353 K and atmospheric pressure of air in a 63 L atmospheric chamber.

The rate constants obtained at 298 ± 2 K (in units of 10−11 cm3 molecule-l s-l) are: nopinone 1.82 ± 0.20; ketolimonene 13.2 ± 1.30; myrtenal 5.97 ± 0.80; and limononaldehyde 5.17 ± 0.44. A very weak temperature dependence in the temperature range 298–353 K was obtained for nopinone and limononaldehyde. Meanwhile, ketolimonene and myrtenal show a negative dependence over the temperature range studied. Atmospheric lifetimes towards OH radicals deduced from room temperature rate constants prove that once emitted into the atmosphere, all studied compounds can be degraded in less than one day and thus contribute to the photochemical pollution on a local or regional scale."

 More than 2400 synoptic stations in China have been conducting automatic visibility observations since 2013. Investigate the potential contribution of visibility data assimilation to the prediction of visibility and PM2.5 is worthwhile. Visibility data was converted to aerosol extinction coefficient (AExtC) at 2424 synoptic stations in China from 1–31 December 2020. The Weather Research & Forecasting Data Assimilation system coupled with Chemistry (WRFDA-Chem) aerosol optical property module was applied to assimilate the bias-corrected visiometer AExtC. The analysis field was used as the initial chemical condition of the Weather Research & Forecasting system coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) 24 h forecast run. Relative humidity information was assimilated to further decrease the uncertainty of RH before aerosol DA was applied. To illustrate the contribution of the AExtC DA, four parallel experiments were conducted, including a control run (CTR), a visiometer AExtC DA run (VIS), a ground PM2.5 DA run (PM) and a joint assimilation of the AExtC and PM2.5 run (VisPM). Compared with those of the CTR experiment, better AExtC and PM2.5 forecast skills were acquired up to 24 forecast hours via the VIS, PM, and VisPM experiments. The assimilation of visiometer AExtC significantly improved the model prediction performance of AExtC (PM2.5), with a reduction of in the RMSE value of 21 % (20 %). Direct DA of visiometer AExtC (PM2.5) yielded a better AExtC (PM2.5) analysis and forecasts. However, the VIS experiment also revealed its potential contribution to PM2.5 prediction in Northwest China, compensating for the sparse number of PM2.5 stations in this region. Joint assimilation of both the visiometer AExtC and ground PM2.5 further improved the AExtC and PM2.5 forecast, with reductions of RMSE of 22 % and 31 %, respectively."

 The Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), a satellite sensor has been in orbit for over 40 years, providing remote sensing images before 2000 and there is considerable room for improvement in the accuracy of current air temperature (Ta) inversions based on AVHRR to obtain accurate long-term Ta data before 2000. Here, we aim to estimate daily average (Tave), maximum (Tmax), and minimum (Tmin) air temperatures at a resolution of 5 km for the Chinese region during the period 1983–2000. We developed a satellite-retrieval daily temperature extrapolation method based on machine learning (ML) combining multiple sources of big data, i.e., leveraging comprehensive and gap-free land surface temperature data from remote sensing along with other relevant variables from reanalysis data, topography and auxiliary data of local temperature, to generate extended time series of high-resolution Ta data. Quality validation results indicate that the ML can enhance the accuracy of Ta inversion with average error range of various ML methods being 0.995–1.606 °C, 1.316–1.971 °C and 1.396–1.980 °C for Tave, Tmax, and Tmin, respectively, which is better than the 2.297 ± 1.704 °C, 3.294 ± 2.016 °C and 2.873 ± 1.666 °C of ERA5.

Traditional emission inventories equate BC with elemental carbon (EC) and overlook the variability in its properties across sources, leading to uncertainties in climate predictions. This study shows that EC from solid fuel combustion contains substantial low-maturity EC (char), whose emissions increase alongside the light absorption of soluble organic carbon (OC) as the fuel aromaticity rises. Concurrently, the abundance of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (O-PAHs) in soluble OC also increases. This suggests that char and brown carbon (BrC) share similar formation pathways with O-PAHs as key precursors. Time-resolved analysis during combustion cycles revealed a significant positive correlation between O-PAHs, the light absorption of soluble OC, and char emissions, further supporting this shared pathway. The nonbonding orbitals in BrC and char facilitate n → π* transitions in the visible region, which are more wavelength-dependent than the π → π* transition in high-maturity EC (soot). This study highlights char as a light-absorbing intermediate, influencing light absorption of EC emitted from solid fuel combustion. These insights into the formation pathways and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols enhance our understanding of their climate impacts and underscore the need to differentiate between char and soot in climate models to improve accuracy."

Magnetic measurements of PM2.5 samples, complemented by detailed chemical analyses, reveal similar temporal variations between BC and magnetite while demonstrating that the relative abundance of magnetite to BC varies by combustion source, driving seasonal trends. Magnetite abundance during combustion episodes was found to follow the order: coal > oil > biomass, with mass concentrations roughly estimated via magnetization to be 9–10%, 5–6%, and <2% of BC, respectively. Furthermore, magnetite was estimated to contribute up to 5% of the BC absorption coefficient, suggesting the considerable overestimation of BC depending on the source.

 The Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL) causes significant regional radiative forcing which may influence the tropospheric weather and climate. Our analysis reveals that the intensified ATAL weakens the South Asian High (SAH) and the South Asian Monsoon. The ATAL leads to increases in diabatic heating in the upper troposphere in the SAH region, induces an anomalous upward flow which decreases the adiabatic heating and causes cooling anomalies in the upper troposphere in the SAH region, and ultimately weakens the SAH (diabatic heating mechanism). However, responses of the SAH to the ATAL are nonlinear. Model results indicate that when the ATAL intensity is doubled, a temperature inversion occurs in the upper troposphere which tends to stabilize the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and prevent the upward moisture transport (static stability mechanism). The reduced latent heat release induces middle and upper tropospheric cooling in the SAH region, thereby weakens the SAH."

To enhance downscaling accuracy, we present a hybrid training method integrating multi-resolution inverse fluxes—national-scale coarse grids with fine-scale grids (Shanxi/Jiangsu). Experiments show hybrid training outperforms conventional approaches, increasing R² from 0.56 to 0.61 with 2.7%-area fine grids and reducing prediction biases compared to data fusion without high-resolution inputs while vastly exceeding nearest-neighbor interpolation (R² = 0.39). By combining gap-filled CO/NO2 columns, nighttime lights, population density, vegetation indices, and meteorological data, we downscaled national 45 km eight-day CO2 fluxes to daily 10 km resolution.

 This study investigates the impact of aerosol component data assimilation on air quality forecasting using the WRF-Chem model coupled with a 3DVAR framework and Observation System Simulation Experiments(OSSE). Four observation network configurations(27 km, 100 km, 270 km, and full-density 2016 stations) were tested to evaluate how spatial resolution and station density influence the simulation of six aerosol components(SO₄2−, NH₄+, NO₃−, BC, OC, OIN). Results demonstrate that assimilating aerosol speciation data significantly outperforms total PM₂.₅/PM₁₀ assimilation, reducing initial field RMSE by 38.2 % and enhancing 48-h forecast correlation(CORR) by 0.15–0.18. The DA_270km experiment, with only 119 stations, achieved accuracy comparable to the full-density DA experiment, highlighting the critical role of spatial representativeness over station count. High-resolution networks(e.g., DA_27km) exhibited suboptimal performance, particularly for carbonaceous aerosols(BC, OC), where RMSE increased by 25–30 % due to “super-resolution assimilation” effects and amplified subgrid parameterization errors. Mechanistically, traditional 3DVAR frameworks showed limitations in handling ultra-dense networks, including redundancy in observational data and scale mismatches between model grids and observation density. Chemically inert components like OIN showed minimal assimilation impacts(<5 % variance), emphasizing the need for refined emission inventories. These findings advocate for optimized observation networks(50–100 km resolution) balancing spatial coverage, model resolution, and cost-effectiveness, prioritizing aerosol speciation data to advance air quality forecasting and emission control strategies."

However, their application in complex urban environments, particularly in coal‐dominated regions, may be compromised by overlapping sources and atmospheric processes. Using a decade‐long data set (2005–2015) of rainwater chemistry and high‐resolution aerosol measurements (2018–2019) in Shanghai, China's largest megacity, this study quantitatively assesses the impacts of coal combustion on potassium and LG levels. Our analysis reveals that over 80% of K+ in rainwater and ∼53% of aerosol potassium originate from coal combustion as indicated by strong correlations with industrial SO2 emissions (r2 = 0.80–0.95). Similarly, LG concentrations are significantly impacted by coal combustion with molecular diagnostic ratios aligning with coal‐derived endmembers particularly during autumn. Considering the prevalence of coal‐based energy systems in most Chinese cities, we argue that pollution attributed to BB in rainwater and aerosol across urban China may be systematically overestimated when relying on currently broadly used BB tracers. By integrating long‐term observational data with receptor modeling, we further underscores the necessity of refining source attribution methodologies to better distinguish between BB and coal combustion impacts on air quality and climate in urban areas."

This study proposes an efficient plane‐parallel PRTM by a combination of machine learning (ML) techniques and traditional physical radiative transfer models. The atmosphere is decomposed into layers with independent optical properties, each have type‐specific polarized scattering parameterizations. To be more specific, a physics‐informed neural network (PINN) model that directly incorporates physical constraints into the ML process is developed to capture complex polarized interactions of cloudy layers. By independent training for atmospheric layers of different types, we can effectively enhance the generalization capability across realistic atmospheric profiles. The interconnection of the polarized states across multiple layers is achieved using the adding‐doubling method, which is optimized through a discretization scheme for efficient computation. The PINN model demonstrates remarkable physical consistency when simulating the radiative properties of both ice and water clouds. The mean absolute relative errors (MAREs) are 0.7% for ice clouds and 1.0% for water clouds, with the latter showing errors in regions characterized by strong scattering peaks. For multi‐layer cloud cases, the model produces an MARE of 0.9%. Compared to rigorous PRTMs, our model improves the computational efficiency by 3 orders of magnitude. The proposed PRTM can be readily adapted to account for distinct particle types, especially aerosols, by modifying the optical parameterization in the training data set, showing promise for more extensive applications in atmospheric research."

Local anthropogenic mineral dust was found to be the dominant chemical component, accounting for (53 ± 14)% of the aerosol mass concentrations. Carbonaceous aerosols (34 ± 12)%, mainly from domestic and waste biomass burning, and secondary inorganic aerosols (13 ± 6%) from anthropogenic combustion sources were also found. High βabs(λ) was observed at all sites, with an estimated mass absorption efficiency, MAE(λ), from (1,296 ± 472) 10−3 m2 g−1 at 375 nm to (621 ± 239)10−3 m2 g−1 at 850 nm. The contributions of the primary light‐absorbing aerosols to βabs(λ) were determined using chemical tracers for two optical clusters identified based on the estimated MAE for black carbon (BC). BC was the major contributor to βabs(λ) at all wavelengths (>60%). The brown carbon contribution decreased with λ from (8–40) % at 375 nm to (1–23) % at 532 nm, and was higher in Cluster 1 than Cluster 2. Anthropogenic mineral dust in Cluster 2 appeared to be more light absorbing than pure desert dust and was a significant contributor to βabs(λ), constant with wavelength at ∼16%. The levels of light‐absorbing aerosols identified have implications for the radiation budget and atmospheric stability. Although BC dominates light absorption on the South African Highveld, mineral dust contributes significantly to aerosol mass concentrations and enhanced light‐absorption."

 Cold wave (CW) systems in China, driven by strong northerly winds, typically clean the atmosphere but can also transport pollutants. However, elevated PM2.5 and O3 levels often precede CW events, with key processes remaining unclear. This study analyzes over 2000 in-situ observations (2014–2022), atmospheric reanalysis, and WRF-CAMx simulations to examine CW impacts on air pollution over eastern China. A three-day compressional heating period before CW events alters planetary boundary layer (PBL) dynamics, influencing pollutant levels. PM2.5 is driven by wind speed, PBL height (PBLH), and mean sea level pressure (MSLP), while O3 is influenced by temperature, humidity, solar radiation, PBLH, and MSLP. Though CWs generally clean the air on the day of its arrival, ~18% of cases show increased PM2.5 due to enhanced secondary formation and suppressed PBLH. Numerical simulations reveal CW-induced long-range pollutant transport and highlight critical meteorological-pollution interactions before CW events."

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of PM2.5 acidity and the underlying chemical mechanisms. The results showed that PM2.5 acidity exhibited weakly acidic patterns, with a bimodal pattern on seasonal scales, primarily due to high loadings of ammonium ions and frequent sandstorms. Sensitivity tests indicated that temperature had a more pronounced effect on aerosol acidity than relative humidity, owing to its significant influence on ammonium partitioning. Furthermore, PM2.5 acidity responded to changes in aerosol chemical composition, with sulfate and total ammonium (TNHx) being the most significant contributors, followed by total nitrate (TNO3) and total chloride (TCl). Sulfate modified aerosol acidity by preferentially promoting the formation of sulfate and bisulfate, which in turn regulated the partitioning of semi‐volatile species. TNO3 contributed to the dynamic equilibrium between sulfate and bisulfate by interacting with the partitioning of semi‐volatile species. Initially, TNHx triggered a sharp increase in aerosol acidity by preferentially utilizing sulfate; however, subsequent neutralization and partitioning between TNHx and of semi‐volatile acidic species limited further evolutions in acidity. The comprehensive analysis of key chemical species suggested that reducing PM2.5 pH can only be achieved through effective ammonia control. This study not only addresses theoretical gaps in the numerical simulations of aerosol acidity in ammonia‐rich environments but also enhances our understanding of the global differential distribution characteristics."

 In this paper, we primarily design a novel system for measuring Meteorological Optical Range (MOR) called Multi-Modal Dual Reflection Transmissometer (MMDRT), which is based on a variant Beer Lambert Law. Conventional physical visibility meters, along with the latest digital image-based visibility measurement algorithms, exhibit drawbacks and limitations when subjected to varying geographical environments and fluctuations in sunlight exposure. To overcome the shortcomings of previous equipment and algorithms while avoiding environmental and temporal constraints, we conduct more detailed research on parameter settings for the original equipment and made more scientific improvements to it. First, we analyze the limitation and unsuitability of Beer Lambert Law. Second, we build a measurement system based on a variant Beer Lambert Law, which is utilized to capture the change of MOR. Third, a novel multi-model deep-learning algorithm combining images and atmospheric factors is proposed to learn the relationship between spot images taken by MMDRT, meteorological factors and MOR. New 6511 samples are used to test the performance of MMDRT.

 Atmospheric aerosols significantly influence global and regional climate by interacting with radiation and clouds. These interactions are difficult to represent in atmospheric chemistry models due to their dependence on aerosols' physicochemical properties associated with emission, aging, and removal processes. In the absence of precipitation, large uncertainties arise from the parameterization of aerosol dry deposition (ADD), which could lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of aerosol interactions.In this study, the WRF-Chem model is validated and used to assess (1) its sensitivity to emission sources’ representation and to four ADD schemes coupled with the MOSAIC 8-bin aerosol model (i.e., ADD1 – based on Binkowski and Shankar, 1995; ADD1E – based on Emerson et al., 2020; ADD101 – based on Peters and Eiden, 1992; and ADD301 – based on Zhang et al., 2001); and (2) the impact of ADD on size-resolved dust aerosol load, number, and optical depth during a Saharan dust event that affected the Iberian Peninsula between 7 and August 12, 2010.Results show that all simulation experiments using the different ADD schemes captured the observed horizontal and vertical aerosol layer's structure, concentration, and optical properties, with model skill significantly improving when all emission sources were considered. However, this agreement with observations results from compensating effects of different aerosol size distributions in all ADD schemes. In fact, only ADD1 could reproduce the observed coarse mode shape, with ADD1E and ADD301 largely overestimating the aerosol volume in the 5–10 μm diameter range. Bin-dependent relative differences in dust number, load, and AOD show that of all the schemes, ADD1 offers the best balance between predicted aerosol number in 0.078–1.25 μm range and aerosol load in 5.0–10.0 μm diameter range during the dust event."

With an equatorward shift, anthropogenic NOx emissions become significantly more efficient at producing O3 and play a major role in driving TOB trends, mainly due to larger convection at the tropics effectively lifting O3 and its precursors to the free troposphere, where O3 lifetime is longer. 
 Over the past few decades, the tropospheric ozone precursor anthropogenic emissions – nitrogen oxides (NOx) and reactive carbon (RC) from northern mid-/high-latitude regions (e.g., North America, Europe) – have been decreasing, and those from (sub-)tropical regions (e.g., South Asia , the Middle East ) have been increasing, leading to an equatorward emission redistribution. In this study, we quantify the contributions of various sources of NOx and RC emissions to tropospheric ozone using a source attribution technique during the 2000–2018 period in a global chemistry transport model. We tag the ozone molecules with the source of their NOx or RC precursor emission in two separate simulations: NOx-tagged and RC-tagged. These tags include various natural (biogenic, biomass burning, lightning NOx and RC from methane oxidation) and regional anthropogenic precursor emission sources and influx from the stratosphere. We simulate ∼336 Tg O3 of tropospheric ozone burden (TOB) with an increasing trend of 0.91 Tg O3 yr−1 (0.28 % yr−1), largely contributed (and trend driven) by anthropogenic NOx emissions and methane oxidation. The ozone production efficiency of regional anthropogenic NOx emissions increases when emissions decrease (e.g., Europe, North America) and decreases when emissions increase (e.g., South Asia, Middle East, international shipping). Tropical regions, despite lower emissions, contribute more to TOB compared to emissions from higher latitudes, consistent with previous work, predominantly due to large convection (combined with intense sunlight and larger reaction rates) at the tropics, thereby lifting O3 and its precursor molecules into the free troposphere where ozone's lifetime is longer. We simulate a smaller relative contribution from tropical regions to the global mean surface ozone compared to their contribution to the TOB. The global population-weighted mean ozone  is much larger compared to global mean surface ozone, mainly due to large anthropogenic emissions from densely populated regions – East Asia, South Asia and other tropical regions – and a substantial contribution from international ship NOx emissions. The increasing trends in anthropogenic precursor emissions from these regions are the main drivers of increasing global population-weighted mean ozone."

By using advanced models, we found that natural emissions from these areas can significantly affect air quality. Our results suggest that the design and planning of UGSs should not only consider aesthetics and social factors but also their environmental impacts on air quality. 
 The use of urban green spaces (UGSs), such as parks and gardens, is widely promoted as a strategy to improve the urban atmospheric environment. However, this study reveals that it can exacerbate urban ozone (O3) levels under certain conditions, as demonstrated by a September 2017 study in Guangzhou, China. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF-MEGAN) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we assessed the impact of UGS-related biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions (hereafter referred to as UGS-BVOC emissions) on urban O3. Our findings indicate that the UGS-BVOC emissions in Guangzhou amounted to 666 Gg (∼90Mgkm-2), with isoprene (ISOP) and monoterpene (TERP) contributing remarkably to the total UGS-BVOC emissions. Compared to anthropogenic VOC (AVOC) and BVOC emissions, UGS-BVOC emissions account for ∼33.45 % in the city center, and their inclusion in the model reduces ISOP underestimation. The study shows improved simulation mean biases for MDA8 (maximum daily 8 h average) O3, from −3.63 to −0.75 ppb in the city center.  Integrating UGS-BVOC emissions and UGS-LUCC emissions (where LUCC denotes land use cover change) enhances surface monthly mean O3 by 1.7–3.7 ppb (+3.8%-8.5%) and adds up to 8.9 ppb (+10.0 %) to MDA8 O3 during pollution episodes. UGS-BVOC emissions alone increase monthly mean O3 by 1.0–1.4 ppb (+2.3%-3.2%) in urban areas and contribute up to 2.9 ppb (+3.3 %) to MDA8 O3 during pollution episodes. These impacts can extend to surrounding suburban and rural areas through regional transport, highlighting the need to accurately account for UGS-BVOC emissions to better manage air quality."

Blossey;Sarah J. Doherty,Impact on the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition of the interaction of cloud microphysics and macrophysics with large-scale circulation,"This study explores how aerosols affect clouds transitioning from stratocumulus to cumulus along trade winds under varying atmospheric conditions. We found that aerosols typically reduce precipitation and raise cloud height, but their impact changes when subsidence changes by aerosol enhancement are considered. Our findings indicate that the cooling effect of aerosols might be overestimated if these atmospheric changes are not accounted for. 
 This study examines the impact of the interaction of cloud microphysics and macrophysics with the large-scale circulation on the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (SCT) using a large-eddy simulation (LES) combined with weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) parameterization. The WTG approximates large-scale circulation by inducing domain-mean subsidence to counter buoyancy perturbations relative to a reference thermodynamic profile. A stationary sea-salt sprayer perturbs transitioning clouds over a Lagrangian domain.Results show that the cloud response to aerosol injection differs significantly depending on whether stratified adjustments in the large-scale circulation in response to buoyancy perturbations are considered. Aerosol injection suppresses precipitation and enhances entrainment in both cases. Additionally, reduced surface sensible heat flux by precipitation suppression weakens boundary layer turbulence. Without the WTG, cloud-top height rises without a compensating adjustment in subsidence, delaying drizzle-induced stratocumulus thinning (“drizzle-depletion” feedback) by several days.With the WTG, intensified subsidence restrains cloud-top growth and accelerates stratocumulus thinning, leading to reduced boundary layer turbulence by weakened longwave cloud-top cooling and increased susceptibility to cloud breakup. For lightly precipitating clouds, aerosol injection accelerates the SCT by enhancing cloud thinning through warming driven by increased entrainment (“deepening–warming” mechanism). For heavily precipitating clouds, where the SCT is dominated by drizzle-depletion feedback, aerosol injection delays the SCT marginally as intensified subsidence amplifies the deepening–warming mechanism.These findings suggest that ignoring large-scale circulation adjustments in limited-domain models may overestimate aerosol cooling effects by ∼15–30 W m−2."

AEH retrievals are only performed when aerosol optical depth is larger than 0.3. The retrieval results show significant estimations by comparing the aerosol height from the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument. 
 An algorithm for aerosol effective height (AEH) was developed for operational use with observations from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). The retrieval technique uses the slant column density of the oxygen dimer (O2–O2) at 477 nm, which is converted into AEH after retrieval of aerosol and surface optical properties from GEMS operational algorithms. The retrieved AEHs provide continuous vertical information on severe dust plumes over East Asia with reasonably good validation results and the collection of plume height information for anthropogenic aerosol pollutants over India. Compared to the AEH retrieved from Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), the retrieval results show a bias of −0.03 km with a standard deviation of 1.4 km for the AEH difference over the GEMS observation domain from January to June 2021. The AEH difference depends on aerosol optical properties and surface reflectance. Compared to the aerosol layer height obtained from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), differences of 1.50±1.08 km, 1.59±1.22 km, and 1.71±1.24 km were obtained for pixels with single-scattering albedo (SSA) <0.90, 0.90 < SSA < 0.95, and SSA > 0.95, respectively."

This study investigated the compositions, formation pathways, and sources of OSs at a coastal site of the South China Sea in summer. Thirty-three OS species were quantified by using an UHPLC-Orbitrap MS and were assessed under marine and terrestrial air mass origins. iOSs (isoprene-derived OSs) ranked the highest, followed by C2/C3 OSs (OSs with two or three carbon atoms). The formation of iOSs was influenced by aerosol pH and their major precursor (isoprene), with photochemical processes playing a significant role in terrestrial transport. Different from urban conditions, sea breezes favored the formation of 2-MAS (C4H7O7S–) over 2-MTS (C5H11O7S–) even under low NOx levels, mainly attributed to the high temperature and dominance of aqueous oxidation. Compared to terrestrial transport, the formation of C2/C3 OSs was more favored than that of iOSs under the influence of sea breezes. Marine biogenic emission was quantified as an important source of C2/C3 OSs. This study enhances our understanding of the influence of both terrestrial and marine factors on the formation pathways of atmospheric OSs and emphasizes the significant contribution of marine biogenic sources to OSs."

The particles of soot have a complex fractal morphology, but in atmospheric aerosol models, they are commonly represented as spheres. We show that taking the fractal morphology into consideration significantly accelerates the rate of aging of soot aerosol in the atmosphere because concave surfaces in fractal particles promote rapid capillary condensation of trace gas chemicals produced from the photochemical oxidation of volatile organic compounds, even when vapors of such chemicals are subsaturated. Our results suggest that, by capillary condensation alone, these chemicals can transform hydrophobic soot particles into cloud condensation nuclei within a few hours. Additionally, capillary condensation induces the compaction of fractal soot even at a moderately elevated relative humidity, changing its transport and optical properties. Representing an important mechanism of atmospheric aging, capillary condensation has a profound effect on the evolution of direct and indirect climate impacts of soot at a higher rate than previously recognized, and hence, it must be incorporated into atmospheric aerosol models to improve their predictive power."

However, large uncertainties exist for marine CHBr3 emission estimations, especially around Asia. In this study, we establish a new marine emission inventory of CHBr3, considering the physical and biogeochemical forces in the interaction of the ocean and atmosphere. The surface seawater concentrations are predicted based on expanded in situ CHBr3 measurements and the machine-learning approach. The marine CHBr3 emission is estimated to be 55.9 Gg Br yr–1 around Asia, accounting for 20.4% of the global total. Our estimate is 18.7 Gg Br yr–1 higher than the previously widely used bottom-up emission inventory, primarily due to discrepancies in the Western Pacific and the South China Sea. Higher estimated marine CHBr3 emissions significantly affect the stratospheric bromine radicals and ozone over Asia, leading to a maximum increase of 13.6% in Br and 12.2% in BrO concentrations and thus up to a 2.5 ppbv reduction in stratospheric ozone.

We conducted two ship‐based incubation experiments in the Northwest Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans to explore how dust deposition, ocean acidification, and microplastic exposure impact these compounds. Our results demonstrate that these stressors not only alter phytoplankton community but also modify per‐cell DMSP production capacity and DMSP degradation pathways, subsequently influencing DMSP, DMS, and MeSH concentrations. CS2's response closely mirrors phytoplankton abundance and species. Initial physical‐chemical conditions, such as carbonate system and nutrient availability, may mediate the sensitivity of phytoplankton and sulfur compounds to environmental shifts. This study enhances our understanding of biogenic sulfur responses in dynamic marine ecosystems and provides essential basis for future climate modeling."

 Brown carbon (BrC) holds scientific significance by influencing radiative balance, cloud condensation dynamics, and regional air quality. This study demonstrated that heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) emit substantially higher levels of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols under aggressive conditions, such as frequent acceleration and high-speed phases, by investigating the emission profiles, formula distribution, and chromophore characteristics under various driving conditions. A non-targeted analysis of BrC was performed using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled with a soft electrospray ionization source. The light absorption properties were assessed and revealed significantly higher light absorption during frequent acceleration and high-speed phases compared to low-speed phases. Formula distribution analysis highlighted a substantial presence of nitrogen-containing species, constituting 53–65% of the identified peaks, with high O/N ratios (

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108207,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要探讨了东南太平洋典型区域单层层积云的分布特征和成因，并分析了其辐射效应。研究使用了CloudSat卫星数据（2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR和2B-FLXHR-LIDAR产品）以及ERA5数据，研究了层积云的季节性变化、形成机制以及辐射效应。研究结果表明，层积云的分布与整层湿度（TCWV）和低层大气稳定性（LTS）密切相关，气溶胶浓度也会影响其辐射效应。云几何厚度（CGT）是关键的气象指标，影响云辐射效应。该研究有助于改进云辐射强迫的模拟，从而减少气候变化评估中的不确定性。虽然没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但卫星观测数据的使用以及对气溶胶和云辐射效应的关注，使其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Stratiform clouds', 'CloudSat', 'Radiative forcing', 'Aerosol optical depth', 'Cloud fraction', 'Shortwave radiation', 'Longwave radiation', 'Sea surface temperature', 'Lower Tropospheric Stability', 'ERA5']",Ximing Deng;Yong Han;Chunsong Lu;Xinxin Xie;Yurong Zhang;Tianwei Lu;Li Dong;Qicheng Zhou,Distributional characteristics and causes of single-layer stratiform clouds over typical region in the southeastern Pacific Ocean,"•Single-layer stratiform cloud distribution varies seasonally with humidity and stability driven by sea surface temperature. •Cloud fraction affects shortwave radiation more than longwave, depending on the cloud geometric thickness. 
 sSingle-layer Stratiform clouds (Sc), as the most common cloud system for stratiform clouds, plays an important role in global radiative balance due to their duration and extensive coverage. However, there are still substantial uncertainties in their formation and radiative forcing. In this paper, we use the Cloudsat 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product from 2007 to 2010 to distinguish it from other cloud types. ERA5 data and 2B-FLXHR-LIDAR from the same period are used to investigate its formation mechanisms and radiative effects. The results show that the single-layer Sc exhibits obvious seasonal variation in the spatial distribution, which is closely related to the distribution of whole-layer humidity (TCWV) and Lower Tropospheric Stability (LTS). Different aerosol concentrations alter their effects. When aerosol optical depth (AOD) is less than 0.12, increased TCWV suppresses cloud formation, amplified by stronger LTS. However, as AOD > 0.14, TCWV promotes cloud fraction (CF), while LTS weakens this effect. CGT is a key meteorological indicator that, when fixed, reduces the impact of meteorological factors (e.g., TCWV, LTS) on cloud structure, enabling a clearer assessment of CF' s effect on cloud radiative effect (CRE). The results show CF has a larger impact on shortwave radiative forcing (CRE_SW) than on longwave (CRE_SW), but its effect depends on the cloud geometric thickness (CGT). When the cloud layer is thin (CGT < 310.3 m), the CF enhances the cloud shortwave and longwave radiative effect, resulting in a regional cooling effect (slope_CERnet = −25.2); the thick cloud layer (CGT > 310.3 m) will inhibit CRE_SW but enhance CRE_LW, thereby diminishing the cooling effect (slope_CERnet = −19.89). This study will help improve the simulation of cloud radiative forcing, thereby reducing uncertainties in climate change assessments."
