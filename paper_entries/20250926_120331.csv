10.5194/acp-25-11199-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了热带积云对流云中暖相微物理过程的演变，并使用极化遥感反演、原位测量和基于热力学的框架来评估液滴大小分布的演变。虽然该研究主要关注云微物理过程，但它利用了机载遥感技术（如研究扫描偏振计RSP）来获取云顶的液滴有效半径、有效方差和数浓度等信息。这些参数与大气气溶胶和云的相互作用密切相关，进而影响气候。此外，该研究还探讨了如何将高分辨率模拟结果扩展到大规模模型和天基观测平台，这意味着它与卫星观测和大气成分分析等大气环境遥感技术具有一定的相关性。通过对气溶胶廓线进行模拟，并与原位测量数据进行对比，该研究有助于理解气溶胶对云滴形成和演变的影响，从而为改进地球系统模型中的相关参数化方案提供依据，并最终提升对气候变化的预测能力。,"['cloud droplet effective radius', 'effective variance', 'number concentration', 'polarimetric retrievals', 'in situ measurements', 'large-eddy simulation', 'cumulus congestus', 'aerosol profiles', 'Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP)', 'satellite observations', 'warm-phase microphysics']",McKenna W.

This study demonstrates a benchmark framework for using novel airborne measurements and retrievals to constrain high-resolution simulations of moderately deep cumulus clouds and pathways for scaling results to large-scale models and space-based observational platforms. 
 Owing to uncertainties in convective microphysics processes, improving parameterizations in Earth system models (ESMs) can benefit from observationally constrained cases suitable for scaling between cloud-resolving models and ESMs. We propose a benchmark large-eddy simulation (LES) cumulus congestus case study from the NASA Cloud, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) for evaluating and improving ESMs in single-column model (SCM) mode. We seek observational constraints using novel polarimetric retrievals and in situ cloud microphysics measurements. Simulations using bulk and bin microphysics initialized with observed aerosol profiles are compared to cloud-top retrievals of cloud droplet effective radius (Reff), effective variance (νeff), and number concentration (Nd) from the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Both schemes reproduce characteristics of cloud-top Nd and Reff that increase and decrease with altitude, respectively. Cloud-top Nd is low-biased relative to RSP retrievals in both schemes, potentially due to limitations in both simulations and retrieval assumptions. Cloud-top Reff is low-biased in the bulk scheme but reasonably reproduced by the bin scheme. Profiles of Nd and Reff are sensitive to the collision–coalescence process and the vertical variation in aerosol size distribution. Comparison of simulated and in situ droplet size distributions (DSDs) shows that, to first order, integrated moments are always sensitive to sizes <∼30 µm and can also be sensitive to larger sizes if the DSDs are sufficiently broad, with implications for the assumed maximum observed size retrieved by the RSP. The bin scheme captures the observed extended tail of the DSD, while the bulk scheme is unable to due to parametric constraints. Differences in expected relationships between in situ measurements of cloud cores and cloud-top retrievals by RSP demonstrate difficulty in constraining well the case presented herein. Finally, a thermal-tracking framework demonstrates that the dilution of  Nd throughout a thermal's lifetime is heavily determined by collision–coalescence and the height-varying aerosol distribution and that, in the absence of these, the impact of entrainment on diluting  Nd is largely offset by secondary activation. Implications for evaluating warm-phase convective microphysics schemes in ESMs and translating results for use on global, space-based polarimetry platforms are discussed."
10.5194/acp-25-11261-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文关注美国犹他州Uinta盆地冬季光化学机制的季节性变化，特别是臭氧的形成与前体物（VOC和NOx）之间的关系。论文通过模型分析表明，盆地的臭氧系统对VOC和NOx的敏感性随季节变化，主要受太阳辐射和前体物浓度变化的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，这些都是大气环境遥感技术的重要应用领域。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性。,"['ozone', 'VOC', 'NOx', 'photochemical regime', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Marc L. Mansfield;Seth N. Lyman,"Seasonal trends in the wintertime photochemical regime of the Uinta Basin, Utah, USA","Precursor compounds must be present in the lower atmosphere for ozone to form. Ozone abatement strategies focus on reducing such precursors, but measuring and modeling are necessary to determine the most efficient way to do this. We show that the sensitivity of ozone to various precursors changes over the course of the winter. We also argue that similar seasonal changes probably occur in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Several lines of evidence indicate that the photochemical regime, i.e., the degree to which ozone production is either VOC- or NOx-limited, varies with season in the Northern Hemisphere. For most regions, the question is patently academic, since excessive ozone occurs only in summer. However, the Uinta Basin in Utah, USA, exhibits ozone in excess of regulatory standards in both winter and summer. We have performed extensive Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM) box modeling to better understand these trends. The models indicate that, in late December, the Basin's ozone system is VOC-sensitive and either NOx-insensitive or NOx-saturated. Sensitivity to NOx grows throughout the winter, and, in early March, the system is about equally sensitive to VOC and NOx. The main driver for this trend is the increase in available solar energy as indicated by the noontime solar zenith angle (SZA). A secondary driver is a decrease in precursor concentrations throughout the winter, which decrease because of, firstly, a dilution effect as thermal inversions weaken and, secondly, an emission effect because certain emission sources are stronger at colder temperatures. On the other hand, temperature and absolute humidity (AH) are not important direct drivers of the trend."

Eissner;David B. Mechem;Yi Jin;Virendra P. Ghate;James F. Booth,Identifying synoptic controls on boundary layer thermodynamic and cloud properties in a regional forecast model,"Low-level clouds have important radiative feedbacks and can occur in a range of meteorological conditions, yet our knowledge and prediction of them are insufficient. We evaluate model forecasts of low-level cloud properties across a cold front and the associated environments that they form in. The model represents the meteorological conditions well and produces broken clouds behind the cold front in areas of strong surface forcing, large stability, and large-scale subsiding motion. 
 Although most of our understanding of boundary layer cloudiness is based on idealized, subtropical, barotropic marine environments, boundary layer clouds exist across a range of conditions. In this study, we use the Naval Research Laboratory's Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) and an automated cold-front-relative analysis framework to explore the boundary layer structure associated with low clouds across a transect through the cold front of a midlatitude synoptic cyclone. The model credibly captures boundary layer structure in line with conceptual models of midlatitude cyclones and ground-based observations at Graciosa Island in the Azores. The warm sector is conditionally unstable, with clouds that are too shallow and with too little liquid water, compared to cloud property retrievals from satellite and surface-based instruments. The cold-frontal region exhibits convection associated with weak stability and ascent. Northwest of the cold front, the boundary layer is well mixed, deeper, and capped by a strong inversion maintained by large-scale subsidence. Simulated clouds in frontal and post-frontal regions are mostly too thick, with too much liquid water and too little cloud base drizzle. The post-frontal clouds are associated with grid-scale updrafts, which appear to be the model's attempt to represent mesoscale organization of cellular convection typically observed in the cold sector of midlatitude cyclones. The deep, well-mixed post-frontal boundary layers and cloudiness are maintained by strong surface fluxes, as in cold air outbreaks. Our analysis framework serves as a unique approach to model verification, and our results offer insights into differences in boundary layer cloud behavior between subtropical and synoptic cold-sector regimes."

Piedehierro;André Welti,Homogeneous ice nucleation in adsorbed water films: a theoretical approach,"The mechanisms of ice nucleation at temperatures below 235 K have remained unclear for the past century. We suggest that ice nucleation is caused by the freezing of water adsorbed on aerosol surfaces. To test this hypothesis, we derived theoretical equations to predict the exact atmospheric conditions under which ice nucleation occurs. Our predictions agree well with experiments. The new theory thus provides a basis for an improved description of ice nucleation in the atmosphere. 
 Ice nucleation plays a critical role in cloud formation and atmospheric processes, influencing precipitation and climate. In this study, we present a theoretical approach for describing homogeneous ice nucleation within adsorbed water films on insoluble substrates and suggest that it may be a mechanism for deposition ice nucleation with non-porous ice nuclei that induce ice premelting. Our theory is based on the Frenkel–Halsey–Hill (FHH) adsorption model, which characterizes the substrate–adsorbate interaction, and the classical nucleation theory of homogeneous freezing, which describes the probability of ice formation. We use the theory to model the melting point (MP), critical ice nucleus size, and nucleation rates as functions of adsorbed water film thickness and substrate properties. Our results indicate that the melting point depression can be as much as 5 K on hydrophilic substrates when the thickness of the water film is 1 nm. The onset temperature for homogeneous ice nucleation (235 K for cloud droplets) can shift 1–2 K lower in adsorbed films. At temperatures below 235 K, the humidity at which ice nucleation occurs is determined by the condition that the adsorbed water film must be thick enough to accommodate the critical ice nucleus.  Comparisons of calculated relative humidity conditions with experimental ice nucleation data for silica particles show promising agreement, validating the FHH model as a framework for describing deposition ice nucleation in the atmosphere."

These findings provide critical insights into the formation mechanisms of Cl-OOMs in polluted settings. 
 Chlorine (Cl) atoms generated from the photolysis of atmospheric reactive chlorine species can rapidly react with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), forming chlorine- and non-chlorine-containing low-volatile oxygenated organic molecules. Yet, the formation mechanisms of chlorine-containing oxygenated organic molecules (Cl-OOMs) from reactions of Cl atoms with aromatics in the presence and absence of NOx are not fully understood. Here, we investigated Cl-OOMs formation from Cl-initiated reactions of three typical aromatics (i.e., toluene, m-xylene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB)) in the laboratory and searched for ambient gaseous Cl-OOMs in suburban Shanghai. From our laboratory experiments, 19 Cl-containing peroxyl radicals and a series of Cl-OOMs originating from the Cl-addition-initiated reaction were detected, which provides direct evidence that the Cl-addition-initiated reaction is a non-negligible pathway. In addition, a total of 51 gaseous Cl-OOMs were identified during the winter in suburban Shanghai, 38 of which were also observed in laboratory experiments, hinting that Cl-initiated reaction of aromatics could serve as a source of Cl-OOMs in an anthropogenically influenced atmosphere. Toxicity evaluation of these Cl-OOMs shows potential adverse health effects. These findings demonstrate that Cl-OOMs can be efficiently formed via the Cl-addition pathway in the reactions between aromatics and Cl atoms and some of these Cl-OOMs could be toxic."

We studied a photovoltaic power plant's impact on climate and soil. The panels increased radiation, reduced wind, and caused daytime warming but nighttime cooling. Soil stayed colder and wetter, extending the frozen period by 50 days. These changes may help stabilize permafrost but could also affect biodiversity and water cycles. 
 Rising global energy demand and the transition to low-carbon sources have driven the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, introducing significant land-use changes with largely unexplored ecological consequences. This study examined the microclimatic and soil hydrothermal impacts of a pastoral-integrated PV power plant in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Year-round observations from two 10 m towers, located inside and outside the PV power plant, revealed that PV installations increased annual net radiation by 28.9 %, while reducing albedo and wind speed by 31.6 % and 36.2 %, respectively. Air temperature responses were highly asymmetrical, with daytime and summer warming but nighttime and winter cooling. The PV power plant induced strong spatial heterogeneity in soil temperature and moisture: At 5 cm depth, PV array gaps exhibited cold and moist conditions, whereas areas beneath the panels were cold and dry. These changes extended the soil frozen period by approximately 50 d and reduced the soil moisture depletion rate by 1.3 to 3.5 times compared to the reference site. These findings indicate that the PV power plant can alter local energy and water balances in ways that may buffer ecosystem responses to climate warming. However, further multi-year studies are needed to evaluate their long-term impacts on vegetation dynamics, carbon fluxes, and permafrost processes."

 Aerosol–radiation interactions play a crucial role in air pollution and climate change, with scattering being the dominant process. The complex refractive index of organic aerosols is essential for accurately simulating these interactions, with the scattering capability being predominantly determined by the real part of the refractive index (mr). Prevailing models often assume a constant mr for organic aerosols (e.g., 1.53 or 1.45) at different wavelengths or claim that the mr of primary organic aerosols (POAs) is substantially higher than that of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) (e.g., 1.63 for POA and 1.43 for SOA), largely due to a lack of direct measurements. This study employs direct measurements from the DMA-SP2 system to demonstrate a strong diameter dependence of dry state mr at 1064 nm, closely associated with primary aerosol emissions and secondary aerosol formation. Source apportionment of aerosol size distributions reveals that the mr of SOA is substantially higher than that of POA. Optical closure calculations, based on extensive dry-state observations of aerosol scattering at 525 nm, size distributions, and chemical compositions, confirm that SOA formation can enhance aerosol mr substantially (from lower than 1.45 when POA dominates to higher than 1.55 when SOA dominates). These results challenge existing model assumptions. In addition, further analysis reveals the mr of SOA increases substantially with oxidation level, which is likely associated with multiphase SOA formation. Our analysis recommends mr values at 525 nm of 1.37 for POA and 1.59 for SOA in urban regions with emissions and meteorological conditions similar to those at the observation site in Guangzhou, a city located in humid southern China. These findings underscore that current modeling practices may introduce substantial inaccuracies in estimating the radiative effects of organic aerosols."

Our model generates hourly PM2.5 maps with high spatial resolution, by combining satellite data, ground measurements, geophysical model data, and different geographical indicators. The model properly accounts for spatial and temporal variability of the urban pollution levels, and can be highly beneficial for air quality monitoring and health protection. 
 Understanding PM2.5 variability at fine scale is crucial to assess urban pollution impact on the population and to inform the policy-making process. PM2.5 in-situ measurements at ground level cannot offer gapless spatial coverage, while current satellite retrievals generally cannot offer both high-spatial and high-temporal resolution, with night-time estimation posing further challenges. This study tackles these difficulties, introducing an innovative deep learning data fusion method to estimate hourly PM2.5 maps using a grid with cell size 100 m × 100 m on urban areas. We combine low resolution geophysical model data, high resolution geographical indicators, PM2.5 in-situ ground stations measurements and PM2.5 retrieved at satellite overpass. To simultaneously treat spatial and temporal correlations in our data, we deploy a 3D U-Net based neural network model. To evaluate the model, we select the city of Paris, France, in the year 2019 as our study region and time. Quantitative assessment of the model is carried out using the ground station data with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Our method outperforms MERRA-2 PM2.5 estimates, predicting PM2.5 hourly (R2 = 0.51, RMSE = 6.58 µg m−3), daily (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 4.92 µg m−3), and monthly (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 2.87 µg m−3).

This study combines satellite millimeter-wave radar and radiometer observations to estimate the vertical distributions of physical parameters of ice particles such as mass, size, and number densities. CPR radar and GPM radiometer observations together reduce the estimation errors of the physical parameters and provide information on the optimal ice particle shape. 
 Satellite remote sensing of frozen hydrometeors in deep convective systems is essential for understanding precipitation systems and the formation of upper-level clouds. To reduce uncertainties in ice cloud microphysical properties inside convective clouds, a combined use of millimeter-wave sensors sensitive to frozen particles in deep convective clouds is a promising strategy. This study uses the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) to retrieve the vertical profiles of ice water content (IWC), number concentration (Nt), and mass-weighted diameter (Dm). A new retrieval method is developed by a combination of a deep neural network (DNN) and an optimal estimation method (OEM). In the first step of the algorithm, an initial guess is estimated by DNN based on an a priori database, followed by the next step where OEM seeks a more optimal frozen hydrometer profile.The retrieval performance is evaluated against selected match-up observations of CloudSat and GPM. The combined use of CPR and GMI observations reduces retrieval errors compared to the CPR-only observations. The retrieved frozen hydrometer profiles excellently reproduce CPR reflectivity and GMI brightness temperatures (Tb) when computed by forward simulations. The Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) reflectivity is also reasonably reproduced, indicating some ability to retrieve large snow and graupel particles detectable by the low-frequency radars. A significant spread in simulated Tb is found for large ice water paths (IWPs) among different ice habit models tested, of which the optimal models are dendrite snowflake and soft sphere for the ice density model used in this algorithm. The combined algorithm developed by this work implies the potential of passive and active millimeter-wave instruments for retrieving multiple aspects of the cloud ice properties when combined in tandem. Future work will incorporate new satellite missions, including EarthCARE Doppler millimeter-wave radar and submillimeter-wave radiometers such as Ice Cloud Imager."

We propose a novel machine learning framework for wind profile correction and the Aeolus satellite is used to verify the reliability of the algorithm further to enhance data reliability in meteorological remote sensing. 
 Doppler wind Lidars (DWLs) have been widely used to detect wind vector variations, based on ground monitoring of atmospheric boundary layer and wind shear. This study evaluates the performance between three DWLs and in situ balloon radiosonde. Lidars data comparison focuses on low altitudes (height <2 km) from July to September 2021 from three producers: MSD (Minshida), CUIT (homemade), and WP (windprofile) Lidars. Within the research height range, comparisons show the root mean square errors (RMSE) for wind speed were 1.11, 4.45, and 5.15 m s−1, while wind direction RMSE were shown at 49.83, 82.89, and 84.87°, respectively. The measurement accuracy decreases with the altitude increase (up to 2 km). The Lidar performance requires a certain amount of aerosol backscattering, when PM2.5 ranges within 35–50 µg m−3, MSD Lidar exhibited the highest wind speed correlation (R2=0.82) with radiosonde, and the wind direction accuracy observed with the three Lidars is enhanced with the increase of aerosol concentration, indicating that particle loading is the critical factor affecting the wind profile. Lidar performance varied significantly with planetary boundary layer heights (PBLH), particularly, the Lidar performance is relatively optimal when the PBLH within 500–750 m, with the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of wind speed are 0.97, 0.92, and 0.72, while the wind direction is shown at 0.98, 0.75, and 0.70, respectively. The vertical relationship between cloud base height (CBH) and PBLH had also varied influences on the Lidar measurements. Machine learning was used to remove anomalies and complement missing values, the random forest (RF) demonstrated superior performance, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93(CUIT) and 0.90(WP) in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. RF-based correction of CUIT data enhanced the R2 from 0.42 to 0.65. The R2 between the RF-based CUIT and Aeolus satellite data was 0.83, indicating that the method effectively improved data, even in circumstances of anomalies. We proposed a new correction algorithm combined with the isolation forest (IF) and RF to handle high-dimensional and incomplete datasets. Our procedure could increase the Lidar measurement quality of wind."

Here we present a daily 1 km shortwave albedo product for Antarctic sea ice from 2012 to 2021, based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflectance data. The albedo for missing pixels due to cloud cover was also reconstructed. This dataset can be used to assess changes in Antarctic sea ice, radiation budget, and the strength of sea ice albedo feedback, as well as their potential interconnections. 
 Sea ice albedo is a critical parameter for quantifying the energy budget in the Antarctic region. High spatiotemporal resolution sea ice albedo product is essential for Antarctic climate and environmental research. In this study, based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflectance data, we use the Multiband Reflectance Iteration (MBRI) algorithm to calculate sea ice albedo. This algorithm fully utilizes multi-band observations from single-angle/date observed information to correct the anisotropy of the sea ice surface. Additionally, spatiotemporal information is utilized to reconstruct albedo under cloudy-sky conditions, while correcting for cloud radiative forcing effects. A new daily seamless Antarctic sea ice albedo product with a 1 km resolution is then generated for the period 2012 to 2021. Monte Carlo simulations show that the average retrieval uncertainty of this product is 0.022, with higher uncertainty in backward observations. MBRI albedo product was validated using in situ measurements from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS). The results show that the bias is 0.02, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.071. After upscaling to 25 km resolution and applying a 5 d temporal aggregation, the RMSE decreased to below 0.055. Compared to existing albedo products, the MBRI product exhibits improved spatial continuity due to the reconstruction of cloudy-sky pixels. Statistical analysis shows that albedo under cloudy-sky conditions is higher than under clear-sky conditions (mean difference: 0.035–0.064).

Results show rising winter temperatures since 2013, increasing acidification at Blainville-sur-Mer, and nutrient shifts, with high ammonium in the East and declining phosphates.

 This data paper presents a harmonized and quality-controlled dataset resulting from 24 years (2000–2024) of monthly monitoring at three coastal stations in Normandy, France: Blainville-sur-Mer, Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, and Utah Beach. The dataset includes measurements of key physico-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen), biogeochemical variables (dissolved nutrients: nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and silicate), and biological indicators (chlorophyll a concentration). Sampling was conducted using consistent protocols across stations, allowing for long-term comparison. All data have undergone validation and standardization to ensure their usability for environmental assessment and modeling purposes. The dataset provides valuable insights into the evolution of coastal water quality under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Notable trends include increasing winter temperatures (especially since 2010), progressive ocean acidification at Blainville-sur-Mer, and changing nutrient regimes across the region, with a marked phosphate decline and spatial contrasts in nutrient limitation (phosphorus-limited on the East coast, nitrogen-limited on the West coast). These long-term observations are critical for understanding ecosystem dynamics, supporting coastal management strategies, and informing sustainable aquaculture development. The dataset is openly available and intended to support further interdisciplinary research in marine science and environmental policy (SMEL, 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15058835)."

Moreover, the employed radar and rain gauge datasets and the algorithms needed to produce this real-time radar product are described. 
 The Dutch real-time gauge-adjusted radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) product provides 5 min accumulations every 5 min on a ∼1 km2 grid covering the Netherlands and the area around it (∼4.5×105 km2). It plays a key role in hydrological decision-support systems and as input for nowcasts in order to inform decision makers. Major changes to the production of this QPE product were implemented on 31 January 2023, and include (polarimetric) fuzzy logic clutter removal, rain-induced attenuation correction, and vertical profile of reflectivity correction. Moreover, the mean-field bias rain gauge adjustment was replaced by a spatially variable rain gauge adjustment. We evaluate the potential quality improvement resulting from these changes by comparing the last year of the old and the first year of the renewed QPE product. Clutter leading to overestimation in the old radar product is effectively removed in the renewed radar product. The evaluation against rain gauge accumulations shows a strong improvement. The average underestimation decreases by about 10 percentage points to 15 % over the Netherlands. Improvements of the statistics are clear for the daily precipitation over a large part of the QPE product domain, but also show the potential for incorporating rain gauge accumulations outside the Netherlands. The 1 h and daily extremes over the Netherlands are also better captured by the renewed product. Improvements in daily precipitation accumulations for the renewed product are stronger in the winter period than in the summer period. Finally, it is recommended to include Belgian and German rain gauge data in the product.

This dataset offers a valuable resource for studying mountain ecosystems, supporting Earth system modeling, and predicting how soils respond to environmental change. 
 Datasets of soil multi-element concentrations are essential for advancing our understanding of ecological functioning and responses to global change in mountain regions. However, the paucity of such datasets represents a fundamental impediment to accurately assess and predict biogeochemical processes in these sensitive ecosystems. Here, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset comprising more than 1300 soil samples collected from 166 sites across 30 mountain regions in China, spanning five major climatic zones and representative vegetation types. Soil samples were systematically collected from three standardized horizons (organic, surface mineral, and parent material), and analyzed for the concentrations of 24 elements, including macronutrients (e.g., phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium), micronutrients (e.g., iron, molybdenum, manganese, copper), and trace metals (e.g., cadmium, chromium, lead, antimony). To support integrated Earth system analyses, the dataset is accompanied by key site-specific environmental variables, including climate parameters (temperature, precipitation, aridity index), normalized difference vegetation index, soil physicochemical properties (pH, moisture, bulk density), soil type, parent rock type, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and chemical index of alteration. The dataset reveals significant vertical stratification in element distributions, with organic horizon enriched in biogenic elements, and deeper horizons dominated by lithogenic components. Spatial patterns along latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal gradients underscore the influence of climate and geology on soil chemistry.

Mesoscale features like eddies and fronts are crucial to this but are often unresolved in models due to computational limits. We built a regional NEMO model of the Southern Ocean at 8 km resolution, BIOPERIANT12, which simulates ocean, ice, and biogeochemistry. This helps us investigate dynamics such as how storms shape surface ocean structure and biology, ultimately affecting atmosphere–ocean carbon exchange. 
 We present BIOPERIANT12, a regional 1/12° ocean–ice–biogeochemical model configuration of the Southern Ocean (SO) based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean platform. It is designed to investigate mean state, seasonal cycle, and upper ocean (< 500 m) dynamics, with a particular focus on processes influencing carbon, heat exchange, biogeochemical mechanisms, and the assumptions underlying physical–biogeochemical model parameterisations within the SO. Over the analysis period 2000–2009, the model demonstrates a stable and realistic upper ocean mean state compared to observation-based products. We use ocean biomes to delineate the major subregions and evaluate the biogeochemical properties of the model, including surface chlorophyll and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. BIOPERIANT12 captures key spatial and temporal features of SO biogeochemistry (BGC), though it tends to overestimate biological biomass and underrepresents high-frequency variability. The model shows skill in reproducing large-scale patterns and seasonal cycles across biomes, offering insights into regional dynamics that are often obscured in coarser models. Despite its limitations, BIOPERIANT12 provides a valuable high-resolution framework for process studies, model–data intercomparisons, and future investigations into mesoscale influences on carbon and heat dynamics.

Its structure is informed by the physical and chemical principles of the atmosphere, allowing it to learn and replicate complex atmospheric processes. FastCTM demonstrated matching accuracy to traditional models with less computational demand. It also provides analysis of how different atmospheric processes contribute to air quality changes. 
 Chemical-transport models (CTMs) are indispensable for air-quality assessment and policy development, yet their operational use is hampered by high computational cost. We present FastCTM, a physics-informed neural-network emulator that rapidly predicts hourly concentrations of ten key pollutant variables: major PM2.5 species (SO42-, NO3-, NH4-, organic matter, elemental carbon, crustal material), coarse PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. FastCTM embeds five process-specific neural modules – primary emissions, horizontal transport, turbulent diffusion, chemical reactions and deposition within a unified framework. Given 1 h initial condition data, FastCTM can simulate future 24 h concentrations for ten air pollutants using corresponding meteorological fields and emissions as input. Trained on 2018–2022 WRF-CMAQ forecasts over China and evaluated on 2023 data, FastCTM reproduces CMAQ with mean RMSE (µg m−3) of 9.1, 11.9, 4.4, 4.0, 48.9, 10.9 and R2 of 0.80, 0.81, 0.80, 0.83, 0.90, 0.70 for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3, respectively. Sensitivity tests confirm physically plausible responses to temperature, wind speed, boundary-layer height and precursor emissions. The modular architecture enables quantitative process analysis, offering CTM-like insight at GPU-accelerated speeds. In a nutshell, FastCTM provides a computationally efficient solution for air-quality simulations, sensitivity analysis, and process attribution with high accuracy and physical consistency."

For highly variable quantities, we demonstrate that a model might perform evaluation poorly or favourably compared to the single realisation of the world that the observations represent, highlighting the need for large ensembles for model evaluation. 
 Observations can be considered as one realisation of the climate system that we live in. To provide a fair comparison of climate models with observations, one must use multiple realisations or ensemble members from a single model and assess where the observations sit within the ensemble spread. Single model initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) are valuable tools for such an evaluation. Here, we present the new Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive (MMLEAv2) which has been extended to include 18 models and 16 two-dimensional variables. Data in this archive have been remapped to a common 2.5 × 2.5° grid for ease of inter-model comparison. We additionally introduce the newly updated Climate Variability Diagnostics Package version 6 (CVDPv6), which is designed specifically for use with LEs. The CVDPv6 computes and displays the major modes of climate variability as well as long-term trends and climatologies in models and observations based on a variety of fields. This tool creates plots of both individual ensemble members, and the ensemble mean of each LE, including observational rank plots, pattern correlations, and root mean square difference metrics displayed in both graphical and statistical output that is saved to a data repository. By applying the CVDPv6 to the MMLEAv2, we highlight its use for model evaluation against observations and for model intercomparisons. We demonstrate that for highly variable metrics a model might evaluate poorly or favourably compared to the single realisation the observations represent, depending on the chosen ensemble member. This behaviour emphasises that LEs provide a much fairer model evaluation than a single ensemble member, ensemble mean, or multi-model mean. By leveraging the combination of the CVDPv6 and MMLEAv2 presented in this paper we can determine which climate variables need a LE for fair assessment against observations."

These improvements make GEOCLIM7 a unique, powerful tool, devised as an extension of GCMs, to investigate the Earth system evolution at timescales (several million years) and with processes that could not be simulated otherwise. We present  a complete description of the model, whose current state gathers features that have been developed and published in several articles since its creation and some that are original contributions of this article, like the seafloor sediment routing scheme and the inclusion of orbital parameters.

The Retina v2 algorithm creates high-resolution pollution maps by integrating satellite and local measurements with an air quality model. Easily portable to other cities, it balances accuracy with low computational demands, matching or outperforming complex dispersion models and data-heavy machine learning. Satellite data proves especially valuable in cities with sparse or no monitoring networks. 
 Urban air pollution poses a significant health risk, with over half the global population living in cities where air quality often exceeds World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. A comprehensive understanding of local pollution levels is essential for addressing this issue. Recent advancements in low-cost sensors and satellite instruments offer cost-efficient complements to reference stations but integrating these diverse data sources in useful monitoring tools is not straightforward. This study presents the updated Retina v2 algorithm, which generates high-resolution urban air pollution maps by assimilating heterogeneous measurements into a portable urban dispersion model. Tested for NO2 concentrations in Madrid during March 2019, it shows improved speed and accuracy over its predecessor, with the ability to incorporate satellite data. Retina v2 balances performance with modest computational demands, delivering similar or better results compared to complex dispersion models and machine learning approaches requiring extensive datasets. Using only TROPOMI satellite data, citywide NO2 simulations show an RMSE of 19.3 µg m−3, with better results when hourly in-situ measurements were included. Relying on data of a single ground station can introduce biases, which can be mitigated by incorporating satellite data or multiple ground stations. Including more stations improves accuracy, with 24 stations yielding a correlation of 0.90 and an RMSE of 13.0 µg m−3. The benefit of TROPOMI diminishes when data from five or more ground stations is available, but it remains valuable for many cities which have limited monitoring networks."

Colwell,Megathrust Earthquake Legacy Linked to Changes in Widespread Potential for Methane and Iron Cycling in Glaciated Wetlands,"Freshwater wetlands are major sources of global methane emissions through biogenic methanogenesis, a process increasingly influenced by climate change. High latitude wetlands are subject to uniquely altered biogeochemical inputs due to disproportionate warming. For example, glacial meltwater delivers metal‐rich sediments that are easily reducible. Additionally, if the wetland is located upon a subduction zone, periodic and dynamic geological forces, such as megathrust earthquakes, can disrupt these systems further. To explore these interactions, we analyzed the genomic potential of microbial communities across a glaciated wetland located in an active forearc region subject to repeated megathrust ruptures. We found that sediment microbial communities contained the complete potential for methanogenesis and iron cycling, yet the relative abundance of key methanogenic genes was reduced in recently deposited freshwater sediments despite high levels of organic matter and iron. These findings suggest that megathrust fault activity and associated uplift exerts broad, abrupt change on microbial metabolic potential, and that overlying sediments reflect modern glacial input which modify the development of metabolic potential. Glacial influence likely disrupts methanogenesis by supporting communities capable of dissimilatory iron reduction, which may increase metal‐dependent methanotrophy. As climate change accelerates glacial melt, extant and newly developing microbial communities will likely respond rapidly to shifting carbon and mineral inputs, altering carbon cycling dynamics in these sensitive ecosystems. Our work links small scale microbial metabolic potential with some of the largest processes on our planet, revealing how cyclical tectonic events can overprint broad scale biogeochemistry by homogenizing microbial metabolisms and disrupting elemental cycling."

To address this, we performed grain‐size and X‐ray fluorescence scanning analyses on two cores from paleochannels in the Lower Meuse (the Netherlands). The downcore ln(Zr/Rb) ratio proves to be a reliable grain‐size proxy, allowing reconstruction of flood‐related sediment input variations. We find the flood intensity record displays a ∼300‐year cycle, synchronous to the North Atlantic Oscillation record at this band.

The MJO imposes an average amplitude variability of ∼ ${\sim} $15% in the non‐migrating diurnal tide (DE3) and 2%–5% for the migrating diurnal tide (DW1), with significant responses observed in other diurnal and semidiurnal tidal components. Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry MLT temperature tides shows no time lag to COSMIC‐2.

Throughout these 19 years, the equatorial crossing time of Terra's orbit varied by less than 1 min from its mean value. This variation created a homogeneous time series of deseasonalized and deregionalized height anomalies unaffected by sun‐glint position changes. We analyzed the changes in effective cloud height (i.e., the integral of cloud occurrence weighted by cloud‐top height) and the influence of all altitudes, from the surface to 20 km, on the effective height. We show that cloud fractions tended to decrease at low altitudes, especially in the tropics, and to increase at high altitudes for most latitudes. The globally effective height has very likely risen, at an average rate of about 1 m/yr. The rise was most significant at high latitudes, reaching 5 ± 1 m/yr between 45°N and 65°N. Tropical high clouds have risen, but this was offset by a reduction in tropical low clouds, resulting in an insignificant change in tropical effective height. The increase in effective height typically reduces the outgoing longwave radiation, thereby augmenting the cloud greenhouse effect. The observed height increase may be an adjustment to the radiative forcing of the stratosphere over 19 years that presumably causes changes in upper tropospheric stability, the tropopause, the Brewer‐Dobson circulation, etc. If so, the observed height increase should be included in modeling the effective radiative forcing."

Williams,Evaluation of Monin‐Obukhov Similarity Theory Wind Profiles in Convective Storm Environments and Cold Pools at the ARM Southern Great Plains Atmospheric Observatory,"Monin‐Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is widely used in numerical weather prediction to model surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and water vapor. However, MOST is based on assumptions of steady state and horizontally homogeneous turbulence that can lead to prediction errors in and around convective storms. To understand the nature of these errors, we used wind and eddy covariance flux measurements from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains Atmospheric Observatory to evaluate MOST wind profiles in fair‐weather and convective storm environments, specifically those of mesoscale convective systems and ordinary thunderstorms. MOST wind profiles agreed well with observations in fair‐weather cases, while in convective storm cases the theory systematically overestimated shear in cold pools after gust front passage. Surface layer stability was found to be important in assessing MOST within convective storm environments. The overestimation of wind shear in cold pools suggests the role of non‐local fluxes in transferring momentum downward. We discuss reasons for differences and agreement with past studies, and conclude with recommendations to improve prediction of surface winds and fluxes in convective storm simulations."

This study introduces the USTC Parameterized Retrieval Method (USTC‐PRM), an algorithm for retrieving profiles of aerosol extinction and trace gas concentration from MAX‐DOAS measurements. Using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTM), we evaluate the impact of various observation geometries and profile shapes on the air mass factor (AMF) and establish the look‐up table (LUT). USTC‐PRM overcomes the underestimation of high‐altitude aerosols by optimal estimation method (OEM) since it does not rely on prior profiles. The correlation between the retrieved AOD and AERONET AOD is 0.896, compared to 0.826 for the contrasted OEM. For trace gas retrieval, we propose a real‐time LUT establishment method based on retrieved aerosol profiles, significantly reducing memory requirements by over 90% (7.8 GB) and improving the correlation with in situ measurements from 0.867 to 0.911. Additionally, we introduce the concept of look‐up error table (LET) to quantify the AMF bias by retrieving it from LUT. We establish a quality evaluation system based on fitting results, LUT errors, and parameter statistics. Using synthetic data and long‐term MAX‐DOAS measurements, USTC‐PRM demonstrates high performance in retrieving profiles under various aerosol scenarios across high, medium, and low extinction levels, while also identifying abnormal situations, such as foggy and cloudy conditions. USTC‐PRM provides a robust, accurate and efficient approach for MAX‐DOAS profile retrieval, which can be utilized for studying regional transport and tracing atmospheric pollutants."

Previous studies showed that an anomalous upper‐level anticyclone and associated subsidence heating, fueled by upwind latent heat release, were the main drivers. Land‐atmosphere interactions have generally been found to play a secondary but important role; however their temporal evolution and state dependence on prior soil moisture (SM) and evaporative regimes remain largely unexplored. To assess this, we run 100 ensemble members of the heatwave with varying initial land surface conditions in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). The circulation outside the PNW is constrained to observations, ensuring that the large‐scale dynamical drivers are reproduced while local land‐atmosphere interactions are free to evolve in the PNW region under differing soil‐moisture states. While circulation largely dictates the heatwave's magnitude (peak day temperatures about 17° ${}^{\circ}$C above the climatological mean), perturbations of the SM preconditioning across a realistic range for the time of year lead to about 3° ${}^{\circ}$C spread in CESM2. We demonstrate how the land‐atmosphere interactions evolve as ensemble members fall below a critical SM threshold where evapotranspiration reduces substantially. We also investigate how an antecedent rain event might have affected this heatwave event. Finally, we simulate the same circulation induced heatwave but in a future climate state with higher greenhouse gases and drier soils. Beyond mean warming effects, drier soils increase the probability of shifting from a wet regime into a transitional regime, exacerbating and elongating the heatwave."

Root architecture reflects land cover and soil heterogeneity, enabling vegetation access to resources that vary temporally and spatially while shaping soil structure and formation. However, how land use can influence roots and soil structure relatively deep in the subsurface (>30 cm) remains poorly understood. We investigate how cropland‐related land use and subsequent vegetation recovery alter rooting dynamics and soil structure in deeper horizons. Using a large‐scale data set representing multiple land uses as a means of varying root abundance across four soil orders, we demonstrate that B horizon root loss and regeneration are linked to changes in multiple soil structural attributes deep within soil profiles. Our findings further suggest that the degree of soil development modulates the extent of structural transformations, with less‐developed soils showing greater susceptibility to root‐associated structural shifts. The greatest change in structural development and distinctness was observed in Inceptisols, while Ultisols exhibited the least change. Such soil structural changes affect water flowpaths, carbon retention, and nutrient transport throughout the subsurface. This work thus underscores the need for Earth system models to capture dynamic soil structural attributes that respond to land‐use change. We suggest that changes in deep‐rooting abundance, such as those accelerating in the Anthropocene, may be an important agent of subsurface structural change with meaningful implications for contemporary and future ecosystem feedbacks to climate."

Up to one‐third of the country's area, mostly the country's south, was flooded. Effective response to intensifying and compounding hazards requires a better understanding of these processes. We can gain insights if impact assessments include socio‐economic components and uncertainties arising from the interactions between impacts. However, the quantitative evidence from impact assessments remains limited and fragmented, due to methodological challenges and data limitations. Using the open‐source impact assessment platform CLIMADA, we study to what extent flood‐related hazards can be used to quantify displacement outcomes in a data‐limited region. Using flood depth, exposed population, and impact functions, we link flood vulnerability to displaced people. This allows us to estimate internal displacement resulting from the flood event, and to further assess how displacement varies across the region. We find that a flood depth threshold of 0.67 m, with a confidence interval (CI) from 0.35 to 1.10 m, provides a best fit to all data from Sindh province. We find a negative correlation between displacement and the degree of urbanization. By testing the performance of our model in explaining differing displacement estimates reported across Pakistan, we show the limitations of existing impact assessment frameworks. We emphasize the importance of estimating potential displacement alongside other impacts to better characterize, communicate, and ultimately mitigate the impacts of flooding hazards."

In a warming climate, sea‐level rise (SLR) is expected to change the frequency of HTF via a direct non‐linear change in the mean water level. In this study, we investigate the impacts of SLR on HTF along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the United States. We quantify the extent to which SLR is expected to exacerbate the HTF regime in the coming decades if no more flood protection is implemented. We estimate SLR at 10 km intervals using regression models, add it to numerically simulated tidal levels, and compare the results with estimated HTF thresholds. Our results provide continuous spatial coverage along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, showing a projected average rise of 0.35 ± 0.10 m in tidal levels above the mean higher high water (MHHW) by 2050, whereas Chesapeake Bay is projected to experience a greater rise of 0.39 ± 0.05 m, and Maine is expected to see a lower increase of 0.27 ± 0.08 m. This yields an increase of 10 days/year and 110 days/year in HTF hours in the years 2050 and 2100, respectively. Moreover, Pamlico Sound and Chesapeake Bay are expected to experience the most significant changes in HTF frequency, with more than 90 days of HTF by 2050s.

Here, we identified Relevant Sites for Amphibian Conservation (RSAC) for Europe (50 km x 50 km grid cells), defined as regions having the highest taxonomic diversity and/or presence of endangered species. We determined regional vulnerability by examining temporal trends of temperature and precipitation over the past 40 years, future climate projections, and the spatial distribution of roads. We integrated this information into a threat‐level index and estimated the potential resilience of the amphibian communities based on the species' reproductive capacity. We identified 525 RSAC, half of which are in Central and Eastern Europe, and the other half distributed along the Mediterranean Basin. Mean annual temperature increased in almost all RSAC, but increments were smaller in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions. RSAC in the Mediterranean showed changes toward shorter droughts and increasingly extreme rainfall, whereas RSAC in Central and Eastern Europe presented trends toward lower daily precipitation and fewer days of uninterrupted rainfall. Regions with the highest concentration of roads may further exacerbate the impacts of the acute climatic changes observed in RSAC of Central Europe.

We determined temperature sensitivity of organic cabon mineralization (CO2‐Q10) and the mechanisms underlying changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content across non‐restored and restored grasslands on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau. Topsoil and subsoil with three SOC contents from non‐restored and passively or actively restored grasslands were incubated for 28 days at 5, 15, and 25°C. We determined the Q10 of SOC mineralization, and the importance of vegetation, soil physico‐chemical properties and microbial communities regulating CO2‐Q10. In C‐poor soil, SOC mineralization rate was slowest with active restoration, but SOC storage increased in both topsoil and subsoil. Increased soil pH and C availability raised CO2‐Q10 in the actively restored grassland. In subsoil of C‐middle soil, SOC storage in passively and actively restored grasslands were 81% and 25% greater, respectively, than in non‐restored grassland. In the topsoil of C‐rich soil, passively restored grassland had less SOC storage (7.5 kg·m−2) than non‐restored grassland (10 kg·m−2), because the greater aboveground biomass increased SOC decomposition caused by the priming effects driven by organic inputs from litter. The CO2‐Q10 in C‐rich topsoil in passively restored grasslands (1.1) was less than in non‐restored grassland (1.3). These findings emphasize that effective restoration management should consider initial organic C content of the degraded grassland to develop the best ecological restoration approaches to maximize C storage and limit CO2 emission into the atmosphere."

However, current methods cannot adequately capture high‐altitude hydrological processes, leading to flawed assessments of climate change impacts on FRS in such regions. Here, we improve the methodology for estimating the supply‐demand dynamics of FRS and quantify this relationship from 1990 to 2020 within the Asian Water Tower (AWT) and its downstream region. By integrating climate model data with bias correction, we estimate the supply‐demand ratio (SDR) of FRS during 2020–2050 on multiple scales. Our findings show that the FRS imbalance in the AWT and its downstream region will persist and intensify. Specifically, more than 44% of the region experienced a significant decline in the SDR during 1990–2020. It is projected that 65.8 ± 2.1% of the region will experience a significant decline in the SDR during 2020–2050 (SSP5‐8.5 scenario). Climate and socioeconomic changes have jointly exacerbated this imbalance, with relative contributions of 58.4% and 41.6%, respectively, and such an imbalance further amplifies flood risk. We propose addressing the FRS imbalance from both the supply and demand sides and strengthening cooperation among upstream and downstream regions and internationally within the Indus and Ganges‐Brahmaputra basins."

Weather modulates dengue transmission by influencing the life cycles of vector mosquitoes and the virus. Three teleconnections are known to affect the weather in Sri Lanka. Those are El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and ENSO Modoki. We studied correlations between dengue incidence (DI) in the Western Province (WP) of Sri Lanka as a whole and three districts of the province and indices of ENSO, IOD and ENSO Modoki. We used four indices of ENSO and one index each of IOD and ENSO Modoki. We acquired notified dengue cases in WP, population data and monthly indices of three teleconnections for the 2005–2019 period. We used wavelet time series analysis to determine correlations between indices of teleconnections and DI. Two indices of ENSO were correlated with the DI of the WP and all three districts of the WP individually. The other two indices were correlated with the DI of two districts. The index of IOD was correlated with DI of two districts. The index of ENSO Modoki was correlated with the DI of WP and one district of it. Both positive and negative extremes of at least one teleconnection index were followed by the rise of DI in all districts. We concluded that three teleconnections modulate DI of different districts of WP in different ways. Monitoring of indices of these teleconnections and escalating dengue preventive work after extremes of indices can potentially blunt impending dengue peaks."

This study uses satellite and ground‐based carbon monoxide (CO) measurements from 2004 to 2019 to evaluate a change in its seasonal cycle due to wildfire emissions. Monthly average CO total columns from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument over Alberta and Ontario, and from a ground‐based Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in downtown Toronto are compared before and after 1 January 2012, following previous literature. Between the two time periods, a new peak emerges in the seasonal cycle of CO, centered around August. Monthly emergency room admissions from Alberta and Ontario for nine cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are assessed with a difference in difference analysis, using MOPITT CO as the exposure metric. This analysis was used to calculate the change in monthly hospital admissions per 100,000 people, given a 1 ppb increase in XCO post‐2012 compared to pre‐2012, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). For Ontario, this term is positive and significant for hypertension (change = 1.88, CI = 1.18–2.57), ischemic heart disease (0.50, CI = 0.12–0.88), arrhythmia (0.12, CI = 0.03–0.22), and asthma (0.31, CI = 0.05–0.57).

 Optical tweezer arrays 1,2 have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing 3–8, simulation 1,9–12, and metrology 13–15. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control 16–18.

 The theory of plate tectonics describes how continents are separated from each other by lateral movement that is accommodated by transform faults connecting mid-ocean ridge sections, which leaves inactive fracture zones on the ocean floor. The occurrence of continental crustal slivers in these fracture zones at distances of hundreds of kilometres to 1,000 kilometres from continents has been documented worldwide, yet their occurrence is not expected from classical plate tectonic theory. Here we use three-dimensional magmatic-thermomechanical numerical simulations to investigate the transition from continental rifting to the birth of oceanic transform fault zones and their relationship to mantle melting and crustal tectonics. These simulations show that continental slivers are entrapped within shear zones in the oceans inherited from preceding continental rifting stage. They also show three distinct stages of transform fault zone formation—continental rift linkage, proto-transform, oceanic transform—resulting from progressive strain localization into a narrowing extension-parallel strike-slip shear zone. Additionally, continental sliver emplacement into oceanic lithosphere is shown to be associated with specific stages of subsidence and uplift linked to the changing transtensional and transpressional stress field, thereby notably modifying the ocean floor morphology, mid-ocean ridge melting conditions and transform fault seismicity.

 In the Arctic Ocean, polar amplification drives warming rates that are two to three times the global average, and this enhanced warming and the associated freshening are expected to accelerate methane cycling, impacting regional and global carbon cycling. However, our understanding of methane cycling in a warmer and fresher Arctic is limited by short observational records. Here we present biomarker evidence for prevalent aerobic methanotrophy in the Arctic Ocean during the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56 million years ago), identified through the occurrence of a hopanoid compound, hop-17(21)-ene, with a distinct isotopic signature characteristic of bacterial methanotrophy. During the PETM, intensified hydrological cycling atop an overall low-sulfate ocean of the early Cenozoic limited sedimentary sulfate availability, suppressing sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation and facilitating aerobic methane oxidation in the water column, consistent with our geological evidence and sediment diagenesis model results. Unlike anaerobic oxidation, which generates alkalinity, aerobic methane oxidation consumes oxygen and produces CO2. Our biomarker-based CO2 reconstructions indicate that the Arctic Ocean became a net CO2 source, particularly during the recovery stage, contributing to prolonged carbon input, temperature rise and ocean acidification during the PETM. These findings highlight potential major perturbations to Arctic carbon cycling under future climate change.

 The synthesis of heavily substituted chiral cyclopropanes presents a significant challenge in organic chemistry due to the inherent strain and steric congestion of these three-membered rings. In this work, we report a highly enantioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation of tri-substituted alkenes via a sulfoxonium-Rh-carbene intermediate, resulting in the formation of highly congested penta-substituted chiral cyclopropanes. The cationic sulfur-substituted Rh-carbene was produced by reacting an I,S-ylide with a paddlewheel Rh catalyst, which undergoes highly enantioselective cyclopropanation. Notably, the incorporation of a sulfoxonium group at one of the bridgehead carbons enhances the chemical versatility of the products, enabling diverse transformations through multiple mechanistic pathways. This work expands the toolkit for synthesizing penta-substituted chiral cyclopropanes and demonstrates the viability of using cationic carbenes in enantioselective transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that chalcogen bonding play a critical role in differentiating the diastereomeric pathways, providing insights into the enantioselectivity.

 The melanocortin-4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor and a key regulator of appetite and metabolism. It can interact with the melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2, a single transmembrane helix protein known to interact with several different G protein-coupled receptors. However, the consequences of this interaction are not completely understood. Here we report that co-expression of melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 has multiple effects on the melanocortin-4 receptor: it enhances G protein-mediated signaling and simultaneously impairs β-arrestin2 recruitment and, consequently, internalization. In addition, co-expression of melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 leads to an increased number of monomers of melanocortin-4 receptor by disrupting receptor oligomers. A structural homology model of the active state melanocortin-4 receptor – melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 – Gαs complex suggests interaction sites that are relevant for receptor activation.

TEtrimmer automates key manual steps, enabling faster and more reliable annotation of transposable elements in any genome. 
 Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences that move within genomes and play important roles in gene regulation and genome evolution. Accurate TE annotation in genomes is crucial for downstream analyses but challenging due to their sequence diversity and frequent fragmentation, including the occurrence of nested copies. We here present TEtrimmer, a tool that automates and replaces key steps of traditional manual curation of TEs. TEtrimmer combines phylogenetic tree analysis with the machine learning method DBSCAN to cluster TE sequences accurately and applies a sliding-window strategy to remove poorly conserved regions of TE-derived multiple sequence alignments. TEtrimmer also provides detailed report plots and features a graphical user interface (GUI) application. Tested on the genomes of six organisms belonging to various kingdoms of eukaryotic life and three simulated genomes, TEtrimmer consistently improved the identification of intact TEs compared to the established tools EDTA and RepeatModeler2. Transposons are repetitive DNA sequences that are hard to identify and map accurately.

Here, the authors demonstrate that substantia nigra pars lateralis dopamine neurons receive selective, robust excitation from auditory and temporal association cortices, which, combined with rapid action potential firing, contributes to auditory threat conditioning. 
 Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL) project to the tail of striatum, where they contribute to threat behaviors. Auditory cortex contributes to threat conditioning, but whether it directly modulates DANs is unclear. Here, we show that SNL DANs fire irregularly, achieve rapid maximal firing rates, exhibit distinct ionic conductances, and receive predominantly excitatory input. This contrasts with substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DANs that fire regularly and receive mainly inhibitory input, establishing SNL DANs as a physiologically distinct dopaminergic subpopulation. Functional mapping revealed robust excitatory input from auditory and temporal association cortices to SNL DANs, but not SNc DANs. In behavioral experiments, inhibiting neurotransmitter release from either SNL DANs or cortical afferents to SNL resulted in impaired auditory threat conditioning. Thus, our work reveals robust functional corticonigral projections to SNL DANs which directly regulate threat behaviors.

Here, the authors demonstrate that clinical immunity to Plasmodium vivax develops rapidly after a single controlled human malaria infection, reducing inflammatory responses and protecting against symptoms, while not significantly affecting parasite load. 
 Clinical immunity to malaria can lead to asymptomatic infection, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To examine the development of clinical immunity, we conducted a multi-cohort, repeat controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study with Plasmodium vivax, and a heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03797989). Malaria-naïve adults underwent CHMI up to three times, by administration of red blood cells infected with P. vivax PvW1 clone or P. falciparum 3D7 clone. Nineteen participants underwent primary CHMI with P. vivax, 12 returned for secondary homologous CHMI and 2 for tertiary homologous CHMI. Six participants who had completed P. vivax CHMI then underwent heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum. We find that clinical immunity to P. vivax develops rapidly after a single CHMI, protecting participants against fever and laboratory abnormalities. This is underpinned by the attenuation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as reduced coagulation and endothelium activation. In contrast, there is no evidence of anti-parasite immunity, suggesting that mechanisms of clinical immunity can operate independently of pathogen load to reduce the damage caused by malaria infection. In addition, we show that clinical immunity to P. vivax is parasite species-specific and provides no protection against CHMI with P. falciparum. Understanding the mechanisms behind clinical immunity to malaria is crucial for developing effective interventions.

 Learning and solving governing equations of a physical system, represented by partial differential equations (PDEs), from data is a central challenge in many areas of science and engineering. Traditional numerical methods can be computationally expensive for complex systems and require complete governing equations. Existing data-driven machine learning methods require large datasets to learn a surrogate solution operator, which could be impractical. Here, we propose a solution operator learning method that requires only one PDE solution, i.e., one-shot learning, along with suitable initial and boundary conditions. Leveraging the locality of derivatives, we define a local solution operator in small local domains, train it using a neural network, and use it to predict solutions of new input functions via mesh-based fixed-point iteration or meshfree neural-network based approaches. We test our method on various PDEs, complex geometries, and a practical spatial infection spread application, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capabilities.

 Wildfire is among the fastest-growing economic risks of climate change, yet cost-effective adaptation strategies remain underexplored. In the electric power sector, where utility infrastructure has ignited some of the most destructive fires, companies are investing heavily to reduce risk. Here we evaluate the costs, reliability implications and risk-reduction benefits of the largest utility wildfire mitigation programme in the United States. Using weather and vegetation data for 25,000 miles of high-risk power lines, we develop a predictive model of ignition risk and compare outcomes across locations that had similar risk profiles but received different interventions. A newer strategy—adjusting protective device sensitivity during high-risk conditions—has reduced more wildfire risk at lower cost per avoided structure burned than conventional approaches such as undergrounding or vegetation management. Our results underscore the importance of comprehensive accounting of costs, risks and reliability when evaluating adaptation investments, particularly where capital-intensive measures may be over-incentivized.

This flux is sixfold greater than that in the United Nations Environment Programme’s last report and twofold to sevenfold that of deep-sea sediment burial, making continental shelves the largest marine mercury sinks. Since industrialization, mercury levels in surface shelf sediments have tripled, indicating that most buried mercury is of anthropogenic origin. However, this sink is increasingly threatened by climate-related processes, bottom trawling and dredging, which physically remobilize mercury through diffusion, stirring, redistribution and off-shelf transport. Empirical extrapolations suggest that ongoing trawling, dredging and warming may transform coastal sediments from mercury sinks to net sources. This shift may have already occurred in parts of Europe’s shelves, though additional verification is required. Our findings highlight the urgent need to reduce anthropogenic mercury and greenhouse gas emissions and balance fishery demand with ecosystem conservation to sustain these critical mercury sinks.

 Over the past four decades, forests have experienced major disturbances, highlighting the need for Near Real-Time (NRT) monitoring. Traditional optical-based detection is cloud-sensitive, whereas Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based frameworks enable all-weather observation. Yet, SAR monitoring has mainly focused on humid tropical forests, with reduced performance in regions showing strong seasonal backscatter variation, such as tropical savannas. Detecting small-scale forest loss also remains difficult due to the spatial resolution loss from speckle filtering. This paper presents an unsupervised SAR-based disturbance detection method with NRT capabilities, using Bayesian inference. Building on an existing methodology, the approach processes single-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR time series through Bayesian conjugate analysis. Forest disturbance is framed as a changepoint detection problem, where each new observation updates the probability of forest loss using prior information and a data model. The algorithm uses a hidden Markov chain to adapt recursively to seasonal variation and bypasses spatial filtering, preserving native data resolution and enhancing small-scale forest loss detection. Additionally, a methodology accounts for proximity to past disturbances. The method is tested on two 2020 reference datasets from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado savanna. The first covers small validation polygons (0.1–1 ha, excluding selective logging), totaling 2,650 ha in the Amazon and 450 ha in the Cerrado. The second includes larger clearings totaling 11,200 ha in the Amazon, and 12,700 ha in the Cerrado. A further comparison is conducted with operational NRT forest loss monitoring approaches. Results show substantial gains in detecting small-scale disturbances with reduced false alarms. In the Amazon, the method achieves an F1-score of 97.3% versus 93.1% for the current leading NRT approach. In the Cerrado, it reaches an F1-score of 97.4%, far exceeding the 33.3% of the optical-based method. For larger clearings, performance matches existing SAR approaches in the Amazon. While combined optical-SAR monitoring increases true positives, it also raises false alarm rates. In the Cerrado, the proposed method clearly outperforms optical monitoring, and in both regions it improves timeliness relative to individual operational approaches."

 The centimeter level deformation generated by small and medium-sized earthquakes contains rich information on tectonic activity, which is of great value for improving the coseismic deformation database and fault dynamics models. InSAR is an important means of observing coseismic deformation, but there is a problem of insufficient observation accuracy for centimeter level coseismic deformation in complex environments. Time-series InSAR advances achieve millimeter-scale deformation monitoring, yet detecting subtle coseismic signals from Mw 5.0–6.5 earthquakes remains challenging in complex environments by computational limits and step-like model discontinuities. We develop a method incorporating SBAS-InSAR and a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) step function to overcome these barriers. Simulations based on Sentinel-1 and MintPy demonstrate 15–55 % RMSE reductions (0.08–0.45 cm) in coseismic fields versus conventional DInSAR/Stacking methods. Applied to the 2021 Yangbi Mw5.9 event, our approach reveals: (1) The tanh-based model maintains phase continuity during abrupt deformation and decouples linear tectonic motion. (2) It enhances displacement field accuracy with 18–61 % noise suppression and the reliability of finite fault inversion. The model enables seconds deformation estimation for single earthquakes on standard hardware, advancing detection thresholds to sub-centimeter levels in high-coherence region.

 Forests play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration, and the varying carbon storage capacities of tree species underscore the need for accurate vegetation classification. This study introduces 3D-M2C-ResNet, a deep learning model for high-resolution, fine-scale tree species classification. The model leverages fused remote sensing inputs, combining Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery with phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 time-series data. A Multi-Scale Cascaded Dilated Convolution (MCDC) module was developed to expand the receptive field through a three-branch architecture, enabling comprehensive spectral–spatial feature extraction. Additionally, a Multi-level Feature Enhancement Strategy (MFES) adaptively refines shallow and deep features, enhancing semantic–spatial integration across layers. The model was evaluated against support vector machine (SVM), VGG16, and ResNet50 on a test set of 22,380 pixels. 3D-M2C-ResNet achieved an overall accuracy of 98.08% and a Kappa coefficient of 97.88%, outperforming baseline methods.

 The concept of city image plays a pivotal role in urban branding, serving as a strategic tool for promoting sustainable urban development. A city’s image not only shapes its identity but also enhances its global competitiveness, attracting tourism, investment, and new residents. Traditional media such as newspapers and television offer limited perspectives on city image, whereas emerging platforms like short video apps provide richer and more diverse insights. Nevertheless, existing studies remain dominated by traditional media analysis, with insufficient examination of how short video platforms represent the spatial, landscape, social, and emotional dimensions of a city’s image. This study proposed a novel approach by leveraging the diverse and extensive short video data from Douyin to thoroughly deconstruct Shanghai’s comprehensive city image. We constructed a geotagged short video database, categorizing landscape and social images based on visual features and assessing emotional tones through audio-text analysis. The findings revealed distinct spatial patterns, with core areas highly concentrated and peripheral areas more dispersed. The analysis further identified nine core image areas, three major development axes, and ten prominent zones that defined Shanghai’s unique geographic and cultural identity. This approach could provide a quantitative characterization of city image, highlighting the potential for improved public space design and enhanced citizen engagement through short videos. Moreover, these results underscored the significant role of social media platforms, especially short video apps, in shaping public perception of cities.

 Accurate tree species mapping is essential for effective forest management but is often constrained by manual, labour-intensive workflows that limit scalability. While airborne laser scanning (ALS) supports large-scale forest attribute prediction, species classification remains difficult in complex, multi-species forests. To address this, we propose an automated, data-driven dual-stream deep learning framework that integrates ALS data with point-cloud metrics to identify individual tree species. Our framework incorporates an automated approach to individual tree segmentation and species labelling using existing forest inventory and field data, resulting in a dataset of 16,269 labelled individual tree point-clouds of four species across a 630,000 ha boreal mixed species forest in Ontario, Canada. Our dual-stream deep learning model integrates a Point Extractor to generate feature representations from raw ALS point-clouds and a complementary Metrics Network to process the point-cloud metrics. Results, based on the split test set of 2441 trees, showed that the inclusion of the Metrics Network improved tree species classification accuracy by approximately 11 % compared to models that rely solely on the Point Extractor. A weighted F1-score of 0.70 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 was achieved using this dual-stream approach, along with enhanced predictive probabilities for all species thus improving the reliability of the predicted results. This approach reduces the manual processing bottleneck of individual tree segmentation and labelling and demonstrates the value of combining raw point-clouds and point-cloud metrics into a deep learning framework, offering a scalable and operational solution for reliable species predictions."

 Accurate characterization of land surface reflectance remains a critical challenge in aerosol retrieval algorithms, particularly in reducing uncertainties associated with satellite-derived aerosol composition products. Through a comprehensive analysis of aerosol component retrievals derived from POLDER/PARASOL observations at global AERONET-validated sites by the GRASP/Component approach, this study investigates the uncertainties in component retrievals based on the Ross-Li and RPV surface reflectance models. We found that these aerosol component retrievals between Ross-Li and RPV models generally show good agreements globally (aerosol absorbing components: R = 0.90 for BC, R = 0.79 for BrC, and R = 0.84 for CAI; aerosol scattering insoluble components: R = 0.94 for FNAI, R = 0.90 for CNAI; aerosol scattering soluble components: R = 0.80 for FNAS+FAWC, R = 0.74 for CNAS+CAWC). Compared to component retrievals based on Ross-Li model, RPV model presents higher aerosol insoluble scattering components but lower soluble scattering components in North Africa, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. These findings highlight the critical role of surface reflectance parameterization in aerosol composition inversion accuracy, particularly for coarse-mode-dominated regions."

 The southwesterly flow (SW) is a synoptic-scale strong wind system that transports warm, moist air toward Taiwan and plays a crucial role in Taiwan's precipitation during the mei-yu season (May 15–June 15). Using ERA5 data (fifth-generation reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and rainfall observations from surface weather stations in Taiwan, this study examines the flow and rainfall characteristics of prolonged SW (PSW) cases and their relationship with extreme precipitation events around southern Taiwan during the 1979–2022 mei-yu seasons. Statistical analysis reveals a strong co-occurrence between PSW and persistent heavy rainfall (PHR), with 75 % of PHR cases occurring during PSW and 60 % of PSW cases featuring PHR. Furthermore, 83 % of R99.9 events (the 99.9th percentile rainfall intensity) are associated with PSW. Composite analysis demonstrates that the formation and maintenance of PSW involve specific synoptic-scale flow patterns: a slight eastward migration of the western North Pacific subtropical high, sustained intensity of the South Asian high, and persistent low-pressure systems over East Asia. These pressure patterns collectively establish sustained southwesterly winds, leading to significant wind speed intensification and moisture accumulation around Taiwan over an extended period (84–126 h). These findings highlight the crucial role of synoptic-scale pressure patterns in maintaining PSW and facilitating PHR occurrence, offering quantitative criteria for forecasting PSW during the mei-yu season."

 Utilizing airborne measurements to investigate the response of microphysics to glaciogenic cloud seeding is instrumental in understanding and evaluating the seeding effect. In this study, the changes in microphysical characteristics of a supercooled liquid cloud induced by aircraft-based cloud seeding is analyzed. The data was collect in North China on Dec. 12, 2023, by using an S-band ground-based weather radar and airborne in-situ measurements. The results show that after cloud seeding, the cloud droplet number concentration and the supercooled liquid water content decreased by 48.5 % and 28.5 %, respectively, while the ice crystal number concentration increased from 0 to 100.8 L−1 on average, leading to a significant broadening of the ice particle spectrum. The ground-based weather radar observed distinct radar echo bands after the cloud seeding was completed. The enhanced radar reflectivity lasted for approximately 30 min before dissipation. A comparative analysis of five previous aircraft-based glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments in the same region revealed that the cloud seeding effect is sensitive to seeding-level temperature, cloud droplet number concentration, and supercooled liquid water content."

 Overshooting tops (OTs) are informative indicators of convective storm intensity and are widely utilized in meteorological analyses. This study presents an automated algorithm for OT detection and OT height estimation using convolutional neural networks applied to visible satellite imagery. The models are trained and validated on an extensive OT dataset comprising approximately 10,000 manually detected cases over Europe. The OTs were identified from high-resolution visible (HRV) channel of the SEVIRI instrument on board the MSG geostationary satellite, with the heights determined from the length of their shadows in the imagery. While conventional OT detection methods primarily rely on the identification of cold features in thermal infrared channels, our approach extracts information from visible channels, leveraging the ground truth data on OT shadow length provided by the training dataset. In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 97% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km. The performance is expected to further improve once the model is applied to polar and new generation geostationary satellites with increased spatial resolution."

Serra;M.A. Jiménez;A. Maimó-Far,Characteristics of sea breeze in a complex terrain island seen by CERRA,"•Sea breeze is analyzed over a complex terrain island using CERRA from 2009 to 2020. •CERRA is able to statistically reproduce the main sea breeze features. •New sea breeze selecting methodology is proposed for CERRA-like data. •The orography representation in CERRA lacks accuracy to show terrain-induced effects. •Vertical atmospheric structure in CERRA reproduces observations from radiosoundings. 
 The physical mechanisms underlying sea-breeze (SB) conditions in the Palma basin (Mallorca island, western Mediterranean Sea) are analyzed using the Copernicus European Regional Reanalysis (CERRA) model outputs from 2009–2020. In this complex terrain region, SB is strongly influenced by the upslope winds generated at the mountains that close the basin. The comparison of model results with multiple sources of observations (automatic weather stations [AWS], satellite products and radiosondes) shows its ability to reproduce the main SB characteristics.Taking as reference the classification of SB conditions from a previous AWS-based study, a new methodology is now proposed that consists of the application of selecting filters to the CERRA data. The characteristics of the SB events show good agreement with those selected from the AWS. CERRA is able to reproduce the majority of SB patterns: the evolution from land breeze to SB, the cold and moist air advection from the sea during the steady state, the height and intensity of the SB maximum, the importance of the soil moisture and the horizontal and vertical temperature differences. CERRA has difficulties in reproducing SB events which are strongly conditioned by the topography of the basin, due to the insufficient spatial resolution to include the effect of surface heterogeneities, as is the case for upslope winds. However, this method is applicable to other complex terrain regions, and CERRA presents itself as a very useful tool for the study of the physical mechanisms that occur under SB conditions."
