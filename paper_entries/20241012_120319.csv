 Rate coefficients for the reactions of OH radicals with C3–C11 alkanes were determined using the multivariate relative-rate technique. A total of 25 relative-rate coefficients at room temperature and 24 Arrhenius expressions in the temperature range of 273–323 K were obtained. Notably, a new room temperature relative-rate coefficient for 3-methylheptane that had not been previously reported was determined, and the obtained kOH value (in units of 10−12 cm3 molec.−1 s−1) was 7.71 ± 0.35. Interestingly, whilst results for n-alkanes agreed well with available structure–activity relationship (SAR) calculations of Kwok and Atkinson (1995), Neeb (2000), Wilson et al. (2006), Jenkin et al. (2018), and McGillen et al. (2020), the three cycloalkanes (cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane) and one branched alkane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) were found to be less reactive than predicted by the SAR approach. Conversely, the SAR estimates for 2,3-dimethylbutane were approximately 25 % lower than the experimental values, with the exception of those estimated by the Wilson group, highlighting that there may be additional factors that govern the reactivity of highly branched alkanes that are not captured by current SAR techniques. Arrhenius expressions (in units of cm3 molec.−1 s−1) for the reactions of various branched alkanes with OH radicals were determined for the first time: 2-methylheptane, 1.37±0.48×10-11exp-209±100/T, and 3-methylheptane, 3.54±0.45×10-11exp-374±49/T. The reactivity relation of saturated alkanes with OH radicals and chlorine atoms was obtained: log10k(Cl+alkanes)=0.569×log10k(OH+alkanes)-3.111 (R2 = 0.86). In addition, the rate coefficients for the 24 previously studied OH + alkanes reactions were consistent with existing literature values, demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of this method for the simultaneous investigation of gas-phase reaction kinetics."
10.5194/acp-24-11365-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了高氧化有机分子（HOMs）在全球大气中新粒子形成（NPF）中的作用。通过将HOMs的化学机制与一个全面的成核方案半显式地耦合到一个全球气候模型中，更新后的模型显示出与成核速率、生长速率和NPF事件频率的测量结果有更好的吻合。研究结果表明，HOM驱动的NPF导致全球颗粒物和云凝结核负荷的显著增加。该研究使用了全球气候模型，并与地面观测数据进行比较，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['aerosol nucleation', 'new particle formation', 'global climate model', 'cloud condensation nuclei', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Xinyue Shao;Minghuai Wang;Xinyi Dong;Yaman Liu;Wenxiang Shen;Stephen R.

Carslaw,Global modeling of aerosol nucleation with  a semi-explicit chemical mechanism for  highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs),"Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) play an important role in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). By semi-explicitly coupling the chemical mechanism of HOMs and a comprehensive nucleation scheme in a global climate model, the updated model shows better agreement with measurements of nucleation rate, growth rate, and NPF event frequency. Our results reveal that HOM-driven NPF leads to a considerable increase in particle and cloud condensation nuclei burden globally. 
 New particle formation (NPF) involving organic compounds has been identified as an important process affecting aerosol particle number concentrations in the global atmosphere. Laboratory studies have shown that highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) can make a substantial contribution to NPF, but there is a lack of global model studies of NPF with detailed HOM chemistry. Here, we incorporate a state-of-the-art biogenic HOM chemistry scheme with 96 chemical reactions to a global chemistry–climate model and quantify the contribution to global aerosols through HOM-driven NPF. The updated model captures the frequency of NPF events observed at continental surface sites (normalized mean bias changes from −96 % to −15 %) and shows reasonable agreement with measured rates of NPF and sub-20 nm particle growth. Sensitivity simulations show that compared to turning off the organic nucleation rate, turning off organic initial growth results in a more substantial decrease in aerosol number concentrations. Globally, organics contribute around 45 % of the annual mean vertically integrated nucleation rate (at 1.7 nm) and 25 % of the vertically averaged growth rate. The inclusion of HOM-related processes leads to a 39 % increase in the global annual mean aerosol number burden and a 33 % increase in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) burden at 0.5 % supersaturation compared to a simulation with only inorganic nucleation. Our work predicts a greater contribution of organic nucleation to NPF than previous studies due to the semi-explicit HOM mechanism and an updated inorganic NPF scheme. The large contribution of biogenic HOMs to NPF on a global scale could make aerosol sensitive to changes in biogenic emissions."

Results show that the simulations reproduce the observations well and improve understanding of cloud impacts on radiation. The research also indicates that a few strategically placed sensors, capitalizing on measurement timing, can effectively measure these variations, aiding in the development of detailed weather prediction models. 
 The amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth surface (surface solar irradiance, SSI) is critical for a variety of applications, ranging from surface–atmosphere interactions to solar energy. SSI is characterized by a large spatiotemporal variability, in particular in the presence of cumulus clouds. This results in complex spatial patterns of shadows and sunlight directly related to clouds' geometry and physical properties. Although key in many respects, the instantaneous spatial distribution of SSI remains largely unexplored. Here, we use unique observations from a dense network of pyranometers deployed during the HOPE field campaign to investigate the SSI spatial distribution. For cumulus scenes, bimodal distributions are found, with one mode corresponding to cloud shadows and the other to sunlit areas with enhanced SSI exceeding clear-sky values. Combining large-eddy simulations of cumulus clouds with Monte Carlo ray tracing, we demonstrate the capability of advanced numerical tools to reproduce the observed distributions and quantify the impact of cloud geometrical and physical properties on both modes. In particular, cloud cover strongly modulates their amplitudes, in addition to their position and width, which are also sensitive to cloud height, geometrical depth, and liquid water content. Combining observations and simulations, we also explore sampling strategies to estimate the SSI spatial distribution with a limited number of sensors, suggesting that 10 pyranometers integrated over 10 min can capture most details of the full distribution. Such a strategy could be used for future campaigns to further investigate SSI distributions and their impact on land–atmosphere exchanges or photovoltaic farm management."

Flynn;Shan-Hu Lee,"Measurement report: Urban ammonia and amines in Houston, Texas","Ammonia and amines are important ingredients for aerosol formation in urban environments, but the measurements of these compounds are extremely challenging. Our observations show that urban ammonia and amines in Houston are emitted from urban sources, and diurnal variations in their concentrations are likely governed by gas-to-particle conversion and emissions. 
 Ammonia and amines play critical roles in secondary aerosol formation, especially in urban environments. However, fast measurements of ammonia and amines in the atmosphere are very scarce. We measured ammonia and amines with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) at the urban center in Houston, Texas, the fourth most populated urban site in the United States, during October 2022. Ammonia concentrations were on average four parts per billion by volume (ppbv), while the concentration of an individual amine ranged from several parts per trillion by volume (pptv) to hundreds of pptv. These reduced nitrogen compounds were more abundant during weekdays than on weekends and correlated with measured CO concentrations, implying they were mostly emitted from pollutant sources. Both ammonia and amines showed a distinct diurnal cycle, with higher concentrations in the warmer afternoon, indicating dominant gas-to-particle conversion processes taking place with the changing ambient temperatures. Studies have shown that dimethylamine is critical for new particle formation (NPF) in the polluted boundary layer, but currently there are no amine emission inventories in global climate models (as opposed to ammonia). Our observations made in the very polluted area of Houston, as well as a less polluted site (Kent, Ohio) from our previous study (You et al., 2014), indicate there is a consistent ratio of dimethylamine over ammonia at these two sites. Thus, our observations can provide a relatively constrained proxy of dimethylamine using 0.1 % ammonia concentrations at polluted sites in the United States to model NPF processes."

In this study, we perform detailed simulations of ICI observations. Machine learning is used to characterise the atmospheric ice present for a given simulated observation. This study acts as a final pre-launch assessment of ICI's capability to measure atmospheric ice, providing valuable information to climate and weather applications. 
 The Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) aboard the second generation of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS-SG) will provide novel measurements of ice   hydrometeors. ICI is a passive conically scanning radiometer that will operate within a frequency range of 183 to 664 GHz, helping to cover the present wavelength gap between microwave and infrared observations. Reliable global data will be produced on a daily basis. This paper presents the retrieval database to be used operationally and performs a final pre-launch assessment of ICI retrievals.Simulations are performed within atmospheric states that are consistent with radar reflectivities and represent the three-dimensional (3D) variability of clouds. The radiative transfer calculations use empirically based hydrometeor models. Azimuthal orientation of particles is mimicked, allowing for the consideration of polarisation. The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the ICI retrieval database are shown to vary according to cloud type. The simulations are considered to be the most detailed performed to this date. Simulated radiances are shown to be statistically consistent with real observations.Machine learning is applied to perform inversions of the simulated ICI observations. The method used allows for the estimation of non-Gaussian uncertainties for each retrieved case. Retrievals of ice water path (IWP), mean mass height (Zm), and mean mass diameter (Dm) are presented. Distributions and zonal means of both database and retrieved IWP show agreement with DARDAR. Retrieval tests indicate that ICI will be sensitive to IWP between 10−2 and 101 kg m−2. Retrieval performance is shown to vary with climatic region and surface type, with the best performance achieved over tropical regions and over ocean. As a consequence of this study, retrievals from real observations will be possible from day one of the ICI operational phase."

To effectively manage forest resources, timely and accurate annual forest maps at a high spatial resolution are needed. This study improved forest maps by integrating PALSAR-2 and Landsat images. Annual evergreen and non-evergreen forest-type maps were also generated. This critical information supports the Global Forest Resources Assessment. 
 Annual forest maps at a high spatial resolution are necessary for forest management and conservation. Large uncertainties remain in existing forest maps because of different forest definitions, satellite datasets, in situ training datasets, and mapping algorithms. In this study, we generated annual maps of forest and evergreen forest at a 30 m resolution in the contiguous United States (CONUS) during 2015–2017 by integrating microwave data (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar – PALSAR-2) and optical data (Landsat) using knowledge-based algorithms. The resultant PALSAR-2/Landsat-based forest maps (PL-Forest) were compared with five major forest datasets from the CONUS: (1) the Landsat tree canopy cover from the Global Forest Watch dataset (GFW-Forest), (2) the Landsat Vegetation Continuous Field dataset (Landsat VCF-Forest), (3) the National Land Cover Database 2016 (NLCD-Forest), (4) the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency forest maps (JAXA-Forest), and (5) the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FIA-Forest). The forest structure data (tree canopy height and canopy coverage) derived from the lidar observations of the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) on board NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1) were used to assess the five forest cover datasets derived from satellite images. Using the forest definition of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, more forest pixels from the PL-Forest maps meet the FAO's forest definition than the GFW-Forest, Landsat VCF-Forest, and JAXA-Forest datasets. Forest area estimates from PL-Forest were close to those from the FIA-Forest statistics, higher than GFW-Forest and NLCD-Forest, and lower than Landsat VCF-Forest, which highlights the potential of using both the PL-Forest and FIA-Forest datasets to support the FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment. Furthermore, the PALSAR-2/Landsat-based annual evergreen forest maps (PL-Evergreen Forest) showed reasonable consistency with the NLCD product. The comparison of the most widely used forest datasets offered insights to employ appropriate products for relevant research and management activities across local to regional and national scales. The datasets generated in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21270261 (Wang, 2024). The improved annual maps of forest and evergreen forest at 30 m over the CONUS can be used to support forest management, conservation, and resource assessments."

This dataset demonstrates satisfactory accuracy (F1-score > 0.80) and high consistency with census data. Our dataset provides valuable information for monitoring and mitigating micro-plastic pollution. 
 Plastic film mulching has been extensively used to increase crop yields in arid and semi-arid regions, but it also altered agricultural landscapes and caused severe environmental pollution. Therefore, accurate and timely mapping of plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) distributions is crucial for planning agricultural production and preventing micro-plastic pollution. However, the scarcity of sufficient and representative training samples hinders large-scale supervised classification and extraction of PMF. Additionally, it remains unclear whether a pre-trained classifier can be directly applied to different regions and years for rapid PMF mapping. To address these challenges, we proposed a new framework that simultaneously takes advantages of the automation of index-based method and the generalization ability of supervised classifier-based approach for PMF mapping. Based on the distinctive spectral responses induced by plastic film deployment events, two novel and robust PMF indices—the Max Blue Band-based Plastic-mulched Farmland Index (MBPMFI) and the Blue Band-based Plastic-mulched Farmland Index (BPMFI)—were initially designed to automatically and rapidly extract PMF pixels in cloud-free areas as candidate training samples. Additionally, the transferability of classifiers pre-trained with these automatically generated samples and optimal features was further evaluated in spatial and spatial–temporal transferability scenarios using F1 values. Finally, by coupling the index-based training sample generation method with the temporal classifier transfer approach, PMF distributions were rapidly produced for the Loess Plateau of China (PMF-LP) for 2019–2021. The results showed that the two newly established indices, MBPMFI and BPMFI, were more robust than the existing PMF indices in enhancing PMF information and suppressing complicated backgrounds. The temporal classifier transfer proved suitable for directly and rapidly mapping PMF across multiple years without additional training samples. Using the locally adaptive classifiers as a reference, the average accuracy decrease of the transferred classifiers was less than 7.0 % under the temporal transferability scenario. Our mapping framework achieved F1 values of 0.80–0.86 in recognizing PMF distributions for the Loess Plateau, highlighting its ability to delineate large-scale spatial patterns of PMF. Additionally, the estimated PMF areas based on the PMF-LP aligned well with the agricultural census data at municipal level (R2 > 0.87). The framework developed in this study lays a foundation for future monitoring of PMF distributions and agricultural micro-plastic pollution on a large scale.

Estimating the stability of IAV is challenging and depends on factors such as the respiratory matrix and drying kinetics. Here, we combine kinetic experiments on millimeter-sized saline droplets with a biophysical aerosol model to quantify the impact of NaCl on IAV stability. We show that IAV inactivation is determined by NaCl concentration, which increases during water evaporation and then decreases again when efflorescence occurs. When drying in air with relative humidity RH = 30%, inactivation follows an inverted sigmoidal curve, with inactivation occurring most rapidly when the NaCl concentration exceeds 20 mol/(kg H2O) immediately prior to efflorescence. Efflorescence reduces the NaCl molality to saturated conditions, resulting in a significantly reduced inactivation rate. We demonstrate that the inactivation rate k depends exponentially on NaCl molality, and after the solution reaches equilibrium, the inactivation proceeds at a first-order rate. Introducing sucrose, an organic cosolute, attenuates IAV inactivation via two mechanisms: first by decreasing the NaCl molality during the drying phase and second by a protective effect against the NaCl-induced inactivation. For both pure saline and sucrose-containing droplets, our biophysical model ResAM accurately simulates the inactivation when NaCl molality is used as the only inactivating factor. This study highlights the role of NaCl molality in IAV inactivation and provides a mechanistic basis for the observed inactivation rates."

Understanding the processes that drive the release of P and Al from goethite is of paramount importance for the iron ore industry and for managing nutrient and pollutant behavior in the environment. This study investigates the impact of Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization on the release of P and Al from goethite. We evaluated the solubility and extractability of P and Al in suspensions of Al- and P-coprecipitated goethite, treated with 57Fe-enriched Fe(II)aq under oxygen-free conditions for 30 days at neutral pH and room temperatures. The addition of Fe(II)aq induced the recrystallization of goethite dominant initial synthetic phases (i.e., low P- and Al-containing phases) and the transformation of higher P- and/or Al-bearing starting material that was actually a mixture of goethite and minor amounts of lepidocrocite and feroxyhyte. Our results reveal that Fe(II)-catalyzed mineral and structural evolution led to the repartitioning of P and, to a lesser extent, Al throughout the crystal structure, mineral surface, and aqueous solution. Following a 30 day reaction with Fe(II)aq, we extracted approximately 80, 68.8, 73.9, and 83.2% of P from P-only, low, medium, and high P + Al goethite, respectively. Additionally, we observed total Al removals of approximately 17, 27, and 25% from low, medium, and high P + Al goethite, respectively. The results demonstrate that treating both P-only and P + Al goethite with Fe(II) at room temperature, followed by a 24 h extraction using 1 M NaOH, significantly enhances the overall extractability of P and Al, including both aqueous and surface-adsorbed fractions, compared to Fe(II)-free controls. These findings advance our understanding of the recrystallization process and impurity substitution in goethite, offering promising avenues for developing new environmentally friendly methods to extract P and other impurities from goethitic iron ores at lower temperatures."

Yet mechanistic linkages between root exudation and emergent biogeochemical processes remain challenging to measure nondestructively, in real soil, over time. Here we used a novel combination of in situ microsensors with high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure, nondestructively, changing exudation and associated biogeochemical dynamics along single growing plant roots (Avena sativa). We found that metabolite and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations as well as microbial growth, redox potential (EH), and pH dynamics vary significantly among bulk soil, root tip, and more mature root zones. Surprisingly, the significant spike of rhizosphere DOC upon root tip emergence did not significantly correlate with any biogeochemical parameters. However, the presence of sugars significantly correlated with declines in EH following the arrival of the root tip, likely due to enhanced microbial oxygen demand. Similarly, the presence of organic acids significantly correlated to declines in pH upon root tip emergence. Overall, our in situ measurements highlight how different exudates released along growing roots create functionally distinct soil microenvironments that evolve over time."

This study combines land use classification, P-flow modeling, spatial analysis, and cause-effect chain modeling to assess P emissions and P-induced FEP at a fine spatial resolution in Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area and reveals their dynamic responses to land use changes. We find that land conversion from cultivated land to impervious land corresponded to an increase in P emissions of 4.1, 1.8, and 0.5 Gg during 2000–2005, 2005–2010, and 2010–2015 periods, respectively, revealing its dominant but weakening role in the intensification of P emissions especially in less-developed cities. Expansion of aquacultural land gradually became the primary contributor to the increase in both the amount and intensity of P emissions. Land conversions from cultivated land to impervious land and from natural water bodies to aquacultural land led to 35.9% and 25.3% of the increase in FEP, respectively. Our study identifies hotspots for mitigating the environmental pressure from P emissions and provides tailored land management strategies at specific regional development stages and within sensitive areas."

However, the high-energy ultraviolet (UV) photons in the solar spectrum can cause severe photocorrosion of semiconductors and irreversible photodamage to microorganisms within BNH. Here, we developed an encapsulation strategy using natural luminogens with aggregation-induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) to construct a protective layer for BNH, effectively shielding them against high-energy UV photons. We incorporated natural berberine (BBR) into the BNH composed of Methanosarcina barkeri and polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx). The self-assembled BNH–BBR system displayed a 2.75-fold higher CH4 yield than BNH under simulated solar irradiation. Mechanism analysis revealed that BBR acted as a UV sunscreen for BNH by converting high-energy short wavelengths into low-energy long wavelengths, thereby reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and alleviating the photocorrosion of CNx. Furthermore, BBR functioned as a photosynergist for BNH by regulating photoelectron production and utilization, enhancing the intracellular energy formation in M. barkeri for growth and metabolism. This work provides important insights into the effective and scalable conversion of CO2 into valuable biofuels with BNH under light illumination containing high-energy photons."

However, the universality and evolutionary processes of their generation, particularly concerning their secondary sources, remain unclear at present. We demonstrated through laboratory flow tube experiments that corresponding nitrosamines were generated from heterogeneous reactions of nitrous acid (HONO) with five structurally diverse amines commonly found indoors, including diphenylamine (DPhA), dibenzylamine (DBzA), dioctylamine (DOtA), N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (PANA). The heterogeneous reaction rate constants of DBzA and DOtA with HONO (∼70 ppb) were 1.21 × 10–3 and 2.13 × 10–3 min–1 at 30% relative humidity (RH), resulting in a lifetime of 13.8 and 7.8 h. As compared to higher RH (∼80%), more nitrosamines were produced from the reaction of HONO with surface-sorbed DBzA, DOtA, 6PPD, and PANA at lower RH (30%), with product yields ranging from <0.1% to 0.5%. Furthermore, we observed the formation of nitroso-6PPDs and nitro-6PPDs during room air exposure of 6PPD in a genuine indoor environment, in addition to various other transformation products indicative of reactions of 6PPD with HONO, NOx, and ozone indoors.

The ecological remediation of abandoned tailings is a topic of broad interest, yet our understanding of microbial metabolic status in restored soils, particularly at the aggregate scale, remains limited. This study investigated microbial resources within soil aggregates from revegetated tailings and applied a vector model of ecoenzymatic stoichiometry to examine how different vegetation patterns (grassland, forest, or bare land control) impact microbial resource limitation. Five-year vegetation restoration significantly elevated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in soil aggregates (approximately 2-fold), although these increases were not translated to in the microbial biomass and its stoichiometry. The activities of C- and phosphorus (P)-acquiring extracellular enzymes in these aggregates increased substantially postvegetation, with the most pronounced escalation in macroaggregates (>0.25 mm). The vector model results indicated soil microbial metabolism was colimited by C and P, most acutely in microaggregates (<0.25 mm). This colimitation was exacerbated by monotypic vegetation cover but mitigated under diversified vegetation cover. Soil nutrient stoichiometric ratios in vegetation restoration controlled microbial resource limitation, overshadowing the impact of heavy metals. Our findings underscore that optimizing resource allocation within soil aggregates through strategic revegetation can enhance microbial metabolism in tailings, which advocates for the implementation of diverse vegetation covers as a viable strategy to improve the ecological development of degraded landscapes."

However, rapidly and precisely manufacturing Fe0-based materials with the desired geometries is challenging. Herein, novel three-dimensional printed Fe0 (3DP-Fe0) and bimetallic 3DP-Ni/Fe0 were customized by 3D printing for efficient Fenton-like degradation of florfenicol (FLO), a typical antibiotic in wastewater. 3DP-Ni/Fe0 with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exhibited superior reactivity toward FLO than 3DP-Fe0, generating hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and atomic hydrogen to achieve >90% dehalogenation and >70% total organic carbon removal within 10 min. The resulting degradation intermediates possessed lower antibacterial activity than FLO and did not cause resistance gene proliferation in activated sludge. The Fenton-like activity of 3DP-Ni/Fe0 was similar across different shapes but increased with increasing porosity and size. Compared with powdered Ni/Fe0, 3DP-Ni/Fe0 exhibited faster electron transfer during Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycling, which increased the utilization efficiency of dissolved Fe2+ and H2O2 for ·OH production. Moreover, 3DP-Ni/Fe0 could be reused >150 times, 5-fold more than powdered Ni/Fe0, owing to its lower metal ion release and Fe0 depletion. 3DP-Ni/Fe0 with H2O2 can also efficiently remove chemical oxygen demand from real wastewater and other ROPs (e.g., acetaminophen, carbamazepine, thiamphenicol, and tetrabromobisphenol A)."

However, whether MPs induce health effects after inhalation are unclear. In this study, fluorescent polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) were found in the thymus, spleen, testes, liver, kidneys, and brain on day 1 or day 3 after one intratracheal instillation. Furthermore, mice showed inflammation in multiple organs, manifested as obvious infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, increased Toll-like receptors (TLRs), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), as well as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β) in the lungs, thymus, spleen, liver, and kidneys after four intratracheal instillations of PS-MPs at once every 2 weeks. Hepatic and renal function indexes were also increased. Subsequently, the inflammatory response in multiple murine organs was significantly alleviated by TLR2 and TLR4 inhibitors. Unexpectedly, we did not find any elevated secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 or  TNF-α by RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro. Thus, PS-MPs induced inflammatory injuries in multiple murine organs via the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in vivo, but not macrophages in vitro.

In this study, we introduced a novel approach based on polarized light scattering technique, which offers advantages in terms of rapid, high-throughput, and submicron-sized detection. This technique was successfully applied to characterize the weathered MPs after a 180-day laboratory simulation of coastal environments. By employing polarization measurements, we obtained a 46-dimensional matrix data set for the weathered MP fragments and subsequently processed them using a backpropagation neural network. The successful extraction of effective polarization pulses confirmed the presence of MP fragments within the size range of 0.2–60 μm, yielding total accuracies for size classification ranging from 78.9 to 86.9%. Furthermore, this technique achieved an overall accuracy of 93.8% in classifying MPs with different weathering degrees and polymer types, revealing polarization parameters associated with size and morphological changes play a dominant role in characterizing the weathering process of MPs.

In this study 27 years of airborne measurements of temperature and relative humidity from In‐service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) are used to parameterize the distribution of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The parameterization is designed to simulate water vapor fluctuations within gridboxes of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) with typical size of a few tens to a few hundred kilometers. The distributions currently used in such models are often not supported by observations at high altitude. More sophisticated distributions are key to represent ice supersaturation, a physical phenomenon that plays a major role in the formation of natural cirrus and contrail cirrus. Here the observed distributions are fitted with a beta law whose parameters are adjusted from the gridbox mean variables. More specifically the standard deviation and skewness of the distributions are expressed as empirical functions of the average temperature and specific humidity, two typical prognostic variables of AGCMs. Thus, the distribution of water vapor is fully parameterized for a use in these models. The new parameterization reproduces the observed distributions with a determination coefficient always greater than 0.917 and with a mean value of 0.997. The parameterization is robust to a selection of various geographical subsets of data and to gridbox sizes varying between 25 and 300 km."

Different types of weather events, including tropical cyclones (TCs), mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), and atmospheric rivers (ARs), significantly impact precipitation patterns in East Asia. This study pioneers the application of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural network, U‐Net, and Attention U‐Net models, to simulate precipitation associated with these weather events. The spatial permutation method is also used to identify key meteorological variables for accurately generating precipitation in DL models. The DL models trained on all timeslots consistently surpass the performance of state‐of‐the‐art numerical simulations, although their efficacy slightly diminishes during extreme weather events. This outperformance is attributed to the appropriate emphasis on key variables that capture precipitation processes, such as low‐level moisture and mid‐level pressure fields. However, new DL models trained separately for TCs, MCSs, and ARs using clipped precipitation as the output does not exceed the performance of the previous DL models. Among all input features, moisture variables contribute the most to precipitation at low intensity, while the importance of other variables increases for more intense precipitation, although some discrepancies vary across models and event types. The spatial results further reveal the detailed locations of variables that are essential for accurately simulating precipitation related to weather events, such as areas of high specific humidity and strong winds. DL models could also acquire useful information from region remote to the events to improve the simulation. Overall, DL models serve as promising tools for simulating and enhancing our understanding of precipitation patterns associated with various weather events in East Asia."

Quantifying their contribution to air quality is crucial to understanding the trends of vehicle emissions as low‐ and “zero” emission vehicles join the fleet. Modeling on‐road emissions is complex due to various factors like fleet activities, traffic patterns, and meteorological conditions. We compare on‐road emissions from two mobile models: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fuel‐based Inventory of Vehicle Emission (FIVE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), finding they contribute 4%–33% to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NOx, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Using a regional chemical transport model, we assess air quality effects under different emission scenarios. Both emission data sets yield satisfactory performance, with MOVES showing lower biases in ozone (O3) and PM2.5 over CONUS, while FIVE performs better at city scales due to higher urban NOx emissions. In January, on‐road emissions increased surface O3 over western and southern US by up to 9.1%–13.1% but decreased by 2.5% over the northeastern US, while PM2.5 predictions vary across the US (−85% to 24%). In July, on‐road emissions elevate O3 and PM2.5 concentrations by 15%–20% across CONUS, except in some west coast cities. They also greatly contribute to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by more than 80% near roads and in urban areas.

In response, several epidemiological studies aimed to define ways in which the spread and severity of COVID‐19 can be curbed. As a result, there is a steady increase in the evidence linking greenspaces and COVID‐19 impact. However, the evidence of the benefits of greenspaces or greenness to human wellbeing in the context of COVID‐19 is fragmented and sometimes contradictory. This calls for a meta‐analysis of existing studies to clarify the matter. Here, we identified 621 studies across the world on the matter, which were then filtered down to 13 relevant studies for meta‐analysis, covering Africa, Asia, Europe, and the USA. These studies were meta‐analyzed, with the impacts of greenness on COVID‐19 infection rate quantified using regression estimates whereas impacts on mortality rates were measured using mortality rate ratios. We found evidence of significant negative correlations between greenness and both COVID‐19 infection and mortality rates. We further found that the impacts on COVID‐19 infection and related mortality are moderated by year of publication, greenness metrics, sample size, health and political covariates.

 Climate over land—where humans live and the majority of food is produced—is changing rapidly, driving severe impacts through extreme heat, wildfires, drought and flooding. Our ability to monitor and model this changing climate is being transformed through new observational systems and increasingly complex Earth system models. But fundamental understanding of the processes governing land climate has not kept pace, weakening our ability to interpret and utilize data from these advanced tools. Here we argue that for land-climate science to accelerate forwards, an alternative approach is needed. We advocate a parallel scientific effort, one emphasizing robust theories, that aims to inspire current and future land-climate scientists to better comprehend the processes governing land climate, its variability and extremes and its sensitivity to global warming. Such an effort, we believe, is essential to better understand the risks people face, where they live, in an era of climate change.

 Centennial-scale increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide, known as carbon dioxide jumps, are identified during deglacial, glacial and interglacial periods and linked to the Northern Hemisphere abrupt climate variations. However, the limited number of identified carbon dioxide jumps prevents investigating the role of orbital background conditions on the different components of the global carbon cycle that may lead to such rapid atmospheric carbon dioxide releases. Here we present a high-resolution carbon dioxide record measured on an Antarctic ice core between 260,000 and 190,000 years ago, which reveals seven additional carbon dioxide Jumps. Eighteen of the 22 jumps identified over the past 500,000 years occurred under a context of high obliquity. Simulations performed with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity point towards both the Southern Ocean and the continental biosphere as the two main carbon sources during carbon dioxide jumps connected to Heinrich ice rafting events. Notably, the continental biosphere appears as the obliquity-dependent carbon dioxide source for these abrupt events. We demonstrate that the orbital-scale external forcing directly impacts past abrupt atmospheric carbon dioxide changes.

 Mesoscale oceanic eddies contribute to the redistribution of resources needed for plankton to thrive. However, due to their fluid-trapping capacity, they can also isolate plankton communities, subjecting them to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Diazotrophs, which fix dinitrogen (N2), are key members of the plankton community, providing reactive nitrogen, particularly in large nutrient-depleted regions such as subtropical gyres. However, there is still limited knowledge about how mesoscale structures characterized by specific local environmental conditions can affect the distribution and metabolic response of diazotrophs when compared with the large-scale dynamics of an oceanic region. Here we investigated genetic diazotroph diversity and N2 fixation rates in a transect across the Gulf Stream and two associated eddies, a region with intense mesoscale activity known for its important role in nutrient transport into the North Atlantic Gyre. We show that eddy edges are hotspots for diazotroph activity with potential community connectivity between eddies. Using a long-term mesoscale eddy database, we quantified N2 fixation rates as up to 17 times higher within eddies than in ambient waters, overall providing ~21 µmol N m−2 yr−1 to the region. Our results indicate that mesoscale eddies are hotspots of reactive nitrogen production within the broader marine nitrogen cycle.

Here, the authors reveal a critical role for matrix viscosity in controlling this crosstalk, which they explain via a modified molecular clutch model. 
 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) interact with their surroundings via integrins, which link to the actin cytoskeleton and translate physical cues into biochemical signals through mechanotransduction. N-cadherins enable cell-cell communication and are also linked to the cytoskeleton. This crosstalk between integrins and cadherins modulates MSC mechanotransduction and fate. Here we show the role of this crosstalk in the mechanosensing of viscosity using supported lipid bilayers as substrates of varying viscosity. We functionalize these lipid bilayers with adhesion peptides for integrins (RGD) and N-cadherins (HAVDI), to demonstrate that integrins and cadherins compete for the actin cytoskeleton, leading to an altered MSC mechanosensing response. This response is characterised by a weaker integrin adhesion to the environment when cadherin ligation occurs. We model this competition via a modified molecular clutch model, which drives the integrin/cadherin crosstalk in response to surface viscosity, ultimately controlling MSC lineage commitment. The crosstalk between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions regulates stem cell fate.

Here the authors generate large-scale states of this type with up to 60 qubits and show that discrete time crystals can effectively protect such fragile states. 
 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as two-component Schrödinger cats, play vital roles in the foundation of quantum physics and the potential quantum applications. Enlargement in size and coherent control of GHZ states are both crucial for harnessing entanglement in advanced computational tasks with practical advantages, which unfortunately pose tremendous challenges as GHZ states are vulnerable to noise. Here we propose a general strategy for creating, preserving, and manipulating large-scale GHZ entanglement, and demonstrate a series of experiments underlined by high-fidelity digital quantum circuits. For initialization, we employ a scalable protocol to create genuinely entangled GHZ states with up to 60 qubits, almost doubling the previous size record. For protection, we take a different perspective on discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally for exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, and embed a GHZ state into the eigenstates of a tailor-made cat scar DTC to extend its lifetime. For manipulation, we switch the DTC eigenstates with in-situ quantum gates to modify the effectiveness of the GHZ protection. Our findings establish a viable path towards coherent operations on large-scale entanglement, and further highlight superconducting processors as a promising platform to explore nonequilibrium quantum matters and emerging applications.

Here, Saha et al. show that cone photoreceptors in the fovea exhibit weaker and slower light adaptation than cones in the peripheral retina due to differences in ion-channel properties. 
 Adaptation in cone photoreceptors allows our visual system to effectively operate over an enormous range of light intensities. However, little is known about the properties of cone adaptation in the specialized region of the primate central retina called the fovea, which is densely packed with cones and mediates high-acuity central vision. Here we show that macaque foveal cones exhibit weaker and slower luminance adaptation compared to cones in the peripheral retina. We find that this difference in adaptive properties between foveal and peripheral cones is due to differences in the magnitude of a hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih. This Ih current regulates the strength and time course of luminance adaptation in peripheral cones where it is more prominent than in foveal cones. A weaker and slower adaptation in foveal cones helps maintain a higher sensitivity for a longer duration which may be well-suited for maximizing the collection of high-acuity information at the fovea during gaze fixation between rapid eye movements. Light adaptation in the primate fovea is poorly understood. Here, Saha et al. show that cone photoreceptors in the fovea exhibit weaker and slower light adaptation than cones in the peripheral retina due to differences in ion-channel properties."

 Recent research has identified multiple immune systems that bacteria use to protect themselves from viral infections. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these systems horizontally spread, especially among bacterial pathogens. Here, we investigate antiviral defenses in staphylococci, opportunistic pathogens that constitute leading causes of antibiotic-resistant infections. We show that these organisms harbor a variety of anti-phage defenses encoded within or near SCC (staphylococcal cassette chromosome) mec cassettes, mobile genomic islands that confer methicillin resistance. Importantly, we demonstrate that SCCmec-encoded recombinases mobilize not only SCCmec, but also tandem SCC-like cassettes enriched in genes coding for diverse defense systems. Further, we show that phage infection stimulates cassette mobilization (i.e. excision and circularization). Thus, our findings indicate that SCC/SCCmec cassettes not only spread antibiotic resistance but can also play a role in mobilizing anti-phage defenses.

 Sea cucumbers are predominant deposit feeders in benthic ecosystems, providing protective benefits to coral reefs by reducing disease prevalence. However, how they receive sufficient nutrition from seabed sediments remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate Holothuria leucospilota, an ecologically significant tropical sea cucumber, to elucidate digestive mechanisms underlying marine deposit-feeding. Genomic analysis reveals intriguing evolutionary adaptation characterized by an expansion of digestive carbohydrase genes and a contraction of digestive protease genes, suggesting specialization in digesting microalgae. Developmentally, two pivotal dietary shifts, namely, from endogenous nutrition to planktonic feeding, and from planktonic feeding to deposit feeding, induce changes in digestive tract enzyme profiles, with adults mainly expressing carbohydrases and lipases. A nuanced symbiotic relationship exists between gut microbiota and the host, namely, specific resident bacteria supply crucial enzymes for food digestion, while other bacteria are digested and provide assimilable nutrients. Our study further identifies Holothuroidea lineage-specific lysozymes that are restrictedly expressed in the intestines to support bacterial digestion. Overall, this work advances our knowledge of the evolutionary innovations in the sea cucumber digestive system which enable them to efficiently utilize nutrients from seabed sediments and promote food recycling within marine ecosystems.

 Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, is associated with congenital neurological complications. Here, we investigate potential pathological correlates of virus gene expression in representative ZIKV strains through RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. In addition to the single long polyprotein found in all flaviviruses, we identify the translation of unrecognised upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the genomic 5′ region. In Asian/American strains, ribosomes translate uORF1 and uORF2, whereas in African strains, the two uORFs are fused into one (African uORF). We use reverse genetics to examine the impact on ZIKV fitness of different uORFs mutant viruses. We find that expression of the African uORF and the Asian/American uORF1 modulates virus growth and tropism in human cortical neurons and cerebral organoids, suggesting a potential role in neurotropism. Although the uORFs are expressed in mosquito cells, we do not see a measurable effect on transmission by the mosquito vector in vivo. The discovery of ZIKV uORFs sheds new light on the infection of the human brain cells by this virus and raises the question of their existence in other neurotropic flaviviruses.

The transgenic mouse model here presented accumulates neuromelanin and mimics the early physiopathology of Parkinson’s disease. 
 One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of models accurately mimicking the complex physiopathology of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This model could help explore new research avenues in brain aging and neurodegeneration. Unlike humans, rodents do not accumulate the brain pigment neuromelanin in catecholamine neurons with age.

This study shows that relaxing the fertility policy and delaying retirement age in China could lead to an increase in total and per capita household carbon footprint. 
 The gradual adjustment of fertility and retirement policies in China has social benefits in terms of coping with population aging. However, the environmental consequences of these policies remain ambiguous. Here we compile environmentally extended multiregional input–output tables to estimate household carbon footprints for different population age groups in China. Subsequently, we estimate the age-sex-specific population under different fertility policies up to 2060 and assess the impacts of fertility and retirement policies on household carbon footprints. We find that Chinese young people have relatively higher household carbon footprints than their older counterparts due to differences in income by age group. Relaxing fertility policies and delaying retirement age are associated with an increase in population (and labour supply) and thus increases in household carbon footprints, with the majority of these increases from the fertility side. These results may help policymakers understand interactions among those measures targeting population aging and climate action.

 Breeding programmes have increased the yields of major crops, including maize (Zea mays L.), but the suitability of optimized traits to future climates remains unclear. Here, by comparing the responses of 323 elite maize inbred lines from different breeding eras under natural field conditions, we show that while newer lines exhibit higher grain yield than the early released lines under standard growth, the bred trait of reduced tassel size increases the susceptibility of newly released lines to high temperature during flowering. We identified a potential threshold for spikelets per tassel (~700), over which maize can produce a stably high seed set ratio under warm conditions, and show that small-tassel (<700 spikelets per tassel) genotypes are now unsuitable in 23.7% of global maize-growing regions.

 Remote astronomical telescopes without access to the national electricity grid are usually designed to rely on fossil fuels without considering the social and energy needs of the surrounding communities. Concurrently, climate change concerns and fuel price vulnerability are driving the transition to renewable energy sources. Here we propose a socially accepted renewable energy system for a future telescope in the Atacama Desert, combining an energy system model with a participatory multi-criteria analysis. Our findings highlight the fact that various stakeholders, including local residents, the municipality, the existing local utility and observatories, prioritize emissions reduction, security of supply and reduced electricity costs. The results reveal that a system supplying renewable energy to the telescope could also cover 66% of a nearby community’s energy needs without additional capacity. Stakeholder inputs show that this is the most attractive solution by developing an energy system in which all the actors benefit. Replicating similar energy systems at nearby telescopes could reduce fossil fuel-based energy generation by 30 GWh annually, cutting emissions by 18–24 ktCO2e while contributing to energy justice. The proposed approach aims to promote social acceptance of renewable energy systems by involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, integrating benefit sharing among them and contributing to the region’s emissions reduction efforts.

This Perspective critically analyses the ethics, economics and politics of one key form of carbon pricing: carbon taxes are levied to discourage fossil-fuel-intensive consumption.

 Nations worldwide are implementing greenhouse gas mitigation measures and promoting the efficient use of natural resources to reduce human pressure on the environment and to increase sustainability. Most of these efforts focus on technological advancement and emphasize the need for economic growth, which will enable further development. However, the impact of demographic trends on sustainability and potential response measures has so far received little attention. Here we develop a model to explore a nation’s potential for environmental footprint mitigation over time given existing and expected demographic trends, consumption patterns and technological advancements. The model is used to test the effects of different scenarios (combinations of mitigation factors) on Israel’s land, water and carbon footprints by 2050 as a case study. The analysis reveals that even when implementing an advanced scenario that combines major technological and behavioural changes, the nation’s mitigation goals will not be achieved given the current demographic trend. Our findings emphasize the need for models that test the effects of combinations of factors on natural resources and the environment. Such models could be valuable tools for decision makers when considering alternative pathways that better support the sustainability and decarbonization of nations.

 Recent large-scale seismological observations have shown that off-fault strain localization and foreshock migration could serve as an early warning of an impending earthquake. However, this process is still largely unknown. In this study, state-of-the-art friction experiments were conducted in a oil-confined biaxial shear apparatus to investigate the link between stick-slip nucleation and off-fault deformation. Our findings indicate that there is a direct link between stick-slip nucleation and off-fault deformation, provided that the fault is conditionally unstable (a − b < 0). Inelastic off-fault deformation may trigger unstable slip by decreasing the stiffness of the surrounding rock volume, which favors earthquake nucleation. Additionally, the study presents laboratory observation of precursory strain localization around a fault during stick-slip cycles. These findings suggest that volumetric deformation processes could be a main factor in the nucleation of large ruptures and strain localization could be a reliable harbinger of large earthquakes.

 Marine sediments are archives of environmental change with pollutants potentially acting as chronographic markers of the Anthropocene. Particularly, the vertical transport and burial, as well as slow degradation rate of microplastics, indicate an eventual incorporation into the geological record. A high-resolution reconstruction of microplastics records requires high sedimentation rates, and in Disko Bay (Greenland), this quality coincides with a need for plastic pollution data. Here, a Greenlandic sediment core dated back to 1930 ± 2 was reconstructed for microplastics accumulation via micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We show 85 years of fluctuating microplastics accumulation (987 − 16,645 particles Kg−1) down to 20 µm and diversified into eight polymers. Polyethylene (47%) and polypropylene (32%) were more abundantly present through time. Microplastics accumulation increases significantly after 1950 along with major socio-economic development in the area, suggesting an influence from regional stressors. Regional microplastics reconstructions must therefore be considered in the pursuit of an Anthropocene global plastic horizon.

 Climatic change threatens the persistence of atoll islands and the cultural and ecosystem services they support. However, adaptation and ecosystem management are constrained by lack of knowledge of island-specific transformations. We present an empirically-based island change framework that characterises the physical trajectory of islands, based on high-resolution shoreline analysis on 509 atoll islands in the central Pacific over the past half-century. Using changes in island size and position we identify seven distinct styles of island transformation in the Pacific, including contraction (21.4%), stability (46.1%) and expansion (32.4%), and show that 40% of islands are currently mobile on reef surfaces. Results challenge the framing of islands as erosional, which misrepresents island behaviour and constrains understanding of island futures. The island change framework highlights a broader set of island-specific management considerations, and opportunities, that scale with the style and rate of island change, and provides an empirical basis to inform management.

 Wildfires in the southwestern United States are increasingly frequent and severe, but whether these trends exceed historical norms remains contested. Here we combine dendroecological records, satellite-derived burn severity, and field measured tree mortality to compare historical (1700-1880) and contemporary (1985-2020) fire regimes at tree-ring fire-scar sites in Arizona and New Mexico. We found that contemporary fire frequency, including recent, record fire years, is still <20% of historical levels. Since 1985, the fire return interval averages 58.8 years, compared to 11.4 years before 1880. Fire severity, however, has increased. At sites where trees historically survived many fires over centuries, 42% of recent fires resulted in high tree mortality. Suppressed wildfires tended to burn more severely than prescribed burns and wildfires managed for resource benefit. These findings suggest that expanded use of low-severity prescribed and managed fire would help restore forest resilience and historical fire regimes in dry conifer forests.

 Drought is one of the most damaging hydroclimatic hazards, impacting environmental systems and socioeconomic sectors. Therefore, understanding the physical mechanisms that cause drought events is of critical importance. Here we investigate the influence of oceanic and continental moisture deficits on global meteorological drought events in recent decades, utilizing a Lagrangian dispersion model to track the origin of precipitation deficits leading to droughts. Additionally, meteorological drought events between 1980 and 2018 were segmented based on a three-dimension algorithm considering spatial extent, duration, and magnitude of drought events. Severe meteorological drought events exhibit mixed contribution of precipitation deficits from both continental and oceanic sources. This highlights the importance of considering both types of deficits in understanding severe meteorological droughts. Comparative analysis across time periods shows a consistent pattern in the dominant mixed contribution of precipitation deficits. There is no relevant decadal change in the mixed contributions of these deficits, which implies stability in the prevalence of oceanic and continental sources driving extreme drought events. These findings offer valuable insights into the factors shaping meteorological drought evolution.

 Mangroves in tropical and subtropical coasts are subject to episodic disturbances, notably from severe storms, leading to potential widespread vegetation mortality. The ability of vegetation to recover varies, and with disturbances becoming more frequent and severe, it is vital to track and project vegetation responses to support management and policy decisions. Prior studies have largely focused on binary mangrove mapping (i.e., presence or absence), while tracking conditions and condition change have not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we demonstrate a method based on dense time series Landsat images for continuous monitoring of mangrove conditions, where we track three kinds of post-disturbance mangrove conditions, including disturbed (disturbed, with rebound to the previous state within one growing season), recovering (undergoing natural recovery in longer than one growing season), and declining (showing long-term decline after disturbance). The method starts with disturbance detection using the DEtection and Characterization Of the tiDal wEtland change (DECODE) algorithm, an existing dense time series model designed to detect disturbances in tidal wetlands with adaptation to tidal fluctuations. This algorithm is well suited for the detection of tidal wetland disturbances but does not provide satisfactory post-disturbance monitoring results, due to the substantial variability in post-disturbance Landsat observations. To better monitor post-disturbance conditions, a new time series fitting approach, DECODER (DECODE and Recovery), is proposed for the recovery stage. Additionally, for temporal segments divided by disturbance events, we built a random forest classifier with temporal-spectral variables derived from the time series model to characterize mangrove conditions. Employing this approach in Florida's mangroves, we generated condition maps, such as dieback and recovery, with an overall accuracy of approximately 97.96 ± 0.86- [95 % confidence intervals]. Comparing post-hurricane conditions in Florida revealed that the increased frequency and severity of disturbances are challenging mangrove resilience, potentially diminishing their ability to recover and sustain ecosystem functions."

 Lake bathymetry is important for quantifying and characterizing underwater morphology and its geophysical state, which is critical for hydrological and ecological studies. Due primarily to the harsh environment of the Tibetan Plateau, there is a severe lack of lake bathymetry measurements, limiting the accurate estimation of total lake volumes and their evolutions. Here, we propose a novel lake bathymetry reconstruction by combining ICESat-2/ATLAS (Advanced Topography Laser Altimetry System) data with a numerical model. An improved grid-based photon noise removal method is used to address the photon signal buried in the background noise during the local daytime. The developed model was validated for seven lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and showed good agreement between simulated and measured lake volumes, with an average absolute percentage error of 8.0 % for maximum water depth and 19.7 % for lake volume simulations. The model was then utilized to estimate the water volume of other lakes by combining it with the self-affine theory. The lake depths obtained from ICESat-2/ATLAS show good agreement (RMSE = 0.69 m; rRMSE = 10.3 %) with available in-situ measurements for lakes with depths <16.5 m, demonstrating the potential of ICESat-2/ATLAS for improved reconstruction of the bathymetry of clear water inland lakes. Our study reveals for the first time, that the Tibetan Plateau has an estimated total lake water volume of 1043.69 ± 341.31 km3 for 33,477 lakes (>0.01 km2) in 2022. Over 70 % (∼734.8 km3) of the lake water storage is concentrated in the Inner Plateau, with the Yellow River basin accounting for 10.9 % (∼113.9 km3), followed by the Indus River basin with 7.2 % (∼75.1 km3). Our study provides a robust method for estimating total lake volumes where in-situ measurements are scarce and can be extended to other clear water lakes, thus contributing to more accurate global assessments and towards comprehensive quantification of Earth's surface water resources distribution."

 Avian diversity, a key indicator of ecosystem health, is closely related to canopy structure. Most avian diversity models are based on either optical remote sensing or airborne lidar data, but the latter is limited to small study areas. The launch of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument in 2018 has opened new avenues for exploring the influence of vegetation structure on avian diversity. To examine how direct measurements of canopy structural characteristics explain bird diversity across North America, we analyzed 18 GEDI metrics from 2019 to 2022, along with corresponding Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) counts and AVONET morphological data, analyzing effects across broad regions and at varying spatial extents. We grouped 440 bird species into 20 ecological guilds under six guild categories and employed random forest algorithms to model avian diversity across eight spatial extents (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 39.2 km). The models predicted six diversity indices, including species richness (sRich), functional richness (fRich), evenness (fEve), dispersion (fDis), divergence (fDiv), and redundancy (fRed) across eight spatial extents. The best-predicted guilds varied for each diversity index. The most accurate models were sRich (pseudo-R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 4.28) and fRed (pseudo-R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.13) for forest specialists guilds; fRich (pseudo-R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.18) for urban guilds; fEve (pseudo-R2 = 0.28, RMSE = 0.08) for insectivore guilds; and fDiv (pseudo-R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.12) and fDis (pseudo-R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.87) for short distance migrants guilds. Our results highlight the critical role of canopy structure, including its horizontal and vertical distribution and variation, in predicting avian diversity, as measured by the mean number of detected modes (num_detectedmodes), the standard deviation of foliage height diversity (FHD), num_detectedmodes, canopy cover, and plant area index (PAI) across the spatial extents centered on BBS routes. Therefore, we recommend incorporating the GEDI metrics into avian diversity modeling and mapping across North America, thereby potentially enhancing bird habitat management and conservation efforts."

 Information on rice planting areas is critically important for food and water security, as well as for adapting to climate change. Mapping rice globally remains challenging due to the diverse climatic conditions and various rice cropping systems worldwide. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which is immune to climatic conditions, plays a vital role in rice mapping in cloudy, rainy, low-latitude regions but it suffers from commission errors in high-latitude regions. Conversely, optical data performs well in high-latitude regions due to its high observation frequency and less cloud contamination but faces significant omission errors in low-latitude regions. An effective integrated method that combines both data types is key to global rice mapping. Here, we propose a novel adaptive rice mapping framework named Rice-Sentinel that combines Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. First, we extracted key phenological phases of rice (e.g., the flooding and transplanting phase and the rapid growth phase), by analyzing the characteristic V-shaped changes in the Sentinel-1 VH curve. Second, we identified potential flooding signals in rice pixels by integrating the VH time series from Sentinel-1 with the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Sentinel-2, utilizing the generated phenology phases. Third, the rapid growth signals of rice following its flooding phase were identified using Sentinel-2 data. Finally, rice fields were identified by integrating flooding and rapid growth signals. The resultant rice maps in six different case regions of the world (Northeast and South China, California, USA, Mekong Delta of Vietnam, Sakata City in Japan, and Mali in Africa) showed overall accuracies over 90 % and F1 scores over 0.91, outperforming the existing methods and products. This algorithm combines the strengths of both optical and SAR time series data and leverages biophysical principles to generate robust rice maps without relying on any prior ground truth samples. It is well-positioned for global applications and is expected to contribute to global rice monitoring efforts."

 Small α-dicarbonyls (SαDs) are well-known as the important precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Hence, it is imperative to understand the atmospheric chemistry of SαDs to contribute to SOA formation. In this work, we investigated the interfacial chemistry of typical SαDs, including methylglyoxal (MG) and biacetyl (BA) in the neutral and acidic droplets by combined molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations. The trans configurations of MG and BA are found to be the favorable configurations at the interfaces and are prone to stay at the gas-liquid interface of the acidic droplet. The C=O group exhibits a preferential uptake orientation towards the interface because the carbonyl-O atom has a strong interaction with interfacial H2O. The uptakes and accumulations of MG and BA at the interfaces are promoted by the acidic condition. Subsequent interfacial hydrations of MG and BA in the acidic droplet are beneficial to yield diols, which can engage in oligomerization in the droplet interior to contribute SOA formation. Our results provide the theoretical insight into the interfacial chemistry of SαDs and their role in SOA formation."

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) stands as one of the most important greenhouse gasses, with steadily increasing concentrations attributable to human activities. In the pursuit of reaching peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals, it is essential to quantify carbon emissions and evaluate carbon reduction strategies. To establish a high-precision observation with full time series and spatial coverage, a spatio-temporal interpolation method was developed to obtain XCO2 data over mainland China at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° for the years 2015–2021. An east-west gradient, higher levels in the east and lower levels in the west, was observed, exhibiting a seasonal pattern of elevation in spring and reduction in summer. Subsequently, the research area is classified into seven clusters based on time-series XCO2 anomalies (ΔXCO2) and ODIAC (Open Source Data Inventory of Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide) carbon emission data. This classification aims to emphasize the differentiation of spatial heterogeneity in carbon emissions and the results highlight that regions with high ΔXCO2 reflect higher carbon emission. Finally, the carbon emissions of each cluster were estimated by using a random forest model individually yielding an R2 of approximately 0.6. For assessing the variables influencing carbon emission predictions, the importance of each variable was calculated. Specifically, NightTime Lighting data (NTL), representing human production activities, emerged as a crucial variable influencing carbon emission predictions in most clusters. In comparison, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is considered a more critical variable in Southwest China (SWC), primarily owing to the intricate vegetation carbon sink system in this region. Temperature (T) emerges as a key variable influencing the estimation of carbon emissions in certain developed cities in Eastern China (EC), driven by the urban heat island effect which amplifies energy consumption, modifies land use, and impacts urban systems, influencing the spatial patterns of carbon emissions. Carbon emissions in different characteristic regions was quantified by establishing machine learning models with remote sensing data, which can provide new insights and support for refined carbon monitoring and management strategy."

Blamey;Chris J.C. Reason,Rainfall characteristics over the Congo Air Boundary Region in southern Africa: A comparison of station and gridded rainfall products,"•The first comparison between station data in poorly observed southwestern Africa and gridded rainfall products is presented. •Gridded rainfall products do not accurately capture extreme rainfall in mountainous regions. •GPCC and CPC do not adequately represent strong rainfall gradients in the region. •Most gridded rainfall products overestimate rainfall in the northern and wetter parts of the domain. 
 Strong meridional rainfall gradients exist between the tropics and subtropics in southwestern Africa, bounded to the north by the moist Congo basin and to the south by the Kalahari Desert. This domain received relatively little scientific attention compared to the rest of southern Africa. In this study, the limited available station data are assessed against six gridded rainfall products (CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR, ERA5, GPCC and CPC) for various rainfall characteristics. The nearest neighbour approach was used to match the closest rainfall dataset pixel to each station location, with the assumption that each rain gauge represents observation of various pixels of products, irrespective of product resolution. Results reveal that ERA5, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR tend to represent the monthly rainfall totals and number of rainy days well for most stations although magnitudes and monthly peaks differ. CPC and GPCC tend to perform poorly for magnitudes of rainfall, rainy days and monthly cycles especially for Angolan stations. These products also fail to adequately capture spatial distributions of rainfall, with poor representation of the strong gradients found in the region.Correlations between various gridded rainfall products mostly show good agreement in rainfall totals and rainy days. For early summer (October–November-December) moderate rainy days, ERA5 and CHIRPS products tend to have more days than the stations while CPC and GPCC products perform poorly over Angola and in the south. ERA5 generally overestimates rainfall in mountainous regions, while other products tend to underestimate it. Based on the Simple Daily Intensity Index, it was found that for most of the gridded rainfall products tend to overestimate rainfall during rainy days in the northern and wetter part of the domain. Furthermore, for heavy rainfall, CPC and GPCC tend to compare fairly well with stations in the southern and eastern parts of the domain but poorly with those in the western parts. PERSIANN-CDR tends to underestimate heavy rainy days for most stations in early and late summer (January–February-March-April). However, CHIRPS compares well at several stations, while ERA5 performs well for stations located in the south. This study helps provide useful guidance in choosing suitable rainfall gridded datasets for assessing long term rainfall cycles, daily rainfall characteristics as well as extremes over southwestern Africa."

 Understanding and forecasting the spatial and temporal distributions of extreme precipitation over urban areas is crucial for effective planning and mitigation efforts. However, this task remains challenging as accurate forecasting depends on properly representing urban surfacees and their interactions with the planetary boundary layer (PBL). We examined the hindcast of an extreme precipitation event over Beijing on 21–22 July 2012. The primary focus was assessing its sensitivity to two widely used PBL parameterizations (MYJ and YSU), two urban parameterizations (SLUCM and BEP_BEM), and two different land-use and land-cover (LULC) datasets.Sensitivity experiments were initialized at different times to explore the model dependence on initial conditions. The analyses were conducted over three selected regions: the entire model domain covering the Beijing metropolitan area, an upwind region of Beijing, and the entire urban area of Beijing. The results show that the MYJ PBL scheme performs better than the YSU PBL scheme in capturing near-surface air temperature as well as the location and timing of the heaviest precipitation. The variability in simulated precipitation among the chosen PBL schemes is lower compared to that among different time of initializations. The LULC impacted the spatial distribution of precipitation but its effect on the amount of precipitation was minimal. Overall, using a combination of the MYJ PBL scheme, SLUCM urban parameterization, and locally-enhanced Beijing LULC, and initializing the model simulations at 0000 UTC July 20, 2012, demonstrated superior performance in capturing precipitation levels, despite some spatial discrepancies in the precipitation distribution. The performance of BEP_BEM urban parameterization is similar to SLUCM across various factors such as average rain rate, maximum rain rate, and rain volume. These findings offer valuable insights towards better simulations of extreme precipitation and flooding in rapidly urbanizing areas such as Beijing."

However, it is virtually unknown how multiple biotic and abiotic drivers, such as climate, grazing, and fire, interact to determine woody dominance across global drylands. We conducted a standardized field survey in 304 plots across 25 countries to assess how climatic features, soil properties, grazing, and fire affect woody dominance in dryland rangelands. Precipitation, temperature, and grazing were key determinants of tree and shrub dominance. The effects of grazing were determined not solely by grazing pressure but also by the dominant livestock species. Interactions between soil, climate, and grazing and differences in responses to these factors between trees and shrubs were key to understanding changes in woody dominance. Our findings suggest that projected changes in climate and grazing pressure may increase woody dominance in drylands, altering their structure and functioning."

Transshipment—the transfer of catches, fuel, parts, or crew between fishing and cargo vessels known as reefers—is often criticized for its opacity and poor governance. Better insight into the beneficial ownership of vessels involved in transshipment and their operational patterns could lead to more effective management. Our study presents a publicly accessible database of reefers’ owners, operators, and flags. We identified 569 individual reefers and found that Russian and Chinese owners control 26 and 20% of the global reefer fleet, respectively. Results also show that 65% of all reefer vessels fly the flags of Russia, Panama, or China. This high level of consolidation suggests considerable leverage for enhancing transparency and governance. Our findings highlight the potential for reforming existing transshipment practices through collaboration among owners, flag states, fishery regulators, and scientists."

Birds, like mammals, acquire cognitive flexibility attributed to a well-developed telencephalon. Precocial chicks acquire imprintability just after hatching when thyroid hormone (T3) flows into the brain and primes later learning. Here, we show that the perihatch synthesis of T3paralleling thyroid development is crucial for imprinting and endows newborn chicks with cognitive flexibility via a mechanism involving the nidopallium dorsocaudale, the avian “prefrontal cortex.” Imprinted chicks showed higher cognitive flexibility than those unimprinted in switching or reversal task experiments.

Morton;Sven Kuthning;Saskia Goes;Helen M. Williams;Mark Rehkämper,Primitive asteroids as a major source of terrestrial volatiles,"The origins of Earth’s volatiles are debated. Recent studies showed that meteorites display unique mass-independent isotopic signatures of the volatile element Zn, suggesting that Earth’s Zn originated from materials derived from different regions of the Solar System. However, these studies largely omitted meteorites from the differentiated planetesimals thought to represent the Earth’s building blocks, which underwent melting and substantial volatile loss. Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals. We incorporate these results in mixing models that aim to reproduce Earth’s abundance and isotope compositions of Zn and other elements. Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn. The remaining Zn was supplied by primitive materials that did not experience melting and associated volatile loss. Combined with other findings, our results imply that an unmelted primitive material is likely required to establish the volatile budgets of the terrestrial planets."

Climate models forced by historical anthropogenic forcing suggest an increase in AR activity in the extratropics over the past four decades. However, reanalyses indicate a ~6° to 10° poleward shift of ARs during boreal winter in both hemispheres, featuring a rise along 50°N and 50°S and a decrease along 30°N and 30°S. Our analysis demonstrates that low-frequency sea surface temperature variability in the tropical eastern Pacific exhibits a cooling tendency since 2000 that plays a key role in driving this global AR shift, mostly over extratropical oceans, through a tropical-driven eddy-mean flow feedback. This mechanism also operates on interannual timescales, controlled by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and is less pronounced over the Southern Ocean due to weaker eddy activity during austral summer. These highlight the sensitivity of ARs to large-scale circulation changes driven by both internal variability and external forcing in current and upcoming decades."

While the mechanisms underlying eukaryotic Ca2+transport are well documented, an understanding of prokaryotic transport remains nascent. LMCA1, a Ca2+adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) fromListeria monocytogenes, has emerged as a prototype for elucidating structure and dynamics in prokaryotic Ca2+transport. Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach integrating kinetics, structure, and dynamics to unravel the intricacies of LMCA1 function. A cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a Ca2+-bound E1 state showed ion coordination by Asp720, Asn716, and Glu292. Time-resolved x-ray solution scattering experiments identified phosphorylation as the rate-determining step. A cryo-EM E2P state structure exhibited remarkable similarities to a SERCA1a E2-P* state, which highlights the essential role of the unique P-A domain interface in enhancing dephosphorylation rates and reconciles earlier proposed mechanisms. Our study underscores the distinctiveness between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ca2+ATPase transport systems and positions LMCA1 as a promising drug target for developing antimicrobial strategies."

However, the intrinsic limitation of low electric output in GS-TENGs could affect the accuracy and sensitivity of sensing systems. Here, we develop a porous composite by integrating an adhesive poly(siloxane-diphenylglyoxime-urethane) (PSDU) elastomer with ferroelectric (3,3-difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4[(DF-CBA)2CuCl4] fillers. PSDU, an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with alternating hard-soft segments and supramolecular bonds, imparts excellent compressibility, adhesion, and self-healing properties to the composite. Simultaneously, the incorporation of (DF-CBA)2CuCl4as functional fillers leverages the formation of a hydrogen bonding network to enhance charge transfer processes. These fillers facilitate charge accumulation through an electric poling process, resulting in a power output improvement that surpasses 1400 times higher than that of a dense PSDU-based GS-TENG. Tapping onto the versatile properties of porous poly(siloxane-diphenylglyoxime-urethane)-perovskite (PSDU-PK) GS-TENGs, applications such as hand gesture/food recognition and dual-mode sensing system have been demonstrated, suggesting their promising potential in wearable electronics and smart agriculture."

Fortunately, stochastic resonance can counterintuitively harness noise to notably enhance the output signal-to-noise ratio in a nonlinear system. Although stochastic resonance has been extensively studied in various disciplines, its potential in realistic sensing tasks remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose and demonstrate a noise-enhanced microwave sensor using a thermal ensemble of interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the strong nonlinearity present in the Rydberg ensembles and leveraging stochastic noises in the system, we demonstrate the stochastic resonance driven by a weak microwave signal (from several microvolts per centimeter to millivolts per centimeter). A substantial enhancement in the detection is achieved, with a sensitivity surpassing that of a heterodyne atomic sensor by 6.6 decibels. Our results offer a promising platform for investigating stochastic resonance in practical sensing scenarios."

Using the InsG3680 mouse model with aShank3mutation seen in humans, we revealed an unknown role for Shank3 in postsynaptic oligodendrocyte (OL) features, similar to its role in neurons. This was shown by impaired molecular and physiological glutamatergic traits of InsG3680-derived primary OL cultures. In vivo, InsG3680 mice exhibit significant reductions in the expression of key myelination–related transcripts and proteins, along with deficits in myelin ultrastructure, white matter, axonal conductivity, and motor skills. Last, we observed significant impairments, with clinical relevance, in induced pluripotent stem cell–derived OLs from a patient with the InsG3680 mutation.

Thus, here, we have studied calcium cobalt germanate (CaCoGe2O6) and calcium cobalt silicate (CaCoSi2O6) crystals in depth. Heat capacity data show that the spins in both compounds are dominantly Ising-like, even after being manipulated by high magnetic fields. On cooling below the Néel temperatures, a sharp field–induced transition in magnetization is observed for CaCoGe2O6, while multiple magnetization plateaus beneath the full saturation moment are spotted for CaCoSi2O6. Our analysis shows that these contrasting behaviors potentially arise from the different electron configurations of germanium and silicon, in which the 3d orbitals are filled in the former but empty in the latter, enabling electron hopping. Thus, silicate tetrahedra can aid the interchain superexchange pathway between cobalt(II) ion centers, while germanate ones tend to block it during magnetization."

Peelen,Attentional guidance through object associations in visual cortex,"Efficient behavior requires the rapid attentional selection of task-relevant objects. Preparatory activity of target-selective neurons in visual cortex is thought to support attentional selection, guiding spatial attention and favoring processing of target-matching input. However, naturalistic searches are often guided by nontargets, including target-associated “anchor” objects. For instance, when looking for a pen, we may direct our attention to the office desk on which we expect to find it. Here, using fMRI and eye tracking in a context-guided search task, we tested whether preparatory activity in visual cortex reflected the target, the guiding anchor object, or both. Participants learned associations between targets and anchors, reversing across two scene contexts, before searching for these targets. Participants’ first fixations were reliably guided by the associated anchor. Preparatory activity in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) represented the target-associated anchor rather than the target. These results shed light on the neural basis of context-guided search in structured environments."
