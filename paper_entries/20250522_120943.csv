Turner,High-resolution greenhouse gas flux inversions using a machine learning surrogate model for atmospheric transport,"We developed an efficient GHG (greenhouse gas) flux inversion framework using a machine-learning emulator (FootNet) as a surrogate for an atmospheric transport model, resulting in a 650 × speedup. Paradoxically, the flux inversion using the ML (machine-learning) model outperforms the full-physics model in our case study. We attribute this to the ML model mitigating transport errors in the GHG flux inversion. 
 Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is critically important for projecting future climate and assessing the impact of environmental policy. Estimating GHG emissions using atmospheric observations is typically done using source–receptor relationships (i.e., “footprints”). Constructing these footprints can be computationally expensive and is rapidly becoming a computational bottleneck for studying GHG fluxes at high spatio-temporal resolution using dense observations. Here, we demonstrate a computationally efficient GHG flux inversion framework using a machine learning emulator for atmospheric transport (FootNet) as a surrogate for the full-physics model. The footprints generated by FootNet are at approximately 1 km resolution. We update the architecture of the deep-learning model to improve the performance in a GHG flux inversion. We find that the posterior fluxes estimated with FootNet footprints are in good agreement with the posterior fluxes estimated with STILT footprints. We observe that the more simplistic representation of transport in the machine learning model helps to mitigate transport errors. This flux inversion using a machine learning surrogate model requires only meteorological data, GHG measurements, and prior fluxes. Constructing footprints using FootNet is 650 times faster than the full-physics atmospheric transport model on similar hardware. This speedup allows for the computation of footprints “on the fly” during the GHG flux inversion (i.e., computed as needed, rather than archiving for future use) and makes near-real-time emission monitoring computationally possible. This work alleviates a major computational bottleneck with inferring GHG fluxes with next-generation dense observing systems."

Sheese;Kaley A. Walker;Chris D. Boone;David A. Plummer,Quantifying the sources of increasing stratospheric water vapour concentrations,"Observations from Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) are used to examine global stratospheric water vapour trends for 2004–2021. The satellite measurements are used to quantify trend contributions arising from changes in tropical tropopause temperatures, general circulation patterns, and methane concentrations. While most of the observed trends can be explained by these changes, there remains an unaccounted-for and increasing source of water vapour in the lower mid-stratosphere at mid-latitudes, which is discussed. 
 According to satellite measurements from multiple instruments, water vapour (H2O) concentrations, in most regions of the stratosphere, have been increasing at a statistically significant rate of ∼1 %–5 % per decade since the early 2000s. Previous studies have estimated stratospheric H2O trends, but none have simultaneously quantified the contributions from all main sources (temperature variations in the tropical tropopause region, changes in the Brewer–Dobson circulation, and changes in methane (CH4) concentrations and oxidation) at all latitudes. Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) measurements are used to estimate altitude-/latitude-dependent stratospheric H2O trends from 2004–2021 due to these sources. Results indicate that rising temperatures in the tropical tropopause region play a significant role in the increases, accounting for ∼1 %–4 % per decade in the tropical lower mid-stratosphere and in the mid-latitudes below ∼20 km. By regressing to ACE-FTS N2O concentrations, it is found that, in the lower mid-stratosphere, general circulation changes have led to both significant H2O increases and significant H2O decreases on the order of 1 %–2 % per decade depending on the altitude/latitude region. Making use of measured and modelled CH4 concentrations, the increase in H2O due to CH4 oxidation is calculated to be ∼1 %–2 % per decade above ∼30 km in the Northern Hemisphere and throughout the stratosphere in the Southern Hemisphere. After accounting for these sources, there are still regions of the mid-latitude lower mid-stratosphere that exhibit significant residual H2O trends increasing at 1 %–2 % per decade. Results indicate that these unaccounted-for increases could potentially be explained by increases in upper-tropospheric molecular hydrogen."

Using the developed model, our findings highlight a dual trend: a decrease in the overall deposition of soluble iron from dust but an increase in the solubility of the iron itself due to the enhanced atmospheric processing. The study underscores the critical roles of both dust emission and atmospheric processing in soluble iron deposition and marine ecology. 
 Recent shifts in dust emissions and atmospheric compositions in East Asia may have a significant impact on the deposition of soluble iron from dust over the Northwest Pacific (30–50° N, 140° E–160° W). This study investigates the trends and driving factors behind this phenomenon during the spring of 2001–2017 using an enhanced version of the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 with comprehensive stratospheric chemistry (CAM6-Chem). We improved the model to account for desert dust mineralogy and atmospheric chemical processes that promote iron dissolution, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the evolution of dust iron. Our findings indicate a decreasing trend in dust-soluble-iron deposition from East Asia to the Northwest Pacific by 2.4 % yr−1, primarily due to reduced dust emissions driven by declining surface winds over dust source regions. Conversely, the solubility of dust iron showed an increasing trend, rising from 1.5 % in 2001 to 1.7 % in 2017. This increased iron solubility is linked to the acidification of coarse-mode aerosols and in-cloud oxalate-promoted dissolution. Sensitivity model simulations reveal that the increase in anthropogenic NOx emissions, rather than the decrease in SO2, plays a dominant role in enhancing dust aerosol acidity. This study highlights a dual trend: a decrease in the overall deposition of soluble iron from dust but an increase in the solubility of the iron itself. It underscores the critical roles of both dust emission and atmospheric processing in promoting iron dissolution, which further influences soluble iron deposition and marine ecology."

Additionally, the formation mechanisms of aromatic organic nitrates (ONs) are reported, highlighting that previously identified nitroaromatics in ambient field campaigns can be aromatic ONs. Finally, the hydrolysis lifetimes observed for ONs generated from styrene and NO3 oxidation can serve as experimentally constrained parameters for modeling hydrolysis of aromatic ONs in general. 
 Styrene is emitted by anthropogenic sources and biomass burning and is highly reactive towards atmospheric oxidants. While it has the highest nitrate radical (NO3) reactivity among aromatic hydrocarbons, the NO3 oxidation of styrene and formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have not been investigated. In this study, we conduct chamber experiments with styrene concentrations ranging from 9.5 to 155.2 ppb. The resulting SOA yields range from 14.0 % to 22.1 % with aerosol mass loadings of 5.9–147.6 µg m−3 after wall loss corrections. The chemical composition of SOA is characterized by online measurements, revealing that dimeric organic nitrates (ONs) constitute 90.9 % of the total signal of particle-phase products. C16H16N2O8 and C8H9NO4 are identified as the major particle-phase products, which constitute 88.3 % and 4.1 %, respectively, of the measured signal. We propose formation mechanisms for the ON products, including the common RO2+ RO2 / HO2 pathway and other radical chain termination reactions such as RO + R and R + R. We also investigate the hydrolysis of particulate ONs. The hydrolysis lifetime for ONs is determined to be less than 30 min. This short hydrolysis lifetime can be attributed to the stabilization of the carbocation by delocalized π orbitals of the benzene-related skeleton of aromatic ONs. This work provides the first fundamental laboratory data to evaluate SOA production from styrene + NO3 chemistry. Additionally, the formation mechanisms of aromatic ONs are reported for the first time, highlighting that compounds previously identified as nitroaromatics in ambient field campaigns could also be attributed to aromatic ONs."

Analysing data from 22 389 global sampling stations over 67 years, we uncover spatial and temporal variations in isotopes, showing depletion from the Equator to the poles and from coastal to inland areas. These variations, influenced by geographic, topographic and meteorological factors, reveal the water cycle's heterogeneity. 
 Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes are widely used as tracers of the water cycle, and surface water is an integral part of the water cycle. Compared with other waterbodies, surface water is more susceptible to different natural and anthropogenic factors, and an accurate understanding of surface water changes is of great significance in ensuring regional water security, maintaining ecological balance, and promoting sustainable economic and social development. The spatial and temporal distributions of global surface water stable isotope data are extremely uneven on a global scale due to factors such as observation conditions and instrumental analysis. For this reason, we have compiled and analysed the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope data in surface water from 22 389 sampling stations worldwide from 1956 to 2023, with 102 511 data records. The results indicate the following: (1) global surface water stable isotopes are gradually depleted from the Equator to the poles and from the coast to the interior. However, there are significant differences in the spatial and temporal distributions of surface water isotopes in different regions. (2) The variation in stable isotopes in surface water is controlled by geographic location, topographic conditions and meteorological factors (especially temperature), and its heterogeneity is considerable. The global stable isotope dataset of surface water provides vital information for an in-depth understanding of the water cycle and climate change. It can provide essential data references for global water resource management and research.

U-Surf enhances urban representation across scales and supports kilometer-scale urban-resolving Earth system modeling unprecedentedly, with broader applications in urban studies and beyond. 
 High-resolution urban climate modeling has faced substantial challenges due to the absence of a globally consistent, spatially continuous, and accurate dataset to represent the spatial heterogeneity of urban surfaces and their biophysical properties. This deficiency has long obstructed the development of urban-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) and ultra-high-resolution urban climate modeling, over large domains. Here, we present U-Surf, a first-of-its-kind 1 km resolution present-day (circa 2020) global continuous urban surface parameter dataset. Using the urban canopy model (UCM) in the Community Earth System Model as a base model for satisfying dataset requirements, U-Surf leverages the latest advances in remote sensing, machine learning, and cloud computing to provide the most relevant urban surface biophysical parameters, including radiative, morphological, and thermal properties, for UCMs at the facet and canopy level. Generated using a systematically unified workflow, U-Surf ensures internal consistency among key parameters, making it the first globally coherent urban canopy surface dataset. U-Surf significantly improves the representation of the urban land heterogeneity both within and across cities globally; provides essential, high-fidelity surface biophysical constraints to urban-resolving ESMs; enables detailed city-to-city comparisons across the globe; and supports next-generation kilometer-resolution Earth system modeling across scales. U-Surf parameters can be easily converted or adapted to various types of UCMs, such as those embedded in weather and regional climate models, as well as air quality models. The fundamental urban surface constraints provided by U-Surf can also be used as features for machine learning models and can have other broad-scale applications for socioeconomic, public health, and urban planning contexts. We expect U-Surf to advance the research frontier of urban system science, climate-sensitive urban design, and coupled human–Earth systems in the future.

Uncertainty in Vs impacts seismic hazard predictions. Stochastic procedures model this uncertainty but must be calibrated using detailed geological data and Vs databases. This paper provides a new Vs profile database for Piedmont (northwest Italy), integrating geological modelling and geophysical data and supporting similar studies in other regions. 
 Ground response analyses using a statistically representative sample of soil and rock profiles are typically used to estimate earthquake ground motions and, in turn, the seismic hazard of a particular area of study. With this aim shear-wave velocity (Vs) properties of the profiles are of paramount importance given that uncertainty in this parameter plays a major role in ground motion prediction and in its variability. Usually, stochastic procedures are adopted to model this uncertainty, and several stochastic approaches have been developed. These approaches should, however, be calibrated on detailed geological–geomorphological information and specific Vs profile databases. Within this context, the present paper aims to provide a new extensive database of Vs profiles over the Piedmont region (northwest Italy). These data are obtained through a specific workflow developed for their evaluation at the regional scale, merging the information of specific geological–geomorphological modelling and a devoted geophysical data collection. The obtained database (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13685087, Comina et al., 2024) could be used as the basis of Vs randomization approaches in different geological contexts as well, and results from the specific data analyses performed could be adopted as a reference for similar materials in analogous geological contexts."

 In the context of escalating climate change impacts and the heightened frequency of natural hazards, the imperative for robust multi-risk assessment and proactive mitigation strategies has become increasingly evident. Tenerife, situated in the Atlantic archipelago, encapsulates the challenges faced by communities globally, prompting a paradigm shift towards anticipatory risk management. This study presents a pioneering effort to establish a multi-hazard database for regions susceptible to be impacted by multiple natural hazards, using Tenerife (Canary Islands) as a case study, to provide a foundation for more accurate risk assessments and informed decision-making. Our methodology involved the systematic collection and analysis of over 500 years of historical data (https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/17088) on volcanic activity, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and extreme weather events, allowing us to identify patterns, vulnerabilities, and effective resilience measures. In this sense, our holistic approach aims to empower stakeholders with a nuanced understanding of natural processes. The database reveals key patterns in hazard occurrence and impacts, such as the frequent and damaging floods linked to heavy rainfall and ravine overflows. It also highlights the increasing frequency and severity of these events in recent decades, underscoring the urgent need for improved management practices. Other hazards, like rock falls and landslides, though less common, pose significant risks in areas affected by human activities. Key recommendations include the implementation of flood prevention measures such as ravine cleaning, water retention areas, and reforestation, as well as enhanced geotechnical studies and slope stabilization efforts to mitigate landslide risks. The approach outlined here is not only applicable to Tenerife but serves as a scalable model for other regions facing complex natural hazard scenarios.

When measuring the particle sizes, however, sometimes the sampling lines that transfer the aerosol to the measurement device distort the size distribution, making the measurement unreliable. We propose a method to correct for the distortions and estimate the true particle sizes, improving measurement accuracy. 
 The particle number (PN) emissions of both light- and heavy-duty vehicles are nowadays regulated and are typically measured from a full dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling (CVS). PN measurements for research and development purposes, though, are often taken from the raw exhaust to avoid the high setup costs of CVS. There is, however, a risk with these and any other kind of PN measurements with high number concentrations, which is that physical processes such as coagulation and diffusion losses inside sampling lines can alter, sometimes dramatically, the particle size distribution and bias its measurement. In this paper, we propose a method in the Bayesian framework for inverse problems to estimate the initial, unaltered particle size distribution based on the distorted measurements. The proposed method takes into account particle morphology and van der Waals and viscous forces in the coagulation model  and  allows the incorporation of prior information on the particle size distribution and, most importantly, a systematic quantification of uncertainty. We analyze raw exhaust PN measurements of a fuel-operated auxiliary heater and find that while a typical sampling line can reduce the PN by more than 50 %, the initial particle size distribution can be feasibly estimated with reasonable computational demands. The proposed method should give more freedom for designing the measurement setup and also aid in the comparison of results obtained at different sampling locations, such as CVS and tailpipe."

Fibroblasts were treated with p,p′-DDT and their metabolites (p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDD) and evaluated for cytotoxicity, metabolic efficiency, and oxidative stress response. In vitro cytotoxicity testing revealed that accumulation of DDTs is likely to pose adverse effects at the cellular level in 90% of the studied dolphins as their tissue concentrations exceeded EC50 values. Analyses of DDTs and their metabolites DDDs and DDEs in the cells and media indicated that a substantial amount of p,p′-DDT is metabolized into other products besides p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDD. Furthermore, analyses of antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, and expression of related genes indicated that p,p′-DDT exposure induced oxidative stress likely through the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.

Additionally, the initial concentration of Co2+ greatly influences the extent of Co incorporation within the final Mn–Co oxides and Mn oxidation states. Increased Co incorporation correlates with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies within the Mn oxide structures, which reduces their band gap and significantly influences the reactivity of Mn oxides, governing their ability to participate in pollutant degradation and redox transformations. This study advances our understanding of the mechanism of formation of Co-incorporated Mn oxides in the natural environment and provides insights into their occurrence in the natural environment and their applications in environmental processes."

Riverine Sr isotopes play a crucial role in identifying the link between continental weathering and the nearby ocean. This study reported spatial variations of Sr data from LCR during the flood season, and Sr isotopes were coupled with hydrochemical data based on a Bayesian model to assess solute sources. Results showed that carbonate weathering was the predominant contributor to riverine dissolved Sr (contribution ratio ∼35%). Besides, halite dissolution, silicate weathering, and groundwater contributed 28, 16, and 12% of dissolved Sr, respectively. The chemical weathering rate of LCR was relatively high, and the level of CO2 consumption doubled within a decade, indicating potential regional climate change. Flux estimations revealed that 42.9 tons of 87Sr were introduced to the Mekong River annually, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. Silicate-derived Sr accounted for 38% of this flux, exerting a significant influence on seawater Sr-isotopic composition. Dam construction and a warming climate with accelerated snow melting (headwater area) and increased precipitation may enhance the suitability of chemical weathering. A more systematic study on the controlling factors of weathering is needed to provide better insight into basin management in the Lancang-Mekong region."

However, the fate of BPAF in soil is still obscure. Here, we used [ring-U-14C]-labeled BPAF to investigate its fate in three agricultural soils for 240 days, based on a four-compartment fate model. BPAF dissipated in the soils with a half-life of 35–110 days, accompanied by low mineralization (8.5–11.3% of the initial radioactivity). The main fate of BPAF in the soils was formation of nonextractable residues (NERs) (44.2–65.3%), mostly (>90%) via physicochemical sequestration (31.2–42.7%) and ester bonds (10.0–22.6%). Notably, the sequestered free BPAF in the NERs increased the half-life by 1.4–2.5 times. Six transformation products (TPs) were identified, including BPAF mono- and dimethyl ethers, monosulfate ester, and three single-ring monophenolic compounds. BPAF monomethyl ether was the predominant extractable TP, while the polar TPs were the predominant physico-chemically sequestered and ester-linked TPs in the NERs. Three transformation pathways for BPAF in the soils are proposed, including type II ipso-substitution, O-methylation, and sulfate conjugation.

This study developed a novel urea electro-assisted forward osmosis (UEFO) system to recover urea from source-separated urine, aiming to enhance urea recovery efficiency and suppress urea hydrolysis through the synergistic interaction between the electric field and FO. The UEFO leveraged the application of an electric field to facilitate ion migration and in situ OH– generation, enabling dynamic regulation of the osmotic pressure difference. This enhanced the urea recovery and stabilized alkaline conditions. Compared with the open-circuit system, the UEFO significantly improved urea recovery efficiency and transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the UEFO significantly enhanced the alkalinity of the feed solution through the in situ OH– generation, thereby reducing urease activity by 34.73%. Additionally, partial least squares path modeling revealed that the electric field was the critical driving factor for urea recovery in the UEFO. Contribution distribution revealed that the electric field contributed 59.41% to urea recovery and 79.29% to hydrolysis inhibition, highlighting its key role as the core driving force in UEFO. Mechanistic exploration revealed that the electric field dynamically regulated the osmotic pressure difference across the FO membrane by modulating ion migration and the chemical environment, thereby promoting efficient urea migration and inhibiting its hydrolysis. Furthermore, an economic assessment demonstrated that the use of UEFO could generate a net profit of $0.34 per ton of urine treated, achieving a positive economic return.

Characterizations and theoretical calculations unveiled that the urea-nonstoichiometric modulation method optimized the specific surface area and geometrical structure of perovskite, promoted the formation of La defects and oxygen vacancies (OVs), enhanced lattice oxygen activation and migration, and also facilitated the coadsorption of NO and O2 and increased the d-band center of the perovskite. The synergistic activation of lattice oxygen and molecular oxygen along with the low-temperature oxidation mechanisms of NO was finally revealed: the comodulation strategy caused stretching and distortion of the 2U-L0.8MO lattice, making its lattice oxygen susceptible to activation, thereby oxidizing adsorbed NO to NO2 and simultaneously generating OVs. Afterward, O2 would be captured by the abundant OVs on the 2U-L0.8MO surface and converted to superoxide O2–, which could not only directly oxidize NO but also transform into single 1O2 on the adjacent Mn4+ site for the targeted oxidation of NO. This work realizes the coactivation of O2 and lattice oxygen and also extends the understanding of the low-temperature-targeted oxidation of NO."

Devising effective strategies to mitigate membrane fouling has become crucial for sustainable water treatment. Here, we propose a titanium-based pre-coagulation strategy for RO fouling mitigation through regulation of the microbial habitat in RO feed. The pre-coagulation performance of Ti(SO4)2 for desulfurization wastewater and the subsequent RO fouling mechanism were systematically investigated. Our findings revealed that the Ti pre-coagulation induced an acidized environment, maintained a balance between organic and inorganic depositions, and fostered a beneficial microbial community that resisted rapid fouling. The 20 day RO operations in different pre-coagulation scenarios (Ti, Al, and Ctrl) showed that the Ti group membranes maintained the highest normalized flux at 57.15%, outperforming the Ctrl and Al groups by 7.92% and 15.16%, respectively. Microbial community analyses, including taxonomic profiling and metagenomic analysis, demonstrated that Ti-based pre-coagulation reduced the dominance of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)-secreting genera, such as Sphingopyxis, while promoting Terrimonas and Paenarthrobacter, with acid-tolerance traits and reduced EPS production. This shift mitigated biofouling by enhancing microbial balance and limiting biofilm formation.

We here explained the compound event through a trans‐seasonal vegetation‐land‐atmosphere interacting perspective. The wetter spring‐sunnier summer pattern resulted in record high loads of vegetation and enhanced transpiration. This led to progressive depletion of soil moisture to a critical threshold that shifted the originally weak response of air temperature into hypersensitive mode. The resulting rapid rise of air temperature amplified atmospheric evaporative demand to an unprecedentedly high level, which in turn exacerbated the drying‐out of soil and vegetation. These favorable weather and fuel factors combined to cause unseasonal forest fires of unprecedented burning intensity. Our results remind of preparedness against drought‐heat‐fire compounding hazards even in humid regions under opportune configurations between ecological and meteorological conditions."

 Close-in companion stars are expected to adversely influence the formation and orbital stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets by tidally truncating protoplanetary discs1–4, impeding mutual accretion of planetesimals5–8 and narrowing dynamically stable regions9. This explains the observed dearth of S-type planets in tight binary star systems10–13. ν Octantis, whose stellar components have a mean separation of 2.6 au, has long been suspected of hosting a circum-primary planet in a retrograde and exceptionally wide orbit that resides midway between the stars14–20. Strong theoretical grounds against its formation and the absence of observational precedents, however, have challenged the reality of the planet. Here we present new radial velocity measurements that consolidate the planet hypothesis. Stable fits to all radial velocity data require the planetary orbit to be retrograde and practically coplanar. We also report the critical discovery from adaptive optics imaging that the companion star is a white dwarf. Our exploration of credible primordial binary orbital settings shows that the minimum separation between the stars was 1.3 au initially, which overlaps the current planetary orbit and makes any scenarios in which the circum-primary planetary orbit formed coevally with the young stars hardly conceivable. The retrograde planet must have originated from a circumbinary orbit or a second-generation protoplanetary disc, showing the role of binary stellar evolution in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. A planet in a retrograde orbit around a star with a close-in white dwarf companion reveals the role of binary stellar evolution in the formation and evolution of planets."

 Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering1,2 or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants3,4, which limits their wide application. Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity. We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation5 at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information. To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells. In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells6 are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age. In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis7 are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases. EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale.

 Spatial RNA organization has a pivotal role in diverse cellular processes and diseases1–4. However, functional implications of the spatial transcriptome remain largely unexplored due to limited technologies for perturbing endogenous RNA within specific subcellular regions1,5. Here we present CRISPR-mediated transcriptome organization (CRISPR-TO), a system that harnesses RNA-guided, nuclease-dead dCas13 for programmable control of endogenous RNA localization in live cells. CRISPR-TO enables targeted localization of endogenous RNAs to diverse subcellular compartments, including the outer mitochondrial membrane, p-bodies, stress granules, telomeres and nuclear stress bodies, across various cell types. It allows for inducible and reversible bidirectional RNA transport along microtubules via motor proteins, facilitating real-time manipulation and monitoring of RNA localization dynamics in living cells. In primary cortical neurons, we demonstrate that repositioned mRNAs undergo local translation along neurites and at neurite tips, and co-transport with ribosomes, with β-actin mRNA localization enhancing the formation of dynamic filopodial protrusions and inhibiting axonal regeneration. CRISPR-TO-enabled screening in primary neurons identifies Stmn2 mRNA localization as a driver of neurite outgrowth. By enabling large-scale perturbation of the spatial transcriptome, CRISPR-TO bridges a critical gap left by sequencing and imaging technologies, offering a versatile platform for high-throughput functional interrogation of RNA localization in living cells and organisms.

 Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies1 and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation on the rotating disk and transport gas inwards to feed the central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole2. They are believed to be long-lived structures3,4 and are now identified at redshift z > 2 (refs. 5,6). However, little is known about the onset and effects of bars in the early cosmic epoch because the spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here we report on a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observed the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and found the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars7–9. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funnelling molecular gas into its centre at a rate of approximately 600 solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy.

 Quasars, powered by gas accretion onto supermassive black holes1,2, rank among the most energetic objects in the Universe3,4. Although they are thought to be ignited by galaxy mergers5–11 and affect the surrounding gas12–15, observational constraints on both processes remain scarce16–18. Here we describe a major merging system at redshift z ≈ 2.7 and demonstrate that radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the other galaxy. Our findings reveal that the galaxies, with centroids separated by only a few kiloparsecs and approaching each other at a speed of approximately 550 km s−1, are massive, are forming stars and contain a substantial molecular mass. Yet, dusty molecular gas seen in absorption against the quasar nucleus is highly excited and confined within cloudlets with densities of approximately 105 to 106 cm−3 and sizes of less than 0.02 pc, several orders of magnitude more compact than those observed in intervening (non-quasar) environments. This is also approximately 105 times smaller than currently resolvable through molecular-line emission at high redshifts. We infer that, wherever it is exposed to the quasar radiation, the molecular gas is disrupted, leaving behind surviving dense clouds too small to give birth to new stars. Our results not only underscore the role of major galaxy mergers in triggering quasar activity but also reveal localized negative feedback as a profound alteration of the internal gas structure, which probably hampers star formation. We demonstrate that in a major merging system, radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the companion galaxy."

 Decades of research have demonstrated that recovery from serious neurological injury will require synergistic therapeutic approaches. Rewiring spared neural circuits after injury is a long-standing goal of neurorehabilitation1,2.

 Carbon has a central role in biology and organic chemistry, and its solid allotropes provide the basis of much of our modern technology1.

But liquid carbon is relevant for modelling planetary interiors4,5 and the atmospheres of white dwarfs6, as an intermediate state for the synthesis of advanced carbon materials7,8, inertial confinement fusion implosions9, hypervelocity impact events on carbon materials10 and our general understanding of structured fluids at extreme conditions11. Here we present a precise structure measurement of liquid carbon at pressures of around 1 million atmospheres obtained by in situ X-ray diffraction at an X-ray free-electron laser. Our results show a complex fluid with transient bonding and approximately four nearest neighbours on average, in agreement with quantum molecular dynamics simulations.

 Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer and shows minimal response to therapies. The immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in glioblastoma contributes to the limited therapeutic response. Astrocytes are abundant in the central nervous system and have important immunoregulatory roles. However, little is known about their role in the immune response to glioblastoma1. Here we used single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of clinical glioblastoma samples and samples from preclinical models, multiplexed immunofluorescence, in vivo CRISPR-based cell-specific genetic perturbations and in vitro mouse and human experimental systems to address this gap in knowledge. We identified an astrocyte subset that limits tumour immunity by inducing T cell apoptosis through the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Moreover, we identified that IL-11 produced by tumour cells is a driver of STAT3-dependent TRAIL expression in astrocytes. Astrocyte signalling through STAT3 and TRAIL expression were associated with a shorter time to recurrence and overall decreased survival in patients with glioblastoma. Genetic inactivation of the IL-11 receptor or TRAIL in astrocytes extended survival in mouse models of glioblastoma and enhanced T cell and macrophage responses. Finally, treatment with an oncolytic HSV-1 virus engineered to express a TRAIL-blocking single-chain antibody in the tumour microenvironment extended survival and enhanced tumour-specific immunity in preclinical models of glioblastoma. In summary, we establish that IL-11–STAT3-driven astrocytes suppress glioblastoma-specific protective immunity by inducing TRAIL-dependent T cell apoptosis, and engineered therapeutic viruses can be used to target this mechanism of astrocyte-driven tumour immunoevasion. A population of TRAIL-positive astrocytes in glioblastoma contributes to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and this mechanism can be targeted with an engineered oncolytic virus to improve outcomes."

 Skeletal editing comprises the structural reorganization of compounds. Such editing can be achieved through atom swapping, atom insertion, atom deletion or reorganization of the compound’s backbone structure1,2. Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles. The compound classes obtained through these methods—indazoles3,4, benzisoxazoles5, benzimidazoles6,7 and benzoxazoles8—are biologically relevant moieties found as substructures in natural products and pharmaceuticals.

 ATP generated in the mitochondria is exported by an ADP/ATP carrier of the SLC25 family1. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cannot synthesize ATP but must import cytoplasmic ATP to energize protein folding, quality control and trafficking2,3. It was recently proposed that a member of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, termed SLC35B1 (also known as AXER), is not a nucleotide sugar transporter but a long-sought-after ER importer of ATP4. Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter.

 Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3–5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations.

Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.

 The isotopic composition of lavas associated with mantle plumes has previously been interpreted in the light of core–mantle interaction, suggesting that mantle plumes may transport core material to Earth’s surface1–5. However, a definitive fingerprint of Earth’s core in the mantle remains unconfirmed. Precious metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), are highly concentrated in the metallic core but extremely depleted in the silicate mantle. Recently discovered mass-independent Ru isotope variations (ε100Ru) in ancient rocks show that the Ru isotope composition of accreted material changed during later stages of Earth’s growth6, indicating that the core and mantle must have different Ru isotope compositions. This illustrates the potential of Ru isotopes as a new tracer for core–mantle interaction. Here we report Ru isotope anomalies for ocean island basalts. Basalts from Hawaii have higher ε100Ru than the ambient mantle. Combined with unradiogenic tungsten (W) isotope ratios, this is diagnostic of a core contribution to their mantle sources. The combined Ru and W isotope systematics of Hawaiian basalts are best explained by simple core entrainment but addition of core-derived oxide minerals at the core–mantle boundary is a possibility. Ru isotopes are proposed as tracers for core–mantle interaction on Earth, and anomalies for ocean island basalts from Hawaii are reported that have higher ε100Ru than the ambient mantle."

 Every generation, the human genome is shuffled during meiosis and a single fertilized egg gives rise to all of the cells of the body1. Meiotic errors leading to chromosomal abnormalities are known causes of pregnancy loss2,3, but genetic aetiologies of euploid pregnancy loss remain largely unexplained4. Here we characterize sequence diversity in early pregnancy loss through whole-genome sequencing of 1,007 fetal samples and 934 parental samples from 467 trios affected by pregnancy loss (fetus, mother and father). Sequenced parental genomes enabled us to determine both the parental and meiotic origins of chromosomal abnormalities, detected in half of our set. It further enabled us to assess de novo mutations on both homologous chromosomes from parents transmitting extra chromosomes, and date them, revealing that 6.6% of maternal mutations occurred before sister chromatid formation in fetal oocytes. We find a similar number of de novo mutations in the trios affected by pregnancy loss as in 9,651 adult trios, but three times the number of pathogenic small (<50 bp) sequence variant genotypes in the loss cases compared with adults. Overall, our findings indicate that around 1 in 136 pregnancies is lost due to a pathogenic small sequence variant genotype in the fetus.

 To grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines2, in vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDL-cholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates—7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol—with protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.

 The amputation of a salamander limb triggers anterior and posterior connective tissue cells to form distinct signalling centres that together fuel regeneration1. Anterior and posterior identities are established during development and are thought to persist for the whole life in the form of positional memory2. However, the molecular basis of positional memory and whether positional memory can be altered remain unknown. Here, we identify a positive-feedback loop that is responsible for posterior identity in the limb of an axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). Posterior cells express residual Hand2 transcription factor from development, and this primes them to form a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh signalling is also upstream of Hand2 expression. After regeneration, Shh is shut down but Hand2 is sustained, safeguarding posterior memory. We used this regeneration circuitry to convert anterior cells to a posterior-cell memory state. Transient exposure of anterior cells to Shh during regeneration kick-started an ectopic Hand2–Shh loop, leading to stable Hand2 expression and lasting competence to express Shh. Our results implicate positive-feedback in the stability of positional memory and reveal that positional memory is reprogrammed more easily in one direction (anterior to posterior) than in the other. Modifying positional memory in regenerative cells changes their signalling outputs, which has implications for tissue engineering.

 Unique phosphorylation ‘barcodes’ installed in different regions of an active seven-transmembrane receptor by different G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) have been proposed to promote distinct cellular outcomes1, but it is unclear whether or how arrestins differentially engage these barcodes. Here, to address this, we developed an antigen-binding fragment (Fab7) that recognizes both active arrestin2 (β-arrestin1) and arrestin3 (β-arrestin2) without interacting with bound receptor polypeptides. We used Fab7 to determine the structures of both arrestins in complex with atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) phosphorylated in different regions of its C-terminal tail by either GRK2 or GRK5 (ref. 2). The GRK2-phosphorylated ACKR3 resulted in more heterogeneous ‘tail-mode’ assemblies, whereas phosphorylation by GRK5 resulted in more rigid ‘ACKR3-adjacent’ assemblies. Unexpectedly, the finger loops of both arrestins engaged the micelle surface rather than the receptor intracellular pocket, with arrestin3 being more dynamic, partly because of its lack of a membrane-anchoring motif. Thus, both the region of the barcode and the arrestin isoform involved can alter the structure and dynamics of GPCR–arrestin complexes, providing a possible mechanistic basis for unique downstream cellular effects, such as the efficiency of chemokine scavenging and the robustness of arrestin binding in ACKR3. Different phosphorylation patterns created by GRK2 and GRK5 on the C-terminal tail of ACKR3 lead to distinct structural arrangements and dynamics of G-protein-coupled receptor–arrestin complexes, potentially explaining diverse cellular outcomes."

 The decline in malaria deaths has recently stalled owing to several factors, including the widespread resistance of Anopheles vectors to the insecticides used in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)1,2. One way to mitigate insecticide resistance is to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage of development by incorporating antiparasitic compounds into LLINs. This strategy can prevent onward parasite transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy3,4. Here, we performed an in vivo screen of compounds against the mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development. Of the 81 compounds tested, which spanned 28 distinct modes of action, 22 were active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen, which in turn prevented establishment of infection. Medicinal chemistry was then used to improve antiparasitic activity of the top hits from the screen. We generated several endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) that inhibited the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex (CytB). Two lead compounds that targeted separate sites in CytB (Qo and Qi) showed potent, long-lasting and stable activity when incorporated and/or extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films. ELQ activity was fully preserved in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and parasites resistant to these compounds had impaired development at the mosquito stage. These data demonstrate the promise of incorporating ELQ compounds into LLINs to counteract insecticide resistance and to reduce malaria transmission.

 The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space1,2. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in cold dark matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations3 with the standard ΛCDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a ΛCDM framework4–6, and our finding provides clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter7, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.

 The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine1,2, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi3–5. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth3, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate6–8 have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures9,10. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius11–13 feature large dentine tubules1 that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth14–16. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth16. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues.

 One-carbon homologs are structurally-related and functionally-identical organic molecules, whose chain-lengths differ by a single methylene (–CH2–) unit1. Across many classes of molecule–including pharmaceutical agents, natural products, agrochemicals, fragrances and petroleum products–the physicochemical characteristics displayed by members of a homologous series subtly differ from one compound to another, which can impart remarkable differences to their function2. The efficient generation of homologs is, therefore, an important strategy in molecular discovery programs3,4.

We report a catalytic one-carbon homologation process that is effective for many classes of alkene in simple and complex molecules. By leveraging the intrinsic reactivity of a novel multifaceted allyl-sulfone reagent, a streamlined one-pot process, involving cross-metathesis and a fragmentation/retro-ene cascade, formally inserts a single methylene unit to the alkene chain. Amongst applications of this process to several structurally and functionally complex molecules, we demonstrate how this practical transformation generates previously unexplored homologs of Cyclosporine-A9.

 Pyrite formation and burial in anoxic ocean environments helps to regulate the acid–base balance of the oceans. Despite its potential importance, the impact of this anoxic alkalinity production on the global carbon cycle and Earth’s long-term climate regulation has been largely overlooked. Here, using a coupled carbon–sulfur cycle model, we show that pyrite burial could drive 5–46 Tmol yr−1 of alkalinity production—up to about six times the modern background volcanic carbon flux—throughout the Phanerozoic eon. During periods of widespread oceanic anoxia (known as oceanic anoxic events), alkalinity production via pyrite burial is amplified and so becomes an important stabilizing mechanism for the climate system, counterbalancing carbon emissions from contemporaneous large igneous province volcanism. Our results indicate that the anoxia–alkalinity feedback was engaged during several of the most severe oceanic anoxic events from large igneous provinces during the past 300 Myr, and thus played a role in limiting the overall impacts of these events on the biosphere and climate. We conclude that ocean deoxygenation may provide an important negative feedback on ocean–atmosphere CO2 partitioning, helping to buffer the impacts of CO2 emission on the Earth system.

Here, the authors show that the muscle-derived factor CLCF1, which declines with age but is restored by exercise, mediates musculoskeletal benefits in aged mice. 
 Skeletal muscle undergoes many alterations with aging. However, the impact of aging on muscle’s ability to secrete myokines and its subsequent effects on the body remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify myokines that have the potential to ameliorate age-related muscle and bone decline. Notably, circulating levels of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) decrease with age, while exercise significantly upregulates CLCF1 levels in both humans and rodents. Restoring CLCF1 levels in aged male mice improves their physical performance, glucose tolerance, and mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, CLCF1 protects against age-induced bone loss by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and promoting osteoblast differentiation in aged male mice. These improvements mirror some of the effects of exercise training. Conversely, blocking CLCF1 activity significantly abolishes these beneficial effects, confirming the crucial role of CLCF1 in mediating the positive effects of exercise on muscle and bone health in male mice. These findings collectively suggest that CLCF1 may contribute to the regulation of age-associated musculoskeletal deterioration, and warrant further investigation into its potential role as a modulator of musculoskeletal health during aging. Aging impairs muscle and bone health, and exercise is known to mitigate this decline, partly through secreted factors.

Here, the authors show that these recordings are compromised by crosstalk. An algorithm was developed to eliminate crosstalk offline, helping to come closer to ground truth data. 
 Advancements in the field of implantable neurotechnologies have enabled the integration of hundreds of microelectrodes on ultra-thin and flexible substrates. Besides implantable components, also connectors, headstages and cables have to comply with the high-count demand, resulting in a complex and compact chain with reduced line spacing and smaller safety margins. Here, we show that epicortical recordings acquired from anesthetized rat brains with a state-of-art neural acquisition system are undoubtedly compromised by crosstalk, with signal coherence maps exhibiting a strong dependency to the routing layout. A crosstalk back-correction algorithm is developed, allowing to infer on how signals would look like under a zero-crosstalk scenario. We found that signal coherence between closely routed channels effectively drops after correction, corroborating crosstalk contamination. Our work stresses the importance of validating recorded data against the routing layout as a crucial step of data quality control, helping to come closer to ground truth data.

 Maladaptive proximal tubular (PT) epithelial cells have been implicated in progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), however the complexity of epithelial cell states within the fibrotic niche remains incompletely understood. Hence, we integrated snRNA and ATAC-seq with high-plex single-cell molecular imaging to generate a spatially-revolved multiomic atlas of human kidney disease. We demonstrate that in injured kidneys, a subset of HAVCR1+VCAM1+ PT cells acquired an inflammatory phenotype, upregulating genes encoding chemokines, pro-fibrotic and senescence-associated proteins and adhesion molecules including ICAM1. Spatial transcriptomic and multiplex-immunofluorescence determined that specifically these VCAM1+ICAM1+ inflammatory PT cells localised to the fibrotic niche. Ligand-receptor analysis highlighted paracrine signaling from inflammatory PT cells mediating leucocyte recruitment and myofibroblast activation. Loss of HNF4α and activation of NF-κβ and AP-1 transcription factors epigenetically imprinted the inflammatory phenotype. Targeting inflammatory tubular cells by administering an AP-1 inhibitor or senolytic agent ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis in murine models of kidney injury, hence these cells may be a tractable target in CKD.

The results provide potential for heatwave predictability. 
 Terrestrial heatwaves are prolonged hot weather events often resulting in widespread socioeconomic impacts. Predicting heatwaves remains challenging, partly due to limited understanding of the events’ spatial evolution and underlying mechanisms. Heatwaves were mainly examined at fixed stations, with little attention given to the fact that the center of a heatwave can move a long distance. Here, we examine the spatial propagation of terrestrial heatwaves using a complex network algorithm, and find four preferred propagation pathways of terrestrial heatwaves in the northern hemisphere. Along each preferred pathway, heatwaves evolve in two ways: propagating along the pathway or being stationary. We show that the propagating heatwave pathways are consistent with the movement of Rossby wave trains, and that both are guided by enhanced Rossby wave flux activities. The detected propagation pathways are found to provide prior knowledge for occurrences of downstream heatwaves that can be used for identifying associated precursor signals. The results shed light on the mechanisms responsible for preferred propagating heatwave pathways and provide potential predictability of terrestrial heatwaves. This study shows that terrestrial heatwaves either propagate or remain stationary along preferred pathways, influenced by Rossby wave activity.

 Despite critical roles in diseases, human pathways acting on strictly nuclear non-coding RNAs have been refractory to forward genetics. To enable their forward genetic discovery, we developed a single-cell approach that “Mirrors” activities of nuclear pathways with cytoplasmic fluorescence. Application of Mirror to two nuclear pathways targeting MALAT1’s 3′ end, the pathway of its maturation and the other, the degradation pathway blocked by the triple-helical Element for Nuclear Expression (ENE), identified nearly all components of three complexes: Ribonuclease P and the RNA Exosome, including nuclear DIS3, EXOSC10, and C1D, as well as the Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex. Additionally, Mirror identified DEAD-box helicase DDX59 associated with the genetic disorder Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome (OFD), yet lacking known substrates or roles in nuclear RNA degradation. Knockout of DDX59 exhibits stabilization of the full-length MALAT1 with a stability-compromised ENE and increases levels of 3′-extended forms of small nuclear RNAs. It also exhibits extensive retention of minor introns, including in OFD-associated genes, suggesting a mechanism for DDX59 association with OFD. Mirror efficiently identifies pathways acting on strictly nuclear non-coding RNAs, including essential and indirectly-acting components, and as a result can uncover unexpected links to human disease.

 Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease, in which mechanical overloading disrupts subchondral bone remodeling before cartilage degeneration and the osteocytes in the subchondral bone are mainly responsible for mechanosensing. However, their functional role in the early osteoarthritis is still unclear. Here we show that mechanical stress induces osteocytes in subchondral bone to secrete extracellular vesicles that accelerate cartilage metabolic dysregulation in patients with both sexes and male mice. The miR-23b-3p in extracellular vesicles promotes cartilage catabolism and inhibits anabolism by targeting OTUD4, disrupting mitophagy in chondrocytes. Inhibiting miR-23b-3p in osteocytes or chondrocytes reduces cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis progression in male mice. Together, our findings highlight that osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate communication with chondrocytes and suggest miR-23b-3p as a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.

 Denisova Cave in southern Siberia is the only site known to have been occupied by Denisovans, Neanderthals and modern humans. The cave consists of three chambers (Main, East and South), with the archaeological assemblages and remains of hominins, fauna and flora recovered from Main and East Chambers being the most thoroughly investigated to date. Here we report the results of analyses of the Palaeolithic artefacts, faunal remains and hominin and mammalian mitochondrial (mt) DNA recovered from renewed excavations in South Chamber. We construct a calendar-year time scale for the stratified Pleistocene deposits from optical dating of the sediments. The timing of hominin occupation and major turnovers in the mtDNA of Denisovans and large mammals largely accords with the patterns detected in Main and East Chambers. Time gaps in those sequences are partly filled by the South Chamber data and the sediment DNA record of Denisovans after 80,000 years ago is more than doubled in size. We combine the sediment dating and DNA records for all three chambers to reveal the whole-of-cave history of this unique site and the climatic conditions experienced by hominins and fauna over the past 300,000 years, including potential changes in habitat suitability for Denisovans and Neanderthals.

They show that vertical velocity, which is often overlooked, better explains climate responses, with implications for species adaptation and fishing resources. 
 Climate responses of marine organisms differ from those on land as marine species have the flexibility to move vertically. While horizontal climate velocity has been used to predict poleward range shifts, many species are not moving as expected. Incorporating shifts in depth, which have received less attention, may better explain climate responses of marine organisms. Here we assess vertical and horizontal climate velocities across 63 global large marine ecosystems and find that 77% of vertical climate velocities are negative, reflecting isotherm deepening. Vertical climate velocity is 10,000 times smaller than horizontal climate velocity, allowing organisms to maintain constant temperatures by shifting metres in depth rather than kilometres horizontally. Within three key large marine ecosystems, we find more species shifts are explained by vertical than by horizontal climate velocity. Together, our findings have implications for understanding species adaptation to change and for future accessibility of marine resources.

 The Inner Tibetan Plateau (ITP), serving as a critical component of the Asian hydrological circulation, has witnessed an increase in summer extreme precipitation events under global warming. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics and underlying mechanisms of the events remain insufficiently understood. This study identifies two distinct synoptic patterns that govern summer regional extreme precipitation events (REPEs) over the ITP from 1979 to 2020. The first pattern (REPE1, constituting 50.5% of the events) is characterized by a Rossby wave train inducing a negative-positive-negative geopotential height anomaly, accompanied by moisture convergence via southwesterlies and convective updrafts over the southeastern ITP. Conversely, the second pattern (REPE2, 49.5%) features a persistent positive-negative-positive geopotential height anomaly associated with mid-to-high latitude circulation, along with moisture convergence driven by southeasterlies and ascending motions over the southwestern ITP. Moreover, both REPE1 and REPE2 have exhibited increased frequencies post-2010, with REPE2 showing a more pronounced upward trend. The rising frequencies of REPE1 and REPE2 have contributed significantly to the increase in extreme precipitation over the ITP in recent decades."

 Winter warm spells (or winter heatwaves) are prolonged periods of anomalously high temperatures in cold seasons where hot weather typically does not occur. These off-season events challenge ecosystems and societies by triggering snowmelt-induced flooding and favoring wildfires, etc., but are yet to be understood. Here we assess the behaviors and drivers of worldwide winter warm spells, which have become more frequent and longer-lasting during 1979–2023. Net shortwave and longwave radiations induced diabatic heating predominantly contribute to temperature anomalies during winter warm spells, but their contributions exhibit contrasts between the tropics and non-tropics. Specifically, tropical winter warm spells are primarily induced by increased solar radiation, accompanied by decreased cloud cover, dried soils and atmosphere, and moisture divergence; whereas, non-tropical winter warm spells are mainly driven by enhanced downwelling longwave radiation under cloudier and wetter conditions. Our findings underscore the urgency to understand and mitigate intensifying off-season events that occur outside their typical seasons in a warming world.

 An up-to-date, detailed global urban land use map is essential for disclosing urban structures and dynamics as well as their differences across different regions. However, generating an accurate global urban land use map remains challenging due to the complex diversity of land use types and the uneven availability of data. Existing methods, which either rely solely on remote sensing imagery or treat supplementary data like point-of-interest (POI) as mandatory inputs, fail to account for regional data disparities and the complex relationships between different data modalities. In this study, we propose an urban land use mapping framework optimized with POI prompts. First, we acquire global urban Sentinel-2 imagery, POI data, and labeled LU samples from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and OpenStreetMap (OSM), and then propose a POI-Prompt Urban Land-use Mapping Network (PPUL-Net), which utilizes POI prompts to enhance classification accuracy and produce reliable predictions in those regions lacking POI data. Consequently, a global land use dataset (GULU) with a 10 m resolution in 2020 has been produced at the first time. Experimental results show that GULU has an overall accuracy of 84.59 %, demonstrating robust performance across continents. Incorporating POI data improved the accuracies for some challenging categories, such as commercial and institutional lands, by 7.32 % and 17.66 %, respectively. Additionally, using POI as prompts instead of direct pixel-level fusion with imagery increased accuracy by 2.92 %. Finally, analysis of the GULU dataset reveals that Europe and North America exhibit high land use diversity, implying mature urban structures, whereas sub-Saharan Africa and South America are predominantly characterized by residential and undeveloped areas. This dataset provides invaluable insights for urban planning, development monitoring, and sustainable development assessments."

 Ecological niche models (ENMs) are crucial for identifying habitat distribution patterns, understanding habitat preferences, and formulating effective conservation policies. However, accurately quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) structure of habitats, a fundamental component, presents challenges. These estimations heavily depend on the quality of original samples (presence/absence), yet reliable absence data requires prolonged and repeated observations, limiting both efficiency and accuracy. In the study, we focused on the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. We developed an adaptive similarity-based model that introduced a “similarity” pseudo-absence sampling approach for ecological niche modeling using fine-scale (20 m) 3D environmental variables from UAV LiDAR data. This approach integrated geographic similarity with an adaptive kernel density estimation (AKDE) method to prioritize pseudo-absence data sampling and then employed three typical machine learning models (SVM, BRT, and RF) for prediction, verifying the feasibility of this approach and offering direct insights into habitat distribution and preferences. The results indicated that the AKDE method provided the best fit in measuring similarity features. Through the model, the performance of estimations exhibited improved (AUC = 0.89–0.94, TSS = 0.71–0.82, and COR = 0.69–0.79), with average increases of 7 %, 14 %, and 12 %, respectively. The RF model produced more coherent suitable habitats, identifying regions at higher elevations (3100 m–3300 m) with preferences for low understory vegetation density (2–5 m, <10 %), moderate canopy relief ratio (> 0.35), lower tree height (10 m–25 m), and sunny slopes (0.60–1). Our findings demonstrate that integrating UAV LiDAR data with ecological niche modeling, along with the improved pseudo-absence sampling approach, enhances habitat assessment and offers significant potential for advancing conservation strategies."

 Accurate and reliable prediction of leaf traits is crucial for understanding plant adaptations to environmental variation, monitoring terrestrial ecosystems, and enhancing comprehension of functional diversity and ecosystem functioning. Currently, various approaches (e.g., statistical, physical models) have been developed to estimate leaf traits through hyperspectral remote sensing and leaf spectroscopy. However, the absence of high-performing, transferable, and stable models across various domains of space, plant functional types (PFTs) and seasons hinder our ability to quantify and comprehend spatiotemporal variations in leaf traits. This study proposes robust and highly transferable models for better predicting leaf traits with hyperspectral reflectance. Initially, three datasets were assembled, pairing common leaf traits — chlorophyll (Chla+b), carotenoids (Ccar), leaf mass per area (LAM), equivalent water thickness (EWT) — with leaf spectra measurements collected across diverse geographic locations in the U.S. and Europe, PFTs, and seasons. Measurements were acquired using spectroradiometers (e.g., ASD FieldSpec 3/4/Pro and SVC HR-1024i) with integrating spheres, leaf clips, and contact probes. We then developed transfer learning-based hybrid models that incorporated the domain knowledge of radiative transfer models (RTMs) through pretraining processes and were well-constrained by fine-tuning with field measurements. Through comparison with other state-of-the-art statistical models, including partial-least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), as well as pure physical models, we found that the proposed transfer learning models achieved better predictive performance and higher transferability. Specifically, compared to other statistical models and pure RTMs, the transfer learning model exhibited higher coefficient of determination (R2) values with range of 0.01 to 0.79, lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) with range of 0.06 % to 33.25 % in model performance. Additionally, the models exhibited improved transferability, with higher R2 values range from 0.04 to 0.32, lower NRMSE range from 0.08 % to 30.81 %. The findings underscore that transfer learning models through integrating domain knowledge from RTMs and limited observations, can harness the advantages of both RTMs and statistical models and serve as a promising approach for effectively predicting leaf traits."

 This study explores the potential of spatially explicit Harvester Production Reports (HPRs) for automatic annotation of Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) data at tree-level, enabling accurate tree species classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By integrating HPRs into the modelling process, this approach provides a practical solution for addressing challenges in remote sensing data annotation for forestry applications. The ALS data were acquired in managed Norway spruce-dominated forests in southern Sweden using a dual-wavelength system composed by two monochromatic sensors. Thus, three datasets were produced: the 905 nm miniVUX dataset (∼100 points/m2), the 1550 nm VUX dataset (∼875 points/m2), and the dual-wavelength dataset (∼975 points/m2), the last being a junction of the two first datasets. The automatic annotation was performed by matching tree records in the HPR and ALS data based on spatial proximity and height similarity, with a total of 45,516 HPR-recorded tree positions being linked to ALS-derived segments and assigned species labels based on HPR records. Then, the individual tree-level ALS point clouds were converted into 2D images from multiple viewing angles, with varying image dimensions and pixel sizes to accommodate trees of different sizes. These images served as input for CNN-based classification, enabling species identification across ALS datasets with varying spectral and spatial resolutions. The CNN models were trained and evaluated to classify trees into Norway spruce, Scots pine, Deciduous, and a “Noise” class for segmentation errors. The classification accuracy varied according to the dataset used, with the dual-wavelength dataset achieving the highest macro-F1 score (0.896), followed by the VUX dataset (0.894) and miniVUX dataset (0.835). These findings highlight spatially explicit HPRs as efficient, high-quality reference data for CNN-based tree species classification with minimal annotation effort."

 Land subsidence is a significant issue in many coastal megacities, including Shanghai, where it poses risks to infrastructure and economic stability. Although numerous studies have used SAR datasets to monitor land subsidence in Shanghai, multi-decadal displacement measurements obtained from multi-sensor SAR data remain unavailable. Moreover, the contributions and variations of driving factors behind the evolution of land subsidence remain poorly understood. This study employs multi-sensor SAR fusion method and a Random Forest model, along with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to examine subsidence evolution and assess the influence of key drivers over the past 30 years. The results show that severe subsidence has spread from central urban areas to surrounding suburban regions, particularly in the eastern coastal and southern industrial zones in Shanghai. SHAP analysis identified that evapotranspiration, sediment thickness, and groundwater extraction were the dominant factors in the early stage of subsidence, while recent groundwater management and recharge practices have significantly mitigated the subsidence rate.

 Atmospheric aging causes PAH transform into more toxic OPAH(oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). However, the performance and its influencing factors of PAH to OPAH in the real-world atmosphere remains obscure. High-time resolved variations in the ratio of aging products and precursors during haze can be effective in studying aging behavior. In this study, high-time resolution PM2.5 samples were collected during five haze events in three cities. Three pairs of PAH with different molecular weights and aging products OPAH (FLU-FLUO, ANT-ANTQ, BaA-BaAQ) were selected as target compounds. Combining with the ratio characteristics of PAH and OPAH emitted from typical emission sources (residential coal combustion, biomass burning, gasoline and diesel exhaust), as well as the traditional aging indicator BeP/BaP explored the evolution patterns of aging for PAH-OPAH. Results show: 1) Varying trends are observed in PAH and OPAH at different sessions of the diurnal variation, and FLUO/FLU, ANTQ/ANT, BaAQ/BaA of haze events were 0.65–2.73, 1.16–9.28, 0.18–0.86, which were higher than the ratios of typical emission sources(0.19–0.66, 0.38–1.35, 0.02–0.17), indicating the presence of PAH consumption and OPAH formation during hazes. 2) High molecular weight (HWM) BaAQ/BaA shows significant positive correlation with BeP/BaP, and correlation weakens as the molecular weight decreases (from BaAQ/BaA to FLUO/FLU), suggesting that HWM OPAH/PAH tends to indicate the evolution of particle-phase PAH, while low molecular weight (LWM) OPAH/PAH reflects the evolution of gas-phase PAH. 3) BaA-BaAQ and ANT-ANTQ both show higher oxidation degrees during daytime than nighttime, while FLU-FLUO shows higher oxidation degrees at nighttime than daytime, showing the aging of PAH is influenced by NO3· at night and O3 during hazes. Gas-phase aging of LWM PAH is activated instantly by sources input and heterogeneous aging of HWM PAH lagged relatively, leading to sustained pollution, which is most evident during fireworks display period.

 Using radar observation data together with ERA5 reanalysis data, this study exposes the mesocyclone characteristics of supercells associated with extreme flash heavy rainfall (FHR, hourly rainfall intensity ≥50 mm) in Jiangsu Province of China during 2020–2021, and reveals their differences from other severe supercells associated with convective hazards such as hail, gales and tornadoes. The results show that most FHR supercells occur in July and August, seasonally later than hail supercells or gale supercells in this region. During the warm season, FHR supercells generally move eastward led by westerly flow since most of them appear along the north edge of the western Pacific subtropical high. Half of FHR supercell mesocyclones sustain only about 2–3 radar volume scans (12–18 min). Most extreme FHR supercells are embedded in mesoscale convective systems and are triggered at more favorable locations where more abundant moisture converges and stronger low-level vertical wind shear is produced. In comparison, the developing extreme FHR supercell generally needs more abundant moisture but not as much higher convective available potential energy or stronger vertical wind shear as hail or gale supercells. In terms of mesocyclone characteristics, tornadic supercells exhibit the strongest rotation intensity, followed by gale and hail supercells, and FHR supercells possess the weakest rotation intensity. Hail supercells have the largest storm diameter, deepest mesocyclone, and highest elevation of strongest rotation, followed by gale supercells, FHR supercells and tornadic supercells. These differences are possibly related to the distinct formation mechanisms of the various severe convective phenomena induced by supercell: hail grows in lower ambient temperature and therefore corresponds to the highest vertical extension of supercell; the majority of convective windstorms in the Yangtze-Huai River region is associated with mid-upper-level dry air entraining into the storm and triggering a strong evaporative effect; and the definition of a tornadic supercell implies that the least diameter and the strongest rotation must approach ground.

For the Haihe River Basin (northern China), we investigated trends in meteorological drought and associated meteorological and atmospheric circulation factors for 1960–2017 using Mann-Kendall tests and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis. Multiple wavelet coherence analysis was used to examine the multiple factors' combined effects at different time scales. The Standard Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, an index of drought, decreased by 0.138 per decade, and the climate became warmer and drier over the 58 years. The meteorological factors with the greatest influence on drought were relative humidity (RH), the combination of mean temperature (Tmean) and RH, and the combination of Tmean, RH, and sunshine duration. Atmospheric circulation factors most affecting drought were the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the combination of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and AO, and the combination of AO, PDO, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Among the mixed two-factor combinations, the combination of RH and the El Niño Southern Oscillation had the largest impact on drought. The impact of meteorological on drought was greater than that of the atmospheric circulation factors. More research on teleconnections of drought signals is needed to prevent drought."

These importers are highly underrepresented in proteomic databases, limiting our knowledge about their cellular copy numbers, component stoichiometry, and the mechanistic implications of these parameters. We developed a tailored proteomic approach to compile the most comprehensive dataset to date of theEscherichia coli“ABC importome.” Functional assays and analyses of deletion strains revealed mechanistic features linking molecular mechanisms to cellular abundances, colocalization, and component stoichiometries. We observed four to five orders of magnitude variation in import system abundances, with copy numbers tuned to nutrient hierarchies essential for growth. Abundances of substrate-binding proteins are unrelated to their substrate binding affinities but are tightly yet inversely correlated with their interaction affinity with permeases. Counterintuitive component stoichiometries are crucial for function, offering insights into the design principles of multicomponent protein systems, potentially extending beyond ABC importers."

Here, we reveal a previously unidentified mechanism by which CD40L-expressing CD8+T cells induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In murine models, up to 50% of tumor-specific CD8+T cells expressed CD40L, and conditional CD40L ablation in CD8+T cells alone led to tumor formation. Mechanistically, CD40L+CD8+T cells can induce cell death in CD40-expressing cancer cells by triggering caspase-8 activation. We demonstrate that a gene signature for resistance to CD40 signaling–induced cell death strongly correlates with worse survival in different human cancer cohorts.

We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration.

The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity."

However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects. Our findings open the door for moiré flatband cavity–enhanced quantum light sources and quantum nodes for the quantum internet."

However, methionine-selective modification remains one of the most difficult challenges in peptide chemistry, with notable limited strategies. In this study, we report a general reversible modification strategy at methionine sites that uses the ruthenium-catalyzed sulfimidation of peptides. This method provides a convenient and effective strategy for late-stage peptide functionalization. The N═S bonds of the conjugates are reduced in the presence of glutathione, resulting the traceless releasing of corresponding peptides and amides. Practical applications are then demonstrated using precise reversible modifications of bioactive peptides, the stapling and linearization of peptides, peptide-drug conjugates, and split-and-pool synthesis. This on/off strategy through methionine-selective and reversible sulfimidation provides a unique tool for peptide chemistry and peptide-based drug discovery."

A limitation of neochromosomes is their low and unpredictable transmission rates due to trisomy. Here, we report that selecting for dicentric recombinants through male crosses uncovers stabilized chromosome 4 fission events, which split it into 4a-4b complementary chromosome pairs, where 4a carries a native centromere and 4b carries a synthetic one. The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22."

However, the extent to which TCs affect infant survival in LMICs is not well understood. We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries’ children fare better after TC exposure than others."

However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive understanding of the ultrafast electron dynamics in nonlinear TCO ENZ materials. This study investigates the effects of laser peak power and ENZ mode excitation on hot electron relaxation in TCOs. Our experimental analysis theoretically supported by a hydrodynamic model reveals that increasing laser pulse intensity extends hot electron relaxation time by more than 200%, while ENZ mode excitation increases it by more than 40% in representative TCO ENZ materials. This research demonstrates the controllable modulation of ultrafast ENZ nonlinearity via pulse peak power and ENZ mode field enhancement.

Engineered living cells can redirect drug delivery systems to effectively reach targeted sites. Here, we used living macrophages as vehicles, attaching them with GeS nanosheets (GeSNSs) carrying β-elemene for transport to tumor sites. GeSNSs act as efficient sonosensitizers, enhancing ultrasound-induced reactive oxygen species generation for treating 4T1 breast tumors. Notably, macrophage hitchhiking delivery of β-elemene–loaded GeSNSs not only achieves high accumulation in tumor regions and suppresses tumor growth under ultrasound treatment, but also effectively remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by improving M1-like macrophage polarization and enhancing the populations of mature dendritic cells, CD4+, and CD8+lymphocytes, thereby facilitating enhanced sonodynamic chemoimmunotherapy. These findings underscore the potential of macrophage hitchhiking strategy for drug delivery and suggest broader applicability of engineered living materials–mediated delivery technologies in disease therapy."

Mice expressing mutant Leu115Arg CSPα/DNAJC5 are viable but develop motor deficits. As described in patients with Kufs disease, we observed the pathological lipofuscinosis and intracellular structures resembling granular osmiophilic deposits (GRODs) in the mutant but not in the WT transgenic lines. Microglia engulf lipofuscin and lipofuscin-containing neurons. Notably, conventional or conditional knockout mice lacking CSPα/DNAJC5 did not exhibit any signs of increased lipofuscinosis or GRODs.

In a macroevolutionary model system, we find that, despite losing ~60% of genera and ~20% of family-level diversity, marine bivalves lost only ~5% of their functional diversity, inconsistent with random extinction. Even with evolutionary opportunities presented by a disrupted ecosystem, low-diversity groups prior to the extinction or those originating in the Cenozoic rarely reach higher ranks today, implying long-term diversity ceilings to certain ecological roles. Clades that survived the extinction tend to dominate functions today, 66 million years post-extinction, but both relative richness and phylogenetic structure of those functional groups have been significantly shuffled. Thus, neither the composition of the pre-extinction biota nor the set of taxa that survived the extinction fully accounts for the functional and phylogenetic structure of today’s biota.

Here, we investigate the growth of individual clown anemonefish,Amphiprion percula, during a marine heatwave. We measured the length of 134 wild clown anemonefish every month and monitored temperature at the scale of their anemone for five lunar months. Our results show that clown anemonefish shrink in response to heat stress and individuals that shrink also display relatively more catch-up growth. Further, shrinking is modulated by social rank and size, and individuals that shrink more often and in a coordinated fashion with their breeding partner have higher survival during the heat stress event. In conclusion, a plastic individual growth response to heat stress, constrained by the social environment, can lead to short-term survival benefits. If this plasticity were widespread in fishes, it may have marked consequences for populations and communities as heatwaves become more frequent."

However, it remains unclear whether the hippocampus drives the communication of predictions to sensory cortex or receives prediction signals from elsewhere. We collected 7-tesla fMRI data in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) while auditory cues predicted abstract shapes. Strikingly, neural patterns evoked by predicted shapes in CA2/3, pre/parasubiculum, and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were negatively correlated to patterns evoked by the same shapes when actually presented. Using layer-specific analyses, we ask: In which direction are predictions communicated between the hippocampus and neocortex? Superficial layers of the MTL cortex project to the hippocampus, while the deep layers receive feedback projections. Informational connectivity analyses revealed that communication between CA2/3 and PHC was specific to the deep layers of PHC. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates predictions through pattern completion in CA2/3 and feeds these predictions back to the neocortex."

As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2hiTAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (Tregs) to TH17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy."
