Footprint tools help address this disconnect. They are effective in educating people, institutions and communities on how their resource use results in environmental pollution and what we can do to moderate that pollution. These tools connect an entity’s activities with the associated pollution. Footprint tools are also constantly evolving. As we better understand how to best estimate emissions—especially from sources further removed like those from the supply chain—the guidance and methods for calculating footprints is changing and improving. This paper reviews footprint tools for people, institutions and communities, with a focus on nitrogen footprint tools (NFTs). It also gives examples of how these tools have been applied to achieve pollution reductions. It concludes with an assessment of how nitrogen and multi-element footprint tools fit into the overall topic of environmental management and discusses their benefits and limitations."

Changes in tillage intensity have a profound impact on soil nitrogen cycling, yet their influence on nitrate losses at large spatiotemporal scales remains uncertain. This study examined the effects of tillage intensity on soil nitrate losses in the US Midwest from 1979–2018 using field data synthesis and process-based agroecosystem modeling approaches. Our results revealed that no-tillage (NT) or reduced tillage intensity (RTI) decreased nitrate runoff but increased nitrate leaching compared to conventional tillage. These trade-offs were largely caused by altered water fluxes, which elevated total nitrate losses. The structural equation model suggested that precipitation had more pronounced effects on nitrate leaching and runoff than soil properties (i.e. texture, pH, and bulk density). Reduction in nitrate runoff under NT or RTI was negatively correlated with precipitation, and the increased nitrate leaching was positively associated with soil bulk density. We further explored the combined effects of NT or RTI and winter cover crops and found that incorporating winter cover crops into NT systems effectively reduced nitrate runoff but did not significantly affect nitrate leaching. Our findings underscore the precautions of implementing NT or RTI to promote sustainable agriculture under changing climate conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between tillage intensity and nitrate loss pathways, contributing to informed decision-making in climate-smart agriculture."

Kanji,Simulated contrail-processed aviation soot aerosols are poor ice-nucleating particles at cirrus temperatures,"Aviation soot residuals released from contrails can become compacted upon sublimation of the ice crystals, generating new voids in the aggregates where ice nucleation can occur. Here we show that contrail-processed soot is highly compact but that it remains unable to form ice at a relative humidity different from that required for the formation of background cirrus from the more ubiquitous aqueous solution droplets, suggesting that it will not perturb cirrus cloud formation via ice nucleation. 
 Aviation soot surrogates processed in contrails are believed to become potent ice nuclei at cirrus temperatures. This is not verified for real aviation soot, which can have vastly different physico-chemical properties. Here, we sampled soot particles from in-use commercial aircraft engines and quantified the effect of contrail processing on their ice nucleation ability at T< 228 K. We show that aviation soot becomes compacted upon contrail processing, but that does not change their ice nucleation ability in contrast to other soot types. The presence of H2SO4 condensed in soot pores, the highly fused nature of the soot primary particles and their arrangement are what limit the volume of pores generated upon contrail processing, in turn limiting sites for ice nucleation. Furthermore, we hypothesized that contrail-processed aviation soot particles emitted from alternative jet fuel would also be poor ice-nucleating particles if their emission sizes remain small (< 150 nm)."

Our findings show that biomass burning and traffic-related emissions (especially from Euro 4 diesel cars) significantly contribute to BC concentrations. This research offers crucial insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to improve air quality in cities. 
 Understanding black carbon (BC) levels and its sources in urban environments is of paramount importance due to the far-reaching health, climate, and air quality implications. While several recent studies have assessed BC concentrations at specific fixed urban locations, there is a notable lack of knowledge in the existing literature on spatially resolved data alongside source estimation methods. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation of BC levels and sources in Modena (Po Valley, Italy), which serves as a representative example of a medium-sized urban area in Europe. Using a combination of multi-wavelength micro-aethalometer measurements and a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian modelling system, we studied two consecutive winter seasons (February–March 2020 and December 2020–January 2021). Leveraging the multi-wavelength absorption analyser (MWAA) model, we differentiate sources (fossil fuel combustion, FF, and biomass burning, BB) and components (BC vs. brown carbon, BrC) from micro-aethalometer measurements. The analysis reveals consistent, minimal diurnal variability in BrC absorption, in contrast to FF-related sources that exhibit distinctive diurnal peaks during rush hours, while BB sources show less diurnal variation. The city itself contributes significantly to BC concentrations (52 ± 16 %), with BB and FF playing a prominent role (35 ± 15 % and 9 ± 4 %, respectively). Long-distance transport also influences BC concentrations, especially in the case of BB and FF emissions, with 28 ± 1 % and 15 ± 2 %, respectively. When analysing the traffic-related concentrations, Euro 4 diesel passenger cars considerably contribute to the exhaust emissions. These results provide valuable insights for policy makers and urban planners to manage BC levels in medium-sized urban areas, taking into account local and long-distance sources."

Burrows,Automated detection of regions with persistently enhanced methane concentrations using  Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite data,"We developed an algorithm to automatically detect persistent methane source regions, to quantify their emissions and to determine their source types, by analyzing TROPOMI data from 2018–2021. The over 200 globally detected natural and anthropogenic source regions include small-scale point sources such as individual coal mines and larger-scale source regions such as wetlands and large oil and gas fields. 
 Methane (CH4) is an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and its rising concentration in the atmosphere contributes significantly to global warming. A comparatively small number of highly emitting persistent methane sources are responsible for a large share of global methane emissions. The identification and quantification of these sources, which often show large uncertainties regarding their emissions or locations, are important to support mitigating climate change. Daily global column-averaged dry air mole fractions of atmospheric methane (XCH4) are retrieved from radiance measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite with a moderately high spatial resolution, enabling the detection and quantification of localized methane sources. We developed a fully automated algorithm to detect regions with persistent methane enhancement and to quantify their emissions using a monthly TROPOMI XCH4 dataset from the years 2018–2021. We detect 217 potential persistent source regions (PPSRs), which account for approximately 20 % of the total bottom-up emissions. By comparing the PPSRs in a spatial analysis with anthropogenic and natural emission databases, we conclude that 7.8 % of the detected source regions are dominated by coal, 7.8 % by oil and gas, 30.4 % by other anthropogenic sources like landfills or agriculture, 7.3 % by wetlands, and 46.5 % by unknown sources. Many of the identified PPSRs are in well-known source regions, like the Permian Basin in the USA, which is a large production area for oil and gas; the Bowen Basin coal mining area in Australia; or the Pantanal Wetlands in Brazil. We perform a detailed analysis of the PPSRs with the 10 highest emission estimates, including the Sudd Wetland in South Sudan, an oil- and gas-dominated area on the west coast in Turkmenistan, and one of the largest coal production areas in the world, the Kuznetsk Basin in Russia. The calculated emission estimates of these source regions are in agreement within the uncertainties in results from other studies but are in most of the cases higher than the emissions reported by emission databases. We demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically detect and quantify persistent localized methane sources of different source type and shape, including larger-scale enhancements such as wetlands or extensive oil- and gas-production basins."

This work furthers our understanding of the complex interactions between continental and marine environments. 
 The western North Atlantic Ocean is strongly influenced by continental outflow, making it an ideal region to study the atmospheric transition from a polluted coastline to the marine environment. Utilizing eight transit flights between the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) in Hampton, Virginia, and the remote island of Bermuda from NASA's Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE), we examine the evolution of trace gas and aerosol properties off the US East Coast. The first pair of flights flew along the wind trajectory of continental outflow, while the other flights captured a mix of marine and continental air mass sources. For measurements within the boundary layer (BL), there was an offshore decline in particle N<100 nm, N>100 nm, CH4, CO, and CO2 concentrations, all leveling off around ∼900 km offshore from the LaRC. These trends are strongest for the first pair of flights. In the BL, offshore declines in organic mass fraction and increases in sulfate mass fraction coincide with increasing hygroscopicity based on f(RH) measurements. Free troposphere measurements show a decline in N<100 nm, but other measured parameters are more variable when compared to the prominent offshore gradients seen in the BL. Pollution layers exist in the free troposphere, such as smoke plumes, that can potentially entrain into the BL. This work provides detailed case studies with a broad set of high-resolution measurements to further our understanding of the transition between continental and marine environments."

Using a large number of process-resolving simulations of marine stratocumulus, we show that solar heating drives a negative feedback mechanism that buffers the persistent negative trend in cloud water adjustment after sunrise. This finding has implications for the dependence of the cloud cooling effect on the timing of deliberate aerosol perturbations. 
 Marine low-level clouds are key to the Earth's energy budget due to their expansive coverage over global oceans and their high reflectance of incoming solar radiation. Their responses to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations remain the largest source of uncertainty in estimating the anthropogenic radiative forcing of climate. A major challenge is the quantification of the cloud water response to aerosol perturbations. In particular, the presence of feedbacks through microphysical, dynamical, and thermodynamical pathways at various spatial and temporal scales could augment or weaken the response. Central to this problem is the temporal evolution in cloud adjustment, governed by entangled feedback mechanisms. We apply an innovative conditional Monte Carlo subsampling approach to a large ensemble of diurnal large-eddy simulation of non-precipitating marine stratocumulus to study the role of solar heating in governing the evolution in the relationship between droplet number and cloud water. We find a persistent negative trend in this relationship at night, confirming that the role of microphysically enhanced cloud-top entrainment. After sunrise, the evolution in this relationship appears buffered and converges to ∼-0.2 in the late afternoon. This buffering effect is attributed to a strong dependence of cloud-layer shortwave absorption on cloud liquid water path. These diurnal cycle characteristics further demonstrate a tight connection between cloud brightening potential and the relationship between cloud water and droplet number at sunrise, which has implications for the impact of the timing of advertent aerosol perturbations."

Leveraging machine learning techniques, we constructed a long-term global sea surface DMS gridded dataset with daily resolution. Compared to previous datasets, our new dataset holds promise for improving atmospheric chemistry modeling and advancing our comprehension of the climate effects associated with oceanic DMS. 
 The oceanic emission of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) plays a vital role in the Earth's climate system and constitutes a substantial source of uncertainty when evaluating aerosol radiative forcing. Currently, the widely used monthly climatology of sea surface DMS concentration falls short of meeting the requirement for accurately simulating DMS-derived aerosols with chemical transport models. Hence, there is an urgent need for a high-resolution, multi-year global sea surface DMS dataset. Here we develop an artificial neural network ensemble model that uses nine environmental factors as input features and captures the variability of the DMS concentration across different oceanic regions well. Subsequently, a global sea surface DMS concentration and flux dataset (1° × 1°) with daily resolution spanning from 1998 to 2017 is established. According to this dataset, the global annual average concentration was ∼ 1.71 nM, and the annual total emissions were ∼  17.2 Tg S yr−1, with ∼ 60 % originating from the Southern Hemisphere. While overall seasonal variations are consistent with previous DMS climatologies, notable differences exist in regional-scale spatial distributions. The new dataset enables further investigations into daily and decadal variations. Throughout the period 1998–2017, the global annual average concentration exhibited a slight decrease, while total emissions showed no significant trend. The DMS flux from our dataset showed a stronger correlation with the observed atmospheric methanesulfonic acid concentration compared to those from previous monthly climatologies. Therefore, it can serve as an improved emission inventory of oceanic DMS and has the potential to enhance the simulation of DMS-derived aerosols and associated radiative effects. The new DMS gridded products are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11879900 (Zhou et al., 2024)."

Satellites have been used to monitor SO2 globally, including remote areas. Here we describe a new satellite SO2 dataset from the OMPS instrument that flies on the N20 satellite. Results show that the new dataset agrees well with the existing ones from other satellites and can help to continue the global monitoring of SO2 from space. 
 For nearly 2 decades, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA Aura spacecraft (launched in 2004) and the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) aboard the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite (launched in 2011) have been providing global monitoring of SO2 column densities from both anthropogenic and volcanic activities. Here, we describe the version-1 NOAA-20 (N20)/OMPS SO2 product (https://doi.org/10.5067/OMPS/OMPS_N20_NMSO2_PCA_L2_Step1.1, Li et al., 2023), aimed at extending the long-term climate data record. To achieve this goal, we apply a principal component analysis (PCA) retrieval technique, also used for the OMI and SNPP/OMPS SO2 products, to N20/OMPS. For volcanic SO2 retrievals, the algorithm is identical between N20 and SNPP/OMPS and produces consistent retrievals for eruptions such as Kilauea in 2018 and Raikoke in 2019. For anthropogenic SO2 retrievals, the algorithm has been customized for N20/OMPS, considering its greater spatial resolution and reduced signal-to-noise ratio as compared with SNPP/OMPS. Over background areas, N20/OMPS SO2 slant column densities (SCDs) show relatively small biases, comparable retrieval noise with SNPP/OMPS (after aggregation to the same spatial resolution), and remarkable stability with essentially no drift during 2018–2023. Over major anthropogenic source areas, the two OMPS retrievals are generally well-correlated, but N20/OMPS SO2 is biased low, especially for India and the Middle East, where the differences reach ∼ 20 % on average. The reasons for these differences are not fully understood but are partly due to algorithmic differences. Better agreement (typical differences of ∼ 10 %–15 %) is found over degassing volcanoes. SO2 emissions (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEASURES/SO2/DATA406, Fioletov et al., 2022) from large point sources, inferred from N20/OMPS retrievals, agree well with those based on OMI, SNPP/OMPS, and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with correlation coefficients >0.98 and overall differences <10 %. The ratios between the estimated emissions and their uncertainties offer insights into the ability of different satellite instruments to detect and quantify SO2 sources. While TROPOMI has the highest ratios of all four sensors, the ratios from N20/OMPS are slightly greater than OMI and substantially greater than SNPP/OMPS. Overall, our results suggest that the version-1 N20/OMPS SO2 product will successfully continue the long-term OMI and SNPP/OMPS SO2 data records. Efforts currently underway will further enhance the consistency of retrievals between different instruments, facilitating the development of multi-decade, coherent global SO2 datasets across multiple satellites."

Additionally, we present a novel tracer transport scheme for the sea ice coupled model and demonstrate that this scheme fulfills the requirements for conservation, accuracy, efficiency, and monotonicity in an idealized test. Our new coupled model also has good performance in realistic tests. 
 As the demand for increased resolution and complexity in unstructured sea ice models is growing, higher demands are also placed on the sea ice transport scheme. In this study, we couple the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydro-science Integrated System Model (SCHISM, v5.11) with Icepack (v1.3.4), the column physics package of the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE); a key step is to implement a total variation diminishing (TVD) transport scheme for the multi-class sea ice module in the coupled model. Compared with the second-order upwind scheme and the finite-element flux-corrected transport (FEM-FCT) scheme, the TVD transport scheme is overall superior when evaluated based on conservation, accuracy, efficiency (even with very high resolution), and strict monotonicity. Although it is slightly weaker than FEM-FCT in terms of accuracy alone, the TVD scheme still outperforms the other two schemes in comprehensive performance. The new coupled model outperforms the existing single-class ice model of SCHISM in the case of Lake Superior. For the Arctic Ocean case, it successfully reproduces the long-term changes in the sea ice extent,  sea ice boundary, concentration observations from satellites, and thickness from in situ measurement."

 A novel split-explicit (SE) external mode solver for the Finite volumE Sea ice–Ocean Model (FESOM2) and its sub-versions is presented. It is compared with the semi-implicit (SI) solver currently used in FESOM2. The split-explicit solver for the external mode utilizes a dissipative asynchronous (forward–backward) time-stepping scheme that does not require additional filtering during the barotropic sub-cycling. Its implementation with arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian vertical coordinates like Z star (z*) and Z tilde (z̃) is explored. The comparisons are performed through multiple test cases involving idealized and realistic global simulations.

It creates layers of snow accumulation at fixed times during the simulation, which are used to model the internal stratification of the ice sheet. Together with reconstructed isochrones from radiostratigraphy data, ELSA can be used to assess ice sheet models and to improve their parameterization. ELSA can be used coupled to an ice sheet model or forced with its output. 
 We provide a detailed description of the ice-sheet layer age tracer Englacial Layer Simulation Architecture (ELSA) – a model that uses a straightforward method to simulate the englacial stratification of large ice sheets – as an alternative to Eulerian or Lagrangian tracer schemes. ELSA's vertical axis is time, and individual layers of accumulation are modeled explicitly and are isochronal. ELSA is not a standalone ice-sheet model but requires unidirectional coupling to another model providing ice physics and dynamics (the “host model”). Via ELSA's layer tracing, the host model’s output can be evaluated throughout the interior using ice core or radiostratigraphy data. We describe the stability and resolution dependence of this coupled modeling system using simulations of the last glacial cycle of the Greenland ice sheet using one specific host model. Key questions concern ELSA's design to maximize usability, which includes making it computationally efficient enough for ensemble runs, as well as exploring the requirements for offline forcing of ELSA with output from a range of existing ice-sheet models. ELSA is an open source and collaborative project, and this work provides the foundation for a well-documented, flexible, and easily adaptable model code to effectively force ELSA with (any) existing full ice-sheet model via a clear interface."

Here we illustrate the spurious effect that tides can have on simulations of south-east Asia. Although they play an important role in determining the state of the ocean, they can increase numerical errors and make simulation outputs less realistic. We also provide insights into how to reduce these errors. 
 The role of mixing between layers of different densities is key to how the ocean works and interacts with other components of the Earth's system. Correctly accounting for its effect in numerical simulations is therefore of utmost importance. However, numerical models are still plagued with spurious sources of mixing, originating mostly from the vertical advection schemes in the case of fixed-coordinate models. As the number of phenomena explicitly resolved by models increases, so does the amplitude of resolved vertical motions and the amount of spurious numerical mixing, and regional models are no exception to this. This paper provides a clear illustration of this phenomenon in the context of simulating the south-east Asian (SEA) seas along with a simple way to reduce its impact. This region is known for its particularly strong internal tides and the fundamental role they play in the dynamic of the region. Using the Symphonie ocean model, simulations including and excluding tides and using a pseudo-third-order upwind advection scheme on the vertical are compared to several reference datasets, and the impact on water masses is assessed. The high diffusivity of this advection scheme is demonstrated along with the importance of accounting for tidal mixing for a correct representation of water masses. Simultaneously, we present an improvement in this advection scheme to make it more suitable for use in the vertical. Simulations with the new formulation are added for comparison. We conclude that the use of a higher-order numerical diffusion operator greatly improves the overall performance of the model."

We initiated this work due to a need to leverage cloud computing advances and to ease the learning curve for new users. 
 The Community Multiscale Air Quality Model  (CMAQ) is a local- to hemispheric-scale numerical air quality modeling system developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and supported by the Community Modeling and Analysis System (CMAS) center. CMAQ is used for regulatory purposes by the USEPA program offices and state and local air agencies and is also widely used by the broader global research community to simulate and understand complex air quality processes and for computational environmental fate and transport and climate and health impact studies. Leveraging state-of-the-science cloud computing resources for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, CMAQ is now available as a fully tested, publicly available technology stack (HPC cluster and software stack) for two major cloud service providers (CSPs). Specifically, CMAQ configurations and supporting materials have been developed for use on their HPC clusters, including extensive online documentation, tutorials and guidelines to scale and optimize air quality simulations using their services. These resources allow modelers to rapidly bring together CMAQ, cloud-hosted datasets, and visualization and evaluation tools on ephemeral clusters that can be deployed quickly and reliably worldwide. Described here are considerations in CMAQ version 5.3.3 cloud use and the supported resources for each CSP, presented through a benchmark application suite that was developed as an example of a typical simulation for testing and verifying components of the modeling system. The outcomes of this effort are to provide findings from performing CMAQ simulations on the cloud using popular vendor-provided resources, to enable the user community to adapt this for their own needs, and to identify specific areas of potential optimization with respect to storage and compute architectures."

We find that our model is able to capture the distribution of precipitation very well but suffers from overestimating the precipitation amounts over high elevation. Increasing the resolution further has no impact on reducing this bias, while increasing the domain size does have modest impacts. 
 Using the regionally refined mesh (RRM) configuration of the US Department of Energy's Simple Cloud-Resolving Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model (SCREAM), we simulate and evaluate four meteorologically distinct atmospheric river events over California.  We test five different RRM configurations, each differing in terms of the areal extent of the refined mesh and the resolution (ranging from 800 m to 3.25 km).  We find that SCREAM RRM generally has a good representation of the AR-generated precipitation in CA, even for the control simulation which has a very small 3 km refined patch, and is able to capture the fine-scale regional distributions that are controlled largely by the fine-scale topography of the state.  It is found that SCREAM generally has a wet bias over topography, most prominently over the Sierra Nevada mountain range, with a corresponding dry bias on the lee side.  We find that refining the resolution beyond 3 km (specifically 1.6 km and 800 m) has virtually no benefit towards reducing systematic precipitation biases but that improvements can be found when increasing the areal extent of the upstream refined mesh.  However, these improvements are relatively modest and only realized if the size of the refined mesh is expanded to the scale where employing RRM no longer achieves the substantial cost benefit it was intended for."

However, few have addressed the challenges in the prior vertical structure. A variety of observations are assimilated to examine the sensitivity of assimilation to vertical structure. Results show that assimilation can optimize the dust field in general. However, if the prior introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. 
 Modeling and observational techniques are pivotal in aerosol research, yet each approach exhibits inherent limitations. Aerosol observation is constrained by its limited spatial and temporal coverage compared to models. On the other hand, models tend to possess higher uncertainties and biases compared to observations. Aerosol data assimilation has gained popularity as it combines the advantages of both methods. Despite numerous studies in this domain, few have addressed the challenges faced in assimilating aerosol data with significant differences in magnitude and degree of freedom between the model state and observations, especially in the vertical direction. These challenges can lead to the preservation or even exacerbation of structural inaccuracies within the assimilation process. This study investigates the sensitivity of dust aerosol data assimilation to the vertical structure of the aerosol profile. We assimilate a variety of dust observations, encompassing ground-based particulate matter (PM10) measurements and satellite-derived dust optical depth (DOD) data, using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The assimilation process is elucidated, detailing the assimilation of raw ground-based and satellite-based observations for an optimized three-dimensional (3D) posterior state. To demonstrate the impact of accurate versus erroneous prior aerosol vertical profiles on the assimilation result, we select three cases of super dust storms for analysis. Our findings reveal that the assimilation of ground observations would optimize the dust field at the ground in general. However, the vertical structure presents a more complex challenge. When the prior profile accurately reflects the true vertical structure, the assimilation process can successfully preserve this structure. Conversely, if the prior profile introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. This is also found in the assimilation of DOD, which exhibits a comparable pattern in its sensitivity to the initial aerosol profile's accuracy."

Excluding a subset of watercourses from legal protection therefore threatens to alter freshwater ecosystems across entire river networks and the services they provide, such as drinking water and flood regulation. Considerable attention has been devoted to defining the scope of environmental laws protecting watercourses. Yet how these definitions are implemented through regulatory mapping, the cartography of waterbodies that legally qualify as watercourses and are thus protected, has not been examined outside of the United States. Here, we demonstrate the consequences of regulatory mapping on the extent of river networks that are protected, using France as a case study. By assembling the first map of France’s watercourses protected under the Water Law, we estimate that a quarter of previously mapped hydrographic segments were excluded from protection and found stark geographical variations in the extent of protected ecosystems. Headwater and nonperennial segments are disproportionately excluded by 28% compared to their prevalence (67%) in the overall hydrographic network, with potentially far-reaching implications for biodiversity and people.

We compared two common nontargeted MS2 acquisition strategies with liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry for structural annotation accuracy by SIRIUS+CSI:FingerID and MS2Tox toxicity prediction of 191 reference chemicals spiked to LC-MS water, groundwater, surface water, and wastewater. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) resulted in higher rates (19–62%) of correct structural annotations among reference chemicals in all matrices except wastewaters, compared to data-independent acquisition (DIA, 19–50%). However, DIA resulted in higher MS2 detection rates (59–84% DIA, 37–82% DDA), leading to higher true positive rates for spectral library matching, 40–73% compared to 34–72%. DDA resulted in higher MS2Tox toxicity prediction accuracy than DIA, with root-mean-square errors of 0.62 and 0.71 log-mM, respectively. Given the importance of MS2 spectral quality, we introduce a “CombinedConfidence” score to convey relative confidence in MS2Tox predictions and apply this approach to prioritize potentially ecotoxic nontargeted features in environmental waters."

In this study, samples of multimedia including air, rhizosphere soil, and tissues of wheat at various growing stages were collected near a mega fluorochemical industrial park in China. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was predominant in both air and soil with a strong correlation, highlighting air deposition as an important source in the terrestrial system. PFAS concentrations in wheat decreased in the stem and ear but increased in the leaves as wheat matured. Specifically, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) dominated in the aboveground tissues in the full-life-cycle, except that PFOA surpassed and became predominant in leaves during the filling and maturing stages, hinting at an airborne source. For all PFAS, both bioaccumulation factors and translocation factors (TFs) were inversely correlated with the carbon chain length during the full-life-cycle. The obtained TF values were considerably higher than those obtained from ambient sites reported previously, further suggesting an unneglectable foliar uptake from air, which was estimated to be 25% for PFOA. Moreover, spray irrigation remarkably enhanced the absorption of PFAS in wheat via foliar uptake relative to flood irrigation. The estimated daily intake of PFBA via wheat consumption and air inhalation was 0.50 μg/kg/day for local residents, at least one magnitude higher than the corresponding threshold, suggesting an alarmingly high exposure risk."

The emission-based multiphase model indicates that the HCHO-related pathway remains significant and can account for 20% of the particulate sulfur under clean marine conditions.

Despite its environmental significance, limited knowledge exists regarding the photosensitivity of permafrost-derived carbon in these ponds. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the photochemical transformations of organic matter in surface water samples from thermokarst ponds from different environments in northern Quebec, Canada. One pond near Kuujjuarapik is characterized by the presence of a collapsing palsa and is therefore organically rich, while the other pond near Umiujaq is adjacent to a collapsing lithalsa and thus contains fewer organic matters. Photobleaching occurred in the Umiujaq sample upon irradiation, whereas the Kuujjuarapik sample exhibited an increase in light absorbance at wavelength related to aromatic functionalities, indicating different photochemical aging processes. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the Kuujjuarapik sample preferentially photoproduced highly unsaturated CHO compounds with great aromaticity, while the irradiated Umiujaq sample produced a higher proportion of CHON aromatics with reduced nitrogen functionalities. Overall, this study illustrates that the photochemical reactivity of thermokarst pond water varies with the source of organic matter. The observed differences in reactivity contribute to an improved understanding of the photochemical emission of volatile organic compounds discovered earlier. Further insights into the photoinduced evolutions in thermokarst ponds may require the classification of permafrost-derived carbon therein."

In this work, the highly toxic HCN formation is inhibited, and the C3H6 resistance of Cu-SSZ-13 is improved by secondary metal modification via doping with rare earth/transition metal elements. Upon introduction of C3H6, the activity of Cu-SSZ-13 significantly decreases at medium-high temperatures. This is primarily due to the competitive reaction between C3H6 and NH3, which compete for the NH3 reductant required in the NH3–SCR reaction, resulting in the production of HCN. The unfavorable effect is alleviated on the modified catalysts due to their enhanced oxidation capabilities toward C3H6 and the HCHO intermediate, facilitating the complete oxidation of C3H6 to COx. This inhibits the undesirable partial oxidation reaction between C3H6 and NH3, thereby improving the activity of Cu-SSZ-13 at medium to high temperatures and significantly reducing the formation of highly toxic HCN."

In this study, we used laboratory gene expression and behavior data from two populations of Atlantic killifish Fundulus heteroclitus [one reference site (SCOKF) and one PCB-contaminated site (NBHKF)] to inform individual-based models simulating cohort growth and survival from embryonic exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations of neurotoxicants. Methylmercury exposed SCOKF exhibited brain gene expression changes in the si:ch211–186j3.6, si:dkey-21c1.4, scamp1, and klhl6 genes, which coincided with changes in feeding and swimming behaviors, but our models simulated no growth or survival effects of exposures. PCB126-exposed SCOKF had lower physical activity levels coinciding with a general upregulation in nucleic and cellular brain gene sets (BGS) and downregulation in signaling, nucleic, and cellular BGS. The NBHKF, known to be tolerant to PCBs, had altered swimming behaviors that coincided with 98% fewer altered BGS. Our models simulated PCB126 decreased growth in SCOKF and survival in SCOKF and NBHKF. Overall, our study provides a unique demonstration linking molecular and behavioral data to develop quantitative, testable predictions of ecological risk."

However, the underlying physical mechanisms of this cold wave, and the extent to which it is driven by internal variability or external forcing, are not fully understood. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and the HadGEM3‐A‐N216 attribution simulations, we identified internal variability as the main cause, contributing −5.14 K to surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies in North America. External forcing slightly mitigated the cold by 0.42 K. An internally generated wave train from the North Pacific, influenced in combination by Pacific‐North American (PNA) and North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) teleconnection patterns, initiated this intense cyclonic event, contributing −2.18 K and −2.12 K to SAT anomalies, respectively.

Wild,From Internal Variability to Aerosol Effects: Physical Mechanisms Behind Observed Decadal Trends in Surface Solar Radiation in the Western Pacific Ocean,"The Pacific Ocean, spanning over 30% of the Earth's surface, provides an ideal setting for studying the surface radiative balance due to its relatively pristine atmospheric conditions, far from anthropogenic emission sources. In this study we investigated the causes for the decadal trends of surface solar radiation (SSR) observed at eight stations scattered across seven islands in the Western Pacific Ocean, and extrapolated the results to the whole Western Pacific region based on the understanding of physical processes. Our results show a contrast between the causes for SSR trends in the northwestern and in the southwestern Pacific. In the Southwestern Pacific region, changes in cloud cover play a major role in the SSR decadal trends and interannual variability. The cloud cover in these areas is strongly associated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, especially those induced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Modes of variability such as ENSO and IPO affect evaporation and convection, impacting the large‐scale dynamics of the atmosphere, therefore influencing the distribution of the regions of deep convection. This consecutively impacts the cloud cover on a regional level and therefore SSR. In the Northern Hemisphere, conversely, a strong influence of these modes on cloudiness and SSR was not found. Instead, indirect evidence suggests that anthropogenic aerosol transported from Eastern Asia plays a major role in the decadal SSR trends. These results contribute to an improved understanding of the physical processes relevant for the long‐term SSR trends in remote regions."

We extract rotating fluid features that maintain structural coherence over time for near‐neutral, transitional, and convective boundary layers. In contrast to traditional analysis of coherent structures in turbulent boundary layers, we provide the first identification of vortex boundaries that are mathematically defined to behave as tracer transport barriers. Furthermore, these vortices are indifferent to the choice of observer reference frame and can be identified without user‐dependent velocity field decompositions. We find a strong agreement between the geometric qualities of the coherent structures we extract using our new method and classical descriptions of horizontal rolls and convective cells arising from decades of observational studies. We also quantify trends in individual vortex contributions to turbulent and advective fluxes of heat under varying atmospheric stability. Using recently developed tools from the theory of transport barrier fields, we compare diffusive momentum and heat barrier fields with the presence of rolls and cells, and determine a strong connection between heat and momentum orthogonality with the physical drivers of roll‐cell transformation. This newly employed frame‐indifferent characterization of coherent turbulent structures can be directly applied to numerical model output, and thus provides a new Lagrangian approach to understand complex scale‐dependent processes and their associated dynamics."

To more deeply understand BL and mixed‐phase cloud properties during CAO conditions, the Cold‐Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) took place from late 2019 into early 2020. During COMBLE, the U.S. Department of Energy's first Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility (AMF1) was deployed to Andenes, Norway, far downstream (∼1,000 km) from the Arctic pack ice. This study examines the two most intense CAOs sampled at the AMF1 site. The observed BL structures are open cellular with high (∼3–5 km) and cold (−30 to −50 ° ${}^{\circ}$C) cloud tops, and they often have pockets of high liquid water paths (LWPs; up to ∼1,000 g m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$) associated with strong updrafts and enhanced turbulence. We use a high‐resolution mesoscale model to explore how well four turbulence closure methods represent open cellular clouds. After applying a radar simulator to model outputs for direct evaluation, cloud top properties agree well with AMF1 observations (within ∼10%), but radar reflectivity and LWP agreement is more variable. Results suggest that the turbulent Prandtl number may play an important role for the simulated BL and cloud properties. All simulations produce enhanced precipitation rates that are well‐correlated with a cloud transition. Finally, the eddy‐diffusivity/mass‐flux approach produces the deepest cloud layer and therefore the largest and most coherent cellular structures. We recommend the use of a non‐local turbulence closure approach to better capture turbulent processes in intense CAOs."

 After injury, mammalian spinal cords develop scars to confine the lesion and prevent further damage. However, excessive scarring can hinder neural regeneration and functional recovery1,2. These competing actions underscore the importance of developing therapeutic strategies to dynamically modulate scar progression. Previous research on scarring has primarily focused on astrocytes, but recent evidence has suggested that ependymal cells also participate. Ependymal cells normally form the epithelial layer encasing the central canal, but they undergo massive proliferation and differentiation into astroglia following certain injuries, becoming a core scar component3–7. However, the mechanisms regulating ependymal proliferation in vivo remain unclear. Here we uncover an endogenous κ-opioid signalling pathway that controls ependymal proliferation. Specifically, we detect expression of the κ-opioid receptor, OPRK1, in a functionally under-characterized cell type known as cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neuron (CSF-cN). We also discover a neighbouring cell population that expresses the cognate ligand prodynorphin (PDYN). Whereas κ-opioids are typically considered inhibitory, they excite CSF-cNs to inhibit ependymal proliferation. Systemic administration of a κ-antagonist enhances ependymal proliferation in uninjured spinal cords in a CSF-cN-dependent manner. Moreover, a κ-agonist impairs ependymal proliferation, scar formation and motor function following injury. Together, our data suggest a paracrine signalling pathway in which PDYN+ cells tonically release κ-opioids to stimulate CSF-cNs and suppress ependymal proliferation, revealing an endogenous mechanism and potential pharmacological strategy for modulating scarring after spinal cord injury. Paracrine κ-opioid signalling among cells surrounding the spinal cord central canal modulates scar formation after injury."

 Hotspot lavas exhibit chemical heterogeneity, much of which is ascribed to heterogeneous deep mantle sources that contain various components with distinct composition, origin and age. However, characterizing primary melt compositions and mantle heterogeneity directly is challenging. Here we investigate a global dataset of hotspot lavas to constrain the incompatible-element composition of their parental melts and sources. Trace-element ratios indicate that the compositional heterogeneity of global hotspot lavas is not primary, but reflects processes that hotspot melts undergo as they ascend to the surface. We find the parental melts of these lavas, as well as of kimberlites and basalts from large igneous provinces, to be uniform in their elemental, and radiogenic and noble-gas isotope, composition. We suggest that the parental melts to all of these lavas derive from a depleted and outgassed mantle reservoir that was replenished with incompatible element-enriched material during the Archaean. This interpretation explains the elemental, radiogenic and noble-gas isotope compositions of hotspot lavas without requiring a heterogeneous lower mantle or the long-term survival of undegassed relics from a primordial Earth.

 Water can be dynamically over-compressed well into the stability field of ice VII. Whether water then transforms into ice VII, vitreous ice or a metastable novel crystalline phase remained uncertain. We report here the freezing of over-compressed water to ice VII by time-resolved X-ray diffraction. Quasi-isothermal dynamic compression paths are achieved using a dynamic-piezo-Diamond-Anvil-Cell, with programmable pressure rise time from 0.1 ms to 100 ms. By combining the present data set with those obtained on various ns-dynamical platforms, a complete evolution of the solidification pressure of metastable water versus the compression rate is rationalized within the classical nucleation theory framework. Also, when crystallization into ice VII occurs in between 1.6 GPa and 2.0 GPa, that is in the stability field of ice VI, a structural evolution over few ms is then observed into a mixture of ice VI and ice VII that seems to resolve apparent contradictions between previous results.

They show that while some species respond rapidly to change, evidence for mass poleward migration is limited. 
 Warming seas are expected to drive marine life poleward. However, few systematic observations confirm movement among entire communities at both warm and cool range edges. We analysed two continent-scale reef monitoring datasets to quantify changes in latitudinal range edges of 662 Australian shallow-water reef fishes and invertebrates over a decade punctuated by climate extremes. Temperate and tropical species both showed little net movement overall, with retreat often balancing expansion across the continent. Within regions, however, range edges shifted ~100 km per decade, on average, in the poleward or equatorward directions expected from warming or cooling. Although some species responded rapidly to temperature change, we found little evidence for mass poleward migration over the decade. Previous studies based on extreme species observations, rather than tracking all species through time, may have overestimated the prevalence, magnitude and longevity of range shifts amongst marine taxa. The authors use 12 years of broadscale survey data across 838 temperate and tropical coastal sites to investigate shifts in marine taxa range edges at the community level.

This Article shows how overseas coal-fired power plants could drive future trajectories of CO2 emissions in host countries. 
 Foreign investments in overseas coal-fired power plants (OCPs) largely impede decarbonization efforts, yet their global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have not been sufficiently quantified. Here we analyse investment data from 908 OCPs worldwide, and then reveal current annual emissions of 0.53 GtCO2 yr−1 and a historical cumulative total of 26 GtCO2. Developed nations account for 78% of these cumulative emissions on the basis of investments, while emissions from developing nations have surged from 8% in 1960 to 39% in 2022. Assuming unchanged policies and technologies, OCPs are projected to contribute an additional 15–30 GtCO2 in cumulative emissions by 2060 directly. Furthermore, they could stimulate local coal power growth in emerging economies, potentially adding 6.3–45.0 GtCO2 emissions indirectly. Our study underscores the critical importance of low-carbon policy interventions in emerging countries to curb the power-sector carbon emissions increasingly influenced by international capital.

 The global biodiversity crisis in agriculture is overlooked compared with that in wild systems. This must change if we are to safeguard domesticated plant diversity and meet global sustainable development and biodiversity goals. In this Perspective, we review tools developed through decades of wild biodiversity conservation and provide a framework for adapting and applying these for agrobiodiversity conservation. We focus on challenges and solutions around monitoring the status of agrobiodiversity, prioritizing its conservation, conserving it in situ and financing to ensure these actions can be maintained long term. Conserving global agrobiodiversity supports wider conservation efforts and is crucial for achieving food security, climate resilience and a sustainable future.

 Many insects utilise optical information in linearly polarised light for navigation, with the degree of linear polarisation (DoLP) determining whether the ‘visibility’ of such optical information is available to them. However, changes in degree of linear polarisation in response to increased atmospheric levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are poorly understood. We present analyses based on both ground-based monitoring and particulate matter modelling, establishing a quantitative relationship between PM2.5 mass concentration and the DoLP. We apply this relationship to a global PM2.5 projection for 2050 and estimate the increase in number and spatial extent of low visibility days for honeybees. We find an increase by up to 20% in the geographical extent of low visibility days in 2050, with an augmented frequency of low visibility days across an area exceeding 0.75 million km2 in India and 2 million km2 in China. More frequent and widespread low visibility conditions can reduce the ability of insects to navigate, especially in hotspot regions.

 To attain sustainable development goals and understand urban growth patterns, continuous and precise monitoring of built-up area heights is essential. This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased. The date of annual temperature peaks advanced during urban growth but delayed during urban renewal (demolition). Our time series analysis framework offers a new method for understanding the yearly dynamics of urban form and its influence on surface temperature, with potential applications in carbon emission and urban climate modeling studies."

 Well-facilitated farmland (WFF) construction is greatly responsible for agricultural sustainable development. How to quantitatively plan the WFF construction distribution and schedule is still challenging. This study thus introduced a simple but robust method, and took the typical dryland Yulin city to spatially identify its potential WFF construction areas and temporally determine construction priorities based on public data. By integrating satellite-observed croplands with survey-based statistical data, this study firstly obtained density maps of constant croplands. We found that constant cropland densities decreased from west to east in Yulin city. Jingbian and Dingbian counties of the west gave relatively dense distributions. Secondly, by overlaying evaluation indictors of WFF construction, we found over 96% of constant croplands had WFF construction potentials. Slope and fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) showed evidently spatial differences, which comprehensively reflected the potentials and difficulties of WFF construction. Therefore, an index SF, by considering normalized slope and FVC, was subsequently introduced to rank potential WFF construction priorities. According to the completion ratio and the assumption that giving priorities to develop better basic condition regions, batches of WFF construction areas were identified under the equal proportion planning scenario for each county (S1). Besides, a scenario of city-wide unified planning (S2) was also discussed. WFF construction areas in S2 were further concentrated in northwestern counties compared to those in S1. Both scenarios recommended that construction priorities were given to northwestern counties. This study could provide valuable references for arranging distributions and schedules of WFF construction."

How to find the balance between efficiency and accuracy in above ground biomass estimation of artificial young coniferous forest?,"•Identified the balance between efficiency and accuracy in biomass estimation. •Demonstrated the feasibility of UAV to replace manual measurements in plantations. •Analyzed impact of scale effects on accuracy of AGB prediction. 
 The accurate estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) is the basis for plantation forest carbon trading. This study focused on Picea crassifolia artificial plantations, extracting individual tree crown diameters and heights using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) data and calculating the individual tree biomass using allometric growth equations. These results were then used to train a satellite image AGB prediction model. In additional, satellite images were resampled to different resolutions to assess the impact of satellite image resolution on model the accuracy. Finally, the model with the highest accuracy among the deep learning algorithms was selected to predicts the AGB within the P. crassifolia plantation forest. The results indicated that the accuracy of single tree crown diameters extracted from P. crassifolia point clouds significantly surpassed those extracted from general point clouds and Crown Height Model (CHM), while the accuracy of the heights extracted from all three sources was similar; RepLKNet outperformed GoogLeNet and ResNet in identifying plantation forest; random forest slightly outperformed XGBoost in the capability of AGB prediction, while the accuracy of the AGB prediction models initially increasd and then decreasd with satellite image resolution, reaching the highest accuracy at a resolution of 50 m. This indicates that the optimal satellite image resolution for estimating the AGB in the study area was affected by scale effects of 50 m. Compared with the combination of satellite data and manual field measurements, the concurrent use of UAVs and satellites offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and accuracy. UAVs can replace manual sampling for carbon sequestration transactions for plantations."

 In August 2023, a detailed investigation of formaldehyde (HCHO) chemical characteristics on ozone (O3) polluted days and non-O3 polluted days in Wuhan was undertaken. The mean value of HCHO on O3 polluted days (3.02 ± 1.15 ppbv) was 122% higher than that on non-O3 polluted days (1.35 ± 0.41 ppbv). Utilizing Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed secondary formation as the dominant HCHO source (58.3% on non-O3 polluted days and 66.2% on O3 polluted days). On O3 polluted days, the contribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)/solvent usage and industrial emissions to HCHO were 13.7% and 8.2%, respectively, whereas on non-O3 polluted days, LPG/solvent use and diesel exhaust contributed 15.4% and 14.7%, respectively. The top ten species, with the highest Relative Incremental Reactivity (RIR) to HCHO, were mainly alkenes and aromatics, which remained consistent on both O3 and non-O3 polluted days. It is noteworthy that the RIR of isobutane to HCHO is significant in this study. Further reapportionment of secondary HCHO by a photochemical box model indicated that LPG/solvent usage (33.2%) contributed the most to HCHO on O3 polluted days, while diesel exhaust (31.9%) dominated on non-O3 polluted days. This research enhances understanding of HCHO in Wuhan, providing a theoretical basis for targeted pollution reduction and supporting efforts to improve air quality and public health."

 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface ozone air pollution have severe health consequences. Since China implemented the nationwide Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) in 2013, annual average PM2.5 concentrations have decreased while O3 concentration have increased in Beijing. It is unclear, however, to the extent that short-term meteorological variability has influenced these trends. To separate the influence of meteorology from long-term emissions-induced changes, we quantify the portion of the long-term PM2.5 and O3 concentration signals associated with short-term meteorological variability. Building off recent literature highlighting the regional nature of pollutant variability, we incorporate both locally observed meteorology and average regional reanalysis. We isolated sub-seasonal variability using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. Next, we trained and compared the utility of three statistical models of varying complexity (a linear model, a general additive model with splines, and a random forest) in their ability to predict out-of-sample daily concentrations. The random forest model yields the best predictive capability in holdout tests and predicts changing meteorological contributions to PM2.5 and ozone concurrent with changing concentrations across the study period. Results show an overall decrease in meteorology induced PM2.5 concentration variability at daily scales since 2013, but variability from meteorology has increased relative to mean PM2.5 concentrations. In contrast, O3 shows the opposite trend, with increasing meteorology-induced variability (meteorology-induced variability normalized by mean observed O3 has decreased). Our results show the importance of including regional meteorology in explaining local PM2.5 and O3 variability and quantify links between long-term policy implementation and short-term meteorological contributions to pollutant concentrations."

 Benzothiazoles (BTHs), commonly used in various industrial applications, have emerged as significant contaminants due to their widespread usage and potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. The aim of this study is to quantify and, for the first time, to characterize the particle size distribution of eight BTHs across twelve fractions of atmospheric aerosol representative of the urban boundary layer. Samples were collected from August to October 2023 in the urban area of Venice, located in the Po Valley, known for its poor air quality. Instrumental analysis was achieved via an UHPLC system coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.All target compounds were present in the samples analyzed and most of them tended to distribute mainly in the fine fraction of aerosol (<1.8 μm). An exception is given by BTH-SO3H, which presents a bimodal distribution with maxima centered in the coarse fraction; this may imply a different source compared to other BTHs. BTH-SH is the most abundant benzothiazole derivative, suggesting tyre debris as the main source since it is the main compound used in vulcanizing accelerators in rubber manufacture. Given its mutagenic properties, its high relative abundance could be of concern for human health.Resultsof this work provide valuable insights into the distribution of BTHs in urban aerosols, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at better understanding their sources and environmental pathways, fate and impacts."

 In this study, we detected for the first time a series of γ-lactones (C7-C16) isolated from Canadian high arctic aerosols collected from late February to June as the sun rises from below the horizon to the maximum. γ-Lactones were identified and quantified by GC-MS utilizing the fragment ion (m/z 85) of [C4H5O2]+.

The odd-carbon numbered γ-lactones such as C9 and C11 are produced by the oxidation of oleic (Δ9C18:1) and eicosanoic (Δ9C20:1) acids, respectively, to monocarboxylic acids in the atmosphere, followed by the subsequent oxidation to positional isomers of hydroxy acids and intramolecular esterification of γ-hydroxy acids. Unsaturated fatty acids, plausible sources of the γ-lactones, can originate from marine phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation via long-range atmospheric transport to the Arctic. Series of ω-oxoacids were also detected with the predominance of C9 species, supporting the photochemical oxidation of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids in the Arctic atmosphere after polar sunrise and/or during the long-range transport to the Arctic."

 When northern Taiwan is influenced locally, PM2.5 events occur in specific conditions. If it is also affected by long-range transport from mainland China in the northwest, the probability of these PM2.5 events increases. The current study applies WRF/CMAQ to study such case but focus on the local. From April 7 to 9, 2019, the Pacific high pressure extended westward, causing the prevailing weak southerly wind near Taiwan. The intensity of the Pacific high pressure weakened, and the wind speed near Taiwan also weakened. Therefore, the PM2.5 concentration in Taiwan increased. In northern Taiwan, the hourly PM2.5 concentration will inevitably increase to approximately 70 μg m−3. The ISAM of the CMAQ model demonstrates that local contributions to daily PM2.5 concentrations at the four representative monitoring stations in northern Taiwan are 3.5 to 16.2 μg m−3, greater than those from central, southern, and eastern Taiwan, from 1.8 to 6.7 μg m−3. We use the integrated process rate (IPR) and integrated reaction rate (IRR) of CMAQ to explore the formation mechanisms of PM2.5. The main causes of the increase in PM2.5 concentration are horizontal advection (HADV), aerosol processes (AERO), emissions (EMIS), and a small amount of cloud processes and aqueous chemistry (CLDS). The main source of NO3− is the reaction between OH and NO2 during the day and the reaction between N2O5 and water vapor at night. The gaseous HNO3 concentration reaches a peak near noon or soon after. The aerosol ANO3 concentration is high in the early morning. We also use the Sulfur Tracking Method (STM) of CMAQ to explore the sources of SO42−. Mainly it is from the local reaction of SO2 and H2O2. Finally, we apply AERO7 in CMAQ to explore the main sources of carbon components. The organic carbon (OC) concentration is much greater than the element carbon (EC) concentration, which indicates a strong local photochemical effect in northern Taiwan. OC mainly comes from low-volatility/semivolatile oxidized combustion OC, followed by low-volatility/semivolatile POA. Similar weather conditions occur in autumn, winter, and spring. When the weak southerly wind was around Taiwan, PM2.5 in northern Taiwan was noticed."

 This paper uses 28 years of satellite altimeter fusion data from 1993 to 2020 to identify and track the mesoscale eddies in the South China Sea based on the Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) closed contour method, with the goal of improving our overall understanding of mesoscale eddy activities in the South China Sea and further investigating the ocean dynamic processes in the region, so as to provide fundamental data for climate change studies. The study examined the spatiotemporal distribution, generation and demise, and movement trajectories of the eddies. Furthermore, key parameters including velocity, vortex radius, amplitude and Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) were analyzed, with a particular emphasis on the seasonal changes and mechanisms that influence EKE in two areas of the South China Sea with high energy values. The South China Sea has more cyclonic eddies than anticyclonic eddies, according to the study, and its eastern region is primarily home to high-frequency generating areas. However, the majority of the vortices will eventually dissipate in the western and central areas of the South China Sea. Furthermore, vortices usually flow farther to the west. With decreasing latitude, the eddy radius and EKE distribution gradually increase, whereas the amplitude is contrary. EKE is caused by the interaction of factors including wind field driving, seawater movement, and circulation.

 The Asian-Pacific Oscillation (APO), featuring a seesaw pattern in the upper-tropospheric temperatures between Asia and the North Pacific, plays profound roles in the Northern Hemispheric climate anomalies. So, its variability and associated physical mechanisms are of great interest. Although progress has been achieved for the APO variability at the interannual time scale, the understanding of its interdecadal variability remains relatively poor. Based on the twentieth-century reanalysis and the simulations of the preindustrial control, Pacific pacemaker, and large ensemble experiments, this study reports a salient contribution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to the interdecadal variability of the APO during summer, featured as a warm (cold) PDO phase accompanying a negative (positive) APO polarity. During the warm PDO phase, the sea surface temperature (SST) warming over the eastern Pacific is conducive to local ascending anomalies, which teleconnect with descending anomalies over the Tibetan Plateau through zonal vertical circulations. The anomalous ascent (descent) over the eastern Pacific (Tibetan Plateau) tends to strengthen (weaken) the atmospheric heating, beneficial for a warming (cooling) of the troposphere in situ. In addition, the PDO-related meridional SST gradient anomalies favor a southward shift of the subtropical jet stream, weakening the South Asian high and the North Pacific trough in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to the atmospheric situation of a negative APO phase. Quantitative analysis from the large ensemble simulations indicates that the PDO may contribute to approximately 48% of recent APO interdecadal variation from the negative phase to the positive phase in the late 1990s."

 Quantitative seasonal Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall forecasting has been a challenge for the climate models as it is sensitive to cloud properties, which are modulated by large-scale dynamics. Proper understanding of the role of dynamics, aerosols, and cloud microphysical processes is important for the precipitation calculation in dynamical models. The all-India averaged seasonal ISM rainfall (ISMR) from June to September had been normal or above normal, however there were large spatial variations. Some meteorological subdivisions, the majority of which lie in the Gangetic Plains, received deficient seasonal rainfall during recent years 2022 and 2010. The quantitative seasonal prediction of the spatial distribution of ISMR from global coupled models (GCMs) has also shown a hard time for accurate spatial rainfall distribution. Four monsoon years (2022, 2021, 2011, and 2010) are considered, in which the country as a whole (all India land points) was ‘above normal’ or ‘normal’. However, in two specific years (2022 and 2010), some subdivisions received deficient rainfall (17% and 15% of the total area). We have used several datasets from the ground, and satellite observations, along with reanalysis products and computed climatology and anomalies for monsoon years of 2022 and 2010. The low-level wind and vertical velocity along with cloud microphysics played a pivotal role in the heterogeneous distribution of ISMR during 2022 and 2010 as compared to years 2021 and 2011. Here, we have demonstrated that the spatial heterogeneity of the positive and negative precipitation anomalies was consistent with cloud properties. Aerosols might have an impact on the cloud microphysical processes and modulate cloud properties and rainfall over different regions due to the availability of water vapor. Therefore, the inclusion of aerosol indirect effects in climate models is crucial for better interactions among dynamics, aerosol, and cloud microphysics. Proper representation of cloud droplet size distribution and microphysical conversion rates might be helpful for quantitative seasonal ISMR forecasting at a smaller spatial scale."

 Induced by numerous environmental and anthropogenic factors, the frequency of compound hot extremes (CoHot) is increasing globally. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of different factors in the change of CoHot, as most studies focused solely on individual factors. We systematically attribute the long-term trends of summertime CoHot in China to 24 factors including climate background, climate change, urbanization (including impervious area expansion and three-dimensional urban morphology), and vegetation change, using partial least square regression (PLSR) and variable importance projections for analysis. Cross-evaluation results based on 2259 meteorological stations indicate that the PLSR model accurately simulates the trends of CoHot frequency, duration, and intensity, with a relative error of 4–20% from national to individual station scales. A warm and humid climate background, rising average summertime temperatures, impervious area expansions, high building volume densities, low building heights, and vegetation wilting are the main factors that favoring the increasing and intensifying trends of CoHot. Although summertime warming contributes the most, the significance of urbanization and vegetation greening has been growing in recent years. Urbanization's contribution increases from 9.3% on a national scale to over 40% in urban centers, mainly due to increased building volume density rather than expansions of impervious area. In northern China, vegetation greening has reduced the local increasing trends in frequency/duration of CoHot by 20% to 40%, and such mitigation effects are primarily induced by increased vegetation cover. Our results suggest that, reducing building volume density and promoting vegetation greening can mitigate the increasing risk of CoHot under global warming."

 Dust storms frequently occur in the spring over East Asia, affecting southern Mongolia and northeast China. An exceptionally powerful dust storm occurred in East Asia from March 14th to March 18th, 2021. To investigate the ability of climate models to simulate severe dust storms, we employed the Weather Research Forecast model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) with Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), SHAO and KOK dust emission schemes to simulate the evolution of this event and to characterize dust aerosols long-range transport. Results showed that this storm was caused by a Mongolian cyclone depicted at 850 hPa with a cold front, which swept dust aerosols southeastward across southern Mongolia to northeast China. Model evaluation with satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and observational PM10 concentrations revealed that the SHAO dust emission scheme performed better in simulating spatial and temporal distribution of AOD over the Gobi Desert (GD) but overestimated them over Taklimakan Desert (TD). In contrast, the GOCART dust emission scheme underestimated AOD over most areas except the Taklimakan Desert; the KOK dust emission scheme overestimated them over both TD and GD. Overall, the SHAO dust emission scheme had good performance in simulating the surface PM10 concentrations over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) and depicted an increase in PM10 concentrations, which denoted the transport of dust aerosols over YRB. As a better description of the physical process of dust emission flux over the eastern region of the Gobi Desert, the SHAO dust emission scheme depicted well the spatial and temporal evolution of dust plume episodes, especially over northeast China and YRB. The significant differences in dust emission fluxes between the three dust emission schemes were attributed to the sensitivity of threshold friction velocity and erodibility factor. Thereunto, the SHAO dust emission scheme incorporated well soil particle size distribution and threshold velocity to produce the dust emission flux, which allowed higher dust emission flux over the eastern GD and under strong southwesterly transported dust aerosols to East Central China's region of North China Plain (NCP) and YRB. This study will help further the simulation of extreme dust events more accurately and the exploration of climate change's effect on dust events over East Asia."

 This paper examines the temporal variability of aridity in Argentina during the period 1961–2020. Monthly data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were used to define climate types according to the Aridity Index (AI) from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Argentina presents a variety of climates ranging from arid and semiarid to subhumid and humid, suggesting simultaneous water deficit and excess conditions. However, an aridity increase in the past six decades has been observed in much of the country, contrasting with reduced areas that have become wetter. Since these changes were not uniform across the study area, a regional-level analysis was conducted to adequately capture the aridity temporal patterns, including trends, jumps, seasonality, and cycles. In general, there was a decrease in the annual AI in most regions, with non-linear patterns such as long-term oscillations, shorter-duration cycles, and abrupt variations in the average. Seasonal aridity changes showed variabilities according to the season, with higher humidity during summer and autumn, and greater aridity during winter and spring. Simultaneously, seasonal AI experienced periodic behavior with significant arid and humid cycles alternating every 10–15 years. These findings highlight the complexity of climate changes, which vary by region and season."

M. E. Zucker",Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wave detector below the standard quantum limit,"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision, giving rise to an apparent limitation known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Gravitational-wave detectors use photons to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors and so are affected by the SQL. We investigated the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after the experimental realization of frequency-dependent squeezing designed to surpass the SQL. For the LIGO Livingston detector, we found that the upgrade reduces quantum noise below the SQL by a maximum of three decibels between 35 and 75 hertz while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, increasing the overall detector sensitivity during astrophysical observations."

Su,Germline mutations in a G protein identify signaling cross-talk in T cells,"Humans with monogenic inborn errors responsible for extreme disease phenotypes can reveal essential physiological pathways. We investigated germline mutations inGNAI2, which encodes Gαi2, a key component in heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction usually thought to regulate adenylyl cyclase–mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Patients with activating Gαi2mutations had clinical presentations that included impaired immunity. Mutant Gαi2impaired cell migration and augmented responses to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We found that mutant Gαi2influenced TCR signaling by sequestering the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein RASA2, thereby promoting RAS activation and increasing downstream extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT S6 signaling to drive cellular growth and proliferation."

Hartwig,Polyolefin waste to light olefins with ethylene and base-metal heterogeneous catalysts,"The selective conversion of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and mixtures of these two polymers to form products with high volume demand is urgently needed because current methods suffer from low selectivity, produce large quantities of greenhouse gases, or rely on expensive, single-use catalysts. The isomerizing ethenolysis of unsaturated polyolefins could be an energetically and environmentally viable route to propylene and isobutylene; however, noble-metal homogeneous catalysts and an unsaturated polyolefin are currently required and the process has been limited to PE. We show that the simple combination of tungsten oxide on silica and sodium on gamma-alumina transforms PE, PP, or a mixture of the two, including postconsumer forms of these materials, to propylene or a mixture of propylene and isobutylene in greater than 90% yield at 320°C without the need for dehydrogenation of the starting polyolefins."

Despite this prevalence, gaps remain in understanding the evolution of brown rat commensalism, their global dispersal, and mechanisms underlying contemporary adaptations to diverse environments. In this Review, we explore recent advances in the evolutionary history of brown rats and discuss key challenges, including finding and accurately dating historical specimens, disentangling histories of multiple domestication events, and synthesizing functional variation in wild rat populations with the development of laboratory strains. Advances in zooarchaeology and population genomics will usher in a new golden age of research on the evolutionary biology of brown rats, with positive feedbacks on their use as biomedical models."

Of the vertebrate animal taxa that share pathogens with us, rodents are the most abundant and diverse, with hundreds of species of confirmed zoonotic hosts, some of which have nearly global distributions. However, only 12% of rodent species are known to be sources of pathogens that also infect people, and those rodents that do are now recognized as tending to share a suite of predictable traits. Here, we characterize those traits and explore them in the context of three emerging or reemerging rodent-borne zoonotic diseases of people: Lassa fever, Lyme disease, and plague."

Converging evidence for the capacity of many species to share others’ affective states has emerged, sparking interest in the empathic capacities of rats. Recent research has demonstrated that rats are a highly cooperative species and are motivated by others’ distress to prosocial actions, such as opening a door or pulling a chain to release trapped conspecifics. Studies of rat affect, cognition, and neural function provide compelling evidence that rats have some capacity to represent others’ needs, to instrumentally act to improve their well-being, and are thus capable of forms of targeted helping. Rats’ complex abilities raise the importance of integrating new measures of rat well-being into scientific research."
