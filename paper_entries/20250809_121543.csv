While such corrections have been developed for square-shaped peaks, we present an approach for correcting peaks with complex shapes. Our method is demonstrated using oxygen clumped isotopes measured in pure oxygen, where the peak tops are linearly increasing and/or negatively curved. 
 Secondary electrons emitted from the surfaces of Faraday cups can significantly influence the peak shapes and intensities of minor isotopes. As the number of these electrons depends on the source pressure,  pressure baseline (PBL) corrections have been proposed to mitigate these pressure-dependent background effects and to reduce the apparent dependence of Δ47 on δ47 (non-linearity) as observed in clumped-isotope studies of CO2. In this work, we describe the determination of pressure baseline corrections for signals whose peak tops vary considerably across their width. Our study focuses on peaks with very small signal-to-baseline ratios (1.005 to 1.025) generated by the clumped isotopes 17O18O (linearly increasing peak top) and 18O18O (negatively curved peak top). The measurements were all performed in pure-oxygen gas using the compact, low-mass-resolution Elementar isoprime precisION isotope ratio mass spectrometer. We demonstrate that our corrections significantly reduce the influence of secondary electrons and that the adjusted clumped-isotope signals correctly increase with signal intensity. Furthermore, we extensively discuss correction procedures of varying complexity and explain why the best results were obtained by predicting multiple background values from the corresponding signals on the peak top (on-peak signals). Through this approach, we typically achieved standard deviations around 1×10-9 (35/32), 0.2 ‰ (δ35), 0.5 ‰ (Δ35), 7×10-9 (36/32), 0.1 ‰ (δ36), and 0.1 ‰ (Δ36) for 120 intervals (20 s integration). For the capital delta values, this corresponds to standard errors of the mean of less than 0.05 ‰, achieved with a total integration time of approximately 40 min and an analysis time of about 6 h. We also show that the uncertainties of certain measurement parameters can be further reduced by optimising the measurement position (acceleration voltage) and applying additional drift corrections. For instance, for 35/32- and 36/32-related parameters, we observed improvements of up to 1 order of magnitude and a factor of 7, respectively. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we also show that the main uncertainties in our capital delta values are related to the on-peak signals, predicted backgrounds, and the peak-top curvature (only for Δ36). Additionally, we present a brief study on the influence of pressure baseline corrections on major oxygen isotope ratios and their delta values. While these corrections had an insignificant effect on their uncertainties, the absolute values of 33/32 and 34/32 changed markedly."

The PL1GD-T dataset was developed using radial basis functions applied to quality-controlled observations from ground weather stations and evaluated using cross-validation methods. This open-access dataset is crucial for climate change impact studies on a smaller scale and can serve a wide range of users, including researchers, administrative bodies, and society. 
 This paper presents a high-resolution gridded dataset of daily minimum (TN), mean (TG), and maximum (TX) near-surface air temperatures over Poland, covering the period from 1951 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The PL1GD-T dataset was developed using radial basis functions (RBFs), which were applied to quality-controlled observations from 347 ground weather stations at the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management – National Research Institute. TG is calculated consistently using the same formula throughout the entire period, and daily TN, TG, and TX fields are generated based on available daily records. Cross-validation methods evaluated the gridding procedure on a monthly basis. The linear RBF was selected by hold-out cross-validation (HO-CV) as the most suitable for the gridding procedure among other RBFs. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was performed to ensure the ability to reproduce the original characteristics variability. The values of the scores averaged over all stations for individual months are in the range of 0.3–0.2, 0.3–0.2, and 0.1–0.2 (K) for the bias; in the range of 1.23–1.46, 0.69–0.92, and 0.84–0.99 (K) for the root-mean-squared difference (RMSD); and in range of 0.91–0.97, 0.98–0.99, and 0.98–0.99 for the correlation for TN, TG, and TX, respectively. The RMSD is clearly altitude-dependent, increasing from lowland to mountainous regions. The dataset's scope and resolution allowed for the robust estimation of local climate variability characteristics and observed trends. The availability of high-resolution datasets in both spatial and temporal contexts is essential for climate change impact analysis on a smaller scale. This new dataset provides a quality-validated, high-resolution, and open-access dataset that could be utilised by society, administrative bodies, or research institutions for climate-related applications. The dataset is publicly available from the repository of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management – National Research Institute at https://doi.org/10.26491/imgw_repo/PL1GD-T (Jaczewski et al., 2024)."

This comprehensive dataset can strongly support ET modeling, water–carbon cycle monitoring, and long-term climate change analysis. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle. Latent heat flux (LE, equivalent to ET in W m−2) observed by the eddy covariance (EC) technique, commonly known as LEEC, has been widely recognized as a highly accurate benchmark for global ET estimation. Currently, there is an increasing need for long-time-series benchmark data to support climate change analysis, construction of new models, and validation of new products. However, existing LEEC datasets, like FLUXNET2015, face significant challenges due to limited observation periods and extensive data gaps, which hinders their application in ET modeling and global change analysis. To address these issues, we developed a gap-filling and prolongation framework for LEEC data and established a benchmark dataset for global ET estimation from 2000 to 2022 across 64 sites at various timescales. The framework mainly includes three parts: site selection and data pre-processing, generation of gap-filled half-hourly/hourly LE data, and generation of prolonged daily LE data. We selected 64 sites from FLUXNET2015 based on rigorous filtering criteria. A novel bias-corrected random forest (RF) algorithm was used for gap-filling and prolongation in the framework to produce seamless half-hourly and daily LE data. After analysis, the framework using the novel bias-corrected RF algorithm achieves excellent performance in both hourly gap-filling and daily prolongation, with mean root mean square error values of 33.86 and 16.58 W m−2, respectively. The algorithm significantly improves the gap-filling performance for long gaps and extreme values compared with the original RF and marginal distribution sampling algorithm. The results demonstrate robust prolongation performance of our framework in both prolongation directions and temporal stability. Furthermore, our gap-filled dataset demonstrates strong consistency with FLUXNET2015 in terms of data distribution. In conclusion, we have published the first benchmark dataset for global ET estimation based on FLUXNET2015 from 2000 to 2022. This dataset can effectively provide data support for ET modeling, water–carbon cycle monitoring, and climate change analysis.

This dataset will contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of land-atmosphere interactions on the TP and support comprehensive research of the energy-water cycle and climate change. 
 In recent decades, the climate of Tibetan Plateau has undergone notable changes, which has a strong influence on global climate systems and human activities, making it a research hotspot. However, due to its extreme elevation, harsh environment, and complex underlying surface, long-term observations of the central Plateau's atmospheric vertical profiles have been challenging and scientific data sharing is crucial and in urgent need. This paper presents a 9-year observational dataset (2014–2022) with hourly temporal resolution from the Nagqu region of northern Tibet. The dataset is a combination of four field stations covering the central Tibetan Plateau, which recorded near-surface meteorological data, radiation budget, turbulent fluxes, and soil hydrothermal characteristics. All observational items in this dataset underwent data processing and quality control to ensure data quality. This dataset represents the most detailed raw observational data on the central Tibetan Plateau's spatial coverage and recent changes.

Our research presents a rare, decade-long dataset of stable isotope measurements to better understand how water moves within dryland environments. This work helps scientists quantify changes in the water cycle and improve our understanding of how drylands may respond to a changing climate. 
 Drylands are essential Earth System components, and dryland dynamics are strongly controlled by water availability. Long-term ground observations of hydrological parameters are often lacking in most dryland ecosystems. A series of foundational and unique water input data, including both rainfall and non-rainfall (i.e., fog and dew) components, in hyper-arid desert environments have been presented in this database. These observations provide comprehensive isotope measurements of rainfall and non-rainfall water resources, which are essential to evaluate the impacts of extreme climate events on the water cycle. The database comprised three key components: (1) a decade-long (2014−2023) event-based stable isotopes (δ2H, δ18O, and d-excess) in rainfall and non-rainfall waters at Gobabeb, (2) a two-month spatial isotope dataset (δ2H, δ18O, and d-excess) of fog collected from the central Namib Desert in 2016 and 2017, and (3) a six-decade (1963−2023) temporal data documenting monthly fog and rainfall amounts as well as annual Kuiseb River flooding events at Gobabeb. The detailed stable isotope data included 585 fog samples, 71 rainfall samples, 115 dew samples, and 13 groundwater samples over the past ten years (2014−2023) in the Namib Desert. Detailed descriptions of the study sites, sampling procedures, analytical methods, and data quality control are provided in this study. The uniqueness of our long-term dataset makes it an important resource for future studies investigating hydrological processes in drylands and their responses to climate change.

The data include water quality properties of lakes, rivers, coasts, as well as the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea. Moreover, the data include a novel estimate of organic carbon in diverse waters and results of a new optical water type classification. The dataset and algorithm behind offers many links to future oceanographic-limnological analysis. 
 Despite advances in remote sensing, consistent monitoring of water quality across freshwater-marine systems remains challenging due to methodological fragmentation. Here, we provide an overview of an exemplary dataset on water quality characteristics in inland waters, coasts, and the open sea estimated from optical satellite data. Specifically, this is Sentinel-3 OLCI data for the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea region for the period June to September 2023. The dataset includes daily aggregated observational data with a spatial resolution of approximately 300 m of reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere and for cloud-free water areas remote-sensing reflectance, inherent optical properties of the water, and an estimation of the concentrations of water constituents, e.g. related to the aquatic carbon content. These are the results of the novel A4O atmospheric correction and the ONNS water algorithm. The dataset serves as a prototype for understanding the processing chain and interdependencies, but also for developing a high degree of connectivity for answering various scientific questions; we do not perform an actual validation of the 73 individual parameters in the dataset. The aim is to show how fragmentation in water quality monitoring along the aquatic continuum from lakes, rivers to the sea can be overcome by applying an optical water type-specific and neural network-based processing scheme for Copernicus satellite data. Emphasis of this work is on analysing the optical complexity of remote-sensing reflectance in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, coastal, and inland waters. Results of a new optical water type classification show that almost all (99.7 %) remote-sensing reflectances delivered by A4O are classifiable and that the region exhibits the full range of optical water diversity. The dataset can serve as a blueprint for a holistic view of the aquatic environment and is a step towards an observation-based digital twin component of the complex system."

We used detailed models and found that forecasts at Baring Head improved significantly due to its narrow geography, but changes at Banks Peninsula were minimal. The study demonstrates that local conditions greatly influence the effectiveness of wave prediction models, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in coastal forecasting to enhance accuracy in the predictions. 
 This study evaluates the effects of downscaling, source terms, and tidal interactions on numerical wave forecasts in Aotearoa New Zealand. We utilised a set of three nested domains (from global to regional scale) to examine significant wave height (Hs), first-order mean period (Tm01), and peak wave direction at two coastal locations, Banks Peninsula and Baring Head. Downscaling markedly improved forecast accuracy at Baring Head, a tidally constricted region, reducing Hs forecast error by 28 %. However, improvements at Banks Peninsula were minimal, likely due to its open-coast characteristics, which are adequately represented even by lower-resolution models. This variability was also evident in the Tm01 predictions, with notable improvements in bias reduction through model downscaling, particularly at Baring Head. Using default source term 6 (ST6) parameters generally improved Hs predictions on the west coast but worsened them on the east, indicating a geographical dependency in model performance. Tidal forcing had a small impact on the overall forecast skill, and its impact was mostly noticed at Baring Head, where tides force large variability. However, the tidally driven wave model showed smaller 12 h variability compared to observations. The study underscores the importance of tailored modelling approaches that consider local geographical and hydrodynamic conditions to optimise wave forecasting."

 We developed a strongly coupled aerosol–meteorology four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) assimilation system, CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var, for investigating the feedback of aerosol data assimilation on meteorological forecasts. This system was developed on the basis of the framework of the incremental analysis scheme of the China Meteorological Administration Global Forecasting System (CMA-GFS). CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var includes three component models: forward, tangent linear, and adjoint models. The CMA-GFS-AERO forward model was constructed by integrating an aerosol module containing the main physical processes of black carbon (BC) aerosol in the atmosphere into the CMA-GFS weather model. The tangent linear model and the adjoint model of the aerosol module were further developed and coupled online with the CMA-GFS tangent linear and adjoint models, respectively. In CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var, the BC mass concentration was used as the control variable and minimized together with atmospheric variables. The validation of this system includes the tangent linear approximation, the adjoint correctness test, the single-observation experiment, and the full-observation experiment. The results show that the CMA-GFS-AERO tangent linear model performs well in terms of tangent linear approximation for BC and that adjoint sensitivity agrees well with tangent linear sensitivity. Assimilating BC observations can generate analysis increments not only for BC but also for atmospheric variables, highlighting the capability of CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var in exploring the feedback of BC assimilation on atmospheric variables. The computational performance of CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var also indicates its potential in operational application.

We observed that RCHI distributes unevenly in time and space. In time scale, the transition follows a “fast-then-slow” trajectory in terms of stranded assets, leading to higher socioeconomic and political efforts at the beginning of the process. Spatially, certain provinces face heightened risks related to stranded assets, unemployment, and energy security, underscoring the urgent need for power system reforms and equitable carbon quota allocations for a just transition.

However, the key effects of oxygen species at iron (oxyhydr)oxide defect sites on SOM molecular activation and transformation under an anoxic environment (e.g., paddy overlying water) are poorly understood. This study investigates molecular-level interfacial interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from rice straw at different stages of decomposition and ferrihydrite (Fh) under anoxic conditions. More decomposed DOM exhibited a 12.75% higher SUVA254 removal rate under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions, a process involving both adsorption and oxidation. This enhanced removal was attributed to vacancy defects on Fh, which activated persistent free radicals in the highly decomposed DOM, increasing electron transfer and triggering chain reactions involving carbon-centered radicals and hydroxyl radicals. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis of the molecular transformation pathways mediated by free radicals revealed that macromolecular polymer formation on the Fh surface was induced by the transformation between phenols and quinones including aryloxyl coupling and Schiff base formation. These findings highlight the importance of mineral defects in modulating redox-active organic matter evolved during decomposition under anoxic and oxic conditions, providing molecular-level evidence for Fh-induced free-radical reactions that aggregate DOM.

Our findings present a reliable, standard-free methodology for identifying previously uncharacterized organic peroxides in SOA at the molecular level, offering new avenues for investigating formation pathways and health impacts of this large, diverse, yet rarely explored compound class. Additionally, we propose peroxide-iodide reactivity as a novel metric for future predictions of oxidative potential─a key indicator of toxicity─and for elucidating the structure of individual organic peroxides in SOA."

Historically this calculation is based on the difference in thermal efficiency between the traditional and new device measured in the laboratory. However, efficiency varies with technological and operational factors that can be accurately accounted for only by field-based measurements. In this research, an uncontrolled cooking efficiency test (UCET) was developed and implemented to measure baseline efficiency and fuel consumption during meal preparation for a planned total of 360 charcoal stove tests and 360 wood stove tests. Results show average thermal efficiencies of 11.8 ± 5.3% for traditional wood and 22.1 ± 9.8% for traditional charcoal cookstoves, demonstrating good agreement with the previous and current UNFCCC baseline values of 10% and 15% for wood and 20% and 25% for charcoal. Single meal fuel use was extrapolated to 0.17 ± 0.07 tonnes/capita/year of wood and 0.04 ± 0.02 tonnes/capita/year of charcoal, conservative compared to the UNFCCC global default of 0.4 tonnes of wood/capita/year. Multiple regression analysis indicated a strong statistical association of efficiency with firepower, pot/pan dimensions, and the cooking method. Results demonstrate the utility of the UCET for evaluating cookstove efficiency and fuel consumption in households to more accurately support the determination of emissions reductions."

Cultivating PFOS low-accumulation variety (LAV) crops, such as lettuce, can mitigate such risks. However, the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of PFOS in LAV remain elusive. We conducted hydroponic experiments to investigate how the root system and transpiration affect PFOS bioaccumulation in LAV in comparison with the high-accumulation variety (HAV). Additionally, two detoxification efflux carrier genes LsDTX18 and LsDTX42 were expressed in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to elucidate their functions in PFOS transport. The results showed that weaker root morphological characteristics restricted PFOS uptake in LAV, compared to HAV. Meanwhile, lower symplastic and apoplastic radial transfer efficiency and weaker transpiration driving force cocaused less PFOS xylem loading and root-to-shoot transport in LAV than in HAV. The young leaves with stronger transpiration accumulated more PFOS. LsDTX18 and LsDTX42, localized in the plasma membrane, regulated the xylem-to-phloem transport of PFOS in the root collar; their overexpression facilitated PFOS efflux from root xylem parenchyma cells, thus leading to less PFOS loading in xylem and subsequent root-to-shoot transport. These findings provide insights into PFOS accumulation with novel mechanisms by which LsDTXs modulate PFOS efflux in plants, laying the foundation for engineering crops with less PFOS accumulation."

This method uses limited known tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) compounds as seeds, enabling the large-scale screening of suspected pollutants without extensive MS/MS databases. The feasibility of the proposed method was validated using 319 and 172 pesticides in positive and negative electrospray ion modes, respectively, achieving annotation rates exceeding 92.81% and accuracy rates surpassing 83.56%. Notably, varying the number of seed compounds maintained an annotation accuracy above 80.16%. Applying this method to the influent and effluent samples from an urban wastewater treatment plant, 1583 compounds were annotated, with 232 transformation products being uniquely found in the effluent. Furthermore, the hazard prioritization of the effluent pollutants of 74 compounds poses a higher priority.

With a typical semiconductor fabrication plant (fab) consuming over 10,000 m3 of ultrapure water (UPW) daily, the environmental footprint is substantial. Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is the primary driver of this impact, accounting for approximately 30–40% of the total wastewater volume and consuming one-third of the UPW used by the fab. This process relies heavily on consumables such as slurries, pads, conditioners, and cleaning solutions, resulting in substantial wastewater generation, energy, and resource consumption. CMP is extremely demanding of resources, consuming large amounts of ultrapure water, and it also generates substantial wastewater and greenhouse gas emissions. In this review, we explore both established strategies and emerging trends for mitigating the environmental impacts of CMP through sustainable practices. It discusses the development of biodegradable slurries, recyclable abrasives, specialized pads, and advanced water treatment technologies. Emphasizing the role of green chemistry principles, life cycle assessment frameworks, and process optimization, this study highlights efforts to minimize the environmental footprint of semiconductor manufacturing. Despite recent progress, gaps remain, particularly in the development of sustainable CMP pads, biodegradability of slurry components, and effective wastewater management.

This response is primarily driven by a sustained weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation due to increased surface buoyancy and sea‐ice extent.

This rainfall event was strongly influenced by an upstream boundary layer jet (BLJ) over the northern South China Sea (NSCS). Using a 21‐member WRF ensemble initialized with Global Ensemble Forecast System data, the best‐performing member was selected as the nature run. Simulated wind profiles over the NSCS from the nature run were assimilated into the worst‐performing member at the initial time step, improving the representation of the BLJ structure and strength. The data assimilation experiments reveal a significant sensitivity of simulated rainfall intensity and spatial distribution to both the number and location of assimilated wind profile observations. A strengthened marine BLJ with a more southerly wind component extending toward the coast enhanced low‐level convergence, upward motion, and moisture transport at its terminus, thus creating a more favorable environment for convection. However, momentum budget analysis indicates that, despite wind profile assimilation, the nearshore BLJ remained too weak to sustain upscale convective growth following convective initiation."

 Plastic debris has recently been identified as a hotspot for abiotic metal transformations, triggered primarily by photo-weathering under sunlight. Here we perform a set of experiments with freshwater in the field and laboratory to explore metal transformations under dark conditions. We demonstrate that light-independent weathering of plastics leads to methylation of inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) in waterbodies. We propose that methylation occurs via an abiotic pathway involving three chain reaction steps, namely the release of plastic-derived dissolved organic matter (P-DOM), complexation of P-DOM with Hg(II) and intramolecular transfer of methyl groups. P-DOM is released during the light-independent oxidation of plastics via reactive oxygen species. Density functional theory simulations confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of the intramolecular transfer of methyl groups to Hg(II), upon its complexation with oxygen-containing groups in P-DOM. Model estimates demonstrate that polypropylene in freshwater produces methylmercury via this abiotic pathway with Hg(II) methylation potentials from 2.8 × 10−5% per day to 5.5 × 10−2% per day in China and 4.0 × 10−6% per day to 7.5 × 10−3% per day in other regions of the world. Plastic debris is therefore a hidden driver of abiotic methylmercury formation in dark waters. Our study uncovers a pathway through which the ongoing plastic pollution alters mercury cycling, posing a burgeoning threat to planetary health. Abiotic methylation triggered by plastic debris can occur independently of light conditions and therefore drive methylmercury formation in dark waters, according to an experimental study combined with density functional theory calculations."

Here, the authors find a mechanism for how the pupillary light reflex drives monocular and binocular retinal activity in mice and shapes conscious visual perception in humans. 
 Retinal adaptation is assisted by the pupil, with pupil contraction and dilation thought to prevent global light changes from triggering neuronal activity in the retina. However, we find that pupillary constriction from increased light, the pupillary light reflex (PLR), can drive strong responses in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vivo in mice. The PLR drives neural activity in all RGC types, and pupil-driven activity is relayed to the visual cortex. Furthermore, the consensual PLR allows one eye to respond to luminance changes presented to the other eye, leading to a binocular response and modulation during low-amplitude luminance changes. To test if pupil-induced activity is consciously perceived, we performed psychophysics on human volunteers, finding a perceptual dimming consistent with PLR-induced responses in mice. Our findings thus uncover that pupillary dynamics can directly induce visual activity that is consciously detectable, suggesting an active role for the pupil in encoding perceived ambient luminance. The pupil is known to assist retinal adaptation to light level changes. Here, the authors find a mechanism for how the pupillary light reflex drives monocular and binocular retinal activity in mice and shapes conscious visual perception in humans."

Here, the authors identify that loss of locus coeruleus axons in the olfactory bulb underlies impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model and provide translational evidence for similar deficits in humans. 
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often begins with non-cognitive symptoms such as olfactory deficits, which can predict later cognitive decline, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Pathologically, the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin (NA) modulating olfactory information processing is affected early. Here we show early and distinct loss of noradrenergic input to the olfactory bulb (OB) coinciding with impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model, before appearance of amyloid plaques. Mechanistically, OB microglia recognize and phagocytose LC axons. Reducing phagocytosis genetically preserves LC axons and olfaction. Prodromal AD patients display elevated TSPO-PET signals in the OB, similarly to AppNL-G-F mice. We further confirm early LC axon degeneration in post-mortem OBs in patients with early AD. Our findings reveal a mechanism linking early LC damage to hyposmia in AD, suggesting olfactory testing and neurocircuit imaging for early diagnosis and enable timely therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.

 Phosphatidylserine externalization on the surface of dying cells is a key signal for their recognition and clearance by macrophages and is mediated by members of the X-Kell related (Xkr) protein family. Defective Xkr-mediated scrambling impairs clearance, leading to inflammation. It was proposed that activation of the Xkr4 apoptotic scramblase requires caspase cleavage, followed by dimerization and ligand binding. Here, using a combination of biochemical approaches we show that purified monomeric, full-length human Xkr4 (hXkr4) scrambles lipids. CryoEM imaging shows that hXkr4 adopts a novel conformation, where three conserved acidic residues create a negative electrostatic surface embedded in the membrane. Molecular dynamics simulations show this conformation induces membrane thinning, which could promote scrambling. Thinning is ablated or reduced in conditions where scrambling is abolished or reduced. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of hXkr4 scrambling and suggests the ability to thin membranes might be a general property of active scramblases.

 Type II polyketides (T2PKs) exhibit a wide range of structural diversity and potent pharmacological activities. However, the optimal chassis for the synthesis of T2PKs remains elusive, impeding the effective mining and production of these compounds. In this study, we identify Streptomyces aureofaciens J1-022, a high-yield producer of chlortetracycline, as a promising chassis for T2PKs synthesis. To mitigate precursor competition, we execute an in-frame deletion of two endogenous T2PKs gene clusters, resulting in a pigmented-faded host, designated Chassis2.0. Compared to conventional Streptomyces chassis, Chassis2.0 demonstrates enhanced efficiency in the production of oxytetracycline, achieving a 370% increase relative to commercial production strains. Additionally, the tri-ring type T2PKs, which includes actinorhodin and flavokermesic acid, are synthesized in Chassis2.0 with high efficiency. Furthermore, an unidentified biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) associated with pentangular T2PKs is directly activated, leading to the production of a structurally distinct TLN-1. In conclusion, we successfully achieve the efficient synthesis of tri-ring type pigmented products, the overproduction of tetra-ring antibiotics, and the discovery of penta-ring type polyketides in Chassis2.0.

 Wheat tillering is an important agronomic trait influencing grain yield. Here, we identify an NHL repeat-containing protein, TaNHLP1, which positively regulates tiller number in wheat. We discovered that the core components of the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway, type 2C protein phosphatase TaPP2C and SNF1-related protein kinase TaSnRK2, interact with TaNHLP1 to regulate its abundance. Furthermore, TaNHLP1 interacts with the Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (TaRACK1A), an ABA pathway negative regulator, and influences its subcellular localization. Importantly, both the TaNHLP1 and TaRACK1A mutations promote ABA accumulation in the shoot bases and tiller buds. Notably, the NHLP1-RACK1 module is conserved across monocots and eudicots, and natural variations in the promoter of TaNHLP1-A enhance its transcriptional activity, leading to increased tiller number and yield. Collectively, these findings elucidate the genetic mechanism of NHLP1-mediated tillering regulation and highlight its potential as a target for improving crop plant architecture.

 Multi-year marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) are major climate events with lasting ecological and economic effects. Though often seen as local Pacific phenomena, our study shows their persistence depends on trans-basin interactions between the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Using observational data and climate model experiments, we find that prolonged MHWs occur as sequential warming episodes triggered by atmospheric wave trains crossing ocean basins. These wave trains alter surface heat flux, initiating MHWs in the GOA and changing North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs). In turn, Atlantic SST anomalies reinforce wave activity, fueling subsequent MHW episodes in a feedback loop. This mechanism appears in historical events (1949–52, 1962–65, 2013–16, and 2018–22), highlighting MHWs as a trans-basin phenomenon.

 Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a scalable strategy for atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. The microbiome function critically regulates the below-ground cycle of carbon and nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. However, microbial functioning related to carbon and nitrogen under ERW remains elusive. Here we investigated how wollastonite addition affects key microbial carbon and nitrogen-cycles genes investigated using metagenomic, in a tropic rubber plantation. After two-year, ERW had enhanced the alpha diversity of biogeochemical cycling genes was mainly driven by increased soil pH. ERW led to an increase in the relative abundance of carbon-fixation genes, and a decrease in the carbon-degradation genes, providing microbiological evidence for carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling functional genes, and available iron increased after wollastonite addition, indicating ERW may influence nitrous oxide emissions through biological and chemical processes.

Putative MTB exhibited high relative abundance (up to 15.4% of metagenomic reads), with Deltaproteobacteria identified as the most ubiquitous and predominant group. Vertical distribution profile revealed that magnetotactic Deltaproteobacteria primarily inhabit low-oxygen niches, suggesting their magnetofossils might serve as a potential proxy for oxygen depletion. Our findings underscore the important ecological roles of putative MTB as key components of oxygen-stratified freshwater ecosystems of northern landscapes. Putative magnetotactic bacteria primarily inhabiting low-oxygen niches and their magnetofossils can serve as a potential proxy for oxygen depletion in freshwater ecosystems in northern landscapes, according to a metagenomic survey of 38 oxygen-stratified freshwater environments of that area."

 The Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer (MRVA) is vital to U.S. food security and global agricultural supply. However, quantitative understanding of its Quaternary origin, architecture, and hydrologic function remains incomplete. Here we develop a three-dimensional hydrostratigraphic model to characterize the deposition of clay and silt, fine-medium sands, and graveliferous sands using lithologic data from 75,000 boreholes compiled across the Lower Mississippi Valley and a geostatistical method—interval kriging. We find that cyclic glacial entrenchments, evidenced by remnants of pre-Wisconsinan postglacial sediments, alongside geodynamic activities shaped the MRVA basal configuration. Stratal weakening from faulting and salt diapirism enhanced glacial incision and thereby produced abrupt aquifer thickening. We demarcate the top of graveliferous sands as the regional marker of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The MRVA hydrostratigraphy reveals hydrologic function and geologic controls on groundwater storage and quality, advancing the assessment of aquifer sustainability under a changing climate, with implications for alluvial aquifers globally.

Philip Robertson,Contributions of vegetation heterogeneity within tower footprint to CO<sub>2</sub> flux estimations through graph neural network modeling,"•Incorporating footprint-weighted spatial data notably improves simulation accuracy. •DeeperGCN performed well in correcting residual errors of random forest and XGBoost. •The optimal spatial resolution of DeeperGCN model for flux simulation is 20 m. •LAI and incoming shortwave radiation are the top two drivers for predicting flux. 
 Net ecosystem exchange of CO₂ (Fc) measured directly by eddy covariance towers is based on various assumptions, including large, flat and homogenous land cover type. In reality, often a tower site is not large enough for flux measurements, and landscapes consist of patches of different land cover types within the flux footprint. In addition, some portions of fluxes are contributed by different cover types when a footprint exceeds the size of the target ecosystem. The contributions of non-dominant patches to Fc are often ignored. In this study, we propose a novel integrated modeling framework that combines random forest (RF) and XGBoost with a residual correction module based on a deep graph convolutional network (DeeperGCN) to simulate Fc for seven flux measurement sites in southwest Michigan. High-resolution remote sensing vegetation indices, soil properties, meteorological variables, and footprint-weighted spatial features were used as model inputs at three spatial resolutions (10 m, 20 m, 30 m), and their importance in predicting Fc with DeeperGCN was assessed. We found that residual correction using DeeperGCN significantly improved prediction accuracy, with the R2 increasing from 0.9098 to 0.9479 for RF and from 0.9235 to 0.9433 for XGBoost. At site level, the maximum improvement in R2 reached 0.1617. Paired t-tests confirmed that these improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Among all predictors, leaf area index and incoming shortwave radiation emerged as the dominant drivers of spatial residual variation, followed by precipitation, relative humidity, and selected vegetation indices. The 20 m resolution yielded the best balance between model performance and computational efficiency. Our modeling framework effectively captures both spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear interactions, offering a robust solution for spatially explicit flux modeling in structurally diverse ecosystems beyond the study sites."

 Mapping the canopy height of large-scale forests is important for understanding global carbon cycles, biodiversity, and ecosystem functions. The new generation spaceborne lidar instrument, NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), employs waveform data to provide dense global observations of vegetation structure. The GEDI Level 2 A (L2A) product directly provides relative height (RH) metrics within 25 m-diameter footprints, significantly enhancing the feasibility of global-scale canopy height mapping. Wall-to-wall canopy height mapping can be conducted efficiently by combining GEDI L2A data with optical satellite imagery. With the rapid growth of global-scale canopy height maps based on GEDI in recent years, a comprehensive validation is urgent for users and future producers. This study provides a detailed validation of the GEDI L2A canopy height product, as well as three global canopy height maps derived based on GEDI L2A data with different optical imagery (Landsat-based global forest canopy height map, Sentinel-based high-resolution canopy height model of the Earth, and Maxar-based global map of tree canopy height). We collected UAV lidar data from 321 km2 of forests in China around 2020 and obtained accurate canopy height (99th percentile height) and forest stand information for validation. The accuracy of the GEDI L2A product and three canopy height maps was evaluated, and we further analyzed the spatial consistency and saturation effects of these maps. The Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold method was used to analyze the relative importance of detailed forest stand factors, terrain factors, and GEDI attributes to the accuracy of each map. We simulated the canopy height mapping process and quantitatively evaluated the propagation of the error in the GEDI L2A canopy height product (errL2A), the error in the geolocation offset of GEDI footprints (errgeolocation), and the error from the upscaling process (errupscale). The results show that RH95 from GEDI L2A achieved the highest accuracy (MAE = 5.1 m) among main RH metrics. The number of detected modes is the most significant factor influencing the accuracy of the GEDI L2A product, with a relative importance of 47.2 %. The three canopy height maps exhibit notable accuracy differences across various canopy height levels, with the overall error of the Sentinel-based map being approximately 1 m smaller than that of the other two (MAE = 5.6 m). Forest stand height and heterogeneity are the primary impact factors of three canopy height maps, while the terrain slope also has a great impact on the Sentinel-based map. In the error propagation analysis, the contribution rates of errL2A and errgeolocation to the overall error were under 5.1 %, while the error from errupscale dominated with a contribution of 92.1 %. This study offers valuable insights by validating key global canopy height maps and simulating the mapping process, which will be an important reference for the utilization and creation of future global canopy height maps."

 Over the past 40 years, plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) has become a widely distributed and seasonally dynamic land use/land management type, driven by its significant contributions to improving crop yield and quality. However, expansion of PMF has far-reaching impacts on the climate, the environment, and rural livelihoods. In particular, the exposure duration of plastic mulching (EDPM) over the course of a year is a critical factor influencing climate change and the energy balance, underscoring the need for a novel approach to accurately characterize EDPM. However, accurately characterizing EDPM remains challenging and has yet to be implemented in practice. Therefore, this study proposes a spectral index-based approach to characterize EDPM at the object scale using Sentinel-2 imagery in the Hetao Irrigation District, China. First, an object-oriented machine learning approach was implemented to map the spatial distribution of PMF. This was achieved by optimizing both the scale parameter of image segmentation and input feature sets (including spectral, textural, geometric, and index features) extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, through iterative masking and stepwise optimization. Then, the time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), PMLI (Plastic-Mulched Landcover Index), and BSI (Bare Soil Index), along with their first and second derivatives, were analyzed to determine key timings, including the start day of plastic mulching, crop growing, and crop canopy closure. Finally, the EDPM, including Full exposure duration of plastic-mulching (FEDPM) and half exposure duration of plastic-mulching (HEDPM), was characterized based on these key timings. The result indicated that the object-oriented machine learning approach is highly effective in enhancing PMF detection and suppressing background information. The overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient were 91.5 % and 0.90. In addition, plastic-mulching primarily occurs in late April in the eastern part of the Hetao Irrigation District, and in late May in the western region. The crop growing takes place in early to late June, while the crop canopy closure mainly occurs in early August. Consequently, the EDPM lasts approximately 3 to 4 months, while the FEDPM and HEDPM last about 1 to 2 months. This research provides a valuable reference for characterizing EDPM at regional or global scales and can be used to assess the regional climate effects of PMF."

 Organic nitrates (ONs) are crucial constituents of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). The liquid-phase degradation of ONs alters the light-absorbing properties of aerosols, thereby influencing the direct radiative effect (DRE) and climate dynamics. Alkyl nitrates (ANs) contribute most of ONs. Previous studies have shown that hydrolysis and •OH-initiated oxidation are two competing degradation pathways for ANs, with oxidation being the dominant mechanism under weakly acidic or weakly alkaline conditions. However, experimental •OH concentrations (ppm) are ten orders of magnitude higher than actual, likely underestimating hydrolysis's contribution. Using propyl nitrate isomers as proxies, we combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantum calculations to re-explore AN's degradation at pH 1–8. Our results show that hydrolysis dominates at realistic •OH levels. Specifically, compared to previous experimental results, hydrolysis is underestimated by 80 % under pH 4–8, resulting in underrating AN's lifetime by 5 orders. Consequently, the resulting light-absorbing attenuation of aerosol will be disregarded, possibly leading to inaccurate DRE and climate effect assessments in oceanic/desert regions where aerosols at pH 4–8 predominates. Our research emphasizes the need to re-evaluate the role of hydrolysis in predicting the fate of ANs and the light-absorbing properties of aerosols."

 While winter has traditionally been the focus of air quality research in South Korea, early summer also experiences high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), largely driven by elevated ammonia (NH3) emissions from agricultural activities. The South Korean government decided to reduce agricultural-based NH3 emissions by 30 % in the Special Act on Fine Aerosol to reduce the levels of PM2.5 due to the significant contributions of NH3 to the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols. In this study, we utilized the CMAQ v5.2.1 model to simulate air quality over East Asia during the KORUS-AQ campaign (1 May – June 12, 2016) and evaluate the accuracy of the NH3 emission, their impacts on PM2.5, and the effectiveness of various emission control strategies, particularly in South Korea. The accuracy of NH3 emissions was evaluated by comparing model-predicted NH3 concentrations with the EANET and AMoN-China networks and with the MARGA equipment in Seoul. The comparison at 60 monitoring stations revealed negative mean biases in China (often exceeding 10 μg m−3), indicating a possible underestimation of NH3 emissions in the KORUSv5.0 inventory in most parts of China except for some overestimations in Henan and Sichuan provinces. On the other hand, biases were smaller in South Korea and Japan, ranging from −3.80 to 2.99 ppb (or −2.68 to 2.11 μg m−3 at the standard ambient temperature and pressure). We found from the sensitivity simulations by incrementally reducing NH3 emissions in South Korea from 0 % to 100 % that NH3 reductions lead to lower aerosol pH and decreased nitrate partitioning (e.g., from 1.31 to −0.54 and from 0.40 to 0.05 for SK, respectively). In addition, the South Korean government's reduction policy of NH3 emissions can improve the mean concentration of PM2.5 between 0.59 and 1.31 μg m−3 in South Korea. Chemical regime analysis concludes that South Korea exhibits NH3-rich conditions, where NOx plays a more dominant role in nitrate formation. Furthermore, the sensitivity simulations of the multi-pollutant reductions indicate that i) a 40 % of NH3 and SO2 & NOx, ii) a 60 % of NH3, or iii) a 60 % reduction of SO2 & NOx emissions are required to achieve a 10 % decrease in PM2.5 in South Korea."

 Reanalysis datasets are essential substitutes for direct observations and play a critical role in weather and climate research. However, the resolution of existing reanalysis over China is too coarse to capture mesoscale atmospheric phenomena and climatic extreme events. To address this limitation, a convection-permitting (CP; resolution ≤4 km) regional reanalysis product over China is necessary. To verify the feasibility of constructing a CP regional reanalysis, this study conducts a CP regional reanalysis experiment over China with the spectral nudging technique (SN). The results reveal that the application of SN can enhance the capability in the reproduction of spatiotemporal precipitation characteristics, regional precipitation features, and Meiyu period precipitation dynamics compared to classical dynamical downscaling. Diagnostic analysis reveals that SN aligns geopotential height at 500 hPa with ERA5 (daily spatial correlations >0.96) and weakens excessive vertically integrated moisture flux convergence in classical dynamical downscaling by >0.2 g/(m2 s), explaining the statistical gains. Furthermore, the CP regional reanalysis outperforms the global reanalysis ERA5 in reproducing regional precipitation and extreme precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. It also excels in representing the characteristics of mesoscale convective system and their associated diurnal cycles during the Meiyu period. These findings highlight the potential of SN in constructing high-resolution reanalysis datasets and underscore its value for developing a long-term CP regional reanalysis product over China."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) pose significant risks due to their associated hazards, including powerful winds, inland and coastal flooding, and wind waves. However, more reliable TC records are required to ensure a robust statistical analysis for risk assessment. To overcome this limitation, researchers have developed methods to generate synthetic tropical cyclones (STCs) that provide a larger sample size of occurrences at specific locations. This study compares STC databases from different sources such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Columbia HAZard model (CHAZ), Synthetic Tropical cyclOne geneRation Model (STORM), and Deltares with historical TCs from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) on a basin-wide scale in the North Atlantic Basin. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of STCs in replicating crucial historical tropical cyclones parameters for risk analysis and to identify potential biases in the STC generation models. The comparison uses a hexagonal mesh to evaluate characteristics such as maximum winds, translation speed, and residence time. The study acknowledges the validation paradox arising from the limited IBTrACS data at specific locations that make it difficult to rigorously validate the accuracy of STCs in those areas and from systematic differences across the STC datasets. Despite the historical TCs database limitation, comparing STC with IBTrACS characteristics remains the only viable method for assessing biases in STC generation models. The evaluated STCs reveal spatial bias patterns, which may indicate deficiencies in the underlying hazard models. Identifying and describing these biases aim to guide the use of these events and highlight key aspects for further development in STC generation methods."

 The agricultural industry in Southeast Asia (SEA) is seriously threatened by weather and climate extremes, of which compound drought–heatwave (CDHW) events are especially detrimental. Using Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model ensembles, we investigated the projected changes in CDHWs and rice yield in SEA, and further examined the potential driving factors behind the impacts of CDHWs on yield. Results indicate a projected 550 % increase in the annual occurrence of CDHWs, which correlates significantly with a 27 % decrease in rice yield under the SSP5–8.5 scenario at the end of the 21st century. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) emerges as a major factor contributing to the reduction in rice yield during CDHW events, with its impact for the southern Indochina Peninsula (SICP) being significantly greater than that of evapotranspiration, and slightly higher for Sumatra. Higher temperatures and lower atmospheric vapor during a CDHW leads to water loss from rice plants, ultimately affecting crop growth and reducing yield. To protect local food security from the adverse effects of CDHWs, it is crucial to implement comprehensive measures to mitigate against heat stress and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at both regional and global levels."

 The position of the Hadley circulation edge (HCE) determines subtropical arid regions' locations, and its variations have attracted considerable attention. This research examines the effects of the preceding winter ENSO on the boreal spring northern HCE (NHCE) by influencing the spring tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) sea surface temperature (SST). The results of six reanalysis datasets show that El Niño and La Niña events have asymmetrical influences on the NHCE, as El Niño events are significantly associated with the equatorward shift of the NHCE. Specifically, when El Niño events occur in the preceding winter, the TIO SST warms in spring, with anomalous eddy momentum flux divergence (EMFD) gradients in the upper troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere, which cause the convergence center to shift equatorward. Additionally, the TIO warming increases subtropical temperatures, reducing the meridional temperature gradient (MTG) between the subtropics and tropics, and increasing the vertical wind shear and static stability, thereby enhancing baroclinic instability criterion (BIC) in the subtropical region and causing the NHCE to shift equatorward. However, when a La Niña event occurs in the preceding winter, the TIO SST cools during spring, but its weak impact on the EMFD, MTG and BIC contributes little to NHCE changes. Furthermore, by using ridge regression to compare the relative importance of the three relevant factors, it is found that variations in MTG and BIC dominate shifts in the NHCE latitude, while EMFD contributes less. This research enhances the understanding of the mechanisms driving HC changes during boreal spring and the atmospheric dynamics linked to these changes."

 This study proposes a new approach to mitigating the damaging impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs) based on the use of targeted microphysical interventions that can modify TC activity. Using high-resolution simulations generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we demonstrate that the artificial addition of supercooled water (SCW) into sensitivity areas (SAs; 200–500 km from the TC center) can effectively modulate both TC motion and TC intensity. Our results show: (1) systematic track deflection towards the SCW-enriched regions caused by the redistribution of potential vorticity (PV); (2) a dual intensity-suppression process that combines upper-level TC outflow suppression with low-level energy decrease in the TC inflow; and (3) TC expansion driven by an enhanced surface enthalpy flux. The mechanisms that control these responses to SCW intervention are also discussed. Initially, middle to upper tropospheric warming caused by SCW freezing enhances the divergent winds aloft, thereby inhibiting TC outflow. Subsequently, middle to lower tropospheric cooling via hydrometeor melting and evaporation generates cold and dry downdrafts and TC inflow. Ultimately, middle tropospheric PV advection drives TC track modification via a compensating flow. The results provide new insights into the development of weather modification strategies aimed at mitigating the damaging impact of future TCs."

Many studies suggest that the retina can detect whether a visual image is focused in front of or behind the back of the eye and modulate eye growth to bring it back to focus. How can the retina distinguish between these two types of defocus? Here, we simulated how eye optics transforms natural images and recorded how the isolated retina responds to different types of simulated defocus. We found that some ganglion cell types could distinguish between an image focused in front of or behind the retina by estimating spatial contrast. Aberrations in the eye optics made spatial contrast, but not luminance, a reliable cue to distinguish these two types of defocus.

We find that the amino terminus of TAM is necessary and sufficient for the localization of proteins to meiotic SGs. Swapping the amino terminus of TAM with the one of its sister protein CYCA1;1 resulted in a separation-of-function allele ofTAM, which prevents the partitioning of TAM to SGs while restoring a wild-type phenotype in atammutant background under nonheat stress conditions.

We find that mvRNAs can cause noncanonical transcription termination through a truncated 5′ polyadenylation signal or a 5′ transient RNA structure that interrupts polyadenylation.

However, their specific role during this process remains elusive. Here, we report that interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and IL-1β are released by islet-resident macrophages, resulting in the suppression of insulin secretion. This may be due to a decreased inflammation-driven expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) and MafA in β cells. Islet-resident macrophages release significantly less IL-1α when compared to IL-1β. However, both cytokines inhibit insulin expression and secretion to a comparable extent. We identified heparan sulfate on the islet surface, which acts as a “molecular glue” potentiating the inhibitory action of IL-1α on insulin expression via specific binding to IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). In vivo analyses revealed that the loss of IL-1 signaling in isolated islets accelerates their revascularization and, thus, enhances their endocrine function. These findings indicate that heparan sulfate fine-tuned IL-1 signaling crucially determines the outcome of islet transplantation."

Here, we reported that hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) was highly expressed in gallbladder cancer stem cells (CSCs) and patients with gemcitabine-resistant GBC. Mechanistic study revealed that interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and transcription factor EB (TFEB) are direct target genes of HLF. The IL-6/IL-6R/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 axis transactivates HLF expression in GBC, forming a positive feedback loop. Functional studies revealed that HLF promoted gallbladder CSCs’ expansion and gemcitabine resistance via TFEB-induced autophagy. In addition, HLF drives TFEB-induced programmed death ligand 1 expression in human tumors and governs tumor immune evasion in a CD8+T cell–dependent manner. Patient cohorts’ analysis suggested that HLF levels in GBCs might determine the distinct responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that HLF could act as a driver for gallbladder CSCs’ self-renewal and drug resistance and a biomarker for individualized therapy."

Herein, we discover that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is down-regulated in patients with lung cancer who do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Our findings indicate that S1P gradient enhances the migration and viability of immune cells and promotes the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype primarily through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–activated nuclear factor κB and Janus kinase–signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathways. To capitalize on these findings, we used a biodegradable sodium alginate hydrogel as a delivery system for the sustained and sequential release of S1P and anti–PD-L1 (αPDL1). In vivo studies demonstrated that S1P-αPDL1@Gel effectively inhibited tumor growth and reduced the recurrence of local tumors after surgery. Additionally, the hydrogel significantly enhanced the infiltration of dendritic cells, M1 macrophages, CD4+T cells, and CD8+T cells. S1P-αPDL1@Gel holds a promising therapeutic strategy for remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment."

Here, we describe a multiscale mathematical model-informed reinforcement learning (M4RL) framework to simulate dynamic tumor-microenvironment interactions and optimize drug combination scheduling. We first develop a multiscale agent-based model (MSABM) for a critical biological scenario where interactions between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells (TCs) underlie immunotherapy resistance in glioblastoma. Next, we learn a surrogate model based on Fokker-Planck equations for the MSABM using a physics-informed neural network approach. We then design a surrogate model–based reinforcement learning method, using an efficient parallel actor-critic algorithm, to predict optimal scheduling of combination treatments. The most effective regimen of dynamic combination of CSF1R inhibitor (targeting TAMs) and IGF1R inhibitor (targeting TCs) is identified and then verified using spatial transcriptomic data. Overall, the M4RL framework introduces a computational approach for characterizing tumor-microenvironment interactions and optimizing dynamic scheduling of drug combinations."

However, our understanding of why invaders establish in some communities but not others (i.e., occurrence probability) and why some communities harbor more invaders than others (i.e., invasion richness) remains limited. Here, we combine species- and community-level analyses across taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions to investigate both the occurrence probability and invasion richness of exotic and translocated fish species across nearly 3000 North American freshwater fish communities. We found that ecological similarity between non-native and native species primarily governed non-native fish establishment, with invaders more likely to succeed when closely related to native species. In contrast, invasion richness was largely promoted by human pressure, while native diversity reduced richness specifically for translocated species. Additionally, both the occurrence and richness of invaders increased toward lower latitudes. Together, these findings highlight the distinct yet complementary roles of environmental filtering, human activities, and biotic interactions in shaping freshwater fish invasions."

In 2017, the Eagle Creek Fire burned 200 km2of the CRG, prompting concerns of heightened debris flow activity, yet its impact on hazard potential remains unclear. To assess the fire's effect on 10 CRG catchments, we quantify pre- and postfire debris flow erosion using airborne lidar, imagery, and field observations, as well as long-term (104- to 106-year) erosion from debris fans and volcanic edifice reconstruction. Fan-derived 104-year erosion rates (1 to 9 mm year−1) exceed 106-year rates by 10 to 50 times, suggesting sustained, rapid unraveling of these catchments following the megafloods. Pre- and postfire debris flow erosion rates are consistent with 104-year rates, such that fire-derived erosion accounts for a relatively small fraction of post-megaflood denudation (<10%), implying persistent landscape disequilibrium that manifests as ongoing high hazard potential in the CRG, regardless of wildfire conditions."

We have recently shown that circulating innate lymphoid cells 1 (cILC1s) have the potential to generate such KIR+NKG2A−NK cells, but their developmental origin was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the development of cILC1 is thymus dependent and identify a putative progenitor of cILC1s in the thymus (thyILC1). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed a close relationship of thyILC1s to CD34+double-negative thymocytes. Both generated comparable NK cell frequencies, while only thyILC1s could be efficiently differentiated into KIR+NKG2A−NK cells. Last, patients withFOXN1haploinsufficiency, showing congenital thymic hypoplasia, exhibited a profound deficiency of cILC1s but not cILC2s and cILC3s, demonstrating their specific thymus dependency. Together, the data suggest that thyILC1s are the source of a thymus-dependent NK cell differentiation pathway that promotes generation of KIR+NKG2A−NK cells."

To assess the impact of these inapparent infections, we measured flight performance as a proxy for honey bee health. We hypothesized that deformed wing virus (DWV) and/or sacbrood virus (SBV) would reduce flight performance and that coinfections would have compounding, negative impacts. We identified virus-specific effects; bees with DWV flew shorter distances at slower speeds, whereas bees with SBV flew greater distances at higher speeds. Bees with high virus loads expressed moreheat shock protein 90, and SBV-infected bees expressed moreoctopamineβ-2 receptor(Oβ-2R).Oβ-2Rbinds octopamine, a “fight or flight” molecule, stimulating metabolic activity, neuromuscular transmission, and movement. To examine relationships between virus infection, octopamine, and flight, we compared the flight performance of DWV-infected bees with octopamine treatment and demonstrated that octopamine negated DWV-associated flight impairment.

However, soft logic gates for macroscopic soft robots usually operate at low frequencies (<5 hertz). Here, we present high-frequency soft logic gates based on soft electric switches with ultralow latency (2 milliseconds). Fast switching is achieved using a tailored piezoresistive material—graphite frameworks (GFs)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). The GFs/PDMS strip exhibits a large resistance change within ~0.01% strain, allowing soft logic gates to operate up to 100 hertz. A soft oscillator is further developed using feedback control with a soft NOT gate and achieves autonomous deformation across ~1 to 78 hertz, demonstrating actuation, sensing, and feedback control capabilities. Compared to other soft electrical switches, this scheme also features a compact size (5 cubic centimeter) and low power consumption (0.4 milliwatts).

Theoretically, a periodic drive can make the system inherit the time period and generate new harmonics or distort the band structure at the fundamental frequency. Here, by combining such a technique with levitated optomechanics, we present an instructive example of a coherent acoustic frequency comb with microsphere phonon lasers. This work shows that our technique offers the capability of flexibly controlling both the teeth number and the teeth spacing of the resulting coherent acoustic frequency comb. In particular, we confirm that all Floquet-driven comb teeth can reach the truly coherent regime, i.e., satisfying all the characteristic features of phonon lasers.

Coarse-grained simulations have predicted an additional mechanism exists involving off-pathway, noncovalent lasso entanglements, which are long-lived kinetic traps and structurally resemble the native state. Here, we examine whether such misfolded states occur in long-timescale, all-atom folding simulations of ubiquitin and λ-repressor. We find that these entangled misfolded states are populated in higher-resolution models. However, because of the small size of ubiquitin and λ-repressor, these states are short-lived. In contrast, coarse-grained simulations of a larger protein, IspE, predict that it populates long-lived misfolded states. Using an Arrhenius extrapolation applied to all-atom simulations, we estimate that these IspE misfolded states have lifetimes similar to the native state while remaining soluble. We further show that these misfolded states are consistent with the structural changes inferred from limited proteolysis and cross-linking mass spectrometry experiments. Our results indicate that misfolded states composed of non-native entanglements can persist for long timescales in both all-atom simulations and experiments."
