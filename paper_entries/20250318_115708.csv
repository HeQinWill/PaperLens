10.5194/acp-25-3253-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了中国山区雾的微物理特性及其与能见度的关系。论文通过对气溶胶粒子和雾滴的同步测量，研究了雾滴大小分布的演变过程，并发现雾前气溶胶的浓度和大小分布对雾的微物理特性有显著影响。此外，雾中残留粒子的消光作用在轻雾能见度下降中起着重要作用，尤其是在污染地区。研究结果强调了在雾能见度预测中，需要同时考虑雾滴和气溶胶的消光作用，这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关，特别是关于气溶胶对能见度的影响。,"['fog microphysics', 'visibility', 'aerosol-fog interaction', 'droplet size distribution', 'atmospheric composition (aerosols)', 'air quality (visibility degradation)']",Quan Liu;Xiaojing Shen;Junying Sun;Yangmei Zhang;Bing Qi;Qianli Ma;Lujie Han;Honghui Xu;Xinyao Hu;Jiayuan Lu;Shuo Liu;Aoyuan Yu;Linlin Liang;Qian Gao;Hong Wang;Huizheng Che;Xiaoye Zhang,Characterization of fog microphysics and their relationships with visibility at a mountain site in China,"Through simultaneous measurements of aerosol particles and fog droplets, the evolution of droplets size distribution during the eight observed fog events was investigated. The results showed that the concentration and size distribution of pre-fog aerosol had significant impacts on fog microphysical characteristics. The extinction of fog interstitial particles played an important role in visibility degradation for light fogs, especially in polluted regions. 
 Enhancing the understanding of fog microphysical processes is essential for reducing uncertainty in fog forecasts, particularly in predicting fog visibility and duration. To investigate the complex interactions between aerosols and fog microphysics and their impacts on visibility degradation, simultaneous measurements of aerosol and fog microphysical characteristics were conducted from April to May 2023 at a mountain site (1483 m a.s.l.) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, China. In this study, eight fog events were investigated during the campaign, revealing significantly higher fog droplet number concentrations (Nd) compared to those observed in clean areas. A strong correlation was found between pre-fog aerosol number concentration (Na) and the peak Nd of each fog event, indicating the substantial influence of pre-existing aerosol levels on fog microphysics. Water vapor supersaturation ratio (SS) within fogs was estimated to 0.07 % ± 0.02 %, slightly higher than previous estimates in urban and suburban areas. The broadening of the droplet size distribution (DSD) at formation, development, and mature stages was dominantly driven by activation, condensation, and collision–coalescence mechanisms, respectively. This evolution process often led DSD to a shift from a unimodal to a trimodal distribution, with peaks around 6, 12, and 23 µm. For fog events occurring under high Na background, a notable decrease in temperature during the mature stage promoted a secondary activation-dominated process, resulting in the formation of numerous small fog droplets and a reduction in the large droplet size. The evolution of DSD can significantly influence visibility (VIS) in fogs. Detailed comparison of several visibility calculation methods suggests that estimating visibility based on the extinction of fog droplets only led to considerable overprediction when 100 m <VIS≤1000 m. The results highlight the necessity of incorporating both fog droplets and aerosol extinction in fog visibility forecasts, particularly in anthropogenically polluted regions."

Evaluating climate models at the gateway to the Arctic","Representing the exchange of air masses between the Arctic and mid-latitudes and the associated cloud formation is difficult for climate models. We compare climate model output to temperature and humidity measurements from weather balloons to provide suggestions for model improvements. Cold biases mostly occur in air that is exported from the Arctic. Models that compute the number of ice particles in a cloud better represent humidity than models that assume a fixed number of ice particles. 
 The Arctic wintertime energy and moisture budgets are largely controlled by the advection of warm, moist air masses from lower latitudes; the cooling and drying of these air masses inside the Arctic; and the export of cold, dry air masses. Climate models have substantial difficulties in representing key processes in these air-mass transformations, including turbulence under stable stratification and mixed-phase cloud processes. Here, we use radiosonde profiles of temperature and moisture and surface radiation observations from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard (1993–2014), to assess the properties of air masses being imported into and exported from the central Arctic in CMIP6 climate models. In the free troposphere, models tend to be cold-biased, especially for the coldest temperatures, and relative humidity in most models is closer to saturation with respect to ice than what is observed. In the analysed models, supersaturation with respect to ice tends to be better represented with two-moment microphysics. The overall distribution of column-integrated precipitable water in models matches well with observations. Cold and dry biases are stronger in air masses being exported from the Arctic than those entering the Arctic. This suggests that the previously reported cold bias in the Arctic in CMIP6 models is probably due to errors in local thermodynamic processes."

Primary pollutants have decreased, consistent with emissions reductions. Surface O3 continues to increase and PM2.5 has decreased overall, but the nitrate component has not. O3 and PM2.5 nitrate depend on nonlinear responses from precursor emissions. Satellite data indicate a recent shift to NOx-sensitive O3 and nitrate formation, where further NOx reductions will benefit both O3 and PM2.5 pollution. 
 Air pollutant emissions in South Korea have been changing rapidly over the past decade. Here we analyze the resulting 2015–2023 trends in air quality and regimes using surface (AirKorea), aircraft (KORUS-AQ), and satellite (low Earth orbit, geostationary) measurements. Surface concentrations of primary pollutants have decreased at rates (CO: −2.6 ± 0.7 % a−1, SO2: −6.4 ± 0.8 % a−1, NO2: −4.4 ± 0.8 % a−1) consistent with the national Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) emissions inventory and satellite observations. CAPSS indicates no trend in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, consistent with satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) and glyoxal (CHOCHO), but surface aromatic concentrations show a 5.0 ± 3.9 % a−1 decrease. Peak season (May–June) maximum 8 h daily average (MDA8) surface ozone (O3) exceeds the 60 ppbv standard everywhere at AirKorea sites, with an increase of 0.8 ± 0.9 ppbv a−1 in the 90th percentile averaged across all sites indicating VOC-limited conditions for O3 production. However, satellite HCHO/NO2 ratios indicate a shift from VOC- to NOx-limited as NOx emissions decrease. Most AirKorea sites are in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), where vestiges of VOC-limited conditions persist; we find no O3 increases over the rest of South Korea. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been decreasing at 5.0 ± 1.6 % a−1, but the nitrate (NO3-) component has not. Satellite NH3/NO2 ratios show that PM2.5 NO3- formation was NH3-sensitive before 2019 but is now becoming NOx-sensitive as NOx emissions decrease. Our results indicate that further NOx emission decreases will reap benefits for both O3 and PM2.5 NO3- as their production is now dominantly NOx-sensitive."

Rodríguez-Fernández;Philippe Richaume;Julio César Salazar-Neira;Stéphane Tarot;Yann H. Kerr,Aboveground biomass dataset from SMOS L-band vegetation optical depth and reference maps,"Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a critical component of the Earth's carbon cycle. The presented dataset aims to help monitor this essential climate variable with AGB time series from 2011 onward, derived with a carefully calibrated spatial relationship between the measurements of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and pre-existing AGB maps. The produced dataset has been extensively compared with other available AGB time series and can be used in AGB studies. 
 Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential component of the Earth's carbon cycle. Yet, large uncertainties remain in its spatial distribution and temporal evolution. Satellite remote sensing can help improve the accuracy of AGB estimates. In particular, the L-band (1.41 GHz) vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission is a good AGB proxy. Averaging the SMOS L-VOD over a year and linking it to an existing AGB map constitute a well-established method to derive a spatial relationship between the two quantities. Then, a temporal extrapolation of this spatial relation derives global and harmonized AGB time series from the L-VOD. This study refines this protocol by analyzing the impact of three factors on the AGB–VOD calibration. First, an analysis shows that ascending and descending VOD can be properly merged to estimate the AGB. Second, the use of a single global spatial relationship is preferred over several regional ones. Third, this new AGB dataset is compared with other published AGB datasets to assess the validity of the temporal extrapolation. The produced dataset provides vegetation biomass values up to 300 Mg ha−1 from 2011 onward. It shows more interannual variability than the other available time series and presents globally lower AGB estimates. In general, the resulting AGB is consistent with the AGB maps of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Biomass version 5 (average Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.87) and can be used in AGB studies. The AGB dataset has been produced from the Level 2 SMOS products with one global VOD–AGB relationship, mixing ascending and descending orbits. The AGB dataset, including the spatial bias, is open-access and the NetCDF files are available at https://doi.org/10.12770/95f76ff0-5d89-430d-80db-95fbdd77f543 (Boitard et al., 2024)."

GeCGO data and GeoNEXTools could help scientists use geostationary satellite data at their interested ground observational sites. 
 The latest generation of geostationary satellites provide Earth observations similar to widely used polar orbiting sensors but at intervals as frequently as every 5–10 minutes, making them ideal for studying diurnal dynamics of land-atmosphere interactions. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) group created the GeoNEX datasets by collating data from several geostationary platforms, including GOES-16/17/18, Himawari-8/9, and GK-2A, and placing them on a common grid to facilitate use by the Earth science community. Here, we document the GeoNEX Coincident Ground Observations dataset (GeCGO) for terrestrial ecosystems studies, and provide examples for its use. Currently, GeCGO provides GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data over a 10 x 10 km area surrounding 1586 network sites across Americas. GeCGO make it easy to compare the time series of geostationary data with the diurnal ground observations including carbon/water fluxes and aerosol optical depth, and is extensible to other regions. We also developed GeoNEXTools to facilitate analyses that require both GeoNEX data and other NASA satellite data. The objectives of this paper are to introduce GeCGO and GeoNEXTools, and demonstrate their applications. First, we describe the details of GeCGO and GeoNEXTools. Second, we explain how GeCGO can be integrated with other satellite data. Finally, we showcase comparisons between GeCGO and observations from three ground-based networks."

Carrera-Hernández,Mexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB): a new daily high-resolution gridded climate dataset for Mexico covering 1951–2020,"Mexico's High Resolution Database (MexHiResClimDB) provides gridded, high-resolution data (600 m) of daily, monthly and yearly precipitation and Tmin, Tmax, Tavg for the 1951–2020 period. With this new database it was possible to summarize extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico and to show that there is an undeniable warming trend in Mexico; however, further studies are needed in order to pinpoint the areas where climate change is having a profound impact. 
 This work presents Mexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB), which is a newly developed gridded, high-resolution climate dataset comprised of daily, monthly and yearly precipitation and temperature (Tmin, Tmax, Tavg). This new database provides the largest temporal coverage of the aforementioned climate variables at the highest spatial resolution (20 arc sec, or 560 m on Mexico's CCL projection) when compared to the other currently available gridded datasets for Mexico and its development has allowed to analyze the country's climate extremes for the 1951–2020 period. By comparing the spatial distribution of precipitation from the MexHiResClimDB with other gridded data (Daymet, L15, CHIRPS and PERSIANN CDR), it was found that the precipitation provided by this new dataset is the only one that adequately represents the spatial variation of extreme precipitation events, in particular for the precipitation that occurred during September 15–16 of 2013, caused by the presence of Tropical storm Manuel in the Pacific Ocean and Hurricane Ingrid (Cat 1) in the Gulf of Mexico. With this new database it was possible to summarize extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico for the 1951–2020 period — a summary that was not available before: the wettest year was 1958, the wettest day 1970-09-26, and September of 2013 the wettest month. It was also found that eight out of the ten days with the highest Tmin occurred in 2020, the two months with the highest Tmin were July and August of 2020 and that the six years with the highest Tmin were 2015–2020. When Tmax was analyzed, it was found that the hottest day was 1998-06-15, while June of 1998 was the hottest month and 2020 the hottest year, and that the four hottest years occurred between 2011–2020. Nationwide (and considering 1961–1990 as the baseline period), Tmin, Tavg and Tmax have increased, with their anomalies drastically increasing in recent years and reaching values above 1.0 oC in 2020. At the same time, precipitation has also decreased in recent years — which combined with the increase in temperature will have severe impacts on water availability that need to be analyzed in detail, for example at the watershed level. This new database provides a tool to quantify — in detail — the spatio-temporal variability of climate throughout Mexico."

This platform produces CRA-LICOM, a high-frequency atmospheric and oceanic gravity de-aliasing product with a 6-hourly, 50 km resolution covering 2002–2024 globally. This product is reliable for de-aliasing, signal separation in satellite gravity missions, and climate change studies. 
 Modeling sub-daily mass changes, dominated by the atmosphere and the oceans, is not only essential for understanding weather and climate change but also serves as a fundamental requirement for nearly all existing terrestrial or space-borne geodetic observations to perform signal separation. Removing these high-frequency mass changes, through the usage of so-called de-aliasing products, is of particular interest for satellite gravity missions such as GRACE and GRACE-FO to prevent the aliasing of short-term mass changes into seasonal and long-term mass variability. However, establishing a global observation network to monitor high-frequency gravity signals is impractical. Thus, ongoing efforts focus on simulating this high-frequency signal by driving atmospheric/oceanic numerical models with specific climate-forcing fields and assimilating observational data. Its realization relies on a complicated system and the uncertainty of obtained results is non-negligible for its dependency on selected forcing field and ocean model."

This work introduces two approaches to represent light scattering by small particles. The first is a scattering simulator based on Mie theory implemented in Python. The second is a neural network emulator that is more accurate than existing methods and is fast enough to be used in climate and weather simulations. 
 The direct interactions of atmospheric aerosols with radiation significantly impact the Earth's climate and weather and are important to represent accurately in simulations of the atmosphere. This work introduces two contributions to enable a more accurate representation of aerosol optics in atmosphere models: (1) NeuralMie, a neural network Mie scattering emulator that can directly compute the bulk optical properties of a diverse range of aerosol populations and is appropriate for use in atmosphere simulations where aerosol optical properties are parameterized, and (2) TAMie, a fast Python-based Mie scattering code based on the Toon and Ackerman (1981) Mie scattering algorithm that can represent both homogeneous and coated particles. TAMie achieves speed and accuracy comparable to established Fortran Mie codes and is used to produce training data for NeuralMie. NeuralMie is highly flexible and can be used for a wide range of particle types, wavelengths, and mixing assumptions. It can represent core-shell scattering and, by directly estimating bulk optical properties, is more efficient than existing Mie code and Mie code emulators while incurring negligible error compared to existing aerosol optics parameterization schemes (0.08 % mean absolute percentage error)."

Erroneous snow height measurements often occur when snow height is low or changes, for instance during snowfall in summer. We prepare a new benchmark dataset with annotated snow height data and demonstrate how to improve the measurement quality using modern deep-learning approaches. Our approach can be easily implemented in a data pipeline for snow modeling. 
 Snow height measurements are still the backbone of any snow cover monitoring, whether based on modeling or remote sensing. These ground-based measurements are often realized using ultrasonic or laser technologies. In challenging environments, such as high alpine regions, the quality of sensor measurements deteriorates quickly, especially under extreme weather conditions or ephemeral snow conditions. Moreover, the sensors by their nature measure the height of an underlying object and are therefore prone to returning other information, such as the height of vegetation, in snow-free periods. Quality assessment and real-time classification of automated snow height measurements are therefore desirable for providing high-quality data for research and operational applications. To this end, we propose CleanSnow, a machine learning approach to automated classification of snow height measurements into a snow cover class and a class corresponding to everything else, which takes into account both the temporal context and the dependencies between snow height and other sensor measurements. We created a new dataset of manually annotated snow height measurements, which allowed us to train our models in a supervised manner and quantitatively evaluate our results. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies to evaluate feature importance and compare several different models, we validated our design choices and demonstrated the importance of using temporal information together with information from auxiliary sensors. CleanSnow achieves a high accuracy of almost 98 % and represents a new baseline for further research in the field. The presented approach to snow height classification finds its use in various tasks, ranging from snow modeling to climate science."

Indeed, magnetite stoichiometry (R = Fe(II)/Fe(III)) is rarely controlled or monitored in Cr-magnetite interaction studies, although it was shown to affect not only redox transformation but also adsorption mechanisms of several contaminants. This study examined the interaction of 20 μM (∼1 mg L–1) Cr(III) with 10 nm magnetites, whose stoichiometries were carefully defined (0.1 ≤ R ≤ 0.5) and preserved under anaerobic conditions in 10 mM NaCl. X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed the formation of a tridentate trinuclear inner-sphere surface complex, but it occurred only on oxidized magnetite (R0.1) or on stoichiometric magnetite (R0.5) under acidic conditions, where H+-promoted dissolution generated an Fe(II)-depleted surface. When magnetite stoichiometry increased, Cr surface speciation evolved in favor of a [Fe2+Crx3+Fe3+ 1–x]OhFeTd3+O4-like solid solution in which Cr(III) partially substitutes Fe(III) in octahedral sites. This study reveals the joint effects of pH and magnetite stoichiometry on the Cr(III) sorption mechanism, demonstrating that Cr(III)-(hydr)oxide precipitation is not necessarily the driving process of Cr(III) elimination from solutions. These results will help predict the fate and transport of chromium as well as develop magnetite-based chromium remediation processes."

However, differences in ecosystem responses to normal and flash droughts in China remain unclear, particularly in terms of vegetation vulnerability and resilience. Using a three‐dimensional clustering method, we identified disparities between these drought types from 1982 to 2022 and found that flash droughts developed 40% faster than normal droughts, but normal droughts caused more severe vegetation damage. With the transition to flash droughts, vegetation sensitivity to droughts has increased. Using Shapley's additive interpretation method, we assessed the role of each environmental factor in vegetation recovery. The results show that in normal droughts, drought characteristics and vegetation sensitivity drive the resilience of vegetation, whereas in flash droughts, temperature and vapor pressure deficit become more significant.

 Designing highly active, cost-effective, stable, and coke-resistant catalysts is a hurdle in commercializing bio-oil steam reforming. Single-atom alloys (SAAs) are captivating atomic ensembles crosschecking affordability and activity, yet their stability is held questionable by trial-and-error synthesis practices. Herein, we employ descriptor-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the stability, activity, and regeneration of Ni-based SAA catalysts for acetic acid dehydrogenation. While 12 bimetallic candidates pass the cost/stability screening, they uncover varying dehydrogenation reactivity and selectivity, introduced by favoring different acetic acid adsorption modes on the SAA sites. We find that Pd-Ni catalyst provokes the utmost H2 activity, however, ab-initio molecular simulations at 873 K reveals the ability of Cu-Ni site to effectively desorb hydrogen compared to Pd-Ni and Ni, attributed to the narrowed surface charge depletion region. Notably, this Cu-Ni performance is coupled with enhancing C*-gasification and acetic acid dehydrogenation with respect to Ni. Building upon these findings, DFT-screening of trimetallic M1-M2-Ni co-dopants recognizes 6 novel modulated single-sites with high stability, balanced H*-adsorption, and anti-coking susceptibility. This work provides invaluable data to accelerate the discovery of affordable and efficient bimetallic and trimetallic SAA catalysts for bio-oil upgrading to green hydrogen.

 The mediodorsal (MD) thalamus is a critical partner for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in cognitive control. Accumulating evidence has shown that the MD regulates task uncertainty in decision making and enhance cognitive flexibility. However, the computational mechanism of this cognitive process remains unclear. Here we trained biologically-constrained computational models to delineate the mechanistic role of MD in context-dependent decision making. We show that the addition of a feedforward MD structure to the recurrent PFC increases robustness to low cueing signal-to-noise ratio, enhances working memory, and enables rapid context switching. Incorporating genetically identified thalamocortical connectivity and interneuron cell types into the model replicates key neurophysiological findings in task-performing animals. Our model reveals computational mechanisms and geometric interpretations of MD in regulating cue uncertainty and context switching to enable cognitive flexibility. Our model makes experimentally testable predictions linking cognitive deficits with disrupted thalamocortical connectivity, prefrontal excitation-inhibition imbalance and dysfunctional inhibitory cell types.

 Aging is the risk factor for chronic pancreatitis and severity determinant for its acute attack, yet the underlying cause is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent β-cells of endocrine pancreas decide the onset and severity of chronic and acute pancreatitis. During physiological aging, senescent β-cells increase the expression of miR-503-322 which is secreted as small extracellular vesicles to enter exocrine acinar cells, driving a causal and reversible role on aging-associated pancreatitis. Mechanistically, miR-503-322 targets MKNK1 to inhibit acinar-cell secretion leading to autodigestion and repress proliferation causing repair damage of exocrine pancreas. In the elderly population, serum miR-503 concentration is negatively correlated with amylase, prone to chronic pancreatitis due to increased miR-503 and decreased MKNK1 in the elderly pancreas. Our findings highlight the miR-503-322–MKNK1 axis mediating the endocrine-exocrine regulatory pathway specifically in aged mice and humans. Modulating this axis may provide potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for aging-associated pancreatitis. Aging is the risk factor for chronic pancreatitis and its acute attack.

For stomatal lineage ground cells, division potential is the product of a cell’s neighbourhood, nuclear size and transcription factor dynamics. 
 During development, many precursor lineages are flexible, producing variable numbers and types of progeny cells. What determines whether precursors differentiate or continue dividing? Here we take a quantitative approach that combines long-term live imaging, statistical modeling and computational simulations to probe the developmental flexibility of stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGC) in Arabidopsis leaves. We discover that cell size is a strong predictor of SLGC behaviour and that cell size is linked to division behaviour at multiple spatial scales. At the neighbourhood scale, cell size correlates with the strength of cell-cell signaling, which affects the rate at which SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a division-promoting transcription factor, is degraded. At the subcellular scale, cell size correlates with nuclear size, which modulates the concentration of SPCH in the nucleus. Our work shows how initial differences in SPCH levels are canalized by nuclear size and cell-cell signaling to inform the behaviour of a flexible cell type. During development, what determines whether precursors differentiate or continue to divide?

 Lysine acylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) that plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes, such as transcription, metabolism, protein localization and folding. Thousands of lysine acylation sites have been identified based on advances in antibody enrichment strategies, highly sensitive analysis by mass spectrometry (MS), and bioinformatics. However, only 27 lysine methacrylation (Kmea) sites have been identified exclusively in histone proteins. It is hard to separate, purify and differentiate the Kmea modification from its structural isomer lysine crotonylation (Kcr) using general biochemical approaches. Here, we identify Kmea sites on a non-histone protein, Cyclophillin A (CypA). To investigate the functions of Kmea in CypA, we develop a general genetic code expansion approach to incorporate a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) ε-N-Methacryllysine (MeaK) into target proteins and identify interacting proteins of methacrylated CypA using affinity-purification MS. We find that Kmea at CypA site 125 regulates cellular redox homeostasis, and HDAC1 is the regulator of Kmea on CypA.

 Borderlands are increasingly recognized as critically important for biodiversity conservation owing to their ecological significance and high political profile. However, the species ranges covered by protected areas and their influencing factors in transboundary areas are still largely unknown worldwide. Here, based on the distributional ranges of 19,039 terrestrial vertebrates, we find that three-quarters of species’ ranges in global borders remain uncovered by protected areas, particularly in tropical areas of Southeast Asia and West Africa. The average protected area coverage of species ranges is lower in transboundary areas than non-transboundary areas after accounting for geographical differences in sampling efforts. We also observe that protected area coverage of species ranges increases with governance effectiveness, collaboration abilities, protection levels, sizes and establishment years of protected areas, and topographic complexity, but decreases with human population density, human development index, and cropland expansion. Furthermore, protected areas simultaneously face threats of ongoing global challenges from climate change, land-use modification, and alien species invasion, and the proportions of borderlands threatened by global changes are higher than elsewhere. All these findings demonstrate that cross-border cooperation is urgently needed to achieve the ambitious goal of global biodiversity conservation by 2050.

 Due to the analogous physicochemical properties and weak coordination ability of alkali and alkaline earth metals, accurate separation of radioactive 90Sr from groundwater or seawater still presents a big challenge in environmental radioactivity remediation. Here we mimic the complexation behavior of molecular crown-ether carboxylic acids to construct an elegant negatively charged supramolecular trap in an anionic crown ether-based metal-organic framework (ZJU-X99) for precisely catching Sr2+. Owing to the synergistic effects of electrostatic interactions arising from the In(COO)4- nodes and supramolecular host-guest recognition from the 18-crown-6 rings, ZJU-X99 exhibits rapid adsorption kinetics (1 min), high adsorption capacity (263 mg/g), and exceptional selectivity for Sr2+ even when 1000-fold of Na⁺, K⁺ and Cs⁺ coexist. Relative to alkali metals, Sr2+ ions are intricately ensconced within the supramolecular trap, resulting in lowest binding energy and minimal structural alterations. Dynamic column experiments and radioactive 90Sr decontamination trials further validate its practical application prospects.

 Droughts have been occurring frequently worldwide in a warming climate with an adverse impact on water–food–energy–ecology security, which raises substantial challenges for drought predictability. However, little is known about the future changes in dynamic predictability of agricultural drought over the globe and the dominant confounders causing this change. Here we leveraged Bayesian model averaging ensemble vine copula model to reveal changes in agricultural drought predictability globally in warm seasons at three projected global warming levels. We found that the projected dynamic predictability of agricultural drought would significantly decrease over 70% of the global land areas in +2 °C and +3 °C worlds, especially over North America, Amazonia, Europe, eastern and southern Asia and Australia. This was primarily attributed to the weakening soil moisture memory, background aridity and weakening land–atmosphere coupling.

Here we compare five conventional bioresidue valorization pathways with insect farming, microbial conversion and protein extraction by simulating their life-cycle assessment across 8,820 combinations of future process efficiencies, 9 food and energy systems scenarios and 11 representative bioresidues across France. Overall, processing bioresidues into novel ingredients is competitive only in certain conditions. These include access to decarbonized energy, substantial technological advancements and scenarios where novel ingredients replace meat rather than animal feed. The microbial conversion of woody residues, manure and sludge into feed will constitute the more sustainable valorization strategy only in contexts where current demand for animal-based food is maintained. However, the sustainability of this scenario must still be further appraised in terms of scaling these systems to a broader level. Efforts to curb environmental effects of food systems have led to the development of ‘waste-to-nutrition’ pathways that process bioresidues into food and feed products such as microbial proteins and insects. This paper examines the environmental mitigation potential of such pathways across France."

Here, by introducing reductive cations, the authors realize scalable fabrication of large-area solar cells in ambient conditions with good performance. 
 High-performance wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells are expected to play a key role in next-generation multi-junction solar cells. However, several challenges remain to be overcome, such as large photovoltage loss, poor stability and scalable fabrication in ambient air, which hinder the commercialization of this technology. Here we incorporate a reductive methylhydrazinium cation into WBG perovskites, which not only reduces defect density but also suppresses iodide oxidation and halide demixing, enabling scalable fabrication of efficient and stable WBG solar cells and modules in ambient air. Remarkably, the champion WBG perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.28 V, corresponding to a record low voltage loss of 0.37 V. The WBG mini modules deliver a stabilized PCE of 19.8% with an aperture area of 25 cm2. The mini modules can keep 94% of the initial PCE after 700 hours of operation under continuous light soaking at 1-sun illumination at 55 ± 5 °C. This work suggests a viable route to the sustainable harvesting of solar energy.

 Accurate and timely CO2 emission inventories are essential for tracking climate change mitigation progress. This study conducts near real-time CO2 emission estimates for China using different timely-updated activity data sources such as annual bulletins and monthly statistics. Comparing the results with emissions estimated by regular statistics, we find that emission estimates relying solely on either monthly statistics or annual bulletins have uncertainties. Prioritizing annual bulletins where available and supplementing with monthly statistics for the most recent year can balance accuracy and timeliness, yielding a median error of 1.3% across different update intervals. However, near real-time estimates of relative changes in annual CO2 emissions bear large uncertainties regardless of the approach. For the six years investigated, near real-time estimates usually failed to capture the trends in annual emissions, indicating that those near real-time approaches are unreliable for estimating changes in CO2 emissions due to notable differences between timely-updated and regular statistics."

 Clarifying relationships between stable oxygen isotope ratios in precipitation (δ18Op) and atmospheric circulations including the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) forms the basis of paleocirculation reconstructions. However, whether the IOD and WPSH modulate interannual variations of δ18Op remains unclear. Here, we reveal the links between the IOD/WPSH and the annual δ18Op in southern East Asia. We found that the IOD strongly influenced annual δ18Op before 1999 by changes in moisture supply from different transport pathways and convection. However, the link became decoupled after 1999, resulting from the transition of the IOD from a symmetric to an asymmetric pattern. In contrast, significantly enhanced WPSH emerges as an important influence on annual δ18Op after 1999. Therefore, the IOD and WPSH alternately influence interannual variation of δ18Op around 1999. Our findings imply that signals of IOD and WPSH should be considered in different periods to better interpret paleoclimate records."

 Global warming increases water evaporation rates from planetary ecosystems. Here, we show that evaporation rates encountered during human breathing in dehydrating atmospheres promote airway inflammation and potentially exacerbate lung diseases. Continuum mathematical analysis predicts that water evaporation thins airway mucus layers and compresses epithelial cells during tidal breathing. Experiments using human tracheal-bronchial cells confirm that exposure to air with progressive degrees of dryness (relative humidities of 95%, 60%, and 30% at 37 °C) causes the mucus layer to progressively thin (by 5%, 35%, and 58%). Associated compression of epithelial cells elevates secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-33, and IL-6). Exposing mice with a muco-inflammatory phenotype to intermittent dry air for 14 days results in histopathological changes and alteration of inflammatory infiltrates. Together with climate model simulations, these findings suggest that most of the United States will be at elevated risk of airway inflammation by the latter half of this century.

 China, despite being a leading producer of potatoes, has a potato yield below the global average, primarily due to inefficient nutrient management practices. Remote sensing provides a non-invasive and large-scale approach to monitor crop nutrient status, offering an efficient alternative to traditional plant tissue analysis. However, the generalization of foliar nutrient models is often constrained by factors such as growth stages and planting cultivars. Transfer learning offers a powerful solution by utilizing knowledge acquired from one task to enhance performance in related one, addressing challenges in model generalizability. Here, we investigated the potential of integrating various transfer learning techniques with partial least squares regression (PLSR) for retrieving three key potato foliar nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) across five growth stages (emergence, tuber initiation, early tuber bulking, mid-tuber bulking and tuber maturation). Three categories of transfer learning techniques were examined: 1) instance-based, including PLSR-KMM (kernel mean matching) and PLSR-TrAdaBoostR2 (transfer adaptive boosting for regression); 2) feature-based, including PLSR-TCA (transfer component analysis); and 3) parameter-based, including PLSR-parameter-based. We found that: 1) The combination of transfer learning techniques with PLSR could generally enhance the model transferability across growth stages, with a decrease in the normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE of 1–10 % for nitrogen, 3–60 % for phosphorous, and 1–15 % potassium; 2) The ranking of transfer learning techniques for improving model generalizability was: PLSR-TrAdaBootR2 > PLSR-parameter based > PLSR-recalibrated > PLSR-TCA > PLSR-KMM; 3) Foliar nitrogen demonstrated the highest transferability, followed by potassium and phosphorus; 4) PLSR models integrated with transfer learning techniques more effectively leveraged the absorption features of foliar biochemistry (e.g., chlorophyll, water and dry matters) to predict nutrients."

 This study provides a comprehensive assessment of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and their carbonaceous fractions-organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), across the Sikkim Himalaya region during the summer and winter of 2022. Sampling was conducted at four strategically selected locations: Gangtok (1151m), Pelling (1962m), Mangan (1353m), and Lachen (2740m). Due to harsh winter condition, Lachen was inaccessible, limiting winter sampling to the remaining three sites. Quartz filter-based low volume air sampling was employed to ensure high precision data collection. Annual average concentrations of PM2.5 exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs) of 40 μg/m3, with the values of 66.48 ± 10.81 μg/m3 (Gangtok), 42.05 ± 17.48 μg/m3 (Pelling), and 61.39 ± 13.24 μg/m3 (Mangan). PM10 levels followed a similar trend: 89.99 ± 12.04 μg/m3 (Gangtok), 58.64 ± 20.17 μg/m3 (Pelling), 82.71 ± 14.94 μg/m3 (Mangan). Winter exhibited significantly higher OC and EC concentrations, especially in Gangtok, attributed to intensified vehicular emissions and biomass burning. The OC/EC ratio exceeding 2 in winter suggests enhanced secondary organic carbon formation, predominately from biomass and coal combustion. Gangtok exhibits the highest SOC/OC ratio, indicating enhanced secondary organic aerosol formation, likely due to higher anthropogenic emissions or favourable atmospheric conditions. In contrast, lower SOC/OC ratios in Pelling and Mangan suggest weaker atmospheric processing or lower VOC emissions. Correlation analysis indicates primary emissions as the dominant source of OC and EC, with transboundary pollution playing a critical role. Air mass Trajectory analysis highlights substantial pollution transport from Afghanistan, and the Indo-Gangetic plain, emphasizing the regional impact on Himalayan air quality. This study underscores, the urgent need for integrated air quality management strategies to mitigate both local and cross-border pollution, safeguarding the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and public health. A combination of emission control policies, real-time monitoring, and predictive modelling is essential to address the escalating air pollution crisis in this ecologically sensitive region."
