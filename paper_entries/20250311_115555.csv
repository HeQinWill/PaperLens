The hydrological processes from evapotranspiration to precipitation reshape the distribution of surface water resources, and a thorough understanding of these processes can contribute to water resources management. China has experienced vegetation greening in recent years. How China’s evapotranspiration, particularly vegetation-related evapotranspiration (transpiration and interception loss), regulates its own water resources effectiveness and the precipitation in surrounding countries remains unclear. Using a high-quality global atmospheric moisture connectivity, evapotranspiration, and precipitation dataset, we find that the regulatory effect of evapotranspiration on precipitation is most pronounced in summer. Annually in China, 57% of the moisture generated by evapotranspiration stays within China, accounting for 39.54% of precipitation sources. The remaining moisture is transported abroad, providing an important source of precipitation for the neighboring countries, especially North Korea and Mongolia. Although grasslands and bare areas contribute much less moisture than croplands and forests, they serve as critical moisture sources for the arid interior of China and Mongolia. Vegetation in China has a negative net hydrological effect domestically, which tends to increase across most parts of the country from 2000 to 2020. This research highlights the critical role of vegetation in the transboundary distribution of water resources through moisture transport and provides new insights for sustainable development of water resources."

Natural ozone variability complicates the detection of small trends. This study optimizes a statistical model fit in ground-station-based observational records by adding parameters that interpret seasonal and long-term changes in atmospheric circulation and airmass mixing, which reduces uncertainties in detecting the stratospheric ozone recovery. 
 This study presents an updated evaluation of stratospheric ozone profile trends at Arosa/Davos/Hohenpeißenberg, Switzerland/Germany; Observatory de Haute-Provence (OHP), France; Boulder, Colorado, Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) and Hilo, Hawaii; and Lauder, Aotearoa / New Zealand, with a focus on the ozone recovery period post-2000. Trends are derived using vertical ozone profiles from NOAA's Dobson network via the Umkehr method (with a recent new homogenization), ozonesondes, and the NOAA COHesive Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SBUV)/Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) satellite-based record (COH) sampled to match the geographical coordinates of the ground-based stations used in this study. Analyses of long-term changes in stratospheric ozone time series were performed using the updated version (0.8.0) of the Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) independent linear trend (ILT) regression model. This study finds consistency between the trends derived from the different observational records, which is a key factor to the understanding of the recovery of the ozone layer after the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments that control ozone-depleting substance production and release into the atmosphere. The northern hemispheric Umkehr records of Arosa/Davos, OHP, and MLO all show positive trends in the mid- to upper stratosphere, with trends peaking at ∼ +2 % per decade. Although the upper-stratospheric ozone trends derived from COH satellite records are more positive than those detected by the Umkehr system, the agreement is within the 2 times the standard error uncertainty. Umkehr trends in the upper stratosphere at Boulder and Lauder are positive but not statistically significant, while COH trends are larger and statistically significant (within 2 times the standard error uncertainty). In the lower stratosphere, trends derived from Umkehr and ozonesonde records are mostly negative (except for positive ozonesonde trends at OHP); however, the uncertainties are quite large. Additional dynamical proxies were investigated in the LOTUS model at five ground-based sites. The use of additional proxies did not significantly change trends, but the equivalent latitude reduced the uncertainty in the Umkehr and COH trends in the upper stratosphere and at higher latitudes. In lower layers, additional predictors (tropopause pressure for all stations; two extra components of Quasi-Biennial Oscillation at MLO; Arctic Oscillation at Arosa/Davos, OHP, and MLO) improve the model fit and reduce trend uncertainties as seen by Umkehr and sonde."

Marais;Rebekah P. Horner;Dylan B. Millet;Kelly C. Wells;Alex B. Guenther,Natural emissions of VOC and NOx over Africa constrained by TROPOMI HCHO and NO2 data using the MAGRITTEv1.1 model,"Vegetation releases biogenic volatile organic compounds, while soils and lightning contribute to the natural emissions of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These gases interact in complex ways. Using satellite data and models, we developed a new method to simultaneously optimize these natural emissions over Africa in 2019. Our approach resulted in an increase in natural emissions, supported by independent data indicating that current estimates are underestimated. 
 Natural emissions (vegetation, soil, and lightning) are the dominant sources of non-methane biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx≡ NO + NO2) released into the atmosphere over Africa. BVOCs and NOx interact with each other and strongly impact their own chemical lifetimes and degradation pathways, in particular through their influence on hydroxyl radical levels. To account for this intricate interplay between NOx and VOCs, we design and apply a novel inversion setup aiming at simultaneous optimization of monthly VOC and NOx emissions in 2019 in a regional chemistry-transport model, based on Tropospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO and NO2 satellite observations. The TROPOMI-based inversions suggest substantial underestimations of natural NOx and VOC emissions used as a priori in the model. The annual flux over Africa increases from 125 to 165 Tg yr−1 for isoprene, from 1.9 to 2.4 TgN yr−1 for soil NO emissions, and from 0.5 to 2.0 TgN yr−1 for lightning NO emissions. Despite the NOx emission increase, evaluation against in situ NO2 measurements at seven rural sites in western Africa displays significant model underestimations after optimization. The large increases in lightning emissions are supported by comparisons with TROPOMI cloud-sliced upper-tropospheric NO2 volume mixing ratios, which remain underestimated by the model even after optimization. Our study strongly supports the application of a bias correction to the TROPOMI HCHO data and the use of a two-species constraint (vs. single-species inversion), based on comparisons with isoprene columns retrieved from the Cross-track Infrared Sensor (CrIS)."

Although the instruments had no range overlap, turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rates were estimated through various methods in convective boundary layers. Hourly averaged estimates showed good agreement, within a factor of approximately 2, suggesting that both instruments and methods provide consistent dissipation rate values. 
 From 21 August to 15 September 2022, a WindCube v2 infrared coherent Doppler lidar (DL) supplied by EKO Instruments Co. (Japan) was deployed at the Shigaraki MU Observatory (Japan) near the LQ7 UHF (1.357 GHz) wind profiler in routine operation. Horizontal and vertical velocity measurements from the DL were reliably obtained in the [40–300] m height range with vertical and temporal resolutions of 20 m and 4 s, respectively. The LQ7 wind measurements are collected with range and temporal resolutions of 100 m and 59 s, respectively, and 10 min average profiles are calculated after data quality control. Reliable LQ7 Doppler data are collected from a height of 400 m. Despite the lack of overlap in the height range, we compared the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate ε in the daytime planetary boundary layer estimated by the two instruments. A method based on the calculation of the one-dimensional transverse line spectrum of the vertical velocity W from mean W time series (TS method) was applied to DL (εDL). The same method was also applied to 1 min LQ7 data (εLQ7TS) to assess its performance with respect to DL despite the poorer time resolution. A more standard method based on the Doppler spectral width (DS) was also applied to LQ7 (εLQ7DS) from the 10 min average profiles. We tested recently proposed models of the form ε=σ3/L, where σ is half the spectral width corrected for non-turbulent effects, and L is assumed to be a constant or a fraction of the depth D of the convective boundary layer (CBL). The main results are the following: (1) For the deepest CBLs (max(D)>∼1.0 km) that develop under high atmospheric pressure, the time–height cross-sections of εLQ7DS and εDL show very consistent patterns and do not show any substantial gaps in the transition region of 300–400 m when εLQ7DS is evaluated with L∼70 m, which is found to be about one-tenth of the average of the CBL depth (L∼0.1D). (2) Hourly mean εDL averaged over the [100–300] m height range is on average about twice the hourly mean εLQ7TS averaged over the [400–500] m height range when D>∼1.0 km. (3) Hourly mean εDL averaged over the [100–300] m height range and hourly mean εLQ7DS averaged over the [400–500] m height range with L∼0.1D are identical on average. Consistent with the fact that ε is expected to decrease slightly with height in the mixed layer, results (2) and (3) imply an uncertainty as to the exact value of the L/D ratio: ∼0.1D<L<∼0.2D. We have also studied in detail the case of a shallow (D<∼0.6 km) convective boundary layer that developed under low atmospheric pressure and cloudy conditions. Despite the fact that hourly mean εDL averaged over the [100–300] m height range and hourly mean εLQ7TS averaged over the [400–500] m height range show more significant discrepancies, maybe due to the different properties of the shallow convection, the time–height cross-sections of εDL and εLQ7DS show more consistent patterns and levels."

By utilizing 48 different estimates, we account for uncertainties in major components of the P surplus. Our findings highlight substantial historical changes, with the total P surplus in the EU 27 tripling over 170 years. Our dataset enables flexible aggregation at various spatial scales, providing critical insights for land and water management strategies. 
 Phosphorus (P) surplus in soils significantly contributes to the eutrophication and degradation of water quality in surface waters worldwide. Despite extensive European regulations, elevated P levels persist in many water bodies across the continent. Long-term annual data on soil P surplus (the difference between P inputs and outputs) are essential to understand these levels and guide future management strategies. This study reconstructs and analyzes the annual long-term P surplus for both agricultural and non-agricultural soils from diffuse sources across Europe at a 5 arcmin (≈10 km at the Equator) spatial resolution from 1850 to 2019. The dataset includes 48 P surplus estimates that account for uncertainties arising from different methodological choices and coefficients in major components of the P surplus. Our results indicate substantial changes in P surplus magnitude over the past 100 years, underscoring the importance of understanding a long-term P surplus. Specifically, the total P surplus across the EU 27 has tripled over 170 years, from 1.19(±0.28) kg ha−1 of physical area in 1850 to around 2.48(±0.97) kg ha−1 of physical area per year in recent years. We evaluated the plausibility and consistency of our P surplus estimates by comparing them with existing studies and identified potential areas for further improvement. Notably, our dataset supports aggregation at various spatial scales, aiding in the development of targeted strategies to address soil and water quality issues related to P.

(2023)","Mapping vegetation as fuel is important for understanding and managing wildfires. Aragoneses et al. (2023) created a European fuel map, but their method has flaws. The fuel types don’t match real fire behavior, and key vegetation metrics were mapped using unreliable methods. The map’s low detail and oversimplified approach caused it to overestimate fire risk in areas with less flammable vegetation, limiting its usefulness for wildfire research and planning. 
 Classifying and mapping vegetation as fuel is essential for various fire research and management applications. Aragoneses et al. (2023) proposed a hierarchical fuel classification system for Europe and allocated standard fuel models to the resulting fuel types, producing a continental fuel map. We examine the methods involved and their outcomes. The reasoning behind their system is misguided, as the proposed set of fuel types does not reflect fuel-complex characteristics and the inherent fire behaviour. In their categorization of shrublands and grasslands, fuel depth is a key variable; however, the bioclimatic modelling approach used to map it is unreliable, as it is based on local empirical relationships. The adopted 1-km mapping resolution is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the needs of spatially-explicit fire behaviour simulation, and implied up-scaling procedures adding uncertainty due to loss of thematic detail. Finally, a simplistic aridity-based rule was applied to assign fuel models to fuel types, limiting the options available. This, in combination with fuel-depth overestimation and untenable fuel model choices, contributed to a substantial fire-hazard overestimation across the large portion of Europe occupied by low-flammability cover types."

Data quality is significantly improved through integration. The integrated dataset is now publicly available for easy access and use by the academic community and the public. These datasets are of great significance for optimizing historical geomagnetic field models, investigating changing magnetic fields, the main geomagnetic field. 
 Decades to centuries of continuous geomagnetic observation data have extensive scientific research and practical application value, especially in revealing the long-term variation rules of the geomagnetic field, which is irreplaceable. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), China established geomagnetic observatories in Beijing, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Urumqi, forming the initial structure of China's geomagnetic observation network together with the Shanghai Observatory. These observatories have continuously observed despite facing many challenges since their establishment, accumulating a large amount of valuable observational data, making significant contributions to the progress of geomagnetic scientific research and development. However, the scattered storage state of these historical data and the potential risk of damage pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of the data. This study conducted a rescue integration of the historical observational data from eight pioneering geomagnetic observatories in China, significantly improving data quality and facilitating long-term preservation and use of the data. This article introduces the basic conditions of eight observatories, including their locations, changes in location, observation environments, magnetic rooms, the magnetism of building materials, the layout of building facilities, measuring instruments, etc. These are the main prerequisites and foundations for ensuring the quality of observation data. Then, it introduces the integration and processing of historical data, including data collection, digitization, unification of formats, anomaly detection, and processing. Subsequently, the processed data were validated, including assessments of daily variations accuracy and long-term stability. The results show that the quality of the integrated historical data has been significantly improved. These datasets are of great value for improving historical geomagnetic field models, studying variable fields, main geomagnetic fields, and their long-term variations. Finally, we applied the data to the analysis and research of Sq and geomagnetic jerks, exploring the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of Sq and jerk in the China. Sq is mainly a daytime phenomenon, and its variation pattern in the middle and low latitude regions is mainly characterized by its dependence on latitude and local time. The geomagnetic jerk phenomenon exhibits significant regional differences and asynchronous occurrence times of jerks. Jerk events in 1969, 1979, 1991, 2003, and 2019 were observed at all observatories and had distinct jerk variation characteristics. Other jerks were only observed at some observatories or individual observatories. The maximum time difference for the occurrence of the same jerk event at different observatories was 2 years. This study aims to provide these precious datasets to the scientific community and the public so that these data can be integrated with data from other sources, thereby further exploring the spatiotemporal evolution and physical mechanisms of the geomagnetic field. The historical datasets of the eight geomagnetic observatories that have been integrated and quality controlled are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14560950 (Zhang et al., 2024b)."

Hence, we proposed a method to estimate uncertainty. Generating appropriate noises associated with the characteristic of the error in analysis can simulate the uncertainty of nowcasting. This method can contribute to the estimation of near–surface analysis uncertainty in both nowcasting applications and ensemble nowcasting development. 
 This study proposes a method to quantify uncertainty represented by errors in very-high-resolution near-surface analysis, specifically for weather nowcasting applications. Gaussian distributed perturbations are used to perturb the first guess and observation with a variance equal to that of the first-guess error. This error reflects the spatial characteristics of the difference between the first guess and observations and dominates the primary sources of analysis uncertainty. However, mapping perturbations to analyse the grid mesh through interpolation results in underdispersion, particularly in areas without stations. To address this issue, Gaussian perturbations are inflated with an inflation factor to amplify the dispersion. This method was applied to high-resolution analysis and nowcasting for hourly temperature, humidity, and wind components in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region to assess its effectiveness in representing uncertainty. The generated ensemble analysis exhibits reasonable spread and high reliability, indicating accurate quantification of analysis uncertainty. Ensemble nowcasting is extrapolated from ensemble analysis to evaluate the transmission of perturbation during extrapolation. Verification results of ensemble nowcasting reflect the fact that the spread increases effectively during extrapolation up to a lead time of 6 h. However, the increase in the spread is highly dependent on the persistence of numerical weather prediction. The results demonstrate that generating appropriate perturbations based on analysis errors effectively represents the analysis uncertainty and contributes to estimating uncertainty in nowcasting."

The WTM enables long-term evaluations of water-table changes. As a proof of concept, we simulate the North American water table for the present and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), showing that North America held more groundwater and lake water during the LGM than it does today – enough to lower sea levels by 14.98 cm. The open-source code is available on GitHub. 
 Ice-free land comprises 26 % of the Earth's surface and holds liquid water that delineates ecosystems, affects global geochemical cycling, and modulates sea levels. However, we currently lack the capacity to simulate and predict these terrestrial water changes across the full range of relevant spatial (watershed to global) and temporal (monthly to millennial) scales. To address this knowledge gap, we present the Water Table Model (WTM), which integrates coupled components to compute dynamic lake and groundwater levels. The groundwater component solves the 2D horizontal groundwater flow equation using non-linear equation solvers from the C++ PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) library. The dynamic lake component makes use of the Fill–Spill–Merge (FSM) algorithm to move surface water into lakes, where it may evaporate or affect groundwater flow. In a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrate the continental-scale capabilities of the WTM by simulating the steady-state climate-driven water table for the present day and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 calendar years before present) across the North American continent. During the LGM, North America stored an additional 14.98 cm of sea-level equivalent (SLE) in lakes and groundwater compared to the climate-driven present-day scenario. We compare the present-day result to other simulations and real-world data. Open-source code for the WTM is available on GitHub and Zenodo."

Accurate modeling of tropospheric delays is critical to achieving high-precision GNSS solutions, and using external delays can improve real-time GNSS convergence times. Current empirical delay models only provide delay but not uncertainty. We propose a global empirical delay model with uncertainty and demonstrate its benefits in accelerating GNSS positioning convergence. 
 Accurate modeling of tropospheric delay is important for high-precision data analysis of space geodetic techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Empirical tropospheric delay models provide zenith delays with an accuracy of 3 to 4 cm globally and do not rely on external meteorological input. They are thus important for providing a priori delays and serving as constraint information to improve the convergence of real-time GNSS positioning, and in the latter case proper weighting is critical. Currently, empirical tropospheric delay models only provide delay values but not the uncertainty of delays. For the first time, we present a global empirical tropospheric delay model, which provides both the zenith delay and the corresponding uncertainty, based on 10 years of tropospheric delays from numerical weather models (NWMs). The model is based on a global grid and, at each grid point, a set of parameters that describes the delay and uncertainty in the constant, annual, and semiannual terms. The empirically modeled zenith delay has agreements of 36 and 38 mm compared to 3-year delay values from the NWM and 4-year estimates from GNSS stations, which is comparable to previous models such as Global Pressure and Temperature 3 (GPT3). The modeled zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) uncertainty shows a correlation of 96 % with the accuracy of the empirical ZTD model over 380 GNSS stations over the 4 years. For GNSS stations where the uncertainty annual amplitude is larger than 20 mm, the temporal correlation between the formal error and smoothed accuracy reaches 85 %. Using GPS observations from ∼ 200 globally distributed IGS stations processed in kinematic precise point positioning (PPP) mode over 4 months in 2020, we demonstrate that using proper constraints can improve the convergence speed. The formal error modeling is based on a similar dataset to that of the GPT series, and thus it is also applicable for these empirical models."

 The Community Inversion Framework (CIF) brings together methods for estimating greenhouse gas fluxes from atmospheric observations. While the analytical and variational optimization methods implemented in CIF are operational and have proved to be accurate and efficient, the initial ensemble method was found to be incomplete and could hardly be compared to other ensemble methods employed in the inversion community, mainly owing to strong performance limitations and absence of localization methods. In this paper, we present and evaluate a new implementation of the ensemble mode, building upon the initial developments. As a first step, we chose to implement the serial and batch versions of the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) algorithm because it is widely employed in the inversion community. We provide a comprehensive description of the technical implementation in CIF and the useful features it can provide to users. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the CIF-EnSRF system using a large number of synthetic experiments over Europe with the flexible and scalable high-performance atmospheric transport model ICON-ART, exploring the system’s sensitivity to multiple parameters that can be tuned by users. As expected, the results are sensitive to the ensemble size and localization parameters. Other tested parameters, such as the number of lags, the propagation factors, or the localization function, can also have a substantial influence on the results. We also introduce and provide a way of interpreting a set of metrics that are automatically computed by CIF and that can help assess the success of inversions and compare them. This work complements previous efforts focused on other inversion methods within CIF. While ICON-ART has been used for testing in this work, the integration of these new ensemble algorithms enables any atmospheric transport model to perform inversions, fully leveraging CIF's robust capabilities."

Here, we incorporate the formation of isoprene epoxydiol secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX-SOA) in individual droplets within a one-dimensional explicit mixing parcel model (EMPM-Chem). We apply EMPM-Chem to simulate turbulence and droplet-resolved IEPOX-SOA formation using a laboratory cloud chamber configuration. We find that the dissolution of IEPOX gases is weighted more toward larger cloud droplets due to their large liquid water content (compared to smaller droplets), while the conversion of dissolved IEPOX to IEPOX-SOA is much greater within smaller deliquesced haze particles due to their higher acidity and ionic strengths compared to cloud droplets. We also apply the EMPM-Chem model to simulate how IEPOX-SOA formation evolves in individual cloud droplets within rising cloudy parcels in the atmosphere. We find that as subsaturated air is entrained into and turbulently mixed with the cloud parcel, evaporation causes a reduction in droplet sizes, which leads to corresponding increases in per droplet ionic strength and acidity. Increased droplet acidity, in turn, greatly accelerates the kinetics of IEPOX-SOA formation. Our results provide key insights into single cloud-droplet chemistry, suggesting that entrainment mixing may be an important process that increases SOA formation in the real atmosphere."

Here, through systematic characterization of emissions from a typical apartment in a Chinese megacity (Shenzhen), we show that indoor environments contribute significantly to the levels of ambient (i.e., outdoor) VOCs. In particular, we observe that the majority of indoor VOCs originate from unoccupied spaces, demonstrating temperature-dependent release from indoor surface reservoirs. The total indoor-to-outdoor VOC emission rates varied from 53 to 2300 mg day–1 (median 230 mg day–1) during unoccupied periods, influenced by both the air exchange rate and indoor temperature. Reanalysis of literature data from various building studies worldwide corroborates our findings and reveals that indoor-to-outdoor emissions scale with room volume, with an average emission rate of 0.33 ± 0.03 mg h–1 m–3. Our study implies that indoor-to-outdoor emissions significantly contribute to urban VOC levels, rivaling traditional urban sources, e.g., power generation and biomass burning. This is particularly true for oxygenated VOCs, such as methanol, amounting to ∼60% of transportation emissions. The findings change our understanding of the role of indoor VOC contributions to outdoor air quality, whose importance will increase as controls on industrial and transportation emissions intensify."

However, no human studies have examined the effects of perinatal exposure to emerging bisphenol alternatives [bisphenol G, bisphenol M, and bisphenol BP (BPBP)] on small for gestational age (SGA) and how placental function may mediate the relationship. Here, 13 urinary bisphenol analogues were detected in 1054 contemporary pregnant women, and BPA was still the most dominant congener. Logistic regressions identified BPA and its traditional alternatives [bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol Z, and bisphenol AP (BPAP)] as being associated with an elevated risk of SGA (all ORs > 1.80, P < 0.05). In contrast, the emerging substitutes, despite high occurrences, all showed much attenuated risk. Mixture effect models Bayesian kernel machine regression and quantile-based g-computation demonstrated that coexposure to bisphenols was strongly correlated with SGA risk (OR = 2.70, P < 0.001), with BPA and the conventional substitutes (BPB, BPE, and BPAP) as primary effect drivers, outweighing the effect from emerging substitutes. Finally, mediation analysis revealed that the placental function index estriol mediated the relationship between exposure and SGA, dominated by BPBP (25.4%). Our findings provide new epidemiological evidence that early BPA alternatives may pose a higher risk for offspring development than those emerging alternatives, potentially via mediation by compromised placental function. Future toxicity assessments and validation studies in other settings on these emerging bisphenols are needed."

Given the ongoing global change and intensified anthropogenic NH3 emissions, it is projected that the global surface NH3 concentration will escalate further. Here, based on ground observations, gridded data of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizer applications, meteorological data, and ancillary information, we estimated changes in global monthly surface NH3 concentration during 2001–2019 at a 0.1°× 0.1° resolution. A novel scale-adaptive approach, essentially an Ensemble Random Forest Model built upon Rotated Quadtree Partitioning and Box-Cox Transformation, was developed. The model well reproduced the spatial and temporal patterns of surface NH3 observations, particularly capturing peak and valley values (R2 = 0.91 and slope = 0.82 for the whole; R2 = 0.79 and slope = 0.70 for testing). The results indicate a global increase in surface NH3 concentration over 2001–2019, from 1.44 μg m–3 yr–1 in 2001 to 1.51 μg m–3 yr–1 in 2019. Notably, hotspots of elevated NH3 concentrations were located in northern South Asia, northern China, the Sahel area, southeast South America, and central United States. Decreased SO2 emissions and increased fertilizer applications dominated the increase of surface NH3 concentrations in China, while in South Asia, the increase was primarily driven by organic and inorganic nitrogen inputs. Temperature changes were identified to play an important role in affecting surface NH3 concentrations in most regions, particularly in Africa, South America, and Oceania. These findings have the potential to facilitate research on global nitrogen cycle and its environmental footprints and inform the development of locally or regionally tailored nitrogen management strategies. Furthermore, the proposed modeling algorithm showcases its capability in capturing intricate patterns and relationships within highly spatially heterogeneous data, thereby addressing up-scaling challenges associated with multimodal site observations."

These non-commodity plastics suffer from inconsistent definitions, complex classifications, and data gaps, which hinder accurate assessment of their production, use, and end-of-life management. This study develops dynamic material flow analysis to investigate 12 key “non-commodity” plastics in China─including PET, PU, seven engineering plastics, and three thermosetting plastics─and addresses these knowledge gaps. Our results show that in 2022, China produces approximately 85 million tonnes of these polymers, a volume comparable to commodity plastics, with 35% used in plastic products and the remainder in non-plastic applications (e.g., fibers, rubber). PET is predominantly employed in short-lifespan packaging, whereas PU, engineering plastics, and thermosetting plastics find use in longer-lifespan applications, underscoring the need for targeted recycling strategies─particularly chemical recycling for PU and thermoset products. Revisiting the scope of “plastics” using scientific criteria can help mitigate definitional ambiguities and guide more effective policymaking. By improving data availability and tracking this underexplored non-commodity category, our study lays the groundwork for more accurate assessments and interventions to reduce plastic pollution."

Fortuitously, two spacecraft crossed the opposite half of this KSMH while the other two spacecraft didn't detect it, which offers a unique opportunity to reveal the properties inside KSMH. We find that the angle between the KSMH's axial and the out‐of‐plane direction of reconnection is about 60°. The non‐ideal energy conversion provided by this KSMH is comparable in intensity to that within the electron diffusion region. The non‐ideal electric field within the KSMH is balanced by the pressure gradient term in the electron momentum equation.

Each season radiative forcing magnitudes were lowest in early spring and intensified as snowmelt progressed, with interannual variability in timing and magnitude of peak impact. Over the full record, radiative forcing was elevated in the first decade relative to the last decade. Snowmelt was accelerated in all years and impacts were most intense in the central to southern headwaters.

 Exposure to anthropogenic atmospheric aerosol is a major health issue, causing several million deaths per year worldwide. The oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons from traffic and wood combustion is an important anthropogenic source of low-volatility species in secondary organic aerosol, especially in heavily polluted environments. It is not yet established whether the formation of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol involves mainly rapid autoxidation, slower sequential oxidation steps or a combination of the two. Here we reproduced a typical urban haze in the ‘Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets’ chamber at the European Organization for Nuclear Research and observed the dynamics of aromatic oxidation products during secondary organic aerosol growth on a molecular level to determine mechanisms underlying their production and removal. We demonstrate that sequential oxidation is required for substantial secondary organic aerosol formation. Second-generation oxidation decreases the products’ saturation vapour pressure by several orders of magnitude and increases the aromatic secondary organic aerosol yields from a few percent to a few tens of percent at typical atmospheric concentrations.

 Thermokarst lakes, serving as significant sources of methane (CH4), play a crucial role in affecting the feedback of permafrost carbon cycle to global warming. However, accurately assessing CH4 emissions from these lakes remains challenging due to limited observations during lake ice melting periods. In this study, by integrating field surveys with machine learning modeling, we offer a comprehensive assessment of present and future CH4 emissions from thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal that the previously underestimated CH4 release from lake ice bubble and water storage during ice melting periods is 11.2 ± 1.6 Gg C of CH4, accounting for 17 ± 4% of the annual total release from lakes. Despite thermokarst lakes cover only 0.2% of the permafrost area, they annually emit 65.5 ± 10.0 Gg C of CH4, which offsets 6.4% of the net carbon sink in alpine grasslands on the plateau. Considering the loss of lake ice, the expansion of thermokarst lakes is projected to lead to 1.1–1.2 folds increase in CH4 emissions by 2100. Our study allows foreseeing future CH4 emissions from the rapid expanding thermokarst lakes and sheds new lights on processes controlling the carbon-climate feedback in alpine permafrost ecosystems.

 Managing junctional hemorrhage is challenging due to ineffective existing techniques, with the groin being the most common site, accounting for approximately 19.2% of potentially survivable field deaths. Here, we report a bicomponent nano- and microfiber aerogel (NMA) for injection into deep, narrow junctional wounds to effectively halt bleeding. The aerogel comprises intertwined poly(lactic acid) nanofibers and poly(ε-caprolactone) microfibers, with mechanical properties tunable through crosslinking. Optimized aerogels demonstrate improved resilience, toughness, and elasticity, enabling rapid re-expansion upon blood contact. They demonstrate superior blood absorption and clotting efficacy compared to commercial products (i.e., QuikClot® Combat Gauze and XStat®). Most importantly, in a lethal swine junctional wound model (Yorkshire swine, both male and female, n = 5), aerogel treatment achieved immediate hemostasis, a 100% survival rate, no rebleeding, hemodynamic stability, and stable coagulation, hematologic, and arterial blood gas testing.

 The microenvironment regulation of Fe-N4 single atom catalysts (SACs) critically governs peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Although conventional heteroatom substitution in primary coordination enhances activity, it disrupts Fe-N4 symmetry and compromises stability. Herein, we propose oxygen doping in the secondary coordination shell to construct Fe-N4-C6O2 SAC, which amplifies the localized electric field while preserving the pristine coordination symmetry, thus trading off its activity and stability. This approach suppresses Fe-N bond structural deformation (bond amplitude reduced from 0.875–3.175 Å to 0.925–2.975 Å) during PMS activation by lowering Fe center electron density to strengthen Fe-N bond, achieving extended catalytic durability (>240 h). Simultaneously, the weakened coordination field lowers the Fe=O σ* orbital energy, promoting electrophilic σ-attack of high-valent iron-oxo towards bisphenol A, and increasing its degradation rate by 41.6-fold. This work demonstrates secondary coordination engineering as a viable strategy to resolve the activity-stability trade-off in SAC design, offering promising perspectives for developing environmental catalysts.

 An exciton–polariton condensate is a state of matter with collective coherence leading to many fascinating macroscopic quantum effects. Recently, optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been demonstrated as peculiar topological states capable of imparting novel characteristics onto the polariton condensates. Organic semiconductors featuring robust Frenkel excitons and high physicochemical tunability potentially offer a promising platform to explore topologically engineering of BIC polariton condensates at room temperature. However, a universal physical mechanism for engineering organic BIC systems has remained elusive, hindering the demonstration of BIC polariton condensates with topologically tunable macroscopic quantum effects. Here we report topologically reconfigurable room-temperature polariton condensates by systematically engineering the BICs in organic semiconductor metasurfaces. Two-dimensional organic metasurfaces are designed to support two polariton BICs with different topological charges. The organic Frenkel excitons with large binding energies allow for non-equilibrium polariton condensation at BICs at room-temperature. By virtue of the excellent physicochemical tunability of organic materials, we further explore the dynamic topological engineering of polariton lasers by manipulating the BICs in situ. Our results fundamentally promote the innovative design and topological engineering of polaritonic materials and devices.

Greenhouse gases are complicating the problem, leading to longer orbital retention of defunct satellites and increasing the risk of collision. 
 Anthropogenic contributions of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere have been observed to cause cooling and contraction in the thermosphere, which is projected to continue for many decades. This contraction results in a secular reduction in atmospheric mass density where most satellites operate in low Earth orbit. Decreasing density reduces drag on debris objects and extends their lifetime in orbit, posing a persistent collision hazard to other satellites and risking the cascading generation of more debris. This work uses projected CO2 emissions from the shared socio-economic pathways to investigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the satellite carrying capacity of low Earth orbit. The instantaneous Kessler capacity is introduced to compute the maximum number and optimal distribution of characteristic satellites that keep debris populations in stable equilibrium. Modelled CO2 emissions scenarios from years 2000–2100 indicate a potential 50–66% reduction in satellite carrying capacity between the altitudes of 200 and 1,000 km. Considering the recent, rapid expansion in the number of satellites in low Earth orbit, understanding environmental variability and its impact on sustainable operations is necessary to prevent over-exploitation of the region.

 Mid-latitude weather systems play a significant role in causing floods, wind damage, and related societal impacts. Advances in numerical modeling and observational methods have led to the development of numerous conceptual models in mid-latitude synoptic and dynamical research. As these models proliferate, integrating new insights into a cohesive understanding can be challenging. This paper uses a kinematic perspective to interpret mid-latitude research in a way that synthesises various concepts and create a schematic diagram of an atmospheric river lifecycle. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite varying methods, definitions, and terminology used to describe extratropical cyclones, warm conveyor belt airflows, and atmospheric rivers, the underlying mechanisms driving their formation and development are consistent. Thus, while studying these features independently is valuable, it is important to recognise that they are all part of a larger atmospheric flow pattern.

This study demonstrates that the SIDS-InSAR method has potential to provide a more comprehensive deformation time series of dam body, especially for the leading-edge upstream slope part."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an indispensable factor for comprehending of surface equilibrium state on the Earth. In particular, satellites can continuously provide LST data and support the large-scale monitoring of LST with a high temporal resolution; however, satellite data may be easily contaminated by clouds. Previous satellite-based all-sky LST reconstruction approaches have inherent limitations, such as low temporal resolution and insufficient consideration of cloud effects. Therefore, this study aims to propose a novel methodology for all-sky 2-km hourly LST reconstruction from GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) using machine learning and timely weighted accumulated radiation to reflect the temporal variation of cloud effects. The light gradient boosting machine approach used the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Land variables (i.e., LST, 2 m air temperature, evaporation, and wind), GK2A products (i.e., short and longwave radiation, and binary cloud cover), and auxiliary variables including geographic variables as independent variables. The GK2A LST and in situ measurements were used as dependent variables. The proposed model showed robust spatial agreement with GK2A LST under clear-sky conditions when conducting five-fold spatial cross-validation, with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.97–0.99. In the leave one station-out cross-validation using 36 in situ data under all-sky conditions, the proposed model showed high performance with R2 values of 0.86–0.97, root mean square error values of 1.42–2.60 °C, and bias values of −0.49–0.23 °C. In a comparison of the proposed model with two scenarios and previous research investigating the effect of accumulated radiation, we demonstrated that the use of accumulated radiation was effective in reconstructing cloudy-sky LST, particularly during the daytime, as evident from the variable analysis conducted through Shapley additive explanations. Using the proposed model, we successfully reconstructed a spatiotemporally seamless LST, which can serve as a fundamental dataset for hourly heat-related research, such as hourly heat flow estimation and urban heat island analysis."

 Carbon monoxide (CO) pollution is one of the unsolved atmospheric environmental issues over countries worldwide. Here, we comprehensively assess the spatial-seasonal variations and trends in CO over China during 2013–2022, by site categorization and cause analysis, which have not been reported in previous studies. Our analysis is based on surface observations, statistical classification techniques, and sensitivity simulations from a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. The results show that CO concentrations and their seasonal variation are higher over the North China Plain than other areas of China during 2013–2022. CO concentrations have decreased at −38.2 ± 31.4 ppbv yr−1 (−3.7% ± 1.8% yr−1) over China during 2013–2022. The declining trends in CO concentrations vary with space, stronger over larger, more polluted, and more industralized cities. GEOS-Chem simulations suggest that the decrease in CO anthropgenic emissions in China would be the main driver for the decreasing trends of CO over China, with a contribution of 80% to the trend. Meteorology, CO anthropgenic emissions over foreign regions, and emissions from biomass burning are the remaining drivers. Our results suggest remarkable benefits of emission reductions in China in abating CO pollution and enhance our understanding on trends of long-term CO pollution over China during 2013–2022."
