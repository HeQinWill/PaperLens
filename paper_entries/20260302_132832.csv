Plata,Complementary Bacterial Functions Enhance Mineralization of Aromatic Aliphatic Copolyesters within a Marine Microbial Consortium,"Plastics are a major environmental concern due to their persistence in natural systems. Biodegradable plastics can mitigate this impact by reducing their residence time in the environment. To constrain the environmental lifetime of these materials, understanding the fundamental principles dictating their biodegradation is crucial. The work presented here probes this complexity by using a 30-member bacterial community enriched from the marine ecosystem to investigate how bacterial consortia mineralize polybutylene sebacate-co-terephthalate (PBSeT), a biodegradable aromatic aliphatic copolyester. Carbon dioxide quantification and isotopic tracing provided evidence of polymer mineralization, while monoculture phenotyping demonstrated no one bacterium could consume all polymer components. Further, coculture incubations revealed complementary functions between community members enhanced mineralization. To explain this enhanced mineralization, dissolved organic carbon and chemical product tracking were performed. Notably, depolymerization of the bulk polymer was dictated by a bacterium unable to consume all polymer components (Pseudomonas pachastrellae), requiring complementary bacteria to achieve enhanced mineralization (Pseudooceanicola nitratireducens or Peribacillus frigoritolerans). This yielded direct experimental evidence of the complementary bacterial transformations that may control polymer mineralization in the environment."

Here, we report an interspecies cooperative mechanism, termed electro-mutualism, that enables efficient extracellular ORR using an electrotrophic Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 (RAG-1) and a non-CO2-fixing electrotrophic Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (MR-1), sustained by inorganic carbon supplied via a bicarbonate–CO2 equilibrium. Under cathodic polarization, RAG-1 assimilates inorganic carbon and secretes lactate using electrode-derived electrons, which fuels MR-1. In turn, MR-1 releases flavins that interact with the RnfB complex of RAG-1, thereby accelerating the transmembrane electron transfer. This electro-mutualistic cooperation achieves, to our knowledge, the highest reported whole-cell ORR current density (20.9 A/m2) under O2-aerated, neutral-pH conditions, outperforming benchmark Pt/C and laccase cathodes evaluated under identical conditions. The universality of electro-mutualism is further supported by replacing MR-1 with Bacillus subtilis and is predicted to extend across proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria. Electro-mutualism thus provides a metal-free, genetically unmodified catalytic strategy for green energy conversion."

Field observations from two exhumed splay faults define end‐member scenarios where impermeable faults trap fluids in their footwall, whereas permeable faults channel fluids along them. Using finite element poroelastic models, with slip mode inferred solely from stress–pore‐fluid pressure patterns, we define two end‐member behaviors: (a) Impermeable, clay‐rich, mature splay faults favor footwall fluid flow, promoting low differential stress, dilation, and vein formation in the upper plate, while reducing pore‐fluid pressure and coupling the megathrust downdip of the intersection. (b) Permeable, less mature faults allow distributed upper‐plate fluid flow, increasing fluid flux, and differential stress, while maintaining plate interface overpressure and promoting creep. These models provide a framework for prism‐scale effects of splay fault permeability on shallow subduction zone deformation and seismicity."

Holbrook,Projected Global Diversity of Marine Heatwaves in the 21st Century,"Marine heatwaves (MHWs)—discrete and prolonged warm ocean temperature extremes—can pose serious threats to marine ecosystems. While the previous work of authors has highlighted the diversity of MHWs, future changes in six representative MHW types, under different climate change scenarios, are unknown. Here, we analyze changes in MHW diversity projected for the late 21st century using multi‐model ensembles from CMIP6 under the SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 scenarios. Our results show that under the normal‐emission scenario, annual occurrence days of bimodal MHWs keep increasing, while those of the other five types rise early but level off around 2050. Under the high‐emission scenario, annual occurrence days of three long, intense types keep rising, whereas the other three decline after mid‐century. We further find that higher‐intensity MHWs are increasingly associated with bimodal events. Spatially, MHW distributions shift toward bimodal dominance, with nearly all ocean regions projected to be governed by bimodal types by mid‐century under the both scenarios. Improved understanding of these projected shifts is critical for informing marine conservation planning and climate adaptation strategies in ocean ecosystems."

In boreal summer, cross‐Pacific ARs originate over Southeast Asia, are fueled by subtropical outflows from the Asian monsoon plume, transport warm, moist air across the North Pacific, and make landfall in North America (NA). Our results show that diabatic heating anomalies over the Indian summer monsoon region and the Philippine Sea–Western North Pacific area jointly modulate AR pathways and landfalls. Numerical experiments verify that distinct heating archetypes generate diverse downstream triple‐pressure circulation structures, steering ARs toward different landfall locations. Cross‐Pacific AR activity is also modulated by climate oscillations; different phases preferentially induce distinct Indo‐Pacific heating patterns and thus redirect AR pathways. Therefore, tropical heating anomalies in Indo‐Western Pacific are valuable predictors of boreal‐summer AR activity.

The simulated spectrum exhibits closely spaced and overlapping peaks resembling portions of the observed STEVE spectra. The VER peaks at ∼185 km‐altitude, with peak luminosity (at 380–780 nm) at the ∼1 $\mathit{\sim }1$ kilo‐Raileigh level. These results suggest multi‐band NO vibrational emissions produced by RVE to be likely a significant contributor to the STEVE continuum."

Traditional signal decomposition methods often fail to adequately separate these components due to their time‐varying frequencies and overlapping spectra. We propose the instantaneous bandwidth Vold‐Kalman Filtering (IB‐VKF), which first defines the component‐specific bandwidth weighting functions ri,IB(n) ${r}_{i,\text{IB}}(n)$, allowing for the independent and precise dynamic tracking of disparate signal features. We demonstrate the algorithm's geophysical utility using data from the CASSIOPE/Swarm‐Echo and CSES missions. The IB‐VKF successfully isolates persistent reaction wheel interference with suppression ratios exceeding 22 dB, and, more critically, separates transient whistler waves from background platform noise, achieving suppression ratios of 9.34 dB for the natural waves. By significantly enhancing the fidelity of space magnetic data, the IB‐VKF provides a powerful new tool for probing wave‐particle coupling and magnetospheric dynamics."

Results show that across 204 near‐contemporaneous water level points for 110 lakes, the average deviation between SWOT and ICESat‐2 was 0.03 m, with a root mean square deviation of 1.43 m, showing a good agreement. The higher temporal resolution of SWOT (<21 days over Greenland) enabled better monitoring of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), with a 100% increase in the number of GLOFs detected compared to ICESat‐2 between 2023 and 2024. These advantages make SWOT an excellent data source for monitoring ice‐marginal lakes around the Greenland Ice Sheet."

Mooring observations and a partial submesoscale‐resolving model show that these Yucatan GCW forms locally when the Yucatan Current separates from the slope, intensifying a frontal zone with isopycnal uplift, cyclonic vorticity, and sharp lateral gradients, signatures of submesoscale activity. These conditions favor interleaving and mixing among Caribbean inflow waters within a vertically compressed isopycnal layer. Lagrangian backtracking confirms their local origin, while forward tracking reveals export within cyclonic frontal eddies along the Loop Current periphery. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized pathway of water‐mass transformation in the Yucatan Channel and highlight its potential implications for Loop Current variability."

We here derive new relationships, including a low and a high b‐value approximation. We apply these theoretical relationships to a comprehensive set of 17 induced seismic sequences, by examining the growth of the released seismicity with the injected volume. While the event number is found to be directly proportional to the volume, the cumulative and maximum seismic moment depends on the volume with an exponent that depends at first order on the b‐value. This is confirmed by the theoretical relationships we derived, and shows that the injected volume primarily controls seismic nucleation and therefore the seismic rate of occurrence. The magnitude dependence on b‐value, which is not considered in most moment‐volume relationships, may have a significant impact on earthquake magnitude forecasting for monitoring purposes."

This work performs a single‐site observational‐closure study that combines AERONET multi‐wavelength extinction and absorption retrievals, in situ observations of particle size, and Mie modeling over multi‐waveband, while treating the BC‐sulfate core‐shell scheme as a mass‐ and number‐conserved, radiatively‐closed set of probabilistically possible solutions and quantifying the resulting mixing, number concentration, and radiative forcing solution space. Results show conventional retrievals overestimate coarse‐mode particles and internal mixing, leading to higher single scattering albedo and broader asymmetry coefficient. Ground‐based constraints yield more physically consistent PSDs and systematically modifies aerosol optical properties, especially for smaller particles within sub‐2.5 micron range. Radiative transfer simulations using these constrained properties reveal enhanced atmospheric heating alongside reduced top‐of‐atmosphere cooling, underscoring the sensitivity of forcing to size‐resolved multi‐waveband constraints."

The simulation reproduces observed PE characteristics and IWP‐precipitation relationships across all storm types. The agreement between IWP‐based and an alternative PE estimation method leveraging saturation adjustment is better for convective storms that produce a lot of cloud ice. PE varies by storm type, with tropical cyclones exhibiting the highest PE and least sample variability. PE also evolves over storm lifetimes, showing lower values during initiation and decay.

Given the limitation in quantifying human influence on icing days in China, we investigate the spatiotemporal variations in icing days and associated intensity over China during 1961–2020, and conduct detection and attribution analyses by using the optimal fingerprinting method, based on the observations from the gridded data set CN05.1 and simulations from 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. Remarkably downward trends in icing days and upward trends in their intensity are found over China during 1961–2020 from both observations and simulations. The anthropogenic (ANT) signal is clearly detected in the observed changes over China and its eastern (east of 105°E) and western (west of 105°E) regions. The greenhouse gases (GHG) play a dominant role, while the attributable changes from natural (NAT) and anthropogenic aerosol (AER) signals are generally negligible. After the attribution‐constraints, the annual icing days are projected to decrease by 14.5 days and strengthen by 0.9°C over China in the long‐term period (2081−2100) relative to 1995−2014 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP2‐4.5 scenario, and those values are 26.1 days and 1.5°C under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario, respectively. In the future projections, the uncertainty range of observation‐constrained projections is narrowed over China and its eastern and western regions in the 21st century under SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 scenarios.

Through field observation, this study analyzed four severe wind erosion events (WEEs) in different years that occurred on the same sandy loam farmland in the Bashang area (Hebei Province, China). Specifically, changes in horizontal saltation flux (Qs), PM10 vertical flux (Fv), and Ed with wind friction velocity (u*) and dynamic properties of soil were investigated. Results show that Qs and Fv both exhibit a strong synchronous trend with u*, but the changing trend in Ed over time among different WEEs is very different and not necessarily related to the changing trend in u*. Ed generally shows a trend of reduction with increasing u*, which may indicate that the supply of dust on sandy loam farmland surface is limited. There is a substantial difference in Qs, Fv, and Ed for different WEEs. This can be attributed to differences in the dynamic properties of the surface soil, especially the particle size distribution of soil aggregates and surface roughness. The findings of this study on sandy loam farmland surface indicate that Ed for a certain location in the field may vary continuously with change in wind and soil conditions. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the research on the dynamic variation of Ed with changes in wind and soil conditions."

Our study addresses this gap by modifying the autoconversion rate in two Earth system models (ESMs), elucidating how ACI could connect with cloud feedback through the warm rain process. We find that higher autoconversion rates, which are associated with stronger ACI, suppress the increase in cloud liquid water path (LWP) and cloud optical depth with warming by enhancing the precipitation efficiency over the extratropical regions, leading to a larger positive cloud feedback. This study offers new insights into the compensatory mechanism between ACI and cloud feedback through the warm rain process and highlights the importance of constraining the autoconversion parameterization in models."

 Sentinel-1 wave mode (WV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) routinely acquires high-resolution vignettes over the Southern Ocean, but its potential for automated and statistically oriented iceberg study has been underutilized. This work presents IByolo, a deep learning model adapted from the YOLOv11 architecture, for the detection and localization of km-sized icebergs in open ocean WV SAR data. The model was trained on a manually curated dataset of 13,686 annotated icebergs across 2062 vignettes. Sensitivity experiments over multiple architectural configurations identified the HGNetV2+C2PSA-CAA+P2 combination as optimal with AP50:95 of 0.41. IByolo generates reliable bounding boxes that enable efficient surface area estimations for icebergs within 0.1-5 km2. Application to 19,025 vignettes acquired south of 40∘S during 2016–2018 yields 80,245 iceberg detections. Most vignettes contain fewer than ten icebergs with total surface areas below 5 km2. Icebergs are concentrated near major calving fronts in the northeastern Weddell Sea, Amundsen–Ross Seas, and coastal East Antarctica. Their population shows a pronounced seasonal cycle, with maxima in the austral summer and near-zero values in winter. This aligns with the Altimeter-based analysis for km-sized icebergs, and together they complement global observational records for further understanding of the Antarctic iceberg drift and changes. The retrieved size distribution follows a power-law scaling with an exponent of –1.42, which is consistent with prior satellite-based estimates. These findings confirm the viability of combining WV SAR data with advanced object detection frameworks for scalable iceberg monitoring. The resulting dataset would be a valuable resource for investigating Antarctic iceberg dynamics, freshwater fluxes, and their broader climatic impacts."

Atkinson,Widespread biophysical cooling effects due to post-fire greening,"•The global recovery time of leaf area index (LAI) post-fire was mapped. •Forest canopy recovery is slightly faster than low-density vegetation. •The global land shows a cooling effect of −0.04 K/d during post-fire greening. •The recovery of ecosystem primary productivity may lag behind that of the LAI. •The cooling effect of productivity recovery is weaker than that of LAI. 
 Wildfires and greening are two important biophysical processes that influence land surface-climate feedback patterns. However, the impact of post-fire greening, which primarily reflects canopy structural recovery, on land surface temperature (LST) remains uncertain, particularly at the daily scale, as this temporal resolution allows for a clearer observation of how fire seasonality and vegetation regrowth influence short-term land surface energy dynamics. In this research, using satellite sensor observations covering the globe from 2004 to 2019, we found that the median post-fire recovery time of leaf area index (LAI) was 479.5 days. Most forests exhibited faster canopy LAI recovery than low-stature herbaceous vegetation, likely due to differences in burn severity and affected plant structures. Fire seasonality also shaped LAI recovery patterns: dry-season and spring fires led to quicker regrowth, with the shortest recovery in temperate spring fires (173.7 days), while wet-season and summer fires showed delayed recovery, especially in cold zones where summer fires need 425.5 days to recovery. During post-fire greening, the annual cycle of LAI recovery caused an average cooling effect of −0.04 K d-1, due to the strong evapotranspiration-climate negative feedback. However, seasonal effects varied: summer fires in temperate and cold zones led to cooling, with the strongest warming observed after temperate winter fires (up to 0.104 K d⁻1). Furthermore, we observed a widespread decrease in carbon use efficiency during post-fire LAI recovery, which means that the recovery rate of ecosystem carbon sinks may not be synchronized with the rate of vegetation greening. By distinguishing between structural and functional recovery, we found that early evapotranspiration-driven cooling during structural recovery may not persist throughout ecosystem functional recovery. This study enhances our understanding of the global biophysical climate effects of post-fire greening in the context of the earth’s land surface-climate feedback, and reveals precise changes in the component parts of this feedback effect."

 The timely and accurate delineation of wildfire-affected regions is critical for effective post-disaster management, strategic planning, and operational response. This paper introduces CA-BAFormer, a connectivity-aware Transformer-based model designed for burned area mapping using uni-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 20-meter spatial resolution. Unlike conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, the proposed uni-temporal framework reduces commission errors arising from spatiotemporal heterogeneity in landscape features, while effectively capturing intrinsic burn scar dynamics. To enhance the detection of contiguous burn scars, the model incorporates a semantic connectivity-aware learning (SCL) scheme. This scheme leverages connected components from semantic labels to guide feature extraction and improve segmentation completeness by explicitly modeling the geometric continuity of fire progression through connectivity-constrained learning. By integrating object-contextual representations with Transformer mechanisms, CA-BAFormer demonstrates superior precision in delineating compact burn scars. Quantitative evaluation across 58 major Canadian wildfires shows that the model achieves 82.04% IoU for burned area segmentation, surpassing the uni-temporal UNet baseline (75.83%) and approaching the 82.60% benchmark established by bi-temporal UNet. Notably, this single-image solution provides an automated, high-fidelity, and bias-mitigated capability for large-scale mapping, making it particularly suitable for integration into next-generation Earth observation platforms with constrained onboard processing resources."

 Photovoltaic (PV) energy is critical to the transition towards a net-zero economy and plays a vital role in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly regarding affordable clean energy (SDG 7) and climate action (SDG 13). Timely and accurate acquisition of the spatial distribution of PV installations is critical for regional energy planning, capacity estimation, and policy adjustment. However, accurately detecting PV installations remains challenging due to their environmental complexity and structural diversity. Through multi-platform spectral analysis (including Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and GF-2 imagery), this study identifies distinctive spectral reflectance properties of PV materials, characterized by a prominent peak in the 400–500 nm range and significantly lower reflectance in the visible to near-infrared spectrum compared to natural landscapes, while exhibiting higher reflectance than water bodies. Leveraging physics-based spectral signatures that remain consistent across diverse geographical settings, we introduce the Spectral Ratio-Normalized Difference Solar Photovoltaic Panel Index (SPPI), a universal approach for efficient PV detection using optical satellite imagery. Quantitative validation across multiple regions (urban, rural, and mountainous environments) demonstrates that SPPI achieves exceptional performance with 94.34% overall accuracy and a robust Kappa coefficient of 0.778, outperforming existing index-based methodologies while producing results comparable to more computationally intensive deep learning approaches. The SPPI methodology’s distinctive advantage lies in its ability to generate precise PV polygon boundaries while maintaining computational efficiency, enabling rapid large-scale mapping without specialized hardware requirements. While installation variations and extreme viewing angles may affect performance, the physics-based nature of the index ensures consistent results under normal imaging conditions. This universal, computationally efficient approach facilitates effective PV installation monitoring and energy capacity estimation, enhancing renewable energy analytics for carbon neutrality initiatives."

 Exposure to metal-laden dust from the shrinking Great Salt Lake (GSL) has become a public health concern in northern Utah. Here, we present the first integrated assessment of both direct and indirect exposure pathways by evaluating metal(loid) bioaccessibility in GSL dust under environmental and physiological conditions and by conducting a greenhouse experiment to quantify metal(loid) transfer from GSL dust to food crops. Among the USEPA Priority Pollutants measured, Zn (103.5 ppm), Cu (75.3 ppm), and Pb (55.9 ppm) exhibited the highest total concentrations in GSL dust, while Tl, Cd, and Se showed the greatest potential to be mobilized from GSL dust into soils or surface waters. Simulated gastric extractions indicated high bioaccessibility of Cd, Pb, and As, and risk assessment revealed that As drives non-carcinogenic health risks associated with oral ingestion of GSL dust, with higher risks for children than adults. Beyond the Priority Pollutant list, nearly 100% of Na in GSL dust was environmentally soluble, with implications for soil, water, and plant health. Our greenhouse experiment further showed accumulation of Li, Be, Na, As, Sr, Sb, and U in cabbage leaves exposed to GSL dust. Together, these findings demonstrate that GSL dust poses coupled risks through direct ingestion and indirect dietary exposure pathways, requiring regional dust risk assessments to integrate particle size, element-specific behavior, and population vulnerability to fully capture exposure and risk."

 The air quality regulation policies in developing countries rely on Particulate mass concentration (PMC) measurements, mainly PM2.5 which might not effectively address and control the Ultrafine Particles (UFPs). This review paper integrates the misleading concept of mass based measurement of particles which indeed is not reflecting the real scenario of public health protection. There can be significantly numerous UFPs than PM2.5 particles with the same mass. Recent scientific studies indicate that exposure to UFPs smaller than 100 nm can have severe health consequences in human beings. These particles are released into the atmosphere and once inhaled can penetrate deep into the lung alveoli, where they deposit and transport genotoxic compounds to various internal organs causing cellular senescence potentially leading to life-threatening conditions making Particle Number concentration (PNC) of UFPs a better indicator of adverse health effects. While a robust particle number (PN) regulations including Euro 7 standards and Particle Number Periodic Technical Inspection (PN-PTI) exists in the European Union, the introduction of on-road PN testing to detect and control high emitting vehicles as part of PTI in India, initially planned for 2023 remains unaddressed. The goal is to help the Indian government recognize the critical importance of implementing a more comprehensive national air quality framework that incorporates PNC alongside PMC and invest in affordable, standardized instrumentation and low cost sensor networks to monitor UFPs and identify the true contributors to rising air pollution, and take decisive legal action for safeguarding public health which paves a clear path forward, guaranteeing its citizen cleaner air."

 Sea fog is a pervasive maritime hazard, responsible for the majority of low-visibility-related transportation accidents. Accurate detection over vast oceans remains challenging due to observational sparsity and the spectral ambiguity between fog and low clouds in passive satellite data. To overcome this, we present a novel, physically constrained machine-learning framework that synergizes active lidar, geostationary imagery, and surface observations for robust sea-fog detection. Our approach first establishes a high-fidelity dataset by deriving accurate fog labels from CALIOP lidar profiles, guided by marine boundary-layer thermodynamics from reanalysis. Validation demonstrates expectational performance, with the mode achieving an overall Probability of Detection (POD) of 92.9%. These labels then train a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model using multi-spectral infrared data from the FY-4 A geostationary satellite. A final post-processing step, incorporating ICOADS surface reports, further refines spatial coherence. This elevates the seasonal POD above 88%, reaching over 99% in summer, while maintain a corresponding Probability of False Detection (POFD) of approximately 12%. This study validates the power of integrating active and passive satellite sensing through machine learning, offering a scalable and effective solution for real-time maritime visibility monitoring and early warning."
