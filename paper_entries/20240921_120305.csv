10.1088/1748-9326/ad7613,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注德国县级主要农作物产量波动与作物多样性之间的关系。研究使用1977年至2018年的标准化产量数据，分析了小麦、大麦、玉米和油菜等主要作物在县级层面的产量波动和香农均匀度指数（SEI）之间的关系。研究结果表明，在过去几十年中，德国的产量波动与SEI之间存在微弱的负相关关系。优化作物面积比例可以将产量方差平均降低24%，但会导致大多数县的SEI下降。这与个别物种（如大麦和小麦）的稳定性在降低组合产量波动方面比作物间年度产量的不同步变化更有效有关。该研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Hella Ellen Ahrends;Hans-Peter Piepho;Michael Sommer;Frank Ewert;Heidi Webber,Is the volatility of yields for major crops grown in Germany related to spatial diversification at county level?,"Recent evidence suggests a stabilizing effect of crop diversity on agricultural production. However, different methods are used for assessing these effects and there is little systematic quantitative evidence on diversification benefits. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between volatility of combined crop yields (denoted as standard deviation) and diversity (denoted as Shannon’s Evenness Index SEI) for standardized yield data of major crop species grown in Germany between 1977 and 2018 (winter wheat, winter barley, silage maize and winter rapeseed) at the county level. Portfolio theory was used to estimate the optimal crop area share for minimizing yield volatility. On average, results indicated a weak negative relationship between volatility and the SEI during the past decades for the case of Germany. Optimizing crop area shares for minimizing volatility reduced yield variance on average by 24% but was associated with a decrease in SEI for most counties. This was related to the finding that the stability of individual species, i.e., barley and wheat, was more effective in reducing the volatility of combined yields than the asynchronous variation in annual yields among crops. Future studies might include an increased number of crop species and consider temporal diversification effects for a more realistic assessment of the relation between yield volatility and crop diversity and test the relationship in other regions and production conditions."

This study evaluates the changes in drought-induced crop yield loss risk for six crops (alfalfa, barley, corn, soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat) between 1971–2000 and 1991–2020 across the contiguous US. Using a copula-based probabilistic framework, our results reveal a spatially heterogeneous change in yield risk to meteorological droughts, which varies with crop types. Regional analyses identify the largest temporal decline in yield risk in the Southeast and Upper Midwest, while the Northwest and South show an increase in risk. Among the considered anthropogenic and climatic drivers of crop productivity, changes in climatic variables such as high temperatures (e.g., killing degree days), vapor pressure deficit and precipitation show significantly stronger associations with changes in yield risk than irrigated area and nitrogen fertilizer application. Among the counties that observe drier drought events, only 55% exhibit an increase in crop yield loss risk due to drier droughts. The rest 45% show a decrease in yield loss risk due to mediation of favorable climatic and anthropogenic factors. Alarmingly, more than half (for barley and spring wheat), and one-third (for alfalfa, corn, soybean and winter wheat) of that the risk increasing regions have outsized influence on destabilizing national crop production. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, agricultural stakeholders, and decision-makers in terms of the potential ways and locations to be prioritized for enhancing local and national agricultural resilience and ensuring food security."

One region of concern is the Midwestern United States, whose agricultural productivity depends on subsurface pipes known as tile drains to improve trafficability and soil conditions for crop growth. Tile drains accomplish this by rapidly transporting surplus soil moisture and shallow groundwater from fields, resulting in reduced watershed storage. However, no work has previously examined the connection between tile drainage and streamflow drought. Here, we pose the question: does the extent of watershed-level tile drainage lead to an increased susceptibly and magnitude of streamflow droughts? To answer this, we use daily streamflow data for 122 watersheds throughout the Midwestern United States to quantify streamflow drought duration, frequency, and intensity. Using spatial multiple regression models, we find that agricultural tile drainage generates statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in streamflow drought duration and intensity while significantly reducing drought frequency. The magnitude of the effect of tile drainage on streamflow drought characteristics is similar to that of water table depth and precipitation seasonality, both of which are known to influence streamflow droughts. Furthermore, projected changes in regional precipitation characteristics will likely drive the installation of additional tile drainage. We find that for each 10% increase in tile-drained watershed area, streamflow drought duration and intensity increase by 0.03 d and 12%, respectively, while frequency decreases by 0.10 events/year. Such increases in tile drainage may lead to more severe streamflow droughts and have a detrimental effect on the socio-environmental usage of streams throughout the Midwest."

Drying, i.e. severe reduction in water flow even leading to streambed desiccation, can have a profound impact on the available aquatic habitat, biodiversity, and functions of rivers. Yet, to date, it is unclear whether similar drying events in comparable climate zones result in similar changes in ecosystem processes, such as river metabolism or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we synthesise the detected effects of drying on gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), as well as on the emissions of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) in rivers and streams. We examined the current available scientific literature detailing the impact of drying on these variables when measured either in the field or in the laboratory. We extracted data from 30 studies analysing GPP and ER responses, and data on GHG emissions from another 35 studies. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether the magnitude and direction of the effects varied across the systems and climate zones studied, or according to the type (natural or human-induced) and severity of drying. In general, drying enhanced GPP (under low flows) and CH4 emissions, and decreased CO2 and N2O emissions. The hydrological phases throughout streambed drying (low water flow, isolated pools, or desiccation) had differential effects on metabolism and GHG emissions. The effects of drying were generally more severe when it induced desiccation, rather than just periods of low flow. Desiccation strongly reduced GPP, likely because of the die-off of algae, while its negative effect on ER was smaller. Greater decrease in GPP than in ER under desiccation would lead to increase in CO2 emissions; our results showed accordingly that desiccation increased CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of the effects varied depending on the study type. Experimental studies conducted in micro- and mesocosms demonstrated greater effects than field studies, thus the extrapolation of results from these to real conditions should be done with caution. Overall, the effects’ direction was inconsistent across climate zones, except for the Mediterranean climate zone, where drying was showing a negative effect on both metabolism and GHG emissions. Our synthesis may contribute to identifying the worldwide trends and patterns of drying on riverine functions associated to global change impacts on river and stream ecosystems."

Engaging and collaborating with communities through the design process enables wider community acceptance and ownership of WASH interventions, ensures a more functional and impactful design, and opens the door for co-benefits of these systems. Accounting for a range of dimensions within a community is critical to creating WASH designs that provide the most benefits. Undergraduate engineering curriculums focus on design, but often do not explicitly account for the social, environmental, and economic elements that affect the success, efficacy, and sustainability of a design. There is increasing emphasis on educating engineers on sustainability and systems thinking so they are equipped to solve complex, multidisciplinary problems. To understand how social, environmental, and economic elements fit into engineering design and how to create sustainable WASH interventions, undergraduate engineering students benefit from participating in WASH design projects that engage and collaborate with communities. This perspective highlights the value of community engagement with partners in Uganda in teaching water resources and environmental engineering design to undergraduate civil engineering students."

However, the atmospheric transport in ATMs is usually simplified and spatiotemporally averaged, leading to systematic biases in simulating the atmospheric CO2 and estimating surface CO2 fluxes. We show that forward simulations of global CO2 using an ATM, GEOS-Chem, at a native resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° and a coarse resolution of 4° × 5° differ significantly near the surface in the Northern Hemisphere and the polar vortex, mainly because of advection in GEOS-Chem. Comparing observing system simulation experiments that assimilate synthetic observations sampled from the forward simulations, we separate the impact of coarse-resolution GEOS-Chem on regional flux estimates. The results suggest that a significant amount of annual carbon uptake from the ocean and tropics is improperly redistributed to the land and northern and southern extratropics, respectively. In addition, these errors lead to an underestimated seasonal amplitude in the northern extratropical land and a reversed sign of the seasonal cycle in the northern extratropical ocean. The reversed sign of the seasonal cycle has also been observed in a real data assimilation experiment and several state-of-the-art inversions, suggesting that reasonable ocean flux estimates depend strongly on the accuracy of the ATM."

However, the increased frequency and extent of wildfires, coupled with unprecedented hot weather, have introduced greater uncertainties in the post-fire permafrost dynamics. We need to address emerging questions, e.g. How will permafrost respond to the joint effect of hot anomalies and wildfires? To what extent will post-wildfire deformation evolve? How will permafrost resilience to wildfires vary? Utilizing interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series analysis, we investigated the post-wildfire ground deformation around a 2019 fire scar in the lower Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, where dramatic heat anomalies and severe wildfires have been recorded in recent years. The resilience of permafrost to wildfires appears to be weakened by the continuous and rapid warming after the fire, as evidenced by the year-on-year acceleration in subsidence rates. Such acceleration was never reported by previous findings that typically observed deceleration in subsidence rates four to five years after wildfires. The deformation along the line of sight (LOS) of the satellite demonstrates significant permafrost degradation induced by wildfires and exacerbated by climate warming, and the cumulative subsidence was detected up to 25 cm in the LOS direction in the upland areas and up to 10 cm in the lowland areas four years after the fire. The difference in deformation magnitude could be attributed to local factors, including ground ice, topography, and vegetation. Our study highlights the increasingly severe threat to circum-arctic permafrost due to the combined effects of wildfires and extreme heat anomalies."

However, the consistency and origins of such climate patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific regions is currently under debate. Here, we propose a probabilistic explanation for episodic ecological events based on the likelihood of multiple climate patterns converging in a particular phase combination. To illustrate, we apply this model to continental scale facultative migration of seed-eating finches out of the boreal forest. This irruption phenomenon is triggered by seed crop failures stemming from two weakly correlated climate patterns occurring simultaneously in their positive phases—the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO). The joint probability of NAO and NPO both being positive (above upper tercile) is about , illustrating a simple probabilistic explanation for quasi-decadal finch irruption and potentially other episodic ecological events in regions affected by multiple climate modes."

However, the extent to which these positive effects counteract the negative effects of heightened aridity on vegetation productivity remains uncertain. Here, we used space-for-time substitution to assess the responses of 15 ecosystem variables to aridity in China’s drylands and predicted vegetation productivity under future aridity, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and CO2. The results showed that vegetation productivity decreased abruptly as aridity (1-precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) increased to the threshold of 0.7, which corresponds to the vegetation decline stage in the dryland ecosystem’s response to increasing aridity. Future projections suggest that 12.8% of China’s drylands will cross aridity thresholds (0.7, 0.8, and 0.95) by 2100, in which vegetation productivity will significantly increase by 40.0%. Elevated CO2 will stimulate vegetation growth, but continuously rising temperature and CO2 by 2100 will have adverse effects, particularly in regions with limited nitrogen and water. This study suggests that effective adaptation and mitigation actions should be developed for regions crossing aridity thresholds, to ensure that drylands maintain the capacity to provide essential ecosystem services required to support the increasing population."

CLSM provides insights into physical attributes like particle size and surface topography, enhancing our understanding of ice nucleation.

Therefore, in artificial weather modification operations, parameters such as the height, thickness, and operating temperature of the target cloud can be obtained through detection. These parameters can be used to automatically calculate the appropriate sowing time, sowing height, and sowing dosage to improve the accuracy of artificial catalytic cloud operations. 
 Current weather modification rockets with a single operation mode, limited operating height, and fixed and uncontrollable operating time cannot achieve seeding in different layers, stages, and quantities for different cloud systems. Therefore, a temporally controllable weather modification rocket with spatial seeding capability is developed in this study. This new rocket features an electronic fuse-controlled intelligent ignition system, with eight channels of ignition tube outputs. Additionally, carrier wave communication technology is incorporated to set the seeding time for eight sets of ignition tubes. The temporally controllable rocket is capable of initiating seeding within 2–26 s and can conduct operations for layering, arbitrary altitude, and fractional-dose seeding within the altitude range of 500–5500 m (at a launch angle of 70°), which is calculated based on the flight trajectory of rockets. The minimum time interval of the rocket for seeding can be set to 0.1 s, and all 48 catalyst bullets loaded in a single rocket can be launched within 0.8 s. Thus, the rocket can achieve both concentrated and continuous seeding. Consequently, during weather modification operations, the parameters such as altitude, thickness, and operating temperature of target clouds can be obtained through detection, and they can be used to automatically calculate the suitable seeding time, seeding altitude, and seeding dose by the launch control system based on the flight trajectory of rockets to improve the accuracy and scientificity of cloud catalytic operations. Ground tests show that the reliabilities of the electric ignition tube output, new electronic fuse input and output, and electronic fuse output energy all meet the design specification.

Desert dust was found to be the main source of total Fe, contributing 65 and 81% annually to total Fe in coarse and fine particles, respectively; in contrast, dissolved aerosol Fe originated primarily from combustion, industrial, and secondary sources. The annual average contributions to dissolved Fe in coarse and fine particles were 68 and 47% for the secondary source and 32 and 33% for the combustion source, respectively. Aerosol Fe solubility was found to be highest in summer and lowest in spring, showing seasonal patterns similar to those of aerosol acidity.

Product analysis of aniline chlorination by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed several large-molecule DBPs, including chloroanilines, (chloro)hydroxyanilines, (chloro)benzoquinone imines, and ring-cleavage products. The product time profiles suggested that the reaction pathways include initial ring chlorination and hydroxylation, followed by the formation of benzoquinone imines that eventually led to ring cleavage. This work revealed the potential of aniline-related moieties in micropollutants as potent precursors to haloacetonitriles and other emerging large-molecule DBPs with the expected toxicity."

Trimethyl, triethyl, and tripropyl phosphates were readily absorbed and acropetally translocated, while tributyl, tripentyl, and trihexyl phosphates accumulated mainly in lateral roots. The acropetal translocation potential was negatively associated with log Kow values. Trimethyl and triethyl phosphates are less prone to biotransformation, while a total of 14 novel hydrolysis, hydroxylated, and conjugated metabolites were identified for other OPEs using nontarget analysis. The extent of hydroxylation decreases from tripropyl phosphate to trihexyl phosphate, but multiple hydroxylations occurred more frequently on longer chain OPEs. Further comparative toxicity test revealed that hydrolyzed and hydroxylated metabolites have stronger toxic effects on Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPK) than their parent OPEs. Dibutyl 3-hydroxybutyl phosphate particularly induces upregulation of CDPK in lateral roots of lettuce, probably associated with adenine reduction that may play an important role in the self-defense and detoxification processes. This study contributes to understanding the uptake and transformation behaviors of alkyl OPEs as well as their associations with a toxic effect on lettuce. This emphasizes the necessary evaluation of the environmental risk of the use of OPEs, particularly focusing on their hydroxylated metabolites."

Although the aging of BrC surrogates from biomass burning has been studied in many laboratory settings, BrC aging behavior in real-world urban environments is not well understood. In this study, through a combination of online dynamic monitoring and offline molecular characterization, the ambient optical aging of BrC was linked to its dynamic changes in molecular composition. Enhanced light absorption by BrC was consistently observed during the periods dominated by oxygenated biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), in contrast to periods dominated by primary emissions or secondary formation in aqueous-phase. This enhancement was linked to the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds during the ambient aging of BBOA. Detailed molecular characterization, alongside analysis of environmental parameters, revealed that an increased atmospheric oxidizing capacity, marked by elevated levels of ozone and nighttime NO3 radicals, facilitated the formation of nitrated aromatic BrC chromophores. These chromophores were primarily responsible for the enhanced light absorption during the ambient aging of BBOA. This study elucidates the nitration processes that enhance BrC light absorption for ambient BBOA, and highlights the crucial role of meteorological conditions. Furthermore, our findings shed light on the chemical and optical aging processes of biomass burning BrC in ambient air, offering insights into its environmental behavior and effects."

We demonstrate the application of this BI model to analyze measurements collected over one year (2021–2022) in Hong Kong. Diel variations in MAE370 nm of BrC reveal a darkening-to-bleaching transition occurring between 8 and 10 O’clock when the solar irradiance ranges from 30 to 400 W m–2. Furthermore, we consistently observe an increase in MAE370 nm of BrC with nitrogen oxide concentrations, suggesting the enhanced formation of nitrogenous organics.

Nitrate (NO3–), found in nearly all water bodies, can significantly impact the performance of 222 nm far-UVC-driven systems. This work was the first to investigate the effect of NO3– on sulfamethoxazole (SMX) photodegradation at 222 nm, finding that NO3– significantly enhances SMX degradation in different dissociated forms. Besides the hydroxyl radical (•OH), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) also played important roles in SMX degradation. With increasing NO3– concentration, the RNS contribution to SMX degradation decreased from 25.7 to 8.6% at pH 3 but increased from 1.5 to 24.7% at pH 7, since the deprotonated SMX with electron-rich groups reacted more easily with RNS. The transformation mechanisms of SMX involving isomerization, bond cleavage, hydroxylation, nitrosation, and nitration processes were proposed. 15N isotope labeling experiments showed that the RNS-induced nitrated products even became the major products of SMX in the 222 nm far-UVC/NO3– system at pH 7 and exhibited a higher toxicity than SMX itself. Further research is necessary to avoid or eliminate these toxic byproducts.

To explore the effects of biomass composition and fire conditions on ash Ca speciation, this study characterizes the speciation of Ca in charcoal and ash samples that were derived from different plant compartments and thermal conditions, using Ca K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy. Results showed that biomass contains abundant organic Ca complexes, which were mineralized into fairchildite and calcite after heating at 450 to 600 °C and then CaO, as temperature increased to 750 °C. Apatite could be an abundant Ca species in fire residues if the Ca/P molar ratio of the biomass is small (<2). The mineralization of organic Ca to the identified Ca minerals during burning was negligibly affected by the oxygen level. Calcium speciation in prescribed fire residues resembled that of biomass ash burned at 550 °C with similar Ca/P molar ratios. Batch experiments showed that macronutrients (Ca, Mg, K, and P) were differentially released, as a result of different solubility of minerals in ashes and reprecipitation of minerals. The aqueous solubility of Ca, Mg, and P decreased as pH increased from 5 to 9, while K showed no pH dependency and was almost completely soluble. Results from this study improve our understanding of the chemistry of fire residues and their geochemical behaviors, which can help evaluate the impact of fire on postfire soil properties and macronutrient cycling."

We observed patchy-distributed Zn and Cd hotspots in all soils, including at a native concentration in the nonspiked soil. With increasing Zn and Cd spikes, these metals preferentially colocated with Fe-dominated mineral phases, whereas with the highest spike, Zn and Cd increasingly colocated with clay minerals and soil organic matter. Soil extracts suggested that large proportions of spiked Zn and Cd were tightly bound to the colocated phases.

Here, we investigated the 2- to 6-hly dynamics of bacterial aerosols over a short period that spanned one instance of haze and one sandstorm. 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequencing was used to identify the total bacteria, and 16S rRNA (rRNA) sequencing was applied to characterize the actively metabolizing bacteria. The results revealed the highest bacterial diversity in sandstorm air and the lowest bacterial diversity in haze air, with markedly different community structures. Moreover,  substantial dissimilarity was detected between the communities of total bacteria and active bacteria within the sandstorm air, with less abundant bacteria dominating the active bacterial population. Selective pressure played a pivotal role in shaping the composition of active bacteria during sandstorms and the total bacterial community in hazy air, thereby enabling potential interactions between airborne microorganisms and chemical components. Additionally, functional prediction analysis suggested  increased pathogenicity in the active bacteria of sandstorm air.

Although there is only a weak slowdown for all intensifying WNP TCs, the average translation speed for RI TCs has significantly decelerated over the RI main development region (7.5°–25°N, 115°–160°E). This slowdown is primarily due to increasing RI probabilities for slower‐moving TCs. By contrast, the RI probability of faster‐moving TCs remains virtually unchanged. These differences in RI trend probabilities between slow‐moving and fast‐moving TCs are primarily linked to a deepening of the WNP mixed layer. TC‐induced sea surface temperature cooling tends to weaken when the mixed layer is deep. During the intensification stage, the deeper mixed layer is more critical for slower‐moving TCs than for faster‐moving TCs. Our findings suggest that RI probabilities for slow‐moving WNP TCs may continue to increase in a future warming climate."

It is found that the drift‐mirror mode is essentially a dissipative instability confined within the potential well due to the FLR effect. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the drift‐mirror mode originates from the coupling between shear Alfvén and mirror branch, where the ion‐sound wave component is negligible.

Both the Arctic and Antarctic SPV were strengthened when the supercontinent Pangea broke up. The increased asymmetry of midlatitude land‐sea contrast tended to weaken the upward propagation of wavenumber‐1 planetary waves, thereby strengthening the SPV.

Further, satellite‐retrieved column‐integrated absorption was dominated by surface absorption, which opens possibilities of using satellite measurements to model surface‐layer optical properties (limited to specific sites) at a higher spatial resolution.

While prior research has established the connection between ARs, orography, and precipitation, the specific mechanisms leading to intense rainfall remain unclear. A novel methodology is introduced that quantifies the relative contribution to the total precipitation from cyclone‐induced processes and orographic processes using modifications to the Met Office Unified Model orography and microphysics parameterization scheme. Results show that the majority (63%) $(63\%)$ of storm Bronagh 's rainfall over land is attributed to cyclone‐related processes (frontal ascent and embedded convection). However, interaction of the AR associated with storm Bronagh and orography focuses more of the rain over the hills, enhancing precipitation in this region by a further 50% $50\%$. Further analysis reveals that the seeder‐feeder mechanism plays a predominant role in orographically enhanced rainfall. Accretion and riming processes occur as rain from the cyclone induced (seeder) cloud falls through the orographically induced (feeder) cloud enhancing precipitation rates. The feeder cloud formation is related to forced ascent of air within the AR over the orography. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between ARs, orography, and cyclone precipitation during the landfall of extratropical cyclones. By separating the mechanisms behind heavy rainfall in the context of storm Bronagh, we quantify for the first time the effect of the seeder‐feeder effect at different heights over orography."

This study aims to fill this research gap by developing sectoral size‐resolved PN emissions for major species including sulfate, organic mass (OM), and black carbon (BC). The size‐resolved emission profiles derived from various measurements in the literature were integrated with a particle mass emission inventory (EI) for 13 major sectors in the Yangtze River Delta region of China as a case study. The particle number size distribution (PNSD) of emitted particles exhibited two distinct peaks: one at approximately 10 nm and the other in the range of 40–60 nm. The primary contributors to PN emissions in the region in 2017 were power plants, gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, and cooking sources. In terms of species, OM dominated PN emissions, followed by primary sulfate and then BC. A regional size‐resolved aerosol model employing the size‐resolved PN EI developed here (referred to as the BIN‐SPE experiment) provided reasonably accurate temporal variations of the total PN concentration and captured the PNSD within the size range of 10–300 nm. Uncertainty analysis of sectoral PN emissions across size ranges was carried out and the performance of the BIN‐SPE experiment was compared with those of three commonly used PN emission parameterizations.

Water content of organic aerosol (OA) particles has been estimated by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we discovered that the hysteresis phenomenon occurred to water content of glassy ultrafine OA particles, demonstrating that thermodynamically non‐equilibrium states need to be considered. Hygroscopic growth for monodisperse ultrafine particles (sucrose and glucose) was investigated for the temperature range from 252 to 296 K. Hysteresis was not observable at 296 K, consistent with literature data. However, hysteresis in water content was observed at sub‐273 K. The lowest relative humidity (RH), at which hygroscopic growth of particles did not depend on exposure history to water vapor, was defined as threshold RH. Threshold RH for 100 nm particles was approximately the same as the glass transition points when hysteresis clearly happened, demonstrating that water diffusion in a highly viscous matrix of organic aerosols was the key to the phenomenon. Employment of a kinetic multi‐layer model quantitatively predicted threshold RH as a function of temperature, exposure time, and the particle size. Considering the temperature and RH range of Earth's atmosphere, we hypothesize that hysteresis in water content for organic aerosols ubiquitously occurs in the upper troposphere, impacting chemical aging and cloud formation processes."

This study introduces the FRamework for Narrative Storylines and Impact Classification (FRNSIC; pronounced “forensic”): a scenario discovery framework that addresses these challenges by organizing and investigating consequential scenarios using hierarchical classification of diverse outcomes across actors, sectors, and scales, while also aiding in the selection of scenario storylines, based on system dynamics that drive consequential outcomes. We present an application of this framework to the Upper Colorado River Basin, focusing on decadal droughts and their water scarcity implications for the basin's diverse users and its obligations to downstream states through Lake Powell. We show how FRNSIC can explore alternative sets of impact metrics and drought dynamics and use them to identify drought scenario storylines, that can be used to inform future adaptation planning."

 The biological aspects of infancy within late Upper Palaeolithic populations and the role of southern refugia at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum are not yet fully understood. This study presents a multidisciplinary, high temporal resolution investigation of an Upper Palaeolithic infant from Grotta delle Mura (Apulia, southern Italy) combining palaeogenomics, dental palaeohistology, spatially-resolved geochemical analyses, direct radiocarbon dating, and traditional anthropological studies. The skeletal remains of the infant – Le Mura 1 – were directly dated to 17,320-16,910 cal BP. The results portray a biological history of the infant’s development, early life, health and death (estimated at ~72 weeks). They identify, several phenotypic traits and a potential congenital disease in the infant, the mother’s low mobility during gestation, and a high level of endogamy. Furthermore, the genomic data indicates an early spread of the Villabruna-like components along the Italian peninsula, confirming a population turnover around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, and highlighting a general reduction in genetic variability from northern to southern Italy. Overall, Le Mura 1 contributes to our better understanding of the early stages of life and the genetic puzzle in the Italian peninsula at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum.

 Ocean energy extraction is on the rise. While tides are the most predictable amongst marine renewable resources, turbulent and complex flows still challenge reliable tidal stream energy extraction and there is also uncertainty in how devices change the natural environment. To ensure the long-term integrity of emergent floating tidal turbine technologies, advances in field measurements are required to capture multiscale, real-world flow interactions. Here we use aerial drones and acoustic profiling transects to quantify the site- and scale-dependent complexities of actual turbulent flows around an idled, utility-scale floating tidal turbine (20 m rotor diameter, D). The combined spatial resolution of our baseline measurements is sufficiently high to quantify sheared, turbulent inflow conditions (reversed shear profiles, turbulence intensity >20%, and turbulence length scales > 0.4D). We also detect downstream velocity deficits (approaching 20% at 4D) and trace the far-wake propagation using acoustic backscattering techniques in excess of 30D. Addressing the energy-environment nexus, our oceanographic lens on flow characterisation will help to validate multiscale flow physics around offshore energy platforms that have thus far only been simulated.

 Determining the genetic architecture of Alzheimer’s disease pathologies can enhance mechanistic understanding and inform precision medicine strategies. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of cortical tau quantified by positron emission tomography in 3046 participants from 12 independent studies. The CYP1B1-RMDN2 locus is associated with tau deposition. The most significant signal is at rs2113389, explaining 4.3% of the variation in cortical tau, while APOE4 rs429358 accounts for 3.6%. rs2113389 is associated with higher tau and faster cognitive decline. Additive effects, but no interactions, are observed between rs2113389 and diagnosis, APOE4, and amyloid beta positivity. CYP1B1 expression is upregulated in AD. rs2113389 is associated with higher CYP1B1 expression and methylation levels. Mouse model studies provide additional functional evidence for a relationship between CYP1B1 and tau deposition but not amyloid beta. These results provide insight into the genetic basis of cerebral tau deposition and support novel pathways for therapeutic development in AD.

 Climate assessments have largely overlooked the radiative effect of anthropogenic coarse particulate matter (PMcoarse, with an aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 µm) in China. Despite its similar mass concentration to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), anthropogenic sources of PMcoarse in China have been much less studied and typically underrepresented in models. Here, we present a new model simulation for PMcoarse in China that incorporates various anthropogenic sources. The model successfully captures the magnitude and distribution of observed PMcoarse and recently available aerosol optical depth measurements at near-infrared wavelengths, which are substantially underestimated if anthropogenic PMcoarse is not included. We find that anthropogenic PMcoarse exerts a cooling effect of -0.11 Wm−2 (-0.03 to -0.42 Wm−2) in China by aerosol–radiation interaction, capable of completely offsetting the warming effect from black carbon by 2060 under Dynamic Projection model for Emissions in China (DPEC) 1.1 scenario. We conclude that the radiative effect due to anthropogenic PMcoarse will likely dampen the warming penalty caused by the emission reduction of other aerosols in China and should be incorporated into climate models."

 Determining causal relationships between environmental change and early animal evolution has been limited by our lack of a robust temporal framework for the Ediacaran Period (635-539 million years ago). Here we present six new radioisotopic age constraints from the Sultanate of Oman, which furnish a quantitative temporal framework for biogeochemical changes associated with animal radiation in the middle and late Ediacaran Period. In addition to constraining the duration of Earth’s largest negative carbon isotope excursion in its type locality, this temporal framework underpins a new understanding of Ediacaran sedimentation rates, a critical control on geochemical records and fossil preservation. Our new dates quantify early Ediacaran (prior to c. 574 million years ago) condensation in key sections across Gondwanan margins.

 The temporal stability of aboveground net primary productivity is generally regulated by plant community structure and species diversity. There are recurring debates on the mechanisms by which environmental changes impact productivity stability in semiarid steppes. Here we revealed that plant community structure, rather than species diversity, regulates productivity stability in a semiarid Steppe. We conducted a decade-long in situ warming and precipitation addition experiment in a semiarid steppe in Inner Mongolia, China, to monitor plant productivity, species asynchrony, species diversity, and stability. We found that Leymus chinensis productivity increased and the Shannon–Wiener decreased under warming conditions, while Stipa krylovii productivity decreased under precipitation addition. Warming reduced the stability of Stipa krylovii and the plant community stability, whereas it did not affect the stability of L. chinensis. These results deepen our understanding of the regulatory role played by community structure and species diversity regarding productivity stability in semiarid steppes.

 The existence and causes of the recently observed rainfall heterogeneity over monsoonal east Asia in historical periods remain unclear. Here we show that such rainfall heterogeneity has been present at least in the last millennium, with decadal to centennial precipitation variations over southeast Asia and north China being broadly synchronous, while central to southwest China’s variations are generally out-of-phase with those in southeast Asia and north China. We propose that the western Pacific subtropical high, which reduces decadal to centennial precipitation over central to southwest China due to its anticyclonic feature, could be responsible for the observed rainfall heterogeneity over subtropical East Asia. Further analyses suggest that intensified decadal to centennial solar activity can lead to enhanced and northward and westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high, resulting in tripolar rainfall heterogenous patterns over monsoonal East Asia.

 The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensors on the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite-R series (GOES-R) broaden the application of global vegetation monitoring due to their higher temporal (5–15 min) and appropriate spatial (0.5–1 km) resolution compared to previous geostationary and current polar-orbiting sensing systems. Notably, ABI Land Surface Phenology (LSP) quantification may be improved due to the greater availability of cloud-free observations as compared to those from legacy GOES satellite generations and from polar-orbiting sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Geostationary satellites sense a location with a fixed view geometry but changing solar geometry and consequently capture pronounced temporal reflectance variations over anisotropic surfaces. These reflectance variations can be reduced by application of a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model to adjust or predict the reflectance for a new solar geometry and a fixed view geometry. Empirical and semi-empirical BRDF models perform less effectively when used to predict reflectance acquired at angles not found in the observations used to parameterize the model, or acquired under hot-spot sensing conditions when the solar and viewing directions coincide. Consequently, using a fixed solar geometry or even the geometry at local solar noon may introduce errors due to diurnal and seasonal variations in the position of the sun and the incidence of hot-spot sensing conditions. In this paper, a new solar geometry definition based on a Constant Scattering Angle (CSA) criterion is presented that, as we demonstrate, reduces the impacts of solar geometry changes on reflectance and derived vegetation indices used for LSP quantification. The CSA criterion is used with the Ross-Thick-Li-Sparse (RTLS) BRDF model applied to North America ABI surface reflectance data acquired by GOES-16 (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020) and GOES-17 (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020) to normalize solar geometry BRDF effects and generate 3-day two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series. Compared to the local solar noon geometry, the CSA criterion is shown to reduce solar geometry reflectance and EVI2 time series artifacts. Further, comparison with contemporaneous VIIRS NBAR (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance) EVI2 time series is also presented to illustrate the efficacy of the CSA criterion. Finally, the CSA-adjusted EVI2 time series are shown to produce LSP results that agree well with PhenoCam-based observations, with no obvious systematic bias in onsets of vegetation maturity, senescence, and dormancy dates compared to about 10-day bias found with local solar noon adjusted EVI2 time series."

10.1016/j.jag.2024.104175,True,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文研究了利用欧洲航天局 (ESA) 气候变化倡议 (CCI) 开发的全球每日土壤湿度 (SM) 数据集来评估印度南部高原和丘陵 (SPH) 的农业干旱。论文比较了基于参数分布的标准化土壤湿度指数 (SSMI) 和基于非参数分布的经验标准化土壤湿度指数 (ESSMI) 的性能，并将其与标准化降水指数 (SPI) 和标准化降水蒸散指数 (SPEI) 进行比较。研究发现，基于 SM 的指数有效地捕捉了不同季节的干湿变化，并且 SSMI 比 ESSMI 更能捕捉到极端干旱区域。此外，论文还引入了动态阈值运行理论 (DTRT) 来识别和表征干旱事件，包括其持续时间、频率、强度和峰值。总体而言，该研究突出了 ESACCI SM 产品在表征农业干旱方面的有效性。,"['soil moisture', 'satellite observations', 'agricultural drought monitoring', 'remote sensing']",Hussain Palagiri;Manali Pal,"Parametric and non-parametric indices for agricultural drought assessment using ESACCI soil moisture data over the Southern Plateau and Hills, India","•Satellite soil moisture has a great potential for agricultural drought monitoring. •Parametric distribution-based index better captured the extreme droughts. •Dynamic Threshold Run Theory is proposed to identify drought events. •Areas facing frequent droughts in SPH also endure longer periods. 
 The European Space Agency (ESA) under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) has developed a multi-satellite global, daily Soil Moisture (SM) dataset that has paved the ways for agricultural drought studies. To evaluate the performance of this ESACCI SM, two SM-based indices i.e. parametric distribution-based Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI) and non-parametric distribution-based Empirical Standardized Soil Moisture Index (ESSMI) are computed to characterize agricultural drought in the Southern Plateau and Hills (SPH) in India from 1991 to 2020. SSMI and ESSMI are then compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The yearly temporal analysis revealed a consistent pattern among all the four indices with 2003 and 2020 marked as the driest and wettest years, respectively. On the other hand, monthly temporal analysis indicated SSMI and ESSMI lagged behind SPI and ESSMI suggesting a delayed response of SM to precipitation. Spatial distributions of indices showed that the SM-based indices effectively capture temporal variations of dryness or wetness across seasons. The near normal and mild to moderate droughts predominated (both spatially and temporally) the SPH and SSMI better captured the extreme drought areas compared to ESSMI. Further, Dynamic Threshold Run Theory (DTRT) is introduced to identify and characterize drought events based on their duration, frequency, intensity and peak. The findings revealed a resemblance in spatial distribution between the duration and frequency. The drought peak and intensity revealed a moderate nature of drought conditions. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of ESACCI SM product to characterize the agricultural droughts."
10.1016/j.jag.2024.104159,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文主要关注的是利用卫星遥感技术进行欧洲地区的作物类型识别，研究重点在于冬季作物类型识别和跨国作物分类。论文使用了ESA的Sentinel-2卫星数据，并结合欧盟的农业申报数据和分层作物农业分类体系（HCAT）进行分析。研究结果表明，深度学习模型能够有效识别欧洲大陆的主要冬季作物类型，HCAT在跨国作物分类方面也表现出良好的效果。整体而言，论文的重点在于利用遥感技术进行作物类型识别，而非大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['satellite', 'Sentinel-2', 'crop type mapping', 'land use']",David Gackstetter;Marco Körner;Kang Yu,Approaching holistic crop type mapping in Europe through winter vegetation classification and the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy,"•Feasibility to detect diverse range of winter vegetation types in continental Europe. •Low influence of winter months and snow even when considering only off-season. •Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy overcomes transnational barriers. •Revealing characteristics of winter crop type mapping and optimization potentials. •Advances towards spatially and temporally holistic crop type mapping in Europe. 
 The process of crop type mapping generates land use maps, which serve as critical tools for efficient evaluation of production factors and impacts of agricultural practice. Yet, despite the necessity for comprehensive solutions in space and time, the state of research still exhibits significant limitations in these two dimensions: (1) From a temporal perspective, the primary focus of past research in crop type mapping has been on the economically most meaningful, main-season crops, thereby largely neglecting the explicit study of off-season vegetation despite its pivotal roles in year-round management cycles. (2) Viewed spatially, study areas in crop type mapping show distinct limitations from a multi- and transnational standpoint, despite intense cross-regional and international interrelations of agricultural production and an increasing number of countries publishing crop reference data. With a focus on Europe, this research aims to tackle the two described shortcomings (a) by investigating to what extent a selection of major off-season, winter vegetation types in continental Europe can be classified and (b) by analyzing the transnational applicability of the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT) for remote sensing-based crop type mapping across the European Union (EU). This study uses ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite data, EU’s administrative farming declarations, and HCAT labels to analyze off-season farming measures, based on a study period from late summer to spring, in Austria, France, Germany, and Slovenia. We demonstrate that deep learning models effectively identify major productive and agroecogically significant winter vegetation in continental Europe. HCAT proves thereby valuable for transnational crop classification, excelling in mixed-country experiments and showing potential for transfer learning. This study’s findings provide a solid foundation for advancing transnational as well as winter and all-year crop type mapping, thereby serving as contribution towards temporally and spatially holistic research on agricultural practices’ sociocultural, economic, and environmental impacts."

 The coal chemical industry produces a large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the emission characteristics and associated impact on the environment and health of the residents are still unclear. This study determined the VOC concentrations and compositions in the Jinjie Coal Chemical Industry Park which is located in northern China. The average concentrations of total measured VOCs (TVOCs) in the industrial areas in summer and winter were 231.5 and 103.2 μg/m3, which were higher than those in the residential areas (123.7 and 70.3 μg/m3), respectively. Aromatics, Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), and alkanes were the dominant VOC classes in the industrial areas, while halocarbons, OVOCs, and alkenes had higher compositions in the residential areas where were not only affected by industrial emissions and also other anthropogenic sources. OVOCs contributed over 43% of ozone formation potential (OFP), while aromatics contributed over 61% of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the Park in both seasons. Using the source apportionment method, biogenic emission and anthropogenic source (gasoline production, coking emission, fuel combustion, solvent coating, and vehicle exhaust) were major contributors to VOCs in residential areas. The industrial-related emissions were the main components of anthropogenic source, accounting for 53.5%–58.7% of the overall VOCs. With reliable estimations of the health aspects, exposures to acrolein (HQ: 7.4–126.6) and formaldehyde (ILCR: 5.5 × 10−3-5.7 × 10−2) posed the highest non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, accounting for 94.3%–98.6% and 55.8%–93.8% of the total HQ and ILCR, respectively. The results demonstrated that substantial environmental and health co-benefits to the residents could be achieved by reducing the industrial emissions from gasoline production, coking process, and diesel-fueled vehicles in the Jinjie Coal Chemical Industry Park. Prioritizing the establishment of efficient air pollution measures and tightening industrial emission standards, especially for hazardous VOCs, are recommended according to the findings of the valuable work."

 India is suffering from severe particulate matter (PM, including PM2.5 and PM10) pollution, while limited ground observations are insufficient to support a comprehensive understanding of its health risks. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to improve the estimation of PM distribution and exposure efficiently. Regional transport as well as accumulation and dispersion processes of PM and its components, which have significant impacts on PM concentrations, are crucial when building ML models, especially for sparsely observed regions like India. Here, geographic and temporal-rolling weighting methods were used to separately extract regional and temporal features for improving the performance of the ML model. The incorporation of temporal and regional features into the ML model significantly improved ML model performance, with root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by 21 % and 19% for PM2.5 and PM10 estimation, as well as an improvement in model underestimation for the heavy pollution scenarios. The spatial-temporal model shows out-of-sample test CV coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.87 and 0.88 for hourly PM2.5 and PM10. The ML model predicts an annual nationwide concentration of 68.3 μg/m3 for PM2.5 with a north (high, especially in Indo-Gangetic Plain) to south (low) distribution, which is consistent with high satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) values. Boundary layer height is identified as the main meteorological factor influencing PM2.5 concentrations in winter. Characterizing the regional transport and cumulative dispersion processes of pollutants by extracting features can help in machine learning training, and this method can be further improved and applied to other studies."

 The particle number size distribution (PNSD) is crucial for evaluating air quality and mitigating environmental pollution, as particles of different sizes have diverse effects on human health and climate. However, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of PNSD is challenging due to its inherent complexities and variability. Multi-lognormal distribution models are employed to fit PNSD, as seen in climate models, but discrepancies between model fits and observed PNSD persist. This study adopts hourly data from 2017 to 2020 across eight monitoring sites in diverse environments—rural, urban, mountainous, and polar, and compares the observed PNDS with those simulated by multi-lognormal distribution models. The results demonstrated that the model generally achieved a high correlation with observed PNSD data (r2 > 0.75), effectively capturing key characteristics of nucleation and Aitken mode particles. However, the model had a tendency to overestimate the total number concentration by approximately 1.09 times, particularly noticeable under conditions of high concentrations of smaller particles. The model successfully represented prevalent bimodal size distribution patterns in urban areas with high ultrafine particle concentrations, though its performance was slightly less accurate in scenarios involving trimodal distributions. Despite these strong correlations and the model's ability to reflect diurnal and seasonal variations, which suggests its broad applicability and utility, there were notable limitations on smaller time scales and in specific particle size ranges. These limitations were particularly evident in capturing detailed phenomena relevant to new particle formation events, indicating areas where model refinement is necessary. The results highlighted the importance of investigating discrepancies between model predictions and actual observations, which is crucial for refining climate models that utilize PNDS. The uniform comparison facilitated a detailed exploration of particle properties from model results, offering deeper insights into aerosol behavior and its environmental impacts."

 The study explores Hurricane Michael's impact on Hurricane Leslie's trajectory predictability using ECMWF and NCEP ensemble systems. A clustering method focused on tropical cyclones is used to identify potential paths for Leslie: Cluster 1 accurately predicted Leslie's direction towards the Iberian Peninsula, whereas Clusters 2 and 3 indicated a southern recurve near the Canary Islands. Analysis of potential vorticity and irrotational wind at upper levels showed a significant interaction between Michael, ridge, and trough across the jet stream from +12 h after initialization. Cluster 1 showed a stronger Michael promoting upper-level wind divergence greatest, modifying the jet stream configuration around the ridge and downstream. Alterations in the jet stream's configuration, functioning as a waveguide, propagated downstream, guiding Leslie towards the Iberian Peninsula. Clusters 2 and 3 indicated the trough's failure to incorporate Leslie, resulting in a recurve of the trajectory around the Azores anticyclone. This research enhances comprehension of the interaction between two tropical cyclones via synoptic Rossby wave flow. Moreover, the conceptual framework can aid operational meteorologists in identifying the sources of uncertainty, particularly in track forecasts under synoptic conditions analogous to those examined in this study."

 This study addresses snow depth overestimation and temperature underestimation in the WRF/Noah-MP regional climate model by producing eight sensitivity simulations at a 10 km grid spacing for the 2001–2006 period, driven by the ERA5 reanalysis. The experiments differ either in the parameterization of snow-related processes within the Noah-MP land surface model, the physical parameterization schemes of the atmospheric model (planetary boundary layer, surface layer, microphysics), or the WRF model version (v4.2 or v4.3, with the latter incorporating snow-related code enhancements). The best-performing configuration is further tested by conducting a hindcast simulation spanning an extended climatological period (1985–2010). The study area includes parts of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, focusing on the Carpathian Basin. Snow depth is evaluated using in situ observations from low-elevation stations and ERA5 reanalysis data. Temperature and precipitation biases are assessed using the CARPATCLIM dataset, consisting of gridded surface meteorological observations. With the appropriate choice of physical parameterizations in the WRF/Noah-MP model, the median snow depth bias is reduced from 3.4 cm/day to 0.7 cm/day across all stations during the 2001–2006 period (November to March), with a corresponding decrease in RMSE from 8.4 to 3.9 cm/day and an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0.68 to 0.82. Concurrently, the underestimation of average daily minimum temperatures decreases from 2.5 °C to 1.6 °C over a plain subregion within the Carpathian Basin. Further efforts are required to eliminate the cold bias above snow cover in the WRF/Noah-MP model. The results suggest that exploring sensitivities to physical processes within the land surface scheme is equally important as testing different physical parameterizations in the atmospheric model itself."

 The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration(BTH) has successively witnessed the extraordinary precipitation extremes (PEs) with huge economic losses and death-toll in the recent decade. To timely and comprehensively understand the PEs in the urban agglomeration, we investigate the characteristic and mechanism of PEs variation based on six extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) including maximum daily precipitation(Rx1day), maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation(Rx5day), total precipitation with daily precipitation more than the 95th percentile (R95P), average daily precipitation on wet days (SDII), heavy precipitation days(R25) and very heavy precipitation days(R50). Our results suggest that the PEs of summertime over the BTH has significantly amplified since 21st century. During 2001–2023, the Rx1day, Rx5day, R95p, SDII, R25 and R50 significantly increased at a rate of 13.5 mm/10a, 26.3 mm/10a, 49.4 mm/10a, 2.2 mm/10a, 0.78d/10a and 0.46d/10a, respectively. The average contribution of urbanization to the increased EPIs is estimated by 21 %.

 Intensity of different precipitation types (convective, stratiform and shallow) and associated cloud vertical microphysical and radiative heating features are analyzed considering typhoon development, maturity, and decaying stages over the western North Pacific using the CloudSat Tropical Cyclone and China Meteorological Administration tropical cyclone best-track datasets from 2 June 2006 to 31 December 2015. At all three stages, the convective precipitation intensity, approximately twice that of stratiform precipitation, is the highest and peaks at development stage. The strongest stratiform precipitation occurs at typhoon maturity stage. Shallow precipitation is the weakest throughout the typhoon lifespan. Although the cloud microphysical parameters (radar reflectivity, cloud ice particle number concentration and effective radius) of both convective and stratiform precipitation tend to increase with precipitation intensity, convective precipitation contains more ice water of larger sizes in upper layers than stratiform precipitation. Unlike convective and stratiform precipitation, dominated by cold clouds, shallow precipitation is dominated by warm clouds with weak vertical contrast in the radiative distribution but strong radiation nearby 5 km. Our results show that cloud ice particle number concentration is important not only in precipitation intensity enhancement but also in determining the shortwave radiative heating center vertical location. More and larger ice particles in convective precipitation profiles result in stronger or comparable shortwave radiative heating than those in stratiform precipitation profiles, while the longwave radiative cooling rates in convective and stratiform precipitation profiles exhibit very similar features, likely attributable to similar infrared radiation levels due to comparable temperatures in these profiles."

Clark;Chengfei He;Lingfeng Wan;Jiuyou Lu;Chenguang Zhu;Lingwei Li;Shaoqing Zhang;Lijing Cheng,Enhanced ocean heat storage efficiency during the last deglaciation,"Proxy reconstructions suggest that increasing global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) during the last deglaciation was accompanied by a comparable or greater increase in global mean ocean temperature (GMOT), corresponding to a large heat storage efficiency (HSE; ∆GMOT/∆GMSST). An increased GMOT is commonly attributed to surface warming at sites of deepwater formation, but winter sea ice covered much of these source areas during the last deglaciation, which would imply an HSE much less than 1. Here, we use climate model simulations and proxy-based reconstructions of ocean temperature changes to show that an increased deglacial HSE is achieved by warming of intermediate-depth waters forced by mid-latitude surface warming in response to greenhouse gas and ice sheet forcing as well as by reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation associated with meltwater forcing. These results, which highlight the role of surface warming and oceanic circulation changes, have implications for our understanding of long-term ocean heat storage change."

While both the many-qubit frontier and the high-dimension frontier are well established, state-of-the-art quantum technology is becoming increasingly able to create and manipulate entangled states that simultaneously feature many particles and high dimension. Here, we investigate generic states that can be considered both genuinely high-dimensional and genuine multiparticle entangled. We consider a natural quantity that characterizes this key property. To detect it, we develop three different classes of criteria. These enable us both to probe the ultimate noise tolerance of this form of entanglement and to make detection schemes using sparse or even minimal measurement resources. The approach provides a simple way of benchmarking entanglement dimensionality in the multiparticle regime and general, platform-independent, detection methods that readily apply to experimental use."

The quantum metric can differentiate whether flat bands will result in correlated physics or are merely dangling bonds. A potential avenue for achieving correlated flat bands involves leveraging geometrical constraints within specific lattice structures, such as the kagome lattice; however, materials are often more complex. In these cases, quantum geometry becomes a powerful indicator of the nature of bands with small dispersions. We present a simple, soft-chemical processing route to access a flat band with an extended quantum metric below the Fermi level. By oxidizing Ni-kagome material Cs2Ni3S4to CsNi3S4, we see a two orders of magnitude drop in the room temperature resistance. However, CsNi3S4is still insulating, with no evidence of a phase transition. Using experimental data, density functional theory calculations, and symmetry analysis, our results suggest the emergence of a correlated insulating state of unknown origin."

RMPEAs containing group IV and V elements have a balance of properties including moderate ductility, low density, and the necessary formability. We find that oxidation of group IV-V RMPEAs induces hierarchical heterogeneities, ranging from nanoscale interstitial complexes to tertiary phases. This microstructural hierarchy considerably enhances hardness without indentation cracking, with values ranging between 12.1 and 22.6 GPa from the oxide-adjacent metal to the surface oxides, a 3.7 to 6.8× increase over the interstitial-free alloy. Our fundamental understanding of the oxygen influence on phase formation informs future alloy design to enhance oxidation resistance and obtain exceptional hardness while preserving plasticity."

In mice with colitis-related CRC, a notable enrichment of FnEVs was observed, leading to a significant increase in intratumor colonization byF. nucleatumand accelerated progression of CRC. The enrichment of FnEVs in clinical CRC tissues was demonstrated. Subsequently, we revealed that FnEVs undergo membrane fusion with CRC cells, leading to the transfer and retention of FomA on recipient cell surfaces. Given its ability to facilitateF. nucleatumautoaggregation through interaction with FN1441, the presence of FomA on CRC cell surfaces presents a target for bacterial adhesion.

Here, we show that the adaptation enzyme CheB methylesterase ofEscherichia coliassembles to the ON state receptor array after exposure to the repellentl-isoleucine and dissociates from the array after adaptation is complete. The duration of increased CheB localization and the time of highly clockwise-biased flagellar rotation were similar and depended on the strength of the stimulus. The increase in CheB at the receptor array and the decrease in cytoplasmic CheB were both ~100 molecules, which represents 15 to 20% of the total cellular content of CheB. We confirmed that the main binding site for CheB in the ON state array is the P2 domain of phosphorylated CheA, with a second minor site being the carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide of the serine chemoreceptor. Thus, we have been able to quantify the regulation of the signal output of the receptor array by the intracellular dynamics of an adaptation enzyme."

The conductive and stretchable sensing domain includes a micropatterned multiwall carbon nanotube and elastomer composite. The skin-like tactile interface effectively detects pressure-induced conductivity changes, offering superior spatiotemporal resolution with fewer interconnects (pixel/interconnects >57). This EIT-based tactile interface discerns external pressures to a submillimeter degree and vertical deformations of a few hundred micrometers. It sustains stable functions under external damage or environmental changes, confirming its suitability for persistent wearable use.

Instead, these SCCs were metabolically flexible and sustained growth through glutaminolysis, another metabolic process frequently implicated to fuel tumorigenesis in various cancers. Here, we focused on glutaminolysis and genetically blocked this process through glutaminase (GLS) deletion in SCC cells of origin. Genetic deletion of GLS had little effect on tumorigenesis due to the up-regulated lactate consumption and utilization for the TCA cycle, providing further evidence of metabolic flexibility. We went on to show that posttranscriptional regulation of nutrient transporters appears to mediate metabolic flexibility in this SCC model. To define the limits of this flexibility, we genetically blocked both glycolysis and glutaminolysis simultaneously and found the abrogation of both of these carbon utilization pathways was enough to prevent both papilloma and frank carcinoma."

Analyses of three sets of bcc HEAs comprising nine different compositions reveal that alloy chemistry profoundly influences screw dislocation core structure, dislocation vibrational properties, and intrinsic ductility parameters derived from unstable stacking fault and surface energies. Key features in the electronic structure are identified that correlate with these properties: the fraction of occupied bonding states and bimodality of the d-orbital density of states.

The transmembrane emp24 domain 9 (TMED9) cargo receptor promotes a general mechanism of cytotoxicity by entrapping misfolded protein cargos in the early secretory pathway. However, the molecular basis for this TMED9-mediated cargo retention remains elusive. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of TMED9, which reveal its unexpected self-oligomerization into octamers, dodecamers, and, by extension, even higher-order oligomers. The TMED9 oligomerization is driven by an intrinsic symmetry mismatch between the trimeric coiled coil domain and the tetrameric transmembrane domain. Using frameshifted Mucin 1 as an example of aggregated disease-related protein cargo, we implicate a mode of direct interaction with the TMED9 luminal Golgi-dynamics domain. The structures suggest and we confirm that TMED9 oligomerization favors the recruitment of coat protein I (COPI), but not COPII coatomers, facilitating retrograde transport and explaining the observed cargo entrapment.

Several studies indicated that selenium deficiency is associated with sarcopenia; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that selenoprotein W (SELENOW) containing selenium in the form of selenocysteine functioned in sarcopenia. SELENOW expression is up-regulated in dexamethasone (DEX)–induced muscle atrophy and age-related sarcopenia mouse models. Knockout (KO) of SELENOW profoundly aggravated the process of muscle mass loss in the two mouse models. Mechanistically,SELENOWKO suppressed the RAC1-mTOR cascade by the interaction between SELENOW and RAC1 and induced the imbalance of protein synthesis and degradation. Consistently, overexpression of SELENOW in vivo and in vitro alleviated the muscle and myotube atrophy induced by DEX.
