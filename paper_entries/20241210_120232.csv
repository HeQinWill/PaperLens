10.1088/1748-9326/ad97cf,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注加拿大火灾天气指数(FWI)在全球不同环境区域的应用和阈值设定。它通过分析大量的研究论文，探讨了FWI值与不同火险等级的关系，以及气象水文变量对FWI的影响。研究结果可以用于改进火灾危险预警系统，制定更有效的野火预防和管理策略。虽然研究中涉及到气象水文变量，例如相对湿度、干旱指数和蒸汽压差等，这些变量可以由大气环境遥感技术观测到，但这篇论文本身并非直接关注遥感技术及其应用。其重点在于FWI指数的应用和改进，而不是遥感技术的开发和应用。,[],Lucie Kudláčková;Lenka Bartošová;Rostislav Linda;Monika Bláhová;Markéta Poděbradská;Milan Fischer;Jan Balek;Zdeněk Žalud;Miroslav Trnka,Assessing fire danger classes and extreme thresholds of the Canadian Fire Weather Index across global environmental zones: a review,"Fire weather indices are one of the basic components of any fire danger early warning system. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) was developed to indicate the danger due to wildfires in boreal and temperate forests in Canada in the second half of the 20th century. Over time, the FWI has been adapted all over the world and is considered the most widely used fire weather index. This study provides a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of 750 research papers, generalizing the adoption of the FWI across 18 global environmental zones. The objective was to determine FWI values for various fire danger classes worldwide, from very low to extreme. The values of FWI and hydrometeorological variables were compared with wildfire occurrence. Key findings indicate that in drier and warmer climates, higher FWI values (around 50) correspond to high fire danger, whereas in cooler and moister climates, lower FWI values (around 25) signify extreme danger. The analysis of hydrometeorological variables reveals that relative humidity, aridity index, and vapor pressure deficit are significant factors influencing extreme minimum FWI, while average solar radiation has minimal impact. These insights have critical implications for developing effective wildfire prevention and management strategies tailored to specific environmental conditions. By establishing new fire danger classes reflective of regional meteorological and hydroclimatic characteristics, this study enhances the global applicability of the FWI. The ability to quickly adapt the FWI for fire danger forecasting in new areas is particularly beneficial for regions with previously low study coverage. The results underscore the importance of integrating regional climate variables into fire danger assessment frameworks to improve early warning systems and mitigate wildfire risks. The conclusions highlights the effectiveness of the FWI in diverse geographic contexts and its potential to enhance fire danger forecasting globally, thereby aiding in the prevention and management of wildfires."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad984a,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了一种利用前馈神经网络（FFNNs）改进火险参数化的方法。该方法利用气象变量（如相对湿度、降水量、温度和风速）来预测卫星观测到的火辐射功率（FRP），从而提高火险预警的精度。研究发现，与传统的火天气指数（FWI）相比，该方法在东亚、俄罗斯、美国东部、南美洲南部和非洲中部等地区显著提高了预测精度。这表明该方法可以有效地利用卫星遥感数据和气象数据来监测和预测火灾，属于大气环境遥感技术的应用范畴。,"['Fire radiative power', 'Satellite-derived fire intensity', 'Remote sensing', 'Meteorological variables', 'Atmospheric environmental monitoring', 'Wildfire']",Yoo-Geun Ham;Seung-Ho Nam;Geun-Hyeong Kang;Jin-Soo Kim,Regionally optimized fire parameterizations using feed-forward neural networks,"The fire weather index (FWI) is a widely used metric for fire danger based on meteorological observations. However, even though it simulates the nonlinear relationship between the meteorological observations and fire intensity, the ability of the FWI to accurately represent global satellite-derived fire intensity observations is limited due to its empirical formulation based on a specific region. In this study, we propose a regionally-fitted fire parameterization method using feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) to understand the nonlinear relationship between the meteorological variables and the fire intensity, which eventually improves the parameterization accuracy. These FFNNs for each grid point utilize daily-averaged meteorological variables (2 m relative humidity (RH2m), precipitation (PRCP), 2 m temperature, and wind speed) as inputs to estimate the satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) values. Applying the proposed FFNNs for fire parameterization during the 2001–2020 period revealed a marked enhancement in cross-validated skill compared to fire intensity estimation based on the FWI. This improvement was particularly notable across East Asia, Russia, the eastern US, southern South America, and central Africa. The sensitivity experiments demonstrated that the RH2m is the most critical variable in estimating the FRP. Conversely, the FWI-based estimations were primarily influenced by PRCP. The FFNNs accurately captured the observed nonlinear RH2m-FRP and PRCP-FRP relationship compared to that of the FWI-based estimations."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad984f,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了气候变化情景下全球降水极端事件的强度和季节变化趋势。利用九个全球气候模型和四个排放情景，分析了降水极端事件的强度和季节性如何共同变化。研究发现，随着排放量的增加，全球许多地区极端降水事件的强度预计会增加，而季节性的变化主要影响热带和亚热带地区。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为对全球降水的观测和分析需要依赖卫星遥感等技术来获取数据，并进行气候模式模拟。,"['precipitation extremes', 'climate change', 'climate models', 'global precipitation', 'satellite remote sensing', 'seasonal changes']",Dario Treppiedi;Gabriele Villarini;Jens Bender;Leonardo Valerio Noto,Precipitation extremes projected to increase and to occur in different times of the year,"There is high confidence that precipitation extremes are projected to become more frequent and severe and, to a lesser extent, that their seasonality may change. However, these precipitation characteristics are dealt with separately, without examining whether magnitude and seasonality are jointly projected to change. Here we assess how the seasonality and magnitude of precipitation extremes are jointly projected to change for different climate scenarios. We perform analyses at the global scale using nine global climate models and four different emission scenarios. We identify large areas of the globe where the magnitude of the extremes is expected to increase as the emissions increase; at the same time, large changes in the seasonality of these extremes are projected to impact regions mainly located in the tropical and sub-tropical areas. These changes could impact our response and mitigation efforts and our resilience against such phenomena in response to climate change."
10.5194/acp-24-13503-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文使用MECO(n)化学气候模型研究了2017年夏季欧洲污染地区臭氧的来源。它关注的是人为排放对对流层臭氧的贡献，特别是交通运输和非交通人为排放（工业、家庭和发电）对氮氧化物、一氧化碳和挥发性有机化合物的排放。研究使用了源解析方法，区分了10个不同的排放源和4个地理区域，重点分析了地面交通运输部门的贡献，并与地面测量数据进行了比较。虽然研究涉及空气质量和臭氧浓度，但它主要关注的是模型模拟和排放源的贡献，并没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，如卫星观测或空气质量监测传感器的数据。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的相关性较弱。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'air quality', 'ground-level ozone', 'nitrogen oxides', 'volatile organic compounds', 'emissions']",Markus Kilian;Volker Grewe;Patrick Jöckel;Astrid Kerkweg;Mariano Mertens;Andreas Zahn;Helmut Ziereis,Ozone source attribution in polluted European areas during summer 2017 as simulated with MECO(n),"Anthropogenic emissions are a major source of precursors of tropospheric ozone. As ozone formation is highly non-linear, we apply a global–regional chemistry–climate model with a source attribution method (tagging) to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic emissions to ozone. Our analysis shows that the contribution of European anthropogenic emissions largely increases during large ozone periods, indicating that emissions from these sectors drive ozone values. 
 Emissions of land transport and anthropogenic non-traffic emissions (e.g. industry, households and power generation) are significant sources of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These emissions are important precursors of tropospheric ozone and affect air quality.  The contribution of the emission sectors to ozone cannot be measured directly but can only be calculated using sophisticated  atmospheric chemistry models. For this study we apply the MECO(n) model system (MESSy-fied ECHAM and COSMO models nested n times) equipped with a source attribution method to investigate the contribution of various sources to ground-level ozone in Europe. Compared to previous source apportionment studies for Europe, for the first time we apply a combined NOx–VOC tagging implemented in an online nested global–regional chemistry–climate model to achieve a finer resolution over central Europe (12 km) but concurrently incorporating the effect of long-range transport. We distinguish 10 different source sectors and 4 geographical source regions, analysing especially the contribution from the land transport sector. Our analysis focuses on large ozone events during summer in four different regions, two major polluted regions (Po Valley and Benelux) and two more remote regions (Iberian Peninsula and Ireland). The analysis concentrates on results for summer 2017, during which  measurement campaign EMeRGe took place. Measurement data from this campaign are used for model evaluation. Our analysis shows that European land transport emissions contribute largely (42 % and 44 %, respectively) to ground-level NOy mixing ratios over Benelux and the Po Valley. Due to the overall lower ozone production efficiency over Benelux compared to the Po Valley, however, the contributions to ground-level ozone are larger in the Po Valley (12 %) compared to Benelux (8 %). In line with previous publications using different source apportionment methods, our results underline the large importance of long-range transport of ozone, especially from North America (Benelux, Ireland), but also from Africa (Iberian Peninsula), and provide additional information about the sectoral contribution not available before. Our analysis shows that the contributions of European emissions from land transport and anthropogenic non-traffic sectors strongly increase with increasing values of MDA8 (daily maximum 8 h average) ozone over the Po Valley and in the Benelux region. Accordingly, these two sectors drive large MDA8 values in these regions. Inter-comparisons of results for 2018 and with a coarser model resolution (50 instead of 12 km) show that these results are robust with respect to inter-annual variability and model resolution. Comparing our results with results from other source attribution methods we find that the contributions to ozone from individual sectors, which have large NOx but rather low VOC emissions, are estimated to be lower, if their emissions of NOx and VOCs are regarded concurrently."
10.5194/acp-24-13525-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了江西地区不同气溶胶模式对暖层状云微物理过程的影响。研究者利用WRF-SBM模式，通过修改气溶胶谱和浓度，模拟了2014年12月24日至25日的一次暖层状云过程。结果表明，气溶胶浓度和粒径分布的变化显著影响云滴谱，高浓度气溶胶促进云的形成并加宽云滴谱，低浓度气溶胶则抑制云的发展。不同类型的气溶胶对云滴谱的影响也不同，例如，积累模式气溶胶增加小云滴浓度，而成核模式和粗模态气溶胶则有利于较大云滴的形成。研究还发现，相对弥散度（ε）与体积加权半径（Rv）之间的相关性随着Rv的增加而发生变化，这与云滴碰撞-合并、凝结和激活过程有关。该研究利用卫星和飞机观测数据对模拟结果进行了验证，并探讨了气溶胶对云物理过程参数化和气候预测的影响，与大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['Aerosol concentration', 'Cloud droplet size distribution', 'Satellite observations', 'Warm stratiform clouds', 'Air quality', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Precipitation', 'Climate prediction', 'WRF model', 'Numerical simulation']",Yi Li;Xiaoli Liu;Hengjia Cai,"Numerical simulation of aerosol concentration effects on cloud droplet size spectrum evolutions of warm stratiform clouds in Jiangxi, China","The influence of different aerosol modes on cloud processes remains controversial. We modified the aerosol spectra and concentrations to simulate a warm stratiform cloud process in Jiangxi, China, using the WRF-SBM scheme. Research shows that different aerosol spectra have diverse effects on cloud droplet spectra, cloud development, and the correlation between dispersion (ε) and cloud physics quantities. Compared to cloud droplet concentration, ε is more sensitive to the volume radius. 
 Changes in aerosol amount and size distribution significantly impact cloud droplet size distribution, as aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs) and influence the relative dispersion (ε) of cloud droplet spectra. Relative dispersion plays a key role in parameterizing cloud processes in general circulation models (GCMs) and microphysical schemes, affecting precipitation estimates and climate predictions. However, the effects of varying aerosol modes on cloud microphysics remain debated, depending on thermodynamic conditions and cloud type. This study simulates a warm stratiform cloud in Jiangxi, China, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Spectra–Bin Microphysics scheme (SBM-FAST) from 18:00 on 24 December 2014 to 06:00 on 25 December 2014 (UTC). Satellite and aircraft observations were used to validate the simulation, showing good agreement in cloud structure. Sensitivity experiments were conducted by increasing nucleation, accumulation, and coarse-mode aerosols 5-fold and by reducing the total aerosol concentration to 1/5 of the control. Results show that higher aerosol concentrations enhance cloud formation and broaden droplet spectra, while lower concentrations suppress cloud development. Accumulation-mode aerosols increase small-droplet concentrations, while nucleation- and coarse-mode aerosols favor larger droplets. The correlation between ε and volume-weighted radius (Rv) shifts from positive to negative as Rv increases. This transition is driven by cloud droplet collision–coalescence, condensation, and activation. Increased accumulation-mode aerosol concentrations shift the ε–Rv correlation from negative to positive in the Rv range of 4.5–8 µm, while reduced aerosol concentrations strengthen the negative correlation. Regardless of different coalescence intensities, ε converges with the increase in number concentration of cloud droplets (Nc)."

These measurements coupled with coincident meteorological information provide a valuable data set needed to evaluate and improve model predictions of aerosols in a traditionally data-sparse region of South America. 
 Few field campaigns with extensive aerosol measurements have been conducted over continental areas in the Southern Hemisphere. To address this data gap and better understand the interactions of convective clouds and the surrounding environment, extensive in situ and remote sensing measurements were collected during the Cloud, Aerosol, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field campaign conducted between October 2018 and April 2019 over the Sierras de Córdoba range of central Argentina. This study describes measurements of aerosol number, size, composition, mixing state, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) collected on the ground and from a research aircraft during 7 weeks of the campaign. Large spatial and multiday variations in aerosol number, size, composition, and CCN were observed due to transport from upwind sources controlled by mesoscale to synoptic-scale meteorological conditions. Large vertical wind shears, back trajectories, single-particle measurements, and chemical transport model predictions indicate that different types of emissions and source regions, including biogenic emissions and biomass burning from the Amazon and anthropogenic emissions from Chile and eastern Argentina, contribute to aerosols observed during CACTI. Repeated aircraft measurements near the boundary layer top reveal strong spatial and temporal variations in CCN and demonstrate that understanding the complex co-variability of aerosol properties and clouds is critical to quantify the impact of aerosol–cloud interactions. In addition to quantifying aerosol properties in this data-sparse region, these measurements will be valuable to evaluate predictions over the midlatitudes of South America and improve parameterized aerosol processes in local, regional, and global models."

This comprehensive dataset, which includes time series of up to 70 years (median 46 years), enables advanced research on water flow and environmental trends and supports the development of hydrological models. 
 Comprehensive large-sample hydrological datasets, particularly the CAMELS datasets (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies), have advanced hydrological research and education in recent years. These datasets integrate extensive hydro-meteorological observations with landscape features, such as geology and land use, across numerous catchments within a national framework. They provide harmonised large-sample data for various purposes, such as assessing the impacts of climate change or testing hydrological models on a large number of catchments. Furthermore, these datasets are essential for the rapid progress of data-driven models in hydrology in recent years. Despite Germany's extensive hydro-meteorological measurement infrastructure, it has lacked a consistent, nationwide hydrological dataset, largely due to its decentralised management across different federal states. This fragmentation has hindered cross-state studies and made the preparation of hydrological data labour-intensive. The introduction of CAMELS-DE represents a step forward in bridging this gap. CAMELS-DE includes 1582 streamflow gauges with hydro-meteorological time series data covering up to 70 years (median length of 46 years and a minimum length of 10 years), from January 1951 to December 2020. It includes consistent catchment boundaries with areas ranging from 5 to 15 000 km2 along with detailed catchment attributes covering soil, land cover, hydrogeologic properties, and data on human influences. Furthermore, it includes a regionally trained long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a locally trained HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning) model that were used as quality control and that can be used to fill gaps in discharge data or act as baseline models for the development and testing of new hydrological models. Given the large number of catchments, including numerous relatively small ones (636 catchments < 100 km2), and the time series length of up to 70 years (166 catchments with 70 years of discharge data), CAMELS-DE is one of the most comprehensive national CAMELS datasets available and offers new opportunities for research, particularly in studying long-term trends and runoff formation in small catchments and in analysing catchments with strong human influences.

We used the MultiVI algorithm, which employs satellite images from various angles to enhance accuracy. Our method outperformed traditional statistical methods compared to field measurements, enabling precise large-scale mapping of vegetation cover for improved environmental monitoring and planning. 
 Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is an important vegetation structure factor for applications in agriculture, forestry, ecology, etc. Due to its simplicity, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based mixture model is widely used to estimate FVC from remotely sensed data. However, the accuracy and efficiency of FVC estimation require the precise calculation of two key parameters: the NDVI of fully covered vegetation and bare soil. Despite their importance, these two endmember NDVI values have not yet been produced as large-scale maps. Traditional statistical methods for obtaining endmember NDVI from satellite datasets highly rely on the assumption that a certain amount of pure pixels of vegetation and soil must be present, which is often invalid for many areas. This study generated 30 m resolution maps of endmember NDVI across China using the MultiVI algorithm incorporating multi-angle remote sensing data. The quality and accuracy of the endmember NDVI maps were evaluated using various validation data, including statistically obtained pure NDVI, soil spectra from a soil library, and field-measured FVC. The NDVI values for bare soil derived from the MultiVI algorithm were consistent with those obtained from the soil spectral library. Additionally, the FVC estimated using the MultiVI-derived endmember NDVI and the VI-based mixture model exhibited reasonable accuracy when compared to the field measurements. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for MultiVI FVC were below 0.13 in the Heihe, Hebei, and Three Gorges Reservoir regions of China. Furthermore, the MultiVI FVC outperformed those calculated using the statistical methods. The endmember NDVI maps provide a convenient and reliable source of key parameters for the accurate and rapid estimation of FVC at large scales.

Baek;Paul A. Ullrich;Bo Dong;Jiwoo Lee,Evaluating downscaled products with expected hydroclimatic co-variances,"We evaluate downscaled products by examining locally relevant co-variances during precipitation events. Common statistical downscaling techniques preserve expected co-variances during convective precipitation (a stationary phenomenon). However, they dampen future intensification of frontal precipitation (a non-stationary phenomenon) captured in global climate models and dynamical downscaling. Our study quantifies a ramification of the stationarity assumption underlying statistical downscaling. 
 There has been widespread adoption of downscaled products amongst practitioners and stakeholders to ascertain risk from climate hazards at the local scale (e.g., ∼ 5 km resolution). Such products must nevertheless be consistent with physical laws to be credible and of value to users. Here we evaluate statistically and dynamically downscaled products by examining local co-evolution of downscaled temperature and precipitation during convective and frontal precipitation events (two mechanisms testable with just temperature and precipitation). We find that two widely used statistical downscaling techniques (Localized Constructed Analogs version 2, LOCA2,  and Seasonal Trends and Analysis of Residuals Empirical Statistical Downscaling Model, STAR-ESDM) generally preserve expected co-variances during convective precipitation events over the historical and future projected intervals as compared to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and two observation-based data products (Livneh and nClimGrid-Daily). However, both techniques dampen future intensification of frontal precipitation that is otherwise robustly captured in global climate models (i.e., prior to downscaling) and with process-based dynamical downscaling across five different regional climate models. In the case of LOCA2, this leads to appreciable underestimation of future frontal precipitation event intensity. This study is one of the first to quantify a likely ramification of the stationarity assumption underlying statistical downscaling methods and identify a phenomenon where projections of future change diverge depending on data production method employed. Finally, our work proposes expected co-variances during convective and frontal precipitation as useful evaluation diagnostics that can be universally applied to a wide range of statistically downscaled products."

GEOCLIM is associated to a climate model, and a new procedure to link the climate model to GEOCLIM is presented here. GEOCLIM is applied here to investigate the evolution of ocean oxygenation following Earth's orbital parameter variations, around 94 million years ago. 
 The numerical model GEOCLIM, a coupled Earth system model for long-term biogeochemical cycle and climate, has been revised. This new version (v 7.0) allows a flexible discretization of the oceanic module, for any paleogeographic configuration, the coupling to any General Circulation Model (GCM), and the determination of all boundary conditions from the GCM coupled to GEOCLIM, notably, the oceanic water exchanges and the routing of land-to-ocean fluxes. These improvements make GEOCLIM7 a unique, powerful tool, devised as an extension of GCMs, to investigate the Earth system evolution at timescales, and with processes that could not be simulated otherwise. We present here a complete description of the model, whose current state gathers features that have been developed and published in several articles since its creation, and some that are original contributions of this article, like the seafloor sediment routing scheme, and the inclusion of orbital parameters. We also present a detailed description of the method to generate the boundary conditions of GEOCLIM, which is the main innovation of the present study. In a second step, we discuss the results of an experiment where GEOCLIM7 is applied to the Turonian paleogeography, with a 10 Myr orbital cycle forcings.

Striking a balance between a high CO2 adsorption capacity and long-term stability under practical conditions is crucial for effectively capturing CO2 from flue gas. In this study, a series of functionalized MFM-136 adsorbents were synthesized in which -NO2 and -NH2 groups were grafted onto the kagome lattice of MFM-136. Modifications with -NH2 groups were found to be highly effective for CO2 adsorption, specifically, the CO2 adsorption capacity peaked at 4.35 mmol/g for NH2(0.6)-MFM-136, representing a 55% enhancement more than MFM-136. Concurrently, the CO2/N2 selectivity for NH2(0.6)-MFM-136 was increased  1.57 times. Verification of novel adsorption sites introduced by NH2–H2L4 was conducted by using in situ DRIFT analysis and DFT calculations. It turns out that NH2–H2L4 modification can effectively mitigate the chemical deposition from the impurity gases and significantly improve the adsorbent’s hydrophobicity and its tolerance to impurity gases. Remarkably, the reduction in the CO2 absorption capacity for NH2(0.6)-MFM-136 was 34% less than that for MFM-136 after 24 h of exposure to simulated flue gas, making NH2(0.6)-MFM-136 a promising candidate for the potential application of stable and selective CO2 capture under industrial flue gas conditions."

A comprehensive multidimensional data set containing 1102 in vivo data points, 75 pulmonary toxicological biomarkers, and 20 features (covering in vitro effects, physicochemical properties, and exposure conditions) was constructed. An IVIVE approach that related effects at the cellular level to in vivo lung toxicity in rodent model was established with prediction accuracy reaching 89 and 80% in training and test sets. Experimental validation was conducted by testing chronic lung fibrosis of 8 new MeONPs in 32 independent mice, with prediction accuracy reaching 88%. The IVIVE model indicated that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in THP-1 cells could serve as an in vitro marker to predict lung toxicity. The IVIVE model showed great promise for minimizing unnecessary animal tests and understanding toxicological mechanisms."

Here, we quantified the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in gut microbiomes of soil collembolans (Folsomia candida) under pesticide stress (zinc thiazole, ZT) and analyzed the trophic transfer of ARGs to the microbiomes of predatory mites (Hypoaspis aculeifer), natural predators of collembolans. High throughput quantitative PCR was used to quantify ARGs, whereas gut microbiomes of collembolans and mites were characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and potential pathogens were identified. Our results revealed that ZT exposure significantly elevated the abundance of ARGs (e.g., AAC(6’)-Ir) in soil collembolan microbiomes. With the increase of ARGs in prey collembolan microbiomes, an increase of ARGs in predatory mite microbiomes was observed through trophic transfer. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) significantly contribute to the transmission of ARGs within this food chain. Additionally, co-occurrence analysis indicated a strong association between gut resistomes and pathogens, such as Brevundimonas diminuta, in the collembolans and predatory mites. Overall, our study provides evidence for the dissemination of ARGs through the collembolan-predatory mite food chain following pesticide exposure, which is important for  understanding the broader dynamics of antibiotic resistance spreading in soil ecosystems."

Our findings indicate substantial changes in the magnitude and partitioning of Antarctic freshwater discharge over the coming decades and centuries, particularly under very‐high warming scenarios, driven by the progressive collapse of the West Antarctic ice shelves.

 Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of

             when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of

Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or

 Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defense efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth1, including the more frequent2 megaton explosions from decameter impactors3−6. While large asteroids (≥100 km) have remained in the main belt since their formation7, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population8,9. However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution —which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies significantly among models10−14. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids (⪆ 10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the asteroids’ emission peaks15 and synthetic tracking techniques16−18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects’ distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ~ 100 m (debiased cumulative slopes of q = − 2.66 ± 0.60 and  − 0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than ~ 100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families —most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia— according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 “in-situ”."

Here, the authors provide evidence for an impaired vascular fibrous repair response involving transforming growth factor-ß2-regulated collagen synthesis and cell differentiation as central mechanisms. 
 Type 2 diabetes is associated with cardiovascular disease, possibly due to impaired vascular fibrous repair. Yet, the mechanisms are elusive. Here, we investigate alterations in the fibrous repair processes in type 2 diabetes atherosclerotic plaque extracellular matrix by combining multi-omics from the human Carotid Plaque Imaging Project cohort and functional studies. Plaques from type 2 diabetes patients have less collagen. Interestingly, lower levels of transforming growth factor-ß distinguish type 2 diabetes plaques and, in these patients, lower levels of fibrous repair markers are associated with cardiovascular events. Transforming growth factor-ß2 originates mostly from contractile vascular smooth muscle cells that interact with synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells in the cap, leading to collagen formation and vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation. This is regulated by free transforming growth factor-ß2 which is affected by hyperglycemia. Our findings underscore the importance of transforming growth factor-ß2-driven fibrous repair in type 2 diabetes as an area for future therapeutic strategies.

 Recent advances unveiled physical neural networks as promising machine learning platforms, offering faster and more energy-efficient information processing. Compared with extensively-studied optical neural networks, the development of mechanical neural networks remains nascent and faces significant challenges, including heavy computational demands and learning with approximate gradients. Here, we introduce the mechanical analogue of in situ backpropagation to enable highly efficient training of mechanical neural networks. We theoretically prove that the exact gradient can be obtained locally, enabling learning through the immediate vicinity, and we experimentally demonstrate this backpropagation to obtain gradient with high precision. With the gradient information, we showcase the successful training of networks in simulations for behavior learning and machine learning tasks, achieving high accuracy in experiments of regression and classification. Furthermore, we present the retrainability of networks involving task-switching and damage, demonstrating the resilience.

 The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is indispensable for viral RNA genome processing. Although the N-terminal domain (NTD) is suggested to mediate specific RNA-interactions, high-resolution structures with viral RNA are still lacking. Available hybrid structures of the NTD with ssRNA and dsRNA provide valuable insights; however, the precise mechanism of complex formation remains elusive. Similarly, the molecular impact of nucleocapsid NTD mutations that have emerged since 2019 has not yet been fully explored. Using crystallography and solution NMR, we investigate how NTD mutations influence structural integrity and RNA-binding. We find that both features rely on a core network of residues conserved in Betacoronaviruses, crucial for protein stability and communication among flexible loop-regions that facilitate RNA-recognition. Our comprehensive structural analysis demonstrates that contacts within this network guide selective RNA-interactions. We propose that the core network renders the NTD evolutionarily robust in stability and plasticity for its versatile RNA processing roles.

Here, the authors develop a platform for the generation of patient-derived B-cell lymphoma models (termed lymphomoids) which maintain the lymphoid tissue architecture, to enable drug screening. 
 The efficacy of anti-cancer therapies depends on the genomic composition of the tumor, its microenvironment, spatial organization, and intra-tumor heterogeneity. B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors emerging from B-cells at different stages of differentiation and exhibiting tumor-specific interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the effect of drug treatments can be influenced by the tumor composition and functional interactions among immune cells. Here, we develop a platform to maintain small fragments of human lymphoma tissue in culture for several days, and use them to test response to small molecules. We collect 27 patient samples representative of different lymphoma subtypes, and establish ex vivo tissue fragments that retain histological, cellular, and molecular characteristics of the original tissue, here referred to as lymphomoids. Using lymphomoids, we test sensitivity to several clinically approved drugs in parallel and examine tissue remodeling upon treatment. Moreover, when this information is available, we show that the effect of the inhibitors observed in lymphomoids is consistent with the patients’ response in the clinic. Thus, lymphomoids represent an innovative ex vivo model to assess the effect of anti-cancer therapies while preserving the tissue structure and its components.

 The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is crucial for the encoding and expression of fear memory, yet it remains unexplored how neural activity in this region is dynamically influenced by distributed circuits across the brain to facilitate expression of fear memory of different ages. Using longitudinal multisite electrophysiological recordings in male mice, we find that the recall of older contextual fear memory is accompanied by weaker, yet more rhythmic, BLA gamma activity which is distally entrained by theta oscillations in both the hippocampal CA1 and the anterior cingulate cortex. Computational modeling with Light Gradient Boosting Machine using extracted oscillatory features from these three regions, as well as with Transformer using raw local field potentials, accurately classified remote from recent memory recall primarily based on BLA gamma and CA1 theta. These results demonstrate in a non-biased manner that multi-regional control of BLA activity serves as reliable neural signatures for memory age-dependent recall mechanisms.

 The world faces multiple water crises, including overextraction, flooding, ecosystem degradation and inequitable safe water access. Insufficient funding and ineffective implementation impede progress in water access, while, in part, a misdiagnosis of the causes has prioritized some responses over others (for example, hard over soft infrastructure). We reframe the responses to mitigating the world’s water crises using a ‘beyond growth’ framing and compare it to mainstream thinking. Beyond growth is systems thinking that prioritizes the most disadvantaged.

 The vulnerability of US offshore wind energy to tropical cyclones is a pressing concern, particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, key areas for offshore wind energy development. Assessing the impact of projected climate change on tropical cyclones, and consequently on offshore wind resources, is thus critical for effective risk management. Herein, we investigate the evolving risk to offshore wind turbines posed by Atlantic tropical cyclones in a non-stationary climate using a synthetic tropical cyclone model. Integrated with climate model simulations, projections show widespread increases in tropical cyclone exposure, with historical 20-year storms occurring every  ~12.7 years on average, increasing in intensity by about 9.3 ms−1. Subsequent fragility analysis reveals that the probabilities of turbine yielding and buckling from a 20-year tropical cyclone could increase by about 37% and 13%, respectively, with regional increases reaching up to 51%. These findings carry substantial implications for the operation and future expansion of offshore wind farms.

 Optimizing hydropower generation from the Nile upstream mega-dams during prolonged droughts while minimizing the downstream water deficit is the cornerstone in resolving the ongoing major water conflict in the Eastern Nile River Basin. A decade of negotiation and mediation has been unsuccessful, mainly due to the hydraulic uncertainties associated with operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam during prolonged droughts. Based on the negotiation outcomes, we provide comprehensive assessments of the efficiency of multiple drought-mitigation policies for the impact of dam operation. Our results suggest it can generate almost optimal hydropower without a noticeable downstream deficit during wet, average, and temporary drought flow conditions. For prolonged drought, we identify an ideal operation policy allowing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam to generate a sustainable energy of 87% of its optimal hydropower without generating additional downstream water deficit. Furthermore, we provide four intermediate policies demonstrating enhanced upstream hydropower generation while minimizing dam-induced downstream water deficits. Our findings attempt to bridge the negotiation disparities in the Nile hydropower mega-dams operations during prolonged drought and foster an actionable and collaborative framework.

A latent class analysis identified three activism levels: Least (23%), Moderate (55%), and Most (22%). The Most Active participants were at least 75% likely to engage in 13 behaviours. The only demographic difference between classes is that participants in the Least Active class were younger. Across classes, the most common reported motivators related to issue importance and action efficacy. Reported barriers were more behaviour-specific, with frequent references to lack of experience and knowledge for financial activism and engagement with climate organisations. Six practical applications for promoting climate activism are discussed. Australians alarmed by climate change report the same motivators for their chosen behaviors, but barriers differ across behaviors and do not depend on the individual’s breadth of activity, according to an analysis that combines a survey of 519 individuals and a statistical approach."
10.1016/j.rse.2024.114546,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇论文提出了一种基于时间注意机制的多尺度生成对抗网络（TAMGAN）来重建MODIS数据的年度时间序列，以解决云污染和传感器故障导致的数据缺失问题。它关注的是地表反射率数据的重建，而不是大气成分的分析。该方法利用3D卷积神经网络和时间注意模块来捕捉地表反射率随时间的变化趋势，并通过多尺度特征提取和渐进式拼接来提高重建数据的精度。实验结果表明，TAMGAN在处理时间序列中大面积连续缺失区域方面优于现有方法，并在物候提取等下游应用中展现了其有效性。总的来说，该研究集中于改进遥感影像数据处理技术，提高地表参数提取的精度，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['Land surface phenology', 'MODIS', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Time series analysis', 'Cloud removal', 'Gap filling', 'Generative adversarial network (GAN)']",Yidan Wang;Wei Wu;Zhicheng Zhang;Ziming Li;Fan Zhang;Qinchuan Xin,A temporal attention-based multi-scale generative adversarial network to fill gaps in time series of MODIS data for land surface phenology extraction,"•A framework to reconstruct annual time series of MODIS products simultaneously. •Input original annual images and generate corresponding cloud-free annual images. •Superior accuracy compared to existing methods, especially in complex situation. •Use less predicting time and show the transferability and robustness. •Downstream application on phenology extraction. 
 High-quality and continuous satellite data are essential for land surface studies such as monitoring of land surface phenology, but factors such as cloud contamination and sensor malfunction degrade the quality of remote sensing images and limit their utilization. Filling gaps and recovering missing information in time series of remote sensing images are vital for a wide range of downstream applications, such as land surface phenology extraction. Most existing gap-filling and cloud removal methods focus on individual or multi-temporal image reconstruction, but struggle with continuous and overlapping missing areas in time series data. In this study, we propose a Temporal Attention-Based Multi-Scale Generative Adversarial Network (TAMGAN) to reconstruct time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. TAMGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a 3-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (3DCNN) in its generator to reconstruct the missing areas in the annual time series of remote sensing images simultaneously. The temporal attention blocks are designed to capture the changing trends of surface reflectance over time. And multi-scale feature extraction and progressive concatenation are introduced to enhance spectral consistency and provide detailed texture information. Experiments are carried out on MOD09A1 products to evaluate the performance of the proposed network. The results show that TAMGAN outperformed the comparison methods across various evaluation metrics, particularly in handling large and continuous missing areas in the time series. Furthermore, we showcase an example of downstream application by extracting phenological information from the gap-filled products. By effectively filling gaps and removing clouds, our method offers spatial-temporal continuous MODIS surface reflectance data, benefiting downstream applications such as phenology extraction and highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence technique in remote sense data processing."
