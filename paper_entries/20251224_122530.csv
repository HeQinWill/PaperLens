Despite their importance, prior assessments of their effectiveness have yielded inconsistent results. The objective of this study is to systematically assess the effectiveness of HPPs in reducing heat-related mortality risk across Europe. We analysed daily mortality and mean temperature data from 102 locations in 14 European countries between 1990 and 2019. Using data from national experts, we identified the year of HPP implementation and categorised their development class. A three-stage analysis was conducted: (1) quasi-Poisson time series models were used to estimate location-specific warm-season exposure-response functions in 3 year subperiods; (2) mixed-effect meta-regression models with multilevel longitudinal structures were employed to quantify changes in pooled exposure-response functions due to HPP implementation, adjusted for long-term trends in heat-related mortality risks; and (3) the heat-related excess mortality due to HPP was calculated by comparing factual (with HPP) and counterfactual (without HPP) scenarios. Estimates are reported by country, region, and HPP class. HPP implementation was associated with a 25.2% [95% CI: 19.8% to 31.9%] reduction in excess deaths attributable to extreme heat, corresponding to 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3–2.4] avoided deaths annually per 100 000 inhabitants. This equates to an estimated 14 551 [95% CI: 10 118–19 072] total deaths avoided across all study locations following HPP implementation. No significant differences in HPP effectiveness were observed by European region or HPP class. Our findings provide robust evidence that HPPs substantially reduce heat-related mortality across Europe, accounting for temporal changes and geographical differences in risks. These results emphasise the importance of monitoring and evaluating HPPs to enhance adaptation to a warming climate."

The measurement campaign studied the effect of the noise barrier on pollutant concentration gradients on the side of a major highway. The studied pollutants included PM10, PM2.5, lung deposited surface area (LDSA), particle number concentration (PNC), NO2, and black carbon (BC). The noise barrier was found to be effective in reducing, especially the concentration of particulate pollutants. 
 A three-month air quality measurement campaign was conducted in spring 2023 near a busy highway in Espoo, Finland. The measurement site featured a high (6.5 m) noise barrier built adjacent to the highway. Additionally, there was a gap in the noise barrier at the selected measurement site, providing an opportunity to study the air quality impacts of the noise barrier. Several air quality measurement devices were installed behind the noise barrier and in the gap at distances of 10, 20 and 40 m from the side of the highway. Additionally, 15 passive samplers were deployed to monitor NO2 concentrations across the study area, mobile measurements were conducted using the ATMo-Lab mobile laboratory on the highway, and concurrent flights with drones equipped with AQ monitors were performed along the highway.The effects of the noise barrier on PM10, PM2.5, lung deposited surface area (LDSA), particle number concentration (PNC), NO2, and black carbon (BC) were quantified based on the analysed measurement data. Furthermore, the measurements were compared with simulated pollutant concentrations from a local-scale Gaussian air quality model (Enfuser) with a nearby obstacle detection and concentration reduction method incorporated in the model to address the effects of the noise barrier in the study.The noise barrier was found to effectively reduce pollutant concentrations behind the barrier. The most notable reductions were observed closest to the highway. The greatest reductions were observed for PM10 (mostly road dust) while gaseous concentrations, such as NO2, exhibited less pronounced decreases."

This sunlight-absorbing, self-lofting aerosol perturbs the radiation budget and stratospheric dynamics differently from major volcanic eruptions, which are also included in this study. 
 Recent studies suggest that  emissions from large forest fires affect stratospheric chemistry, dynamics, and climate, similar to major volcanic eruptions. Using the chemistry-climate model EMAC, we demonstrate that organic carbon emitted from forest fires, injected into the stratosphere through pyro-cumulonimbi, enhances heterogeneous chlorine activation related to high solubility of HCl in particles containing organic acids and an augmented aerosol surface area, in agreement with existing literature. Following the 2019/2020 Australian megafires, the upward transport of the pollution plumes resulted in enhanced ozone depletion in the Southern Hemisphere lower stratosphere, as corroborated by satellite observations. It diminished column ozone in the following two years, accompanied by a dynamically induced reduction in 2020 due to the lofting of smoke-filled vortices, in total by up to 45 DU. The eruption of the submarine Hunga Tonga volcano in January 2022 caused a decline in total ozone across the entire Southern Hemisphere. The water vapour injection from the volcano altered only the vertical distribution of ozone loss. The sunlight-absorbing aerosol from the Australian and, to a smaller extent, the Canadian forest fire emissions in 2019/2020 induced the most significant perturbation in stratospheric optical depth since the major eruption of Pinatubo in 1991. It shifted the sign of instantaneous stratospheric aerosol forcing, derived at the top of the atmosphere, from −0.2 to +0.3 W m−2  in January 2020. The global aerosol radiative forcing resulting from the Hunga Tonga eruption was −0.16 W m−2, primarily driven by changes in stratospheric sulfate aerosols. The positive radiative forcing from the injected water vapour was minimal."

For the first time ever, a high resolution simulation is performed in Bhutan showing the high PM2.5 concentrations within the valleys and potential contaminations up to the glaciers enhancing climate related risks. 
 Our study focuses on Bhutan, a highly mountainous country where government authorities are strengthening air pollution monitoring efforts. To support further analysis and the monitoring strategy, we present the first high-resolution air quality simulations with the chemistry transport model WRF-CHIMERE over the western region of Bhutan at a spatial resolution of roughly 1 km. Increasing the horizontal resolution of the model improves its performance and reduces potential errors caused by excessive spatial averaging of meteorological and emission data with high spatial variability. However, the air pollutant emissions must be improved at a fine scale with better proxy, particularly for industries where improvements are still required. For the first time, we propose high resolution maps of air pollution (concentrations and deposition fields). Our simulations confirm that Bhutan valleys also suffer from air pollution mainly due to PM2.5 (concentrations exceeding 20 µg m−3) dominated by carbonaceous species, largely above the World Health Organization guidelines. Wildfires and anthropogenic activities release large amount of carbonaceous species and can also impact the glaciers by atmospheric fallout. Wildfires can locally contribute to 20 % of the total PM2.5 concentrations over a 15 d period, and theoretically, black carbon can be transported up to the highest peaks. Ecosystems are at risks with deposition fluxes of sulfur and nitrogen species comparable with other locations at risk in the world."

This study presents a method to analyze this in real-time using two weather balloon measurements: ambient and in-plume conditions. Researchers launched 156 balloons during wildfire seasons in Spain, Chile, Greece, and the Netherlands. This methodology detects sudden changes in fire behavior by comparing ambient and in-plume data, ultimately enhancing research on fire-atmosphere interactions. 
 Firefighter entrapments occur when wildfires suddenly transition into extreme wildfire events (EWEs). These transitions are often caused by pyroconvective fire-atmosphere coupling, triggered by a combination of high fire intensity and atmospheric vertical thermodynamic structure. Pyroconvection indices calculated using coarse atmospheric modeling data crudely detect these dynamic transitions due to highly localized atmospheric processes and changes in atmospheric conditions caused by the fire. Consequently, fire managers may remain unaware that fire behavior intensification due to fire-atmosphere coupling is outdating the safety protocols in place. This study presents a new in-plume profiling methodology to improve the assessment of fire-atmosphere interaction dynamics in real-time. As proof of concept, we analyzed 173 successful sondes (148 in-plume) launched during the 2021–2025 fire seasons in Spain, Chile, Greece, and the Netherlands. As a strategy to measure the fire-atmosphere coupling, we propose simultaneously launching two radiosondes: one to measure ambient conditions and another to capture data within the plume updraft. Comparing these profiles, we measure in-situ and in-real time the modification of state variables by the fire-atmosphere interaction. These new observations and methodology improve our assessment of pyroconvection dynamics, demonstrating practical implications that support their use by incident management teams. It has the potential to enhance awareness of possible near-accidents and tactical failures during extreme pyroconvective wildfire events. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive observational dataset to improve pyroconvection nowcasting and advance research on fire-atmosphere interaction."

 We present CrystalTrace, a Monte Carlo raytracing algorithm designed for radiative transfer computations involving ice crystals with both random and preferred orientations. Integrated into the three-dimensional radiative transfer solver MYSTIC, which is part of libRadtran, CrystalTrace enables multiple-scattering simulations of absolute radiances for realistic atmospheric scenes, including clouds with different mixtures of ice crystals and water droplets, aerosols, molecules, and surface properties. It seamlessly extends MYSTIC's macroscopic raytracing down to the microscopic scale of individual ice crystals. By computing single-scattering properties online, CrystalTrace removes the need for precomputed look-up tables, which are also subject to limited angular resolution. The current version of CrystalTrace is implemented for the visible spectral range and supports individual hexagonal prisms with different sizes and aspect ratios. It currently does not account for diffraction and ice absorption. CrystalTrace, integrated with MYSTIC, fills a critical gap by providing a computationally efficient forward radiative transfer simulator for ice clouds containing oriented crystals, thereby enabling retrievals of ice crystal properties from ground-based, airborne, and satellite imaging observations.

The motivation is to reconstruct the atmospheric history of H2 to improve understanding of global H2 biogeochemistry and how it has varied over time.

 This paper describes instrumentation and procedures developed to measure H2 and Ne in polar ice core samples. Gases are extracted from ice core samples by melting under vacuum. Measurements are conducted by gas chromatographic separation with detection by a pulsed helium ionization detector (He-PDD). The analytical system was developed for field analysis of ice core samples immediately after drilling. This minimizes the potential for exchange of these highly permeable gases between the ice core and the modern atmosphere. The design, operation, and performance of the instrument are discussed using data from the initial deployment to Summit, Greenland.

Courtier;Peter G. Huggard;Hui Wang;Richard Reeves;Christopher J. Walden;Richard Cotton;Stuart Fox;Anthony J. Baran,Estimating vertical profiles of ice water content and snowfall rate from radar measurements in the G-band,"This work presents the first known retrievals of ice cloud and snowfall properties using G-band radar, representing a major step forward in the use of high-frequency radar for atmospheric remote sensing. We present theory and simulations to show that ice water content (IWC) and snowfall rate (S) can be retrieved efficiently with a single frequency G-band radar if the mass of a wavelength-sized particle is known or can be assumed, while details of the particle size distribution are not required. 
 We present theory and simulations to show that at frequencies of order 200 GHz (G-band) the radar cross section (σr) of ice particles larger than ∼ a quarter wavelength (0.375 mm) is nearly directly proportional to their mass (m). Hence measurements of radar reflectivity (Z) at this frequency are directly proportional to the ice water content (IWC), with no other assumptions about the shape or breadth of the particle size distribution required. For the same reason, vertically pointing Doppler velocities at this frequency provide the mass-weighted mean vertical velocity of the particles, and the product of Z with the mean Doppler velocity (MDV) is proportional to the snowfall rate (S). This presents the opportunity for straightforward and accurate retrievals of ice microphysics.We explore the sensitivity of such retrievals to the scattering model for ice particles. We find that all seven models examined, four with random orientation and three with horizontal orientation, have σr∝m in this regime, but that the coefficient of proportionality varies between models. The dominant factor controlling this coefficient is the mass-size relationship for the ice particles, and specifically the mass of a wavelength-sized ice particle. If this information is known, or can be assumed, then the ice population parameters above can be retrieved with high accuracy. For mass-weighted mean diameters Dm>0.5 mm the variation in the IWC–Z relationship is within ≈ 30 %, and the variation in the S–(Z×MDV) relationship is within ≈ 15 %.The method is applied to retrieve IWC and S during two case studies, with measurements from the GRaCE 200 GHz Doppler radar at Chilbolton Observatory in the UK. In the first of these case studies, retrieved snowfall rates from particles falling aloft in a precipitating ice cloud were compared to gauge data at the surface. In the second case study, retrieved ice water contents from a deep non-precipitating stratiform ice cloud were compared to measurements made using an evaporative water content probe on board the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 instrumented research aircraft. In both cases a statistical comparison was necessary because of imperfect colocation of the radar measurements and in-situ/gauge sampling. The measurements fall within the distributions of the retrieved water content and snowfall fields, and follow consistent trends with time (Case 1) and height (Case 2), providing evidence that this method produces realistic retrievals.Application of the same technique at even higher radar frequencies would allow clouds with smaller particles (e.g. in high altitude cirrus clouds) to be characterised. Because of the increased gaseous attenuation at such frequencies, the latter may be more practical from airborne or spaceborne platforms."

Fluxes are calculated with multiple gas exchange schemes and wind products, then constrained to match independent regional to global annual mean fluxes estimates. We evaluate flux seasonal cycles and annual patterns against atmospheric O2 observations and quantify flux uncertainties from multiple sources. 
 We present estimates of the monthly open ocean air-sea O2 flux from 2004 to 2024 on a 1°×1° grid spanning 64.5°S to 79.5°N. The flux is computed using 4-dimensional ocean dissolved oxygen (DO) fields derived from Argo float and shipboard observations via machine learning algorithms (GOBAI-O2, Sharp et al., 2023). Flux uncertainties are quantified by generating a large ensemble of flux estimates, first propagating errors from the dissolved oxygen product, then computing fluxes across all combinations of three gas exchange parameterizations that account for bubble-mediated flux and three wind products. We apply DO adjustments to align our resolved global annual mean fluxes with those derived from scaling global ocean heat uptake and regional annual mean fluxes with those derived from ocean inversions. Our results show larger seasonal flux variations at high latitudes than at low latitudes, with clear differences between major ocean basins. Both adjusted and unadjusted annual mean flux estimates exhibit strong ocean O2 sinks at high latitudes, weak sources in the low-to-mid latitude subtropics, and weak sinks near the Equator. The annual mean adjustment significantly enhances ocean O2 uptake in the northern high latitudes and tropical regions while reducing outgassing in the northern subtropics. We evaluate our flux seasonal cycles and annual mean values by comparing forward transport simulations with atmospheric O2 observations from global airborne surveys and surface sampling stations. The simulations reproduce the observed mean seasonal cycles well, but some differences remain in the annual mean latitudinal gradients. We analyze fractional variance contributions from DO, wind, and gas exchange scheme uncertainties and their interactions at regional and hemispheric scales for both climatological monthly and annual mean fluxes. This dataset marks a major improvement over existing air-sea O2 flux products, as it includes the resolution of interannual variability in the flux seasonal cycle, the use of advanced machine learning-based DO fields that better represent complex spatial and temporal patterns, and robust uncertainty quantification across various scales."

CoralCache is designed to meet the data-sharing principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). 
 As science fields enter the Big Data revolution, open-access repositories are essential for addressing larger-scale questions than are possible for single researchers by making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, transparent data and code are increasingly important for reproducible research, especially for data types that inherently require subjective human interpretations.

The dataset provides a basis for identifying the same volcanic ash layers in different sediment deposits and to determine their stratigraphic and chronological relationships. Known ages of volcanic eruptions can be transferred among equivalent ash layers, which allows dating of sediments. Also ash dispersal and the volcanic history of a region can be studied. 
 Tephrostratigraphy and -chronology are powerful tools using volcanic ash (tephra) layers for establishing stratigraphic correlations and/or to obtain chronological information for different kinds of sedimentary archives. To develop tephrostratigraphic frameworks, which ideally document a most complete spatial and temporal record of regional volcanic activity, precise geochemical and chronological characterization of tephra layers is needed. Based on these frameworks, newly discovered tephra layers can be linked to retrieve stratigraphic and chronological information. Tephrostratigraphic frameworks exist or are under construction for various regions. However, for some regions of the world the potential of these methods is not exploited yet, although being influenced by long-term and frequent volcanism and tephra deposition. One of these regions is the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. There geochemical compositions of Pleistocene tephra layers (volcanic glass) were recently systematically investigated for their stratigraphy and chronology within the scope of the Collaborative Research Centre ‘Earth – Evolution at the Dry Limit’ (CRC 1211). These analyses were accompanied by the development of a tephra database called TephAta, which aims at providing a long-term basis for tephrostratigraphic and -chronological data of the Atacama Desert. TephAta allows digital documentation of the full variety of tephra-related datasets within one database and provides search functions to foster and simplify the continuous expansion of the regional framework following the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles. A first data compilation of 106 tephra samples origin from 91 tephra deposits is now available and will be continuously extended spatially and temporally. TephAta does not only provide a stratigraphic and dating tool for paleoenvironmental or mapping studies, but it also helps to explore the integrity of the explosive volcanic history of the region along with the associated volcanic hazard and risk assessment."

The dataset includes detailed measurements of debris-flow kinematic parameters (velocity, depth, and discharge), physical–mechanical properties (particle size, yield stress, and viscosity), seismic data, and hydrometeorological records (e.g., minute-by-minute rainfall and soil moisture). The dataset is publicly accessible via the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (NCDC). 
 The study of mechanisms of debris-flow formation and movement is constrained by the lack of comprehensive and long-term field monitoring data. In 1961, the Dongchuan Debris Flow Observation and Research Station (DDFORS) was established in the highly active debris-flow catchment of Jiangjia Ravine to conduct continuous field observations of debris flows.  With the advancement of technology, more high-precision instruments have been employed to monitor the entire process of debris flows. This paper presents a unique and comprehensive dataset of debris-flow and hydrometeorological observations collected over a 64-year period (1961–2024) in Jiangjia Ravine, China. The dataset documents 17 001 surges for a total of 278 debris-flow events and encompasses detailed measurements of kinematic parameters of debris flow, including velocity, depth, and discharge, as well as physical–mechanical parameters, such as the particle size distribution of debris flow, yield stress, and viscosity of debris-flow slurry. It also incorporates the induced seismic data, providing insights into the dynamic characteristics of debris flows. Furthermore, it includes continuous records of rainfall at 1 min intervals, soil moisture, and suspended sediment concentrations at the catchment scale. This extensive dataset provides invaluable insights into the initiation, transportation, and deposition processes of debris flows. It can be utilized to analyze flow resistance and dynamic characteristics of debris flows, validate various computational models, investigate the effects of debris flows on channel morphology, and evaluate the impact of climate change on sediment transport within watersheds. The dataset is publicly accessible through the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (NCDC; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6803.2025; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6804.2025; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6721.2025;  https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6720.2025; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6807.2025;  https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6719.2025; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6805.2025;  https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6716.2025; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6718.2025;  https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6802.2025; https://doi.org/10.12072/ncdc.ddfors.db6806.2025; Song et al., 2025a–k) and is organized into several categories to facilitate ease of use and analysis."

Keller;Marta Alerany Solé;Mario Acosta,Replicability in Earth System Models,"Can we be sure that different computing environments, that should not change the model climate, indeed leave the climate unaltered? In this article, we present a novel methodology that answers whether two model climates are statistically the same. Besides a new methodology, able to detect significant differences between two model climates 60 % more accurately than a similar recent state-of-the-art method, we also provide an analysis on what actually constitutes a different climate. 
 Climate simulations with Earth System Models (ESMs) constitute the basis of our knowledge about the projected climate change for the coming decades. They represent the major source of knowledge for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are an indispensable tool in confronting climate change. Yet, ESMs are imperfect and the climate system that they simulate is highly non-linear. Therefore, small errors in the numerical representation, initial states, and boundary conditions provided for future scenarios, quickly develop large uncertainties in the trajectories of their projected climates. To improve the confidence and minimize the uncertainty, future projections use large ensembles of simulations with the same model, and ensembles with multiple models. Using these two types of ensembles concurrently addresses two kinds of uncertainty in the simulations, (1) the limited spatiotemporal accuracy of the initial states, and (2) the uncertainty in the numerical representation of the climate system (model error). The uncertainty for the future development of the anthropogenic climate drivers is addressed by projecting different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Organizing multimodel ensembles to make confident statements about the future climate addressing different SSP scenarios is a tremendous collaborative effort. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) addresses this challenge, with the participation of 33 modeling groups in 16 countries. As one among numerous challenges that such undertaking poses, we are addressing model replicability in this article. The anticipated number of simulated years in the 6th CMIP phase (CMIP6) accumulated to about 40 000 years. With typical values for the computational throughput of about 1 to 15 simulated years per day (SYPD), it is clear that the simulations needed to be distributed among different clusters to be completed within a reasonable amount of time. Model replicability addresses the question, whether the climate signal from different scientific scenarios generated by the same model, performed on different clusters, can be attributed exclusively to the differences in the scientific drivers. It has been shown, that even changing specific compiler flags, leads to significant changes in certain climatological fields. Model replicability holds, when the model climatologies derived from the same model under a different computing environment, are statistically indistinguishable. If replicability does not hold, we cannot be certain that differences in the model climate are exclusively attributed to differences in the scientific setups. In this article, we present a novel methodology to test replicability. We further establish an objective measure of what constitutes a different climate based on Cohen's effect size. We provide a thorough analysis of the performance of our methodology and show that we can improve the performance of a recent state-of-the-art method by 60 %. We further provide an estimate of the ensemble size that is required to prove replicability with confidence. We find that an effect size of d=0.2 can be used as a threshold for statistical indistinguishability. Our analysis, based on the Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2) Large Ensemble Community Project (LENS2) 100-member ensemble, shows that with 50 members, we can resolve effect sizes of ∼0.3, and with ensembles of 20 members, we can still resolve effect sizes of ∼0.35. We further provide a robust methodology to objectively determine the required ensemble size, depending on the purpose and requirement of the replicability test."

A distinct slowdown occurred at the central PIIS from 14 March 2022 to 20 January 2023, during which velocities decreased from 13.15 ± 0.04 to 12.71 ± 0.17 m day−1 (−0.44 ± 0.18 m day−1 yr−1). Piglet Glacier, a major tributary of the PIIS, also experienced two deceleration periods between 2023 and 2025. The transitions from acceleration to deceleration and then to near‐steady flow coincided with substantial changes in mélange configuration. Our analysis clearly demonstrates that the flow of the central PIIS and Piglet Glacier is highly sensitive to mechanical coupling along their shear margins. Specifically, the recent slowdowns in the ice flow are most easily explained by variations in the state and configuration of dense ice mélange."

The onset of glaciation has been attributed to CO2 removal through silicate weathering, however previous carbon cycle models have failed to reproduce its timing. Here, we build a high‐resolution climate emulator using the Community Earth System Model and couple it with the SCION Earth Evolution model to better simulate continental weathering. This new framework successfully aligns modeled carbon drawdown and glaciation onset with geological proxy data. We find that additional cooling was driven by increased continental exposure during long‐term marine regression associated with Pangea's assembly, which boosted global weatherability and increased albedo. Our results highlight that changes in continental exposure are critical for long‐term climate evolution, and that high‐resolution climate models are needed to understand these impacts."

Results show that an increase in vertical diffusivity κ associated with tidal mixing can enhance poleward MHT in most of the global ocean by strengthening the overturning circulations in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean (located in the Southern Hemisphere), and weakening it in the Southern Ocean. A mathematical fitting reveals that MHT follows a power‐law relationship with κ by a coefficient of about 0.1, that is, MHTpw ∝ κ0.1. This is the first time to quantify the relationship between tidal mixing strength and poleward MHT, shedding light on the influence of tides on global climate change."

While Arctic amplification is well‐established, the presence and drivers of Antarctic amplification remain contentious. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations, we demonstrate a robust emergence of Antarctic amplification under the 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. Sensitivity experiments identify a pivotal role for sea surface temperature (SST) changes in mediating this anthropogenic response. Positive SST anomalies influence Antarctic temperature through dynamic and thermodynamic processes, exerting distinct and contrasting effects. Dynamic processes, characterized by intensification of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), generally induce continental‐scale cooling. In contrast, thermodynamic processes, specially through enhanced sensible and latent heat fluxes, take precedence over the dynamic effect and drive widespread warming. In a warming climate, these thermodynamic processes are expected to intensify substantially, thereby amplifying the anthropogenic climate signal over Antarctica."

This effect is often neglected in the application of Köhler theory where a constant surface tension equivalent to pure water is assumed. Using a cloud parcel model, we evaluated the impact of four representative surface‐active organics, humic‐like substances (HULIS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cis‐pinonic acid, and dicarboxylic acids, on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation under varied atmospheric conditions. Our results indicate that HULIS significantly enhance CCN activation, particularly at high aerosol concentrations, low updraft velocities, and small particle sizes. SDS, cis‐pinonic acid, and dicarboxylic acids also increase activation but to a lesser degree. The surface activity of HULIS has a stronger influence on CCN activation than its hygroscopicity, with particle size being the most sensitive parameter.

However, the ability of geostationary imagery to resolve contrails has not been systematically characterized. By comparing higher spatial resolution low Earth orbit satellite imagery from Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to geostationary satellite imagery from GOES ABI, we show that the latter does not resolve 80% of the contrails nor half of the total length compared to contrails identified with VIIRS. Our findings underscore the need for multi‐sensor approaches to collect observational contrail data for improved validation of climate models and to enable more rigorous and verifiable contrail avoidance strategies."

Mooring observations in the Halmahera Sea during September 2018 through October 2020 show a mean transport of 0.37–0.76 Sv through the Gebe Strait into the Indonesian seas. This estimate, together with mooring measurements in the Makassar Strait, the Maluku Channel, and the Jailolo Strait of the Halmahera Sea, suggests the total mean transport of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) to be 16.8 Sv ± 1.0 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1), larger than the 15 Sv mean transport previously measured at the exit straits. Mooring data in the Maluku and Halmahera Seas, combined with Lagrangian tracking of the Makassar Strait throughflow using reanalysis velocity, show that 40% of the total ITF transport comes directly from the South Pacific Ocean. The above findings have revised the traditional concept that the ITF comes mainly from the North Pacific.

Through leaching experiments on active‐layer organic soils and underlying mineral permafrost, this study reveals that mineral permafrost exhibits high soil carbon loss as DOC (3.27%–11.42%). However, 11.17%–46.42% of active‐layer DOC is retained by mineral permafrost during vertical transport, forming an internal soil carbon sink. The sink selectively retains aromatic compounds, acting as a molecular “filter” that alters DOC composition and bioavailability. This internal retention complicates interpretations of active‐layer DOC transport dynamics and alters the chemistry of both thawed permafrost and exported DOC.

Forecast systems reproduce the tropospheric variability following SSWs found in reanalysis, including an increase of events followed by a poleward‐positioned jet during La Niña winters. Composite analysis reveals that SSWs increase the likelihood of an equatorward‐shifted jet and negative North Atlantic Oscillation compared to non‐SSW members during both ENSO phases, but La Niña masks this response due to their opposing influence on the North Atlantic mean state. This study highlights the importance of accounting for ENSO when predicting SSW impacts on the circulation and surface extremes on subseasonal timescales."

An observing system simulation experiment demonstrates the approach's capability to improve emission estimates, especially in regions where fires occur during the non‐growing season. Applied to Africa, the inversion yields fire emissions of 1.18 ± 0.22 PgC yr−1 for 2015–2016––about 20% higher than GFED4s and GFAS averages. Regionally, emissions were underestimated in northern Africa (∼0.25 PgC yr−1) due to missing burned area and overestimated in southern Africa (∼0.05 PgC yr−1) due to inflated fuel assumptions. The inversion reduces inter‐inventory discrepancies by 88% and reveals pronounced landscape‐dependent biases. These findings highlight the potential of XCO2‐based joint inversions to enhance regional emission estimates and improve representations of fire–carbon–climate feedbacks in Earth system models."

Stable isotopes (δ18O) covary with excess air, indicating that they primarily reflect monsoon‐driven precipitation changes rather than temperature.

We consider the Asian‐Australian monsoon as a cold air intrusion from the winter hemisphere into the Maritime Continent and quantify the amount and flux of cold air by an isentropic analysis method. This approach enables a systematic assessment of the cold air transport along the monsoon routes and a consistent analysis of cold air intrusions associated with seasonally reversing monsoons. During the East Asian winter monsoon, cold air covers the western Maritime Continent and flows from the South China Sea throughout the Java Sea to the north of the Australian continent with high flux of cold air. Cold air enters the Maritime Continent partly from the southeast of the Philippine Islands and from the Timor Sea. During the Australian winter monsoon, cold air inflows from the Coral Sea through the sea between the Australian continent and New Guinea Island and accumulates in the southern Maritime Continent due to the topographic barriers of the islands. Cold air outflowing through the islands to the Java Sea and the Pacific Ocean induces cross‐equatorial flows. Cold air transport over the Coral Sea in August is approximately 1.7 times higher than that over the South China Sea in January. The duration period of cold air inflow associated with the Australian winter monsoon is 1.5 times longer than that associated with the East Asian winter monsoon."

The proposed one‐way nesting approach combines non‐uniform vertical grid refinement and a domain vertically embedded within the parent large‐eddy simulation (LES), in addition to the standard constant horizontal grid refinement. The transition and equilibration of flow solutions in sub‐meter nested LES domains are systematically analyzed for idealized forcing conditions across stability regimes, and spanning a broad range of parent/nest grid refinements in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Fine‐scale eddies emerge in the LES domains after a moderate fetch from the predominant inflow boundaries. In general, development fetches are delayed with increasing rx ${r}_{x}$ and distance from the surface, with cases where rx> ${r}_{x}\  > $ 10 exhibiting a more energetic quasi‐equilibrium state. Spatial evolution of resolved turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and spectra reveal two mechanisms in the transition and equilibration process. An initial development of additional small scales and a slower TKE decrease associated with a reduction in the larger‐scale energy content via forward energy cascade. The specific transition mechanisms are found to be dependent on the rx ${r}_{x}$/rz ${r}_{z}$ ratio and are impacted by atmospheric stability. The proposed scale‐separation parameter, ϕnc ${\phi }_{nc}$, provides qualitative information about the required development fetch by combining the opposing effects of grid refinements and resolved turbulence levels in the parent domain. Larger ϕnc ${\phi }_{nc}$ values lead to an increased fetch, with ϕnc> ${\phi }_{nc}\  > $ 1.5 typically indicating TKE over prediction due to excessive scale separation between parent and nest and/or non‐convergence."

Nevertheless, socio‐economic developments are changing the oceans' biological characteristics, which could impact the magnitude and distribution of oceanic emissions in the future. In this work, we couple a machine learning (ML) framework to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) data of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and estimate the monthly sea surface concentrations of CHBr3 and CH2Br2 between 2015 and 2100, under different climate change scenarios. We use these estimates to run CESM version 2 (CESM2), with comprehensive halogen chemistry, and calculate present‐day global emissions of 269–271 Gg Br and 61–65 Gg Br for CHBr3 and CH2Br2, respectively, based on different scenarios. Furthermore, we project 14%–40% and 8%–23% increases for global mean emissions of CHBr3 and CH2Br2, respectively, by 2100; where more stringent scenarios lead to smaller enhancements. Regionally, there are uncertainties within the magnitudes and signs of the changes that depend on the climate scenarios considered. Nevertheless, the largest enhancements, under all scenarios, were predicted over the western tropical Pacific Ocean, tropical Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean. We attribute these changes primarily to biological parameters rather than physical parameters. These changes project a 0.47–1.13 ppt Br increase from the combined source gases (CHBr3 and CH2Br2) in the upper troposphere by 2100, which could impact the stratospheric ozone budget.

However, existing estimates are typically derived from direct human activities, while the environmental indirect effects driven by both natural and anthropogenic factors are often overlooked. To date, no studies have explicitly differentiated between the direct and environmental indirect effects of interannual LUC. This omission may bias estimates of LUC‐induced carbon emissions and undermine the effectiveness of carbon reduction policies. Here, we proposed a novel accounting method that employed a process‐based dynamic vegetation model to quantify interannual LUC‐induced carbon fluxes (LUCF) in China from 1990 to 2020, further distinguishing them into direct (LUCF‐d) and environmental indirect fluxes (LUCF‐ind). The results indicate that China's overall LUCF from 1990 to 2020 functioned as a carbon source, with a trend shifting from a source in the 1990s to a sink in the past decade. Over the past 30 years, LUCF‐ind sequestered 1.39 ± 1.05 TgC yr−1, offsetting approximately 25% of the emissions from LUCF‐d. The South and Central regions are the primary areas for the trade‐off between LUCF‐d and LUCF‐ind, with indirect environmental effects reducing direct emissions by 13.3% and 13.7%, respectively. This study aims to enhance the effectiveness of national‐level land use carbon reduction policies by integrating environmental indirect effects and providing methodological references for other countries."

 The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-bound factor with essential yet incompletely understood roles in protein biogenesis1. Here, we show that NAC is a multifaceted regulator that coordinates translation elongation, cotranslational folding, and organelle targeting through distinct interactions with nascent polypeptides both inside and outside the ribosome exit tunnel. Using NAC-selective ribosome profiling in C. elegans, we identify thousands of sequence-specific NAC binding events across the nascent proteome, revealing broad cotranslational engagement with hydrophobic and helical motifs in cytosolic, nuclear, ER, and mitochondrial proteins. Unexpectedly, we discover an intra-tunnel sensing mode, where NAC engages ribosomes with extremely short nascent polypeptides inside the exit tunnel in a sequence-specific manner. Moreover, initial NAC interactions induce an early elongation slowdown that tunes ribosome flux and prevent ribosome collisions, linking NAC’s chaperone activity to kinetic control of translation. We propose NAC action protects aggregation-prone intermediates by shielding amphipathic helices, thus promoting cytonuclear folding. NAC also supports mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis and ER targeting by early recognition of signal sequences and transmembrane domain. Our findings establish NAC as an early-acting, multifaceted orchestrator of cotranslational proteostasis, with distinct mechanisms of action on nascent chains depending on their sequence features and subcellular destinations."

 Distinct ligands for the same G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activate intracellular signaling partners to varying extents, but the molecular mechanisms driving these differences remain elusive. Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gαiβγ heterotrimer by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor1. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptor’s transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule fluorescence assays, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a ‘kinetic trap’ during G-protein activation."

 Warming is pushing Earthʼs system towards unfamiliar climate conditions, complicating predictions. Geological archives of past greenhouse climates provide essential tests for models under extreme forcing. We investigate how precipitation responded to extreme warmth during early Palaeogene global warming events (66–47.8 million years ago)—a period considered a possible analogue for worst-case future scenarios. Here we compile global palaeoclimate data and develop a multi-proxy approach that integrates sedimentary proxies—such as plant fossils, ancient soils and river deposits—providing constraints on global precipitation intermittency (seasonal and interannual variability) and intensity (rainfall rate). The data reveal wet or monsoonal polar regions and aridity punctuated by intense rainfall at mid- and low-latitude continental interiors. This hydroclimate shift occurred 3 million years before and persisted 7 million years after the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum—the warmest period of the Cenozoic Era, suggesting that extreme warmth induces nonlinearities in the hydrological cycle’s sensitivity to temperature increase. Polar humidity and mid-latitude aridity further indicate a departure from the expected wet-gets-wetter and dry-gets-drier response. Shifts towards aridity were decoupled from mean annual precipitation and driven by seasonal and interannual precipitation distribution, such as shorter wet-season lengths and longer interannual rainfall recurrence intervals. This highlights the importance of considering precipitation intermittency and intensity, as similar shifts may occur under future warming despite differences in boundary conditions. Mid-latitude precipitation became less frequent but more intense through the early Palaeogene, reflecting a global hydroclimate response to extreme warming, according to a global multi-proxy reconstruction of precipitation characteristics."

Furthermore, inhibiting LOXL2 or GPR4 signal pathway alleviates immune exclusion. 
 Immune exclusion is associated with adverse prognosis in tumors, and this phenomenon may be facilitated by a physical barrier constituted by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hypoxia and acidity promote immune exclusion, however the detailed mechanism remains unclear. This study demonstrate that G-protein-coupled-receptor-4 (GPR4), as a proton sensor, induces immune exclusion in colon cancer by promoting collagen fiber alignment and deposition. Specifically, GPR4 facilitates collagen alignment via LOXL2 regulation and enhances collagen I by modulating TGF-β, both mediated by the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. We further validate our findings in a male animal model, observing that elevated GPR4 expression in colon cancer results in an immune-excluded microenvironment. Inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and LOXL2 function effectively reverse immune exclusion and enhance immunotherapy efficacy. Collectively, our findings elucidate a mechanism of immune exclusion and propose a potential target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy through the remodeling of the tumor ECM.

 Electronic nematicity, the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry, has emerged as a key instability in correlated quantum systems. CsTi3Bi5, a kagome metal of the AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) family, hosts rich unconventional electronic phases, yet the origin of its nematicity remains unsettled. Here, we combine polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with functional renormalization group calculations on a fully interacting ab initio model. We reveal an orbital-selective nematic deformation in the low-energy band structure and identify a finite angular momentum (d-wave) Pomeranchuk instability driven by electronic correlations in specific orbital channels and detuning from Van Hove singularities. Our results establish a direct link between orbital selectivity and symmetry-breaking instabilities in CsTi3Bi5, providing a microscopic framework for nematic order in kagome systems.

Here, the authors combine live-cell imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal a continuum of cell-cycle withdrawal. 
 Quiescence (reversible cell-cycle arrest) and senescence (irreversible arrest) are challenging to distinguish due to a lack of specific biomarkers, yet both arise simultaneously after chemotherapy. While senescence suppresses tumors by limiting proliferation and recruiting the immune system, quiescent cancer cells evade future therapies and may resume proliferation. Here, we pair time-lapse imaging of cell-cycle dynamics with single-cell RNA sequencing after etoposide treatment to differentiate these states, linking heterogeneous cell-cycle phenotypes to the transcriptomic landscape. We identify diverse senescent types (senotypes) and link them to two arrest pathways — a gradual path arising after a standard mitosis-to-G0 transition, and an alternative direct path driven by a mitotic slip. Using pseudotime trajectory analysis, we find that senescent phenotypes begin to manifest early and gradually along the first trajectory, even in shallow quiescent cells. These data support a model wherein, following chemotherapy, quiescence and senescence exist on a continuum of cell-cycle withdrawal at a transcriptome-wide level. Quiescent and senescent cells often arise side by side after stress, yet their molecular relationship remains unclear.

Here authors find that morphine-induced constipation is mediated by a neural circuit from the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and subsequently to the small intestine in male mice. 
 Opioid-induced constipation is one of the most common and persistent side effect of opioid analgesics, yet the underlying neural mechanism(s) remain unclear. Here we show morphine-induced constipation is mediated by a neural circuit from glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVNGlu) to acetylcholinergic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMVAch), and subsequently to the small intestine in mice. Microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed morphine inhibits the PVNGlu→DMVAch→small intestine circuit, and this is accompanied by decreased small intestinal motility. Chemogenetic activation of this circuit, as well as pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in PVNGlu neurons alleviates morphine-induced constipation. Conversely, artificial inhibition of this circuit mimics morphine-induced constipation in naïve mice. Moreover, we show that morphine suppresses tonic NMDA receptor-mediated currents in DMVAch neurons. These findings reveal a brain-gut circuit underlying opioid-induced constipation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate this debilitating side effect. Neural mechanisms mediating opioid-induced constipation are not fully understood.

 Surgical tasks in small tortuous lumens demand interventional instruments with controllable mechanical adaptability. However, current microcatheters lack a non-disruptive, integration-ready strategy for dynamic stiffness tuning—critical for meeting the divergent mechanical demands for compliant steering and stable advancement. Here, we present a microrobotic system based on a helix-shaped magnetic soft microrobot (Helixoft) that compatibly integrates with commercial microcatheters (down to 300 μm in diameter), enabling continuous stiffness tuning (up to 40-fold) and precise steering, both controlled magnetically, free of any other potentially harmful stimuli. Stiffness tuning and active steering are independently controlled via a decoupled control strategy by the helical motion and torque-driven bending of independent microrobot components. This stiffness and structure reconfiguration allow the integrated microcatheter to perform large-angle navigation, precision payload delivery, and localised tissue biopsy without unintended buckling or tissue damage. We validate the system in both ex-vivo oviduct biopsy and in-vivo drug delivery to the fourth-generation bronchi of live pigs.

 Global warming is intensifying compound humid-heat threats, yet long-term risk assessments accounting for urban‒rural disparities remain scarce. In this study, we develop a comprehensive risk assessment framework by integrating the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change risk approach with indicators from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to humid-heat mitigation and adaptation. Applying this framework to China from 2001 to 2020, we find that sustainable development progress substantially reduces vulnerability, particularly in urban areas, leading to a decline in humid-heat risk. In contrast, rural areas show a slower vulnerability reduction compared to urban areas and show no statistically significant change in humid-heat risk, despite a narrowing urban-rural risk gap. Regional disparities in sustainable development are key drivers of risk heterogeneity in both urban and rural settings. Our findings underscore the urgency of coordinated urban-rural development to simultaneously advance sustainable development and climate adaptation.

Here, authors modulate cell micro cavity via tuning materials’ refractive index to improve photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells. 
 In organic solar cells (OSCs), which represent a quintessential application system for organic conjugated films, the intrinsic light reflection of these films significantly influences the optical performance of the devices through the Fabry–Pérot micro-cavity effect. However, this phenomenon has not been comprehensively investigated. This study demonstrates that the film’s intrinsic reflection arises from the light-matter interaction, which is mainly governed by the polarizability of delocalized electron cloud and the orientation of the conjugated backbone. Furthermore, the multi-level interference within the OSC micro-cavity leads to a dependence of both the reflection properties and the short-circuit current density (JSC) on the active layer thickness. Based on these insights, a strategy for synergistic optimization of device performance through precise tailoring of optical constants and the micro-cavity structure is proposed. By systematically analyzing the intrinsic reflection behavior of organic conjugated films, this study enhances the understanding of the role reflection plays in the performance of photovoltaic devices and provides theoretical support for further optical optimization of organic photovoltaics.

 Many political jurisdictions have embraced climate policy strategies that emphasize large subsidies to deploy green technologies (‘carrots’) with the anticipation that more punitive policies (‘sticks’) may follow. However, little is known about how such policy sequencing affects future policies, emission reductions and costs. Using a multisector model for the USA, we examine carrot-first policies which mimic the increasingly popular interest in industrial policy and offer a way to model these real-world policy choices in energy-system models. We find that a carrot-first policy strategy still requires later use of similar-sized sticks when compared with a policy strategy that begins with sticks and achieves the same levels of long-term decarbonization. Policy carrots alone do not dramatically reduce future emissions. Only with policy sticks are there unambiguous signals to substantially shrink the size of incumbent fossil fuel industries.

 Higher temperatures are expected to impact globally on poverty and inequality, yet little cross-country analysis exists to quantify the effects. Here we analyse a panel dataset of subnational poverty in 130 countries covering the past decade and find that a 1 °C increase in temperature causes headcount poverty increases of 0.63–1.18 percentage points, using the daily poverty lines of US$2.15 (corresponding to 8.3% and 15.6% increases), and increases in the Gini inequality index of 1.3–1.9%. These poverty estimates equal a projected increase of global poor by 62.3–98.7 million people by 2030 compared with a scenario without climate change. Poorer countries—particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa—are more vulnerable, as are countries with higher agriculture shares in the economy. Estimates at the subnational level are larger than those using the country-level data, indicating that aggregated analysis may underestimate climate change risks.

 Nanoporous carbon-based materials with precise molecular discrimination and scalable processability hold great promise for next-generation sustainable membranes in organic solvent nanofiltration, which is an energy-efficient alternative to traditional separation methods. However, simultaneously achieving both high selectivity and ultrafast solvent permeance remains substantially challenging due to difficulties in fabricating long-range ordered films and engineering microstructures with molecular-level precision.

Benefitting from the ordered one-dimensional through-channels bridged by rigid diacetylenic linkages, TPC–CPF membranes achieve precise molecular sieving with unprecedented permeance, surpassing state-of-the-art organic solvent nanofiltration membranes and exceeding commercial counterparts by two to three orders of magnitude at comparable molecular weight cutoffs. With robust mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities under harsh solvents and high temperatures, TPC–CPF membranes enable more than 99% long-term recovery and reuse of homogeneous noble-metal catalysts under industrial conditions. Moreover, the pore-size tunability of TPC–CPF membranes facilitates efficient continuous and cascade separation of complex pharmaceutical mixtures, delivering 14–32 times higher separation efficiencies than commercial membranes.

 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal use and catalytic activity have been widely used in energy and biomedicine. However, the mass production of stable and homogeneous SACs still faces major challenges. Here we report a generalizable strategy for producing highly stable, low-cost SACs in a scalable and sustainable way. After screening 19,196 possible atom-active structures on the surface of NiTi substrate by combining quantum chemistry with machine learning, we synthesized 22 SACs in an area coverage up to 200 cm2 per preparation within 1 hour. The bimetallic CoV and PtCu SACs exhibit the highest biocatalytic activity, which is superior to that of natural enzymes and remains stable after 4 years. Moreover, these single-atom embedded NiTi vascular stents allow for the removal of excessive nitrides and oxides by continuous multi-enzyme catalysis, protecting them from vascular injury, with the corresponding vessel size being three times larger than that of the bare NiTi stent after 3 months of implantation, close to healthy vessels. This single-atom manufacturing strategy could be extended to other biomedical devices with high sustainability and bioactivity.

Clay mineral variations, particularly the shift in smectite content and smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio, together with geochemical weathering indicators (CIA, WIP and Rb/Sr), document a relative increase in chemical weathering around 8 Ma. These mineralogical and geochemical transformations are synchronous with widespread indicators of South Asian monsoon weakening linked with change in exhumation rate of the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau and Late Miocene global cooling. Where reduced physical erosion and enhanced sediment-water interaction under cooler and more seasonal conditions amplified chemical weathering feedbacks. Together, these processes reorganized regional hydrology and monsoon dynamics, underscoring the coupled influence of tectonics and global climate forcing in driving the Late Miocene weakening of the South Asian monsoon. However, the relative influence of climate versus tectonics still remains inherently very complex and higher resolution provenance data, thermochronology and climate model simulations will be crucial for fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the Late Miocene Change."

 Soil extracellular enzymes are critical drivers of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of phosphorus (P) additions on soil enzyme activities and stoichiometries, particularly under varying nitrogen (N) addition regimes worldwide, are not well comprehended. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 155 field studies across various ecosystems (forests, croplands and grasslands), which shows that P enrichment conditions enhances C-acquiring enzymes but has no effect on the enzymatic C:N ratio. P addition alone reduces P-acquiring enzymes by 14% without affecting N-acquiring enzymes. In contrast, P combined with N addition boosts N-acquiring enzymes by 21% while leaving P-acquiring enzymes unchanged. Notably, the combined effect of P and N addition on microbial C limitation (assessed via vector length) and enzymatic stoichiometries is less pronounced than that of P addition alone. Key drivers of these responses include mean annual precipitation, soil microbial biomass, and its stoichiometries. These results suggest that N addition mitigates the stoichiometric imbalance and microbial C limitation induced by P addition, potentially promoting soil organic C accumulation. Our findings emphasize the critical need to account for such interactive effects in models predicting soil biogeochemical cycles under future changes in global exogenous N and P inputs. Phosphorus addition alone reduces phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities by 14%, while phosphorus combined with nitrogen addition boosts nitrogen-acquiring enzyme activities by 21%, according to a meta-analysis based on 155 field studies across various ecosystems."

 Timeframe is a critical factor in understanding the impact of climate change on the evolution of microbial community structure and ecological memory. Here, we demonstrate how bacterial functions have left lasting imprints through their inherent gene-regulatory network traits under alternating wet and dry climatic conditions over loess-paleosol geological time scales.

The unique and extreme conditions of the paleoclimate environment can be reflected in the microbial community composition. Nitrogen deficiency in drier loess soil has facilitated shifts in bacterial phyla community composition, driving the evolutionary functional pathways and strong legacy effects.

 Denitrification, a major source of gaseous nitrogen emissions from agricultural soils, is influenced by management. Practices promoting belowground diversity are suggested to support sustainable agriculture, but how they modulate nitrogen losses via denitrification remains inconclusive. Here we sampled 106 cereal fields spanning a 3000 km North-South gradient across Europe and compiled 56 associated climatic, soil, microbial and management variables. We show that increased denitrification potential was associated with higher proportion of time with crop cover over the last ten years and was best predicted by microbial biomass and microbial functional guilds involved in nitrogen cycling, in particular denitrification. We also demonstrate that several diversification practices affect the variation in denitrification potential predictors, suggesting a trade-off between agricultural diversification and nitrogen losses via denitrification. However, increased crop diversity in rotations improved yield-scaled denitrification, highlighting the potential of this practice to minimize nitrogen losses while contributing to sustainable food production. Increased crop diversity in rotations reduces nitrogen losses relative to crop yield, making it an effective practice for sustainable farming, based on an analysis of 106 cereal fields across Europe and 56 climatic, soil, microbial, and management variables."

 The downward transport of organic particles produced by marine organisms is a key control on the ocean’s carbon storage. Measurements of particle attenuation through the water column have historically been used to infer the sequestration potential of the biological carbon pump. While often modelled using a simple power-law fit, this simplification may obscure important depth-dependent processes. Using data from biogeochemical-Argo floats in the Southern Ocean, here we show that splitting the water column into two distinct regimes captures depth-dependent variability in particle attenuation more effectively. Compared to the simple power-law fit the model reveals greater attenuation just below the productive layer, reducing particulate organic carbon flux into the mesopelagic (200 – 400 m) by 40 – 60%. Our findings suggest a more mechanistic representation of particle attenuation is needed to improve estimates of carbon transport and to reduce uncertainties in ocean-climate feedbacks and future climate projections.

 Triggering mechanisms are a fundamental aspect of landslide studies, as they directly influence both the characteristics of landslides and the environments in which they occur. Identifying the triggers of landslides is particularly important for understanding the morphological evolution of solid planetary surfaces in the Solar System. Ceres, the largest celestial object in the main asteroid belt, is rich in impact craters and exhibits numerous landslides. Published catalogues and available data on these surface features provide a unique opportunity to study the interactions between meteoroid impacts and mass movements. By analyzing the morphometric characteristics and absolute dating of eight landslides and their related impact craters, we have identified an evident cause-and-effect relationship between impact events and the initiation of landslides on Ceres.

 Tropical Indian Ocean warming has intensified under greenhouse forcing, yet its influence on North American terrestrial and agricultural productivity remains poorly understood. Here we show that summer tropical Indian Ocean warming is linked to widespread drying and reduced gross primary productivity across North America. Observations and model simulations reveal that tropical Indian Ocean-induced atmospheric heating excites stationary Rossby wave trains, which establish a high-pressure ridge over western North America and suppresses moisture transport into the continent. This leads to reduced precipitation and soil moisture, leading to 10-20% reductions in terrestrial productivity and crop yields. The relationship persists after excluding El Niño–Southern Oscillation years and is reproduced in multiple climate models, showing robust teleconnection processes. These results highlight a previously underappreciated pathway through which tropical Indian Ocean warming can weaken the North American land carbon sink under future climate change.

 The Holocene temperature conundrum limits our understanding of the past climate-environment-human interaction. Here we reconstructed Holocene winter and growing-season temperatures based on the Pediastrum body size and assemblage from lakes in mid-latitude Asia. Winter temperatures exhibited a warm early Holocene in northeastern China, aligning with growing-season temperature, whereas the Altai Mountains experienced continuous warming trend during the Holocene. The temperature difference was supported by other seasonal/annual temperature records, which indicated that there was spatial heterogeneity rather than seasonal bias in Holocene temperature conundrum. Ice sheets were the main drivers of cold early Holocene, while the latent-heat transport driven by the monsoon contributed to the divergence of Holocene temperature evolution in northeastern China. Our results demonstrate that spatial heterogeneity is a major cause of the Holocene temperature conundrum, linked to the heat redistribution within the Earth system, highlighting the critical role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in shaping spatial patterns of Holocene temperature.
