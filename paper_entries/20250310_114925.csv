Thirteen urinary PFR metabolites and 14 plasma steroid hormones were investigated using LC–MS/MS and four reproductive hormones were investigated using immunoassays. Linear regression for single PFR, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian machine kernel regression (BKMR) models for the PFR mixtures were used to examine the association between hormones and PFRs. Among boys, significant positive associations were observed between estradiol and ΣTCIPP and ΣTBOEP, and inverse associations were identified between insulin-like factor-3 (INSL3) and ΣTCIPP, and between luteinizing hormone (LH) and ΣEHDPHP. The PFR mixture was associated with the trends of increasing estradiol and androstenedione, and decreasing cortisol, cortisone, LH, inhibin B, and INSL3. Among girls, androstenedione and ΣTCIPP, testosterone and ΣEHDPHP, (androstenedione + testosterone)/DHEA-S and ΣTCIPP, and ΣEHDPHP and ΣTPHP were significantly correlated. The PFR mixture showed trends of increasing testosterone, androstenedione, and inhibin B, and decreasing cortisol, cortisone, and INSL3. Individual PFRs and PFR mixtures altered steroids and reproductive hormones in peripubertal children."

In this study, a photomechanical degradation process was employed to convert the primary sunscreen-derived microplastics (SDMPs) into secondary SDMPs. While mechanical degradation caused physical fragmentation, photodegradation induced both physical and chemical alterations, introducing surface oxidation, chemical bond scission, and cross-linking to the secondary SDMPs. Employing a combination of alkaline digestion and pyrolysis GC-MS techniques, it was observed that both physical fragmentation and photooxidation led to heightened intracellular sequestration of MPs. Although the bioaccumulated SDMPs could be indicated by the enlarged lysosomes and fragmented mitochondria, toxicity of secondary SDMPs at the cellular level was primarily driven by chemical transformations post-photodegradation. A nontargeted analysis employing high-resolution mass spectrometry identified 46 plastic-associated compounds in the leachate, with photodegradation-induced chemical transformations playing a crucial role in the dissociation of hydrophobic additives and oxidative conversion of leached compounds. The toxicity of the leachate was exacerbated by photodegradation, with mitochondrial fragmentation serving as the primary subcellular biomarker, indicative of leachate toxicity. This study elucidates the pivotal role of photodegradation in augmenting the cytotoxicity of secondary SDMPs, shedding light on the intricate interplay between physicochemical transformations and environmental risks."

In contrast, current knowledge about emerging PFASs, such as perfluoroether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), and their transport mechanisms remains ambiguous. In this study, the occurrence and transport of both traditional and emerging PFASs in the surface seawater of the Southeast Indian Ocean and Antarctic marginal seas are comprehensively discussed by integrating hydrological data. Long-chain PFASs were restricted to the north of the thermohaline front in the Southeast Indian Ocean, suggesting a transport barrier effect and the input of terrestrial contamination from low-latitude regions. Conversely, unexpectedly high levels of short-chain perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were limited to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, preventing further northward transport. PFBA showed significant positive correlations with two emerging PFECAs, perfluoro-2-methoxyacetic acid (PFMOAA) and fluoro(heptafluoropropoxy)acetic acid (3:2 H-PFECA), which were also widely detected in Antarctic marginal seas for the first time. This suggests their similar sources and environmental behavior, as they were probably formerly accumulated in Antarctic snow through atmospheric deposition and released into seawater during the summertime melting process."

The fifth European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis ERA5, with its unique 1‐hr temporal resolution, provides valuable data for these purposes. However, we identified obvious discontinuities in ERA5‐derived ZTD at 09:00 and 21:00 UTC. A comparison with 10‐year GNSS data from 6,437 stations showed that 32.8% of the stations experienced discontinuities in mean diurnal anomalies of ERA5 ZTD, with an average magnitude of 2.2 mm, far exceeding the 0.3 mm hour‐to‐hour variations observed by GNSS. The discontinuities are more pronounced in summer and are primarily due to errors in ERA5's humidity modeling, with a few pressure‐related issues limited to Antarctica. The discontinuity is attributed to the transition between ERA5's 12‐hr assimilation windows and suggest that other ERA5 variables may also be impacted, warranting caution in ERA5‐based diurnal cycle studies."

This geomagnetic storm, according to the human record of Dst index, is the third‐strongest one throughout history (only slightly lower than those in 1989 and 2003). In such an extreme condition, how the magnetopause evolves and reforms remains unclear, because only a few spacecraft measurements were available in the dayside magnetosphere during previous events. Here, by utilizing in‐situ measurements of multiple spacecraft together with ground magnetometers, we for the first time determine the extreme compression of the magnetopause from higher than 10 RE down to 5 RE. This observation of such severe deformation is also consistent with the prediction of the theoretical model. This study provides crucial insights into the extreme behavior of the magnetopause during the influence of a superstorm."
10.1029/2024GL112562,True,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了源限制对沙尘排放估算的影响。论文提出了一个考虑土壤沙尘供应演变的沙尘排放模型，该模型考虑了沙尘排放造成的损耗以及表面更新过程造成的富集。研究结果表明，源限制对沙尘排放有显著影响，在实际模拟中，考虑源限制后，沙尘排放量可能减少一个数量级。由于全球沙尘模型目前尚未考虑源限制，因此模型估算的沙尘排放量可能被高估。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及空气质量监测（沙尘是空气污染物）、大气成分分析（沙尘是大气中的颗粒物）以及全球沙尘模型的改进，而这些模型通常依赖于卫星观测数据。,"['dust emission', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'global dust models', 'source limitation']",Yaping Shao;Siyu Chen;Ning Huang;Hailin Gui;Rui Mao;Ishizuka Masahide;Chenglai Wu;Xin Yin;Jie Zhang,Source Limitation Could Have Major Implications to Dust Emission Estimates,"A model for source‐limited dust emission is proposed. The model accounts for the evolution of the supply of soil dust depleted by dust emission and enriched by the process of surface renewal, together with several other new developments. The model is tested with a field dataset. The impact of source limitation to dust emission is profound. Our tests show that by considering source limitation, the model predicted dust emission can reduce by one order of magnitude in a real‐case simulation period of less than 20 days. We show that the process of dust emission is much more complex and variable than considered in previous dust models. Our findings have far‐reaching implications, for example, to the global dust emission estimates. Because source‐limited dust emission has so far not been represented in global dust models, the model estimated dust emission is only its potential and may be a substantial overestimate."

Due to the lack of vertical profiling of cloud water, previous studies on the vertical variability of fad within clouds have been confined to single cloud scales. Our prior research achieved a breakthrough in the large‐scale retrieval of cloud adiabatic fraction, while it only provided two‐dimensional information on the adiabatic fraction, leaving the vertical variation of the in‐cloud adiabatic fraction unquantified. In this study, utilizing global‐scale cloud fad data derived from our previous research, we developed a predictive function for global marine low‐cloud fad based on cloud geometric thickness and cloud base temperature (CBT). This enabled us to successfully estimate the vertical distributions of fad within clouds across various temperature conditions on a global scale. The fad within clouds exhibits a quadratic reduction from the cloud base to the top, which is more pronounced at higher temperatures. Specifically, as the CBT rises from 2 to 24°C, the fad at cloud base diminishes from 0.85 to 0.23. The decreasing trend of fad within clouds with increasing temperatures is expected to reduce cloud albedo and coverage potentially constituting a positive radiative cloud feedback mechanism."

Despite the increase in spaceborne and ground‐based concentration measurements, atmospheric inversions are usually limited by uncertainties in chemical transport models (CTMs) when relating fluxes to observed CO2 mole fractions. CO2 eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements have been widely used to directly measure CO2 fluxes over various ecosystems, but they have rarely been used as constraints in top‐down estimations. In this study, we focused on the development of a novel fluxes assimilation scheme through direct flux observations within an Ensemble Square Root Filter assimilation framework. The assimilation scheme avoided some of complexities of concentration observation assimilations. The methodology was primarily applied to typical regions in west China, taking advantage of eight long‐term ecosystem EC sites. Moreover, four sets of assimilation experiments were designed to quantify the impacts of observational constraints by flux and concentration measurements. Generally, results indicate that the monthly and hourly statistics of the a posteriori fluxes constrained by flux observations agreed well with flux measurements, demonstrating reasonable performance in seasonal and diurnal variations. Specifically, assimilation results demonstrated the advantage of a posteriori estimates inferred from flux measurements during growing season, as compared to results inferred from concentrations, while some limitation still exists in monthly budget estimates. Nevertheless, it is important to note that current results are only a mathematical optimum. CO2 biospheric fluxes can be estimated more reliably and robustly at the regional scale given considerably more flux observations for efficient constraint."

Here, a meta‐analysis was conducted to explore the characteristics of runoff pollution indicators (TSS: total suspended solids, TN: total nitrogen, TP: total phosphorus, and COD: chemical oxygen demand) on the roads and roofs in 41 Chinese cities, and a boosted regression tree model was used to reveal the geographical differences in pollution levels and the contribution rates of their influencing factors. The results revealed that the average event mean concentrations (EMCs) of TSS (326 mg/L), TP (0.6 mg/L), and COD (160 mg/L) were significantly greater in road runoff than in roof runoff. Among them, the TSS concentrations were nearly four times greater than those in roof runoff, whereas the TP and COD concentrations were 3.2 and 2.3 times greater, respectively. Urban NPS pollution is severe in China, and the concentrations of runoff pollutants far exceed those in the USA, Germany, and France. There were significant geographical differences in urban NPS pollution due to the influences of air quality (35% relative contribution), climate conditions (15%), and human activities (45%). Prominent pollution from road runoff was observed in the Central region, more severe pollution from roof runoff was observed in the Northern region, and relatively light pollution was observed in the Southern and North‐Eastern regions. This study provides the first synthesis of NPS road and roof runoff pollution levels in Chinese cities on a large spatial scale, resulting in scientific guidance for urban stormwater management and NPS pollution control."

 Deep learning models are widely used to extract features and insights from remotely sensed imagery. However, these models typically perform optimally when applied to the same sensor, resolution and imagery processing level as used during their training, and are rarely used or evaluated on out-of-domain data. This limitation results in duplication of efforts in collecting similar training datasets from different satellites to train sensor-specific models. Here, we introduce a range of techniques to train deep learning models that generalise across various sensors, resolutions, and processing levels. We applied this approach to train OmniCloudMask (OCM), a sensor-agnostic deep learning model that segments clouds and cloud shadow. OCM demonstrates robust state-of-the-art performance across various satellite platforms when classifying clear, cloud, and shadow classes, with balanced overall accuracy values across: Landsat (91.5 % clear, 91.5 % cloud, and 75.2 % shadow); Sentinel-2 (92.2 % clear, 91.2 % cloud, and 80.5 % shadow); and PlanetScope (96.9 % clear, 98.8 % cloud, and 97.4 % shadow). OCM achieves this accuracy while only being trained on a single Sentinel-2 dataset, employing spectral normalisation and mixed resolution training to address the spectral and spatial differences between satellite platforms. This approach allows the model to effectively handle imagery from different sensors within the 10 m to 50 m resolution range, as well as higher resolution imagery that has been resampled to 10 m. The OCM library is available as an open source Python package on PyPI."

 Characterizing sea surface temperature (SST) variability is a critical aspect of studying long-term changes in estuarine environments. However, the scales of estuarine variability and change can be quite small (10 m–10 km). In this study, we present the first combined analysis of an estuary using the 39-year-long SST evolution from the multi-satellite Landsat data (∼18 day average sampling), over a decade of in-situ buoy records (15 min. sampling), and tide gauges (60 min. sampling). We retrieved the seasonal-to-decadal sea surface and tidal temperature variabilities and trends over four decades in Narragansett Bay and its arm, Mt. Hope Bay. The seasonal solar heating, river run-off, and resulting salinity stratification, and bathymetry determine the dominant (∼80%) temperature variance in the bay. The warming trend of the annual mean SST is 0.057 ± 0.024 °C yr−1 for Narragansett Bay and 0.015 ± 0.018 °C yr−1 for Mt. Hope Bay. We classified each Landsat image by tidal phase using tide gauge measurements in order to produce composite SST anomaly maps corresponding to each tidal phase, but non-tidal noise made the signal trustworthy in only a few regions. High-frequency measurements reveal that tidal temperature changes are detectable and consistent at buoy sites but secondary to the temperature changes by season in the bay. The shallower, fresher upper bay shows greater SST variability than the lower bay, whose temperature approaches the more oceanic, less seasonal temperatures at the mouth. Importantly, our study represents the synergistic advantages of utilizing Landsat and in-situ buoy data to offer new and deeper insights into the changing conditions of global estuaries."

 Information regarding the spatial arrangement and extent of past habitats is important for understanding present biodiversity, restoration potential, and fighting extinction-debt effects. European landscapes have changed profoundly over recent decades, with the trend accelerating following World War 2. We develop a proof of concept for mapping historic habitat distribution for Switzerland from black and white aerial imagery compatible with the present-day habitat map. Recently available orthorectified 1946 aerial imagery (1 m resolution) was segmented based on spectral and shape characteristics for training areas (320–508 km2) representing the main biogeographical regions of Switzerland. Initial training data was derived by manual aerial orthoimage interpretation differentiating 15 habitat classes. A random forest model was trained to classify the segments using variables describing spectral information, image texture, segment shape, topography, climate, and anthropogenic influence. Classification accuracy was improved with additional training samples derived in a stepwise approach, applying three different sampling techniques. Highest class accuracies (producer’s and user’s accuracies ≥ 0.75) were achieved for the habitats ‘Standing water’, ‘Flowing water’, ‘Glaciers, permanent ice and snow’, and ‘Forests and other wooded land’. Particularly low user’s accuracies were found for ‘Wetlands’, ‘Hedges and tree rows’ and ‘Buildings’. The comparison to independent data further revealed minor differences in overall accuracy for the three different sampling strategies. Yet, map predictions sometimes varied substantially, indicating that the sampling strategies address different classification issues.

 Heterogeneous dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is an important reactive intermediate in the atmospheric nighttime oxidization of nitrogen oxides and in the formation of nitrate (NO3−) aerosols. However, vertical profiles of N2O5-related chemical species over Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) are currently lacking. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model was employed and simulated vertical profiles of nighttime N2O5-related chemical species to facilitate aircraft-based campaigns over the SMA. The vertical structures of the NO3 radical (NO3•) and N2O5 were assessed during the meteorologically stagnant period (March 16–17, 2016), which was a typical period of nighttime N2O5-driven NO3− formation in the study region. The results showed that nighttime vertical structures exhibiting higher concentrations of N2O5-related chemical species were strongly associated with the nocturnal residual layer (RL), which was decoupled from the ground. Our model showed diminished nighttime NO3• at the ground but active NO3• aloft, as it was retained in the RL. We also carried out the same analysis for the stagnant period (May 16–22, 2016) during the KORUS-AQ campaign, and confirmed the similar profiles of high concentration of NO3• near the altitude of RL. To sum up the cases from this study and KORUS-AQ campaign study, maximum nighttime NO3• and N2O5 concentrations occurred at heights of 78 ± 11% of RL height and 54 ± 15% of RL height, respectively. Although further research on nighttime N2O5 chemistry is needed to resolve outstanding uncertainties, the vertical structures of nighttime N2O5-related chemical species obtained in this study offer useful reference data for future aircraft campaigns."

 The study of the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) oxidative potential (OP), a general indicator of human health risks associated with PM exposure, has become a focal point in research. In Italy, the number of studies concerning OP is limited, especially for the fine fraction of PM. This study aims to compare the impact of different natural and anthropogenic sources on fine PM (PM2.5) and its OP on three areas of Southern Italy. A study of PM2.5 sources sampled at a rural site was carried out. The PM2.5 sources were identified and characterized with the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF5.0) model, while the contribution of each source to the OP estimated with the multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis. Results were compared with those obtained from two similar studies, related to different typology sites in south Italy. The PMF5.0 identified similar sources for the three sites, with different contributions to PM2.5 and OP. The MLR analysis highlights that combustion sources are the main contributors to the OP activity of PM2.5. The relative contributions to OP and PM2.5 are not comparable for all sources. Results of this study represent a contribution to a better understanding of the potential health impact caused by PM2.5; of its spatial variability; and role of different sources."

 Inappropriate reduction strategies can exacerbate ozone pollution. While previous research has primarily focused on developing emission reduction strategies for large areas, this study aimed to create a method for quickly planning emission reductions in subareas within a larger area. Using Taiwan (large area) as an example, this study illustrates how to determine the emission reductions required in each county (subarea) to achieve a 50% reduction in the number of DM8O3 (daily maximum 8-h average ozone) pollution station-days across the entire region (the preset goal). The methodology began with observational data to calculate the expected DM8O3 concentration improvements needed to meet the preset goal. CMAQ-DDM simulations were then conducted to evaluate cross-county O3 transport, revealing the reciprocal impact of emissions between counties on air quality. The results indicated that NOX emission reductions caused O3 deterioration, leading to a focus exclusively on NMHC reductions. A system of simultaneous linear equations was constructed to link emission reductions, the cross-county O3 transport, and the expected improvements. Linear programming was applied to calculate the required NMHC reductions for each county. The findings showed that most counties needed to reduce NMHC emissions by 30%–40%, while some required only 20%. CMAQ simulations of the improvements resulting from these emission reductions (referred to as validated improvements) confirmed that they met the expected improvements in most counties and across Taiwan as a whole. Finally, a nonlinear correction factor, defined as the ratio of validated to linear improvements, was introduced to refine the system of linear equations. This refinement effectively addressed the biases associated with using a system of linear equations to represent the nonlinear processes of ozone formation and ensured that all counties achieved their expected improvements."

 Subway stations are dynamic underground environments where air quality changes rapidly, primarily due to passenger occupancy patterns and the frequent arrival and departure of trains. However, traditional microbial monitoring methods are constrained by their temporal resolutions. To address this, we employed a real-time light-induced fluorescence-based bioaerosol monitoring instrument to detect the dynamics of particulate matters (PM) and classify them into fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAPs) or non-FBAPs based on the intrinsic fluorescent feature of bioaerosols. We deployed this sensor on the platform, in the station hall, and outdoors at a typical subway station for 18 days in Tianjin, China. The results showed that FBAP and non-FBAP concentrations on the platform were roughly 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than those in the station hall, and approximately 3 and 4 times higher than outdoor levels. Notably, the bacteria-like particle levels on the platform were 20 times higher than those outdoor values during most periods. The concentrations of PM, dominated by non-FBAP, peaked during the morning rush hours both on the platform and in the station hall, while the bacteria-like particles reached their lowest levels in the morning, presumably caused by the elevated metal particle levels when trains started operating that inhibit bacterial survival. Train operations strongly influenced non-FBAP concentrations on the platform, as evidenced by the 7-min periodic cycle in the particle autocorrelations corresponding to train schedules. By contrast, the particle levels in the station hall did not show train-related patterns in autocorrelations but showed stronger correlations with the environmental parameters. The revealed dynamic patterns of non-biological and biological airborne particles in the subway station provide insights for mitigating particle exposure in the future."

Gopalakrishnan;Sanjay Sharma,Simulation of premonsoon thunderclouds over two climatic regimes: evaluation and dichotomous detection,"•Simulations show better accuracy for CG flash over Rampurhat than Kohima. •Stronger convection/mixed-phase processes leading to higher lightning over Rampurhat. •Distinct regional thunderstorm development mechanisms impact model performance. •Correct Rejection Rate (CRR) is introduced to evaluate the model for non-thundercloud days. •Higher CRR in Rampurhat indicates better non-thundercloud rejection than Kohima. 
 This study investigates premonsoon (April) thundercloud properties over Northeastern (Kohima, 25.6°N, 94.1°E) and Eastern (Rampurhat, 24.2°N, 87.8°E) India. Thunderclouds were detected using Electric Field Mills (EFM-100) and Lightning Detectors (LD-350), while the WRF model was employed to simulate thundercloud properties. Simulations were performed across all 30 days in each region, regardless of actual thundercloud occurrence, to assess the model's accuracy in differentiating thundercloud and non-thundercloud days. The regional variability of cloud-to-ground (CG) flash density was well represented by the model, with higher flash densities in Rampurhat (mean: 39 × 10−4 km−2 h−1) compared to Kohima (mean: 31 × 10−4 km−2 h−1), consistent with observations. However, the model exhibited a slight overestimation in Kohima and an underestimation in Rampurhat, with spatiotemporal deviations from observations in both regions. Despite this, the simulations effectively captured regional differences in dynamical parameters (vertical velocity, wind shear) and microphysical properties (mixing ratios: qice, qgraupel, qcloud), with Rampurhat showing higher values overall. Six stability indices were evaluated to determine the most reliable indicator for distinguishing thundercloud/non-thundercloud days. In Kohima, the TT index (≥ 38 °C) was most effective, while in Rampurhat, CAPE (≥ 1680 J kg−1) proved more suitable, suggesting that distinct physical mechanisms drive thundercloud development in these regions. The dichotomous detection results for all 30 days in Kohima (Rampurhat) yielded 14 (21) successful detections, 5 (1) misses, 3 (1) false alarms, and 8 (7) correct rejections. We introduced the Correct Rejection Rate (CRR) to assess the model's performance in detecting non-thundercloud days, which showed better accuracy over Rampurhat than Kohima. The study underscores the heightened complexity of predicting thunderclouds over the hilly terrain of Northeastern India compared to the flatter terrain of Eastern India and offers valuable insights for improving strategies to mitigate lightning hazards."
