10.1088/1748-9326/adb444,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文研究了海平面上升对巴西亚马逊沿海湿地迁徙涉禽觅食栖息地的影响。研究重点是海岸线后退和潮滩沉积变化导致的栖息地丧失，以及涉禽如何应对因陆地栖息地海洋侵蚀而形成的潮滩区域。研究方法包括空中调查、卫星图像绘制潮滩分布图以及对涉禽猎物丰度和沉积物特征的采样。结果表明，涉禽会避开被侵蚀的区域作为觅食地，主要原因是这些区域猎物（一种名为Discapseudes surinamensis的甲壳类动物）的减少。因此，该论文主要关注生态学和生物学方面，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Carlos D Santos;Danielle Paludo;Paulo Silvestro;José O Monteiro;Paulo P G Pachelle;Verônica Oliveira;Jason A Mobley,Sea-level rise causes feeding habitat loss for migratory shorebirds in remote coastal wetlands of Brazilian Amazon,"Sea-level rise (SLR) can cause significant changes in coastal wetlands, such as the retreat of coastlines and sedimentary shifts in tidal flats. In areas lacking coastal defenses, rising sea levels are expected to drive the inland migration of coastal wetlands, generally maintaining the extent of tidal flat habitats but also triggering important ecosystem changes. Migratory shorebirds are apex predators in coastal wetlands, thus being highly sensitive to such changes. Despite the worldwide decline of this group of birds, the impacts of SLR on their habitats have not been readily evaluated. In this study, we investigated how migratory shorebirds are responding to the gradual occupation of tidal flats by areas originating from marine transgression of terrestrial habitats, which is a consequence of inland migration of coastal wetlands. We conducted aerial surveys to assess the distribution of shorebirds along 630 km of tidal flats in coastal wetlands of the Brazilian Amazon. We then mapped the distribution of tidal flats in the late 1980s and for the survey period using satellite imagery to identify the tidal areas created by marine transgression over the past four decades. Finally, we sampled these areas and nearby tidal flats to assess shorebird prey abundance and sediment characteristics. We found that shorebirds avoid transgressed areas as feeding grounds, with their numbers sharply declining with the increasing occupancy of this habitat. The dominant shorebird species, the semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), presented densities one order of magnitude lower in transgressed areas than in other tidal flats, indicating a clear response to the reduced availability of its main prey, the crustacean Discapseudes surinamensis. We conclude that, although inland migration of coastal wetlands may preserve the extent of tidal flats over time, their increased occupation by transgressed areas can lead to significant losses in feeding habitat for migratory shorebirds."

This study investigates the spatial distribution and long-range transport dynamics of VOCs over South Korea, using airborne observations conducted during the 2024 Asian Air Quality campaign. VOC concentrations were measured in urban, industrial, and long-range transport scenarios using proton transfer reaction-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography–MS with canister sampling. The results demonstrate that benzene shows significant vertical and spatial dispersion during long-range transport due to its intermediate atmospheric lifetime, which allows it to persist and impact downwind air quality. Additionally, Chlorinated VOCs, such as 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, display transport behaviors. Their relatively consistent concentrations during long-range transport emphasize the influence of industrial activities, including coal combustion and petrochemical processes, as major sources. Elevated levels of chlorinated VOCs were primarily associated with emissions from industrial regions in Chungnam, while aromatic VOCs were predominantly linked to urban traffic emissions. These findings underscore the need for international cooperation to combat transboundary pollution and highlight the importance of comprehensive air quality management strategies that address both urban and industrial emission sources. This study provides essential insights into the atmospheric behavior of VOCs and emphasizes the need for targeted policies to effectively regulate air pollution."

Our study analysed air quality data from 2003 to 2020 on the island Utö and employed modelling, showing a continuous decrease in SO2 concentrations since 2003 and thus evidencing the effectiveness of such regulations in improving air quality. It also underscored the importance of long-term, high-resolution monitoring at remote marine sites. 
 The designation of the Baltic Sea as a sulfur emission control area (SECA) in May 2006, with subsequent tightening of regulations in 2010 and 2015, has reduced the sulfuric emission from shipping traffic. This study assesses the impacts of SECA on observed SO2 concentrations by providing a long-term analysis of 1 min time-resolution air quality data from 2006 to 2020 on Utö (an island in the Baltic Sea) supported by the predictions from the Ship Traffic Emissions Assessment Model (STEAM). Additionally, 1 h resolution data from 2003 to 2005 are utilized to investigate changes due to the SECA limits set in 2006. The observed SO2 concentrations on Utö have continuously decreased since 2003 due to an overall decrease in SO2 emissions in northern Europe, combined with reduced emissions from shipping traffic due to SECA regulations. The 3-year average SO2 concentration dropped from pre-SECA (2003–2005) to post-SECA (2007–2009, 2011–2013, 2016–2018) periods by 38 %, 39 %, and 67 %, respectively. No clear trends were observed in the concentrations of other measured pollutants. Furthermore, we investigated wind-direction-resolved SO2 concentrations for 2 selected years (2014 and 2019), and the results showed a significant decrease in high-SO2-concentration shipping plumes due to the implementation of SECA in 2015. Our study brings out the importance of long-term, high-time-resolution air quality observations at a remote marine research station by providing means for both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the impacts of regulatory environmental legislation."

Employing PRISM (Plume-Rise-Iterative-Stratified-Moist), a new method, we found that considering these effects significantly improves predictions of pollutant dispersion. This insight enhances our understanding of environmental impacts, enabling more accurate air quality modelling and fostering more effective pollution management strategies. 
 Plume rise plays a critical role in dispersing pollutants emitted from tall stacks, dictating the height reached by buoyant plumes and their subsequent downwind dispersion. Commonly, plume rise is assumed to be governed by atmospheric stability and by the exit momentum and temperature of the effluent released from large stacks. However, an under-recognized influence on plume rise is the effects of entrained and/or co-emitted water, which can change the plume height due to exchange of latent heat associated with phase changes in within-plume water. While many of the stack sources achieve high temperatures of the emitted effluent via combustion, the impact of combustion-generated water on plume rise is often overlooked in large-scale air quality models. As the rising water condenses or evaporates, it releases or absorbs latent heat, influencing the height reached by the plumes. Our study investigates the effects of latent heat exchange by combustion-generated and entrained water on plume rise. We introduce a novel approach that integrates moist thermodynamics into an empirical parameterization for plume rise, resulting in the development of PRISM (Plume-Rise-Iterative-Stratified-Moist). Long-term (6-month duration) simulations using PRISM exhibit a difference of up to ±100 % in surface concentrations of emitted pollutants near industrial sources compared to previous predictions, emphasizing the substantial influence of moist thermodynamics on plume rise. Our results show up to 50 % improvement in model-simulated plume height through evaluation vs. aircraft observations over the Canadian oil sands. This study pioneers a plume rise sub-grid parameterization integrating moist thermodynamics in iterative calculation of neutral buoyancy height for plumes emitted from industrial stacks, thereby advancing our understanding of plume behaviour and enhancing the accuracy of air quality modelling. These advancements can potentially contribute to more effective pollution control strategies."

Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of aerosol samples from five regional sites (collected during the summer of 2021) identified oil sands operations as a measurable brown carbon source. Industrial aerosol emissions were unlikely to impact regional radiative forcing. These findings show that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to monitor brown carbon in the AOSR. 
 Extensive industrial operations in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) (Alberta, Canada) are a suspected source of water-soluble brown carbon  (WS-BrC), a class of light-absorbing organic aerosols capable of altering atmospheric solar-radiation budgets. However, the current understanding of  WS-BrC across the AOSR is limited, and the primary regional sources of these aerosols are unknown. During the summer of 2021, active filter-pack  samplers were deployed at five sites across the AOSR to collect total suspended particulate matter for the purpose of evaluating WS-BrC. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, complemented by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modelling, were employed for sample characterization. Aerosol absorbance was comparable between near-industry and remote field sites, suggesting that industrial WS-BrC exerted limited influence on regional radiative forcing. The combined EEM–PARAFAC method identified three fluorescent components (fluorophores), including one humic-like substance (C1) and two protein-like substances (C2 and C3). Sites near oil sands facilities and sample exposures receiving atmospheric transport from local industry (as indicated by back-trajectory analysis) displayed increased C1 and C3 fluorescence; moreover, both fluorophores were positively correlated with particulate elements (i.e. vanadium and sulfur) and gaseous pollutants (i.e. nitrogen dioxide and total reduced sulfur), indicative of oil sands emissions. The C2 fluorophore exhibited high emission intensity at near-field sites and during severe wildfire smoke events, while positive correlations with industry indicator variables suggest that C2 likely reflected both wildfire-generated and anthropogenic WS-BrC. These results demonstrate that the combined EEM–PARAFAC method is an accessible and cost-effective tool that can be applied to monitor industrial WS-BrC in the AOSR."

Ziemba;Paquita Zuidema;Armin Sorooshian,Sensitivity of aerosol and cloud properties to coupling strength of marine boundary layer clouds over the northwest Atlantic,"In situ aircraft data collected over the northwest Atlantic Ocean are utilized to compare aerosol conditions and turbulence between near-surface and below-cloud-base altitudes for different regimes of coupling strength between those two levels, along with how cloud microphysical properties vary across those regimes. Stronger coupling yields more homogenous aerosol structure vertically along with higher cloud drop concentrations and sea salt influence in clouds. 
 Quantifying the degree of coupling between marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds and the surface is critical for understanding the evolution of low clouds and explaining the vertical distribution of aerosols and microphysical cloud properties. Previous work has characterized the boundary layer as either coupled or decoupled, but this study rather considers four degrees of coupling, ranging from strongly to weakly coupled. We use aircraft data from the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) to assess aerosol and cloud characteristics for the following four regimes, quantified using differences in liquid water potential temperature (θℓ) and total water mixing ratio (qt) between flight data near the surface level (∼150 m) and directly below cloud bases: strong coupling (Δθℓ≤1.0 K, Δqt≤0.8 g kg−1), moderate coupling with high Δθℓ (Δθℓ>1.0 K, Δqt≤0.8 g kg−1), moderate coupling with high Δqt (Δθℓ≤1.0 K, Δqt>0.8 g kg−1), and weak coupling (Δθℓ>1.0 K, Δqt>0.8 g kg−1). Results show that (i) turbulence is greater in the strong coupling regime compared to the weak coupling regime, with the former corresponding to more vertical homogeneity in 550 nm aerosol scattering, integrated aerosol volume concentration, and giant aerosol number concentration (Dp>3 µm) coincident with increased MBL mixing; (ii) cloud drop number concentration is greater during periods of strong coupling due to the greater upward vertical velocity and subsequent activation of particles; and (iii) sea salt tracer species (Na+, Cl−, Mg2+, K+) are present in greater concentrations in the strong coupling regime compared to weak coupling, while tracers of continental pollution (Ca2+, non-sea-salt (nss) SO42-, NO3-, oxalate, and NH4+) are higher in mass fraction for the weak coupling regime. Additionally, pH and Cl-:Na+ (a marker for chloride depletion) are consistently lower in the weak coupling regime. There were also differences between the two moderate regimes: the moderate with high Δqt regime had greater turbulent mixing and sea salt concentrations in cloud water, along with smaller differences in integrated volume and giant aerosol number concentration across the two vertical levels compared. This work shows value in defining multiple coupling regimes (rather than the traditional coupled versus decoupled) and demonstrates differences in aerosol and cloud behavior in the MBL for the various regimes."

Scott Evans;Quan Gan;William McClintock;Jerry Lumpe,Remote sensing of lower-middle-thermosphere temperatures using the N2 Lyman–Birge–Hopfield (LBH) bands,"Temperature is essential to understanding the thermosphere. Most temperature measurements have been indirect or had large uncertainties, especially in the lower-middle thermosphere, where data are rarely available. Since October 2018, NASA’s GOLD mission has produced disk images of neutral temperatures near 160 km at locations over the Americas and Atlantic Ocean. This paper discusses both temperature retrieval techniques and issues in interpreting GOLD’s images of thermospheric temperatures. 
 The scientific and societal importance of short-term changes in the thermosphere–ionosphere (T–I) system highlights a need to better understand short-term changes in the thermosphere. For collision avoidance, this need becomes increasingly important as the number of low-earth-orbiting satellites increases because geomagnetic activity can cause dramatic, unexpected increases in satellite drag. The thermospheric density changes responsible for changes in drag depend primarily on changes in the thermospheric temperature. However, for collision avoidance, the specification of drag could also be problematic during quiet periods when the number of satellites and the uncertainties in their orbits are large. While temperatures and densities at higher altitudes (≳250 km) have been extensively studied and modeled, there is a knowledge gap for densities at lower-middle-thermosphere altitudes (≲200 km). At these lower altitudes, the primary sources of thermospheric density data, in situ and drag data from satellites, are rarely available. Remote sensing of temperatures and composition by NASA's Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission can help fill this gap. The GOLD mission produces disk images of neutral temperature, a key parameter for understanding neutral density in the lower-middle thermosphere. However, while disk images of the temperature have been available since the launch of GOLD, recent improvements to its observational capability that are relevant to data interpretation may not be widely known. Also, other temperature retrieval techniques than GOLD's have been published. Comparisons indicate that GOLD's technique gives the most consistent results and yields the lowest uncertainties. This paper discusses both temperature retrieval techniques and issues in interpreting GOLD's images of temperatures."

Nelson;Hannakaisa Lindqvist,A global perspective on CO2 satellite observations in high AOD conditions,"We find that small particles suspended in the air (aerosols) affect the satellite observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) made by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite instrument. Satellite estimates of CO2 appear to be too high for clean areas and too low for polluted areas. Our results show that CO2 and aerosols are often co-emitted, and this is partly masked out in the current retrievals. Correctly accounting for the aerosol effect is important for CO2 emission estimates by satellites. 
 Satellite-based observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are sensitive to all processes that affect the propagation of radiation in the atmosphere, including scattering and absorption by atmospheric aerosols. Therefore,  accurate retrievals of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) benefit from detailed information on the aerosol conditions. This is particularly relevant for future missions focusing on observing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, such as the Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring mission (CO2M). To fully prepare for CO2M observations, it is informative to investigate existing observations in addition to other approaches. Our focus here is on observations from the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission. In the operational full-physics XCO2 retrieval used to generate OCO-2 level 2 products, the aerosol properties are known to have high uncertainty, but their main objective is to facilitate CO2 retrievals. We evaluate the OCO-2 product from the point of view of aerosols by comparing the OCO-2-retrieved aerosol properties to collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua Dark Target aerosol products. We find that there is a systematic difference between the aerosol optical depth (AOD, τ) values retrieved by the two instruments such that τOCO-2∼0.4τMODIS. A similar difference is found when comparing OCO-2 with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This results in 16.5 % of cases being misclassified as low AOD (good quality) by the OCO-2 quality filtering. We also find a dependence of the XCO2 on the AOD difference, indicating an aerosol-induced effect in the XCO2 retrieval. Furthermore, comparing with the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), we find a small AOD-dependent bias in XCO2. In addition, we find a weak but statistically significant correlation between MODIS AOD and XCO2, which can be partly explained by natural covariance and co-emission of aerosols and CO2. Due to the co-emission, using an AOD threshold in the quality filtering leads to a sampling bias, where high XCO2 values are more often removed. To mitigate the effect of this on the anthropogenic CO2 emission monitoring, we investigate the effect of the AOD threshold on the fraction of acceptable XCO2 data. We find that relaxing the MODIS AOD threshold from 0.2 to 0.5, which is the goal for the CO2M, increases the fraction of acceptable data by 14 percentage points globally and by 31 percentage points for urban areas."

Despite their low C/No resolution (1 dB-Hz), we demonstrate that the recorded raw data can be used to estimate irregularity drifts. Further, our observations are consistent with the behavior of an empirical model of the thermospheric winds (HMW14). 
 Previous efforts have used pairs of closely spaced specialized receivers to measure Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and to estimate ionospheric irregularity drifts. The relatively high cost associated with commercial GNSS-based ionospheric receivers has somewhat limited their deployment and the estimation of ionospheric drifts. The development of an alternative, low-cost, GNSS-based scintillation monitor (ScintPi) motivated us to investigate the possibility of using it to overcome this limitation. ScintPi monitors can observe signals from geostationary satellites, which can greatly simplify the estimation of the drifts. We present the results of an experiment to evaluate the use of ScintPi 3.0 to estimate ionospheric irregularity drifts. The experiment consisted of two ScintPi 3.0 deployed in Campina Grande, Brazil (7.213° S, 35.907° W; dip latitude ∼ 14° S). The monitors were spaced at a distance of 140 m in the magnetic east–west direction and targeted the estimation of the zonal drifts associated with scintillation-causing equatorial spread F (ESF) irregularities. Routine observations throughout an entire ESF season (September 2022–April 2023) were made as part of the experiment. We focused on the results of irregularity drifts derived from geostationary satellite signals. The results show that the local time variation in the estimated irregularity zonal drifts is in good agreement with previous measurements and with the expected behavior of the background zonal plasma drifts. Our results also reveal a seasonal trend in the irregularity zonal drifts. The trend follows the seasonal behavior of the zonal component of the thermospheric neutral winds as predicted by the Horizontal Wind Model (HMW14). This is explained by the fact that low-latitude ionospheric F-region plasma drifts are controlled, in great part, by Pedersen-conductivity-weighted flux-tube-integrated zonal neutral winds. The results confirm that ScintPi has the potential to contribute to new, cost-effective measurements of ionospheric irregularity drifts, in addition to scintillation and total electron content. Furthermore, the results indicate that these new ScintPi measurements can provide insight into ionosphere–thermosphere coupling."

 This article presents a simple method for determining greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2 and N2O) using an alternative new set-up of the chromatographic system. The novelty of the presented method is the application of a Carboxen 1010 PLOT capillary column for separation of trace gases – CH4, CO2 and N2O – from air samples and their detection using a barrier discharge ionisation detector (BID). Simultaneously, a parallel molecular sieve column RT-Msieve 5A connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) allowed the determination of CH4, N2 and O2 concentrations from 0.2 % to 100 %. The system was equipped with an autosampler transferring the samples without air contamination thanks to a vacuum pump and inert gas flushing. Method validation was performed using commercial gas standards and comparative measurement of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations applying cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). A 3 d continuous measurement series of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in ambient air and tests of typical vial sample measurements with increased GHG concentrations were performed.The advantage of this method is that the system is easy to set up and allows for simultaneous detection and analysis of the main GHGs using one gas chromatography (GC) column and one detector, thereby omitting the need for an electron capture detector (ECD) containing radiogenic components for N2O analysis and a flame ionisation detector (FID) with a methaniser for low-concentration CO2 samples.

Based on cross-validation tests with spatially-separated training and test subset locations, the resulting products showed equal or better interpolative accuracy compared to standard climatological products from the World Ocean Atlas 2023 and GLODAPv2, and also compared to existing non-climatological products from machine learning and biogeochemical reanalysis/hindcast datasets from CMEMS/Copernicus. The new products showed skill in tracking smooth seasonal and interannual variations not included in the standard climatologies, and improved spatial coverage and detail resolution in northern/Arctic regions, compared to all tested alternatives. Significant uncertainties remained, however, largely due to sparse observational coverage in seasonal and permanent ice-covered regions, and limited resolution in coastal regions.

Traditional models use double precision for accuracy, which is computationally expensive. Lower precision reduces costs but can introduce errors. The quasi-double-precision (QDP) algorithm helps mitigate these errors. This study applies the QDP algorithm to the Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere, showing reduced errors and computational time, making it an efficient solution for large-scale simulations. 
 The limitations of high-performance computing (HPC) significantly constrain the development of numerical models. Traditional numerical models often employ double precision to ensure result accuracy, but this comes at a high computational cost. While using lower precision can substantially reduce computational expenses, it may introduce round-off errors that can affect accuracy under certain conditions. The quasi-double-precision algorithm (QDP algorithm) compensates for these round-off errors by maintaining corrections, thus improving result accuracy. To investigate the effectiveness of this algorithm at enhancing the accuracy of numerical model results, this paper applies it to the single-precision version of the Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere (MPAS-A), and its performance is evaluated across two idealized and two real-data cases. The results show that the application of the QDP algorithm reduces the surface pressure bias by 68 %, 75 %, 97 %, and 96 % in the respective cases. Compared to double-precision experiments, the runtime is reduced by 28.6 %, 28.5 %, 21.1 %, and 5.7 %. This study demonstrates that the QDP algorithm provides effective and cost-efficient computational capabilities for numerical models."

Johnson,Identifying Critical Land Use Thresholds for Biodiversity Conservation in China’s Lake Ecosystems,"Aquatic biodiversity loss, particularly in rapidly developing nations, continues to raise concerns, prompting urgent debates on reconciling economic growth with environmental preservation through land use planning. While spatial variations in aquatic communities along land use gradients are well-documented,  precise ecological thresholds for land use impacts on freshwater lakes remain elusive, hindering sustainable development efforts. This study investigated six representative freshwater lakes in China between 2019 and 2020, all significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities. We utilized macroinvertebrate communities as bioindicators and employed four categories of aquatic ecological metrics─taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, pollution tolerance, and water quality─to assess their responses to local land use patterns. Macroinvertebrate community composition varied significantly among the studied lakes, with pollution-tolerant taxa predominating in highly urbanized and eutrophic systems. Notably, benthic communities exhibited greater sensitivity to urban land use (ecological thresholds: 2–10%) compared to agricultural land use (thresholds: 15–40%). The most pronounced responses were observed within 1–5 km of the lakeshore, with circular buffers yielding more significant effects than fan-shaped buffers, excluding water areas. A novel land use intensity indicator─the ratio of nonecological to ecological land (NEL/EL = area of nonecological land/area of ecological land)─proved effective in predicting ecological shifts. Smaller or heavily urbanized lakes showed marked changes at NEL/EL ratios between 0 and 0.6, while larger or river-connected lakes exhibited shifts at ratios exceeding 1.5. These findings underscore the profound ecological footprint of human activities on lake ecosystems with urban land cover emerging as the most deleterious factor."

To evaluate the efficacy of indicators, a quantitative approach is needed that aligns with the regulatory framework, in which a benchmark value represents an unacceptably high level of a contaminant or contaminant class. This policy microsimulation study develops such an approach in the context of potential regulatory revisions to address brominated HAAs, a class of disinfection byproducts. Likely scenarios include a limit on the sum of nine brominated and chlorinated HAAs (HAA9), on bromide, or on the sum of six brominated HAAs (HAA6Br). The probability of each potential regulatory indicator co-occurring with a high level of HAA6Br was quantified using logistic models. The HAA9 and bromide indicators both performed poorly, with no better than a ∼1 in 4 chance of identifying equivalently high levels of HAA6Br. Furthermore, high false positive rates (>75%) would implicate a substantial number of water systems that do not have high HAA6Br levels. This study reveals the trade-off implicit in the use of regulatory indicators, in which precision (fewer false positives) must be sacrificed to achieve greater coverage (more true positives). The methodology and findings have broad implications for evaluating indicator classes in drinking water policy and research."

However, extensive in-source fragmentation hampers de novo structure elucidation of novel substances that are absent from EI databases. To address this problem, a new method based on GC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) coupled to ion mobility-high resolution mass spectrometry (IM-HRMS) was developed for simultaneous target, suspect, and nontarget screening of HOCs. Of 102 target chemicals, 85.3% produced (quasi-)molecular ions as base peaks, while 71.6% displayed method detection limits lower than those of GC-EI-low resolution MS. The optimized method was applied to standard reference sediment and sediments from the Baltic Sea, an Arctic shelf, and a Norwegian lake. In total, we quantified 56 target chemicals with concentrations ranging from 4.86 pg g–1 to 124 ng g–1 dry weight. Further, using a combination of full scan mass spectrum, retention time, collision cross section (CCS), and fragmentation spectrum, a total of 54 suspects were identified at Confidence Level (CL) 2. Among the remaining features, 169 were prioritized using a halogen-selective CCS cutoff (100 Å2 + 20% mass), leading to annotation of 54 substances (CL ≤ 3). Notably, a suite of fluorotelomer thiols, disulfides, and alkyl sulfones were identified in sediment (CL 1–2) for the first time.

However, many atmospheric inverse models fail to adequately incorporate the spatial and temporal correlations inherent in satellite observations and often lack rigorous methods for estimating parameters like spatial length scales. We introduce an inference model that processes the spatiotemporal covariance in satellite data and estimates hyperparameters such as covariance length scales. Our approach uses the Gaussian process (GP) machine learning (ML) and modern probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) to perform atmospheric inversions of emissions from satellite data. We develop a GP ML inversion system based on modern PPLs and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, simulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations corresponding to the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2/3 (OCO-2/3) data for July 2020. In our supervised learning framework, we treat the GEOS-Chem simulated data set as the target, with predictors derived by scaling the target with sector-specific factors hidden from the GP machine. Our results show that the GP model, combined with GPU-enabled PPLs, effectively retrieves true emission scaling factors and infers noise levels concealed within the data.

In this study, samples from multiple locations within a relatively small area (20 × 20 m2) contaminated with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) were compared to examine their physicochemical and microbial properties. Unsupervised clustering analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenome shotgun sequencing data indicates that the indigenous community differentiated into three distinct patterns. In Cluster 1, Pseudomonas, with multiple monooxygenases and glutathione S-transferase (GST), was enriched in samples contaminated with high concentrations of BTEX and CAHs. Cluster 2 contained a high fraction of cometabolic degraders. Cluster 3 was dominated by Ralstonia and organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRBs) mediating the reductive dechlorination of CAHs. Significant differences in composition and function among microbiomes were attributed to the differential distribution of organic pollutants, even in such a small area.

In this study, we developed straw carbon-coated nanowires (SC/NWs) as an effective bactericidal material for water disinfection. The thermal decomposition of rice straw produced an sp2-structured, amorphous carbon layer with oxygen-containing functional groups and hetero atoms on its surface. The SC coating enhanced the bactericidal performance of Cu(OH)2 NWs by more than 3-log, achieving >6-log inactivation of Escherichia coli at a flux of 2000 L m–2 h–1. The bacteria exposed to SC/NWs suffered extensive membrane disruption and lost cellular integrity. In contrast, the uncoated NWs caused limited damage to the bacteria. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the SC coating had strong van der Waals and electrostatic interactions with bacterial membranes, and these attractive forces led to efficient rupture of bacteria during water flow. The SC/NWs were used to disinfect real water samples, including tap water and reclaimed water, with >6-log reductions in bacterial counts during storage. Importantly, no bacterial reactivation was observed after 24 h of storage, which indicated that the SC/NWs caused irreversible membrane damage to the bacteria.

However, recent decades have seen the Pacific Walker circulation strengthen despite a weakening convective mass flux. Here, we conduct a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) experiments to separate the effects of global warming from changes in SST patterns. The tropical‐mean convective mass flux weakens in proportion to the global warming amplitude, largely unaffected by SST pattern changes. Conversely, the Walker circulation response is sensitive to SST pattern changes, weakening with global warming if zonal SST contrast decreases or increases below a certain threshold and strengthening if the increase in SST contrast exceeds that threshold. Thus, the Walker circulation might continue to strengthen if the SST pattern effects dominate.

Based on 6 year observations from Van Allen Probes, we compare the statistical distributions of IEs with electron acceleration events outside the plasmasphere (OEs). We find that most IEs were observed at L < 4.0 at energies below ∼1.5 MeV, with weaker acceleration ratio (<10) and larger event numbers (peaking value reaching >200), compared to stronger but less frequently occurred (peaking event numbers only reaching ∼80) OEs that were mostly observed at L > 4.0. The evolution of electron phase space density of a typical IE shows signature of inward radial diffusion or transport. Our study provides a feasible mechanism for IE, which is the results of the inward radial transport of the electron acceleration in the outer region of outer belt."

Several gridded satellite‐based precipitation products with global coverage, such as the Integrated Multi‐satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) family of products, are available worldwide. However, the accuracy of these products may vary due to retrieval algorithms or geographic location. Numerous correction techniques have been implemented, and machine learning techniques, especially Deep Neural Networks, have proven to be the most effective in improving precipitation estimation. This study aims to investigate the performance of the PERSIANN‐Dynamic Infrared Rain Rate near real‐time product (PDIR‐Now) in the Western U.S. and assess the effectiveness of three deep learning models including U‐Net, Efficient‐UNet, and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) in correcting biases present in the product. The developed models are expected to be more accurate than traditional methods, as they include digital elevation information and can resolve complex orographic enhancements in precipitation processes. This incorporation will mitigate the bias associated with SPPs, enabling further potential applications in water resource management. The findings revealed that the corrected results, utilizing the Efficient‐UNet and cGAN models, surpassed the original PDIR‐Now product and U‐Net model across various statistical and categorical metrics at different temporal scales. This bias‐correction scheme will enhance the assessment and understanding of precipitation patterns and can be used to improve the quality of precipitation estimates in other regions."

In climate models, the greenhouse aspect is prescribed with urbanization and emission trajectories embedded in socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). However, the biophysical aspect is omitted because no models currently simulate spatially explicit urban land transition. Urban land is typically warmer than adjacent natural land due to a large urban‐versus‐natural land contrast in biophysical properties. The lack of biophysical representation of urbanization in climate models raises the possibility that model projection of future warming may be biased low, especially in areas with intense urban land expansion. Here, we conduct a global sensitivity study using a dynamic urban scheme in the Community Earth System Model to quantify the biophysical effect of urban land expansion under the SSP5‐RCP8.5 scenario. Constant urban radiative, thermal, and morphological properties are used. We find that the biophysical effect depends on land aridity. In climate zones where surface evaporation is water‐limited, the biophysical effect causes a significant increase in air temperature (0.28 ± 0.19 K; mean ± one standard deviation of nine ensemble pairs; p < 0.01) in areas where urban expansion exceeds 5% by 2070. The majority of this warming signal is attributed to an indirect effect associated with atmospheric and land feedback, with the direct effect of land replacement playing a minor role. These atmospheric feedback processes, including solar brightening, soil drying, and stomatal closure, act to enhance the warming initiated by surface property changes of urban land replacement."

However, the impact and its pathways remain poorly understood. This study investigates the contributions of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from Lake Taihu to O3 formation in surrounding regions using a numerical approach. Composite analysis, case studies, and process analysis reveal that BVOC emissions from Lake Taihu increase hourly near‐surface O3 concentrations, with a maximum rise of 25.5 μg m−3, improving model performance. The influence of lake BVOC emissions is large on the northwest side of Lake Taihu, primarily determined by the spatial emission patterns and dominant wind fields. The development of the planetary boundary layer, particularly the thermal internal boundary layer, and the enhanced lake breeze play important roles in increasing near‐surface O3 levels over land, whereas variations in temperature play a minor role. Vertical cross‐sections show that interactions between land‐lake breezes and background wind fields are critical for O3 transport, increasing surface concentrations in surrounding areas. Additionally, lake BVOC emissions intensify both daytime and nighttime gas‐phase chemical formation of O3, consuming nitrates and producing additional O3 within the lower troposphere. This study highlights the importance of local thermal circulations and lake BVOC emissions in O3 pollution, emphasizing the need for comprehensive air pollution control strategies in lakeside cities."

We compared the responses of the hydrological cycle with different timescales between land and ocean within approximately 5 years after the eruption. On land, because of a decrease in shortwave radiation (SW) due to the volcanic forcing, evaporation and precipitation decreased immediately after the eruption, and also cloud cover decreased and worked to increase SW, contrary to the volcanic forcing. In the ocean, the decrease in precipitation was more pronounced after approximately a year after the eruption. Thus, we noted a clear land‐ocean contrast in weakening the global average response of the hydrological cycle. The global mean gross primary production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems has increased since the eruption. This increase is mainly due to the rise of tropical GPP, which was attributable to the reduced cloud cover caused by volcanic force. While the volcanic forcing decreased SW in most terrestrial areas, the reduced cloud cover contributed to the GPP increase through the increase in SW. The relationship between these responses highlights the importance of reducing uncertainty in Earth system models related to the response of the hydrological cycle, such as clouds, to reduce uncertainty in the carbon cycle's response to volcanic eruptions."

However, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) induced by grassland reclamation are poorly quantified due to the scarcity of large‐scale‐sampling data. Through paired sampling of 101 cropland and 101 grassland plots, this study examined changes in SOC resulting from conversion of grassland to cropland in an agropastoral ecotone of northern China. Results showed that grassland reclamation caused an average decrease of 16.07% in the surface (0–10 cm) SOC content. Over 80% of this region experienced SOC loss, while less than 20% showed increased SOC. As grassland soil organic carbon increased, the sensitivity of soil organic carbon changes to climate change following grassland‐to‐cropland conversion decreased, while the positive effects of changes in water flux and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) strengthened. The most important factor influencing the change in SOC after grassland reclamation was the change in NDVI in low and medium SOC grasslands and the change in vegetation transpiration in high‐SOC grasslands. This study found spatial heterogeneity in the effects of grassland reclamation on SOC at the regional scale and offers insights into enhancing regional SOC sequestration."

 Human Th17/type 17 cells express the chemokine receptor CCR6, but the functions of CCR6 and other chemokine receptors in human type 17 Th cell extravasation have not been fully delineated. Here we show that human peripheral blood CD4+CCR6+ T cells co-expressing CCR2 have a pathogenic Th17 signature, can produce inflammatory cytokines without T cell receptor activation, and show enhanced expression of pathogenicity-associated and activation-associated genes in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis as compared to controls. In flow chambers with activated endothelial cell (EC) monolayers, CD4+CCR6+CCR2+ T cells are efficient at transendothelial migration (TEM). Ligands for CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR3 localize to EC surfaces and mediate only arrest, whereas CCR2 ligands fail to bind well to ECs and mediate only TEM. Conversely, expressing a chimeric CCR2 ligand engineered to bind glycosaminoglycans on ECs results in CCR2-mediated arrest but blocks TEM induction. Our results from human pathogenic-like type 17 cells thus suggest that T cell migration arrest requires chemokine bound to EC surfaces, whereas TEM requires a transendothelial chemokine gradient.

 Early-onset lung cancer in young adults represents a less studied clinical entity with increasing incidence which still affects a large number of cancer patients. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of early-onset lung cancer for the clinicopathological features, genomic alterations, gene expression, and immune landscape by establishing a cohort enrolling 421 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from ten medical centers in China. Comparative analysis reveals a distinct genomic alteration between younger and elder patients with NSCLC, with ERBB2 mutations and ALK-rearrangement strikingly more frequent in younger group. Transcriptome profiling indicates altered cellular metabolism and immune-related genes in tumors from younger patients. Immunological analysis reveals a decreased infiltration of immune cells (notably T cells) in tumors from younger patients. Cellular and mechanistic studies show that the prevalent ERBB2 mutants in cancer from younger patients can indeed drive tumorigenesis by elevating AKT signaling. Importantly, meta-analysis of clinical trials and our clinical practice further validate the promise of HER2-targeted therapy to treat early-onset NSCLC in East Asian patients. Our comprehensive and integrative analysis not only reveal multiple unrecognized characteristics of early-onset lung cancer, but also inform actionable therapeutics to manage this type of cancer.

The polymer library exhibits considerably tunable performance: glass-transition temperatures of −36–72 °C, melting temperatures of 43–133 °C, degradability, thermoplastics/elastomers, and thioester-based functions. This study furnishes a facile method to precisely incorporate thioester bonds into sequence-controlled polymers. The precise placement of thioester bonds into sequence-controlled polymers remains challenging.

 Re-oxidation of Cr(III) in treated Cr-contaminated sites poses a considerable source of Cr(VI) pollution, necessitating stable treatment solutions for long-term control. This study explores the immobilization of Cr(VI) into chromite, the most stable and weathering-resistant Cr-bearing mineral, under ambient conditions. Batch experiments demonstrate chromite formation at pH above 7 and Fe(III)/Cr(III) ratios exceeding 1, with Fe(III) occupying all tetrahedral sites, essential for stability. A theoretical model is developed to evaluate the effects of pH and Fe(III)/Cr(III) ratios on chromite crystallinity, resulting in AI4Min-Cr, a publicly accessible platform offering real-time intelligent remediation strategies. To tackle the complexities of non-point source Cr pollution, we employ microbial methods to regulate on-site Eh and pH, optimizing chromite precipitation. Long-term stability tests confirm that chromite remained stable for over 180 days, with potential for magnetic separation recovery. This study presents a mineralogical strategy to address re-oxidation and Cr resource recovery in Cr-contaminated water and soil.

 The diverse biotas of the world’s mountains face a challenging future due to increasing threats like climate change, land-use change, and biological invasions, the last being particularly understudied in these regions. Here we compile occurrence records for 717 alien vertebrate species distributed in 2984 mountains worldwide. We analyze their distribution, biogeographic origin, presence in protected areas, and the drivers’ explaining alien vertebrate richness in mountains. We find that the alien vertebrates most frequently recorded are birds (318 species) and mammals (161 species) reported in 2595 and 1518 mountains globally, respectively. The Palearctic, Nearctic, and Australasian realms are the most common recipients; the Nearctic, Indo-Malay, and Afrotropic realms are the most frequent donors. Almost 50% of the alien species studied also occur in protected areas. Proxies of anthropogenic impacts (e.g., higher road density or lower biodiversity intactness) and mountains’ physical characteristics (e.g., elevation range and roughness) explain the distribution of alien vertebrates in mountains. Importantly, the magnitude of invasions in tropical mountains could be underestimated due to sampling bias towards the Northern Hemisphere and Australia. Our large-scale assessment reveals the advance of alien vertebrates in mountains worldwide and urges attention to minimize the impacts of biological invasions on the exceptional mountain biotas.

This phenomenon exhibits remarkable diversity and is commonly classified into two groups based on the location of maximum sea surface temperature anomalies. One of the two flavors with the maximum anomalous warming in the central equatorial Pacific is called El Niño Modoki. It has been suggested that anomalous zonal advection primarily contributes to the development of the positive sea surface temperature anomalies.

 Nucleation and subsequent growth of new aerosol particles in the atmosphere is a major source of cloud condensation nuclei and persistent large uncertainty in climate models. Newly formed particles need to grow rapidly to avoid scavenging by pre-existing aerosols and become relevant for the climate and air quality. In the continental atmosphere, condensation of oxygenated organic molecules is often the dominant mechanism for rapid growth. However, the huge variety of different organics present in the continental boundary layer makes it challenging to predict nanoparticle growth rates from gas-phase measurements. Moreover, recent studies have shown that growth rates of nanoparticles derived from particle size distribution measurements show surprisingly little dependency on potentially condensable vapors observed in the gas phase. Here, we show that the observed nanoparticle growth rates in the sub-10 nm size range can be predicted in the boreal forest only for springtime conditions, even with state-of-the-art mass spectrometers and particle sizing instruments. We find that, especially under warmer conditions, observed growth is slower than predicted from gas-phase condensation. We show that only a combination of simple particle-phase reaction schemes, phase separation due to non-ideal solution behavior, or particle-phase diffusion limitations can explain the observed lower growth rates. Our analysis provides first insights as to why atmospheric nanoparticle growth rates above 10 nm h−1 are rarely observed. Ultimately, a reduction of experimental uncertainties and improved sub-10 nm particle hygroscopicity and chemical composition measurements are needed to further investigate the occurrence of such a growth rate-limiting process."

Results show warming significantly influences infections across seasonal, interannual, and decadal scales. Higher temperatures significantly impact infection rates, especially in autumn and winter, with long-lasting effects extending 5-6 years. Sustained warming lowers the total infection numbers compared to pre-warming levels. When winter and summer experience simultaneous warming, infection fluctuations during the warming period are mainly driven by winter warming. Winter warming also lowers the peak-to-trough infection ratio, reducing epidemic intensity fluctuations. Additionally, parameter choices can significantly affect the impact of warming on infection rates. Warming of varying intensity and duration can significantly impact influenza outbreaks, potentially altering their seasonal patterns in a global warming context."

Nonetheless, the rainfall is more intense on the right side of landfalling TCs compared with oceanic TCs.

 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a tipping climatic component, has a quasi-global impact and it could induce a cascade of critical transitions. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the location of the overturning circulation’s current state relative to its stability thresholds. We identify similarities between observational and simulated spatial patterns, bifurcation diagrams and phase spaces linked with AMOC changes. The resemblances suggest that the overturning already underwent a Hopf bifurcation and entered a bistable regime before 1854, that it suffered a Rate-induced tipping around 1970, possibly linked with the Great Salinity Anomaly, and that it approached the attractor of its weak state. These changes in the overturning circulation dynamics are indicative of complex structural stability variations during the preindustrial revolution, which underline the need for a long-term temporal assessment of the overturning circulation stability on multi-centennial to millennial time-scales, to set its contemporary and future evolution in a long-term context."

 Turbidity currents carve Earth’s deepest canyons, form Earth’s largest sediment deposits, and break seabed telecommunications cables. Directly measuring turbidity currents is notoriously challenging due to their destructive impact on instruments within their path. This is especially the case for canyon-flushing flows that can travel >1000 km at >5 m/s, whose dynamics are poorly understood. We deployed ocean-bottom seismometers safely outside turbidity currents, and used emitted seismic signals to remotely monitor canyon-flushing events. By analyzing seismic power variations with distance and signal polarization, we distinguish signals generated by turbulence and sediment transport and document the evolving internal speed and structure of flows. Flow-fronts have dense near-bed layers comprising multiple surges with 5-to-30-minute durations, continuing for many hours. Fastest surges occur 30–60 minutes behind the flow-front, providing momentum that sustains flow-fronts for >1000 km.

 In the fields of computer graphics, computer vision and photogrammetry, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a major topic driving current research and development. However, the quality of NeRF-generated 3D scene reconstructions and subsequent surface reconstructions, heavily relies on the network output, particularly the density. Regarding this critical aspect, we propose to utilize NeRF-Ensembles that provide a density uncertainty estimate alongside the mean density. We demonstrate that data constraints such as low-quality images and poses lead to a degradation of the rendering quality, increased density uncertainty and decreased predicted density. Even with high-quality input data, the density uncertainty varies based on scene constraints such as acquisition constellations, occlusions and material properties. NeRF-Ensembles not only provide a tool for quantifying the uncertainty but exhibit two promising advantages: Enhanced robustness and artifact removal. Through the mean densities, small outliers are removed, yielding a smoother output with improved completeness. Furthermore, applying a density uncertainty-guided artifact removal in post-processing proves effective for the separation of object and artifact areas.

 Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in atmospheric PM significantly impacts climate and health. However, China's air pollution control on CDOM is unclear. To evaluate the effect of the Blue Sky Defense Battle (BSDB) on the pollution characteristics and sources of CDOM, we comprehensively analyzed 1,428 PM2.5 samples in Xi'an (2016-2022). Compared with the pre-BSDB period, we found a 17% increase in the air quality index and a 42% reduction in CDOM pollution levels. Furthermore, in winter, carbonaceous aerosol concentrations notably declined, with OC decreased by 25% and EC by 74%. Additionally, CDOM in Xi'an was predominantly composed of humic chromophores (80%), and the highly oxygenated humic-like substances (HO-HULIS) declined by 34%, effectively reducing the potential oxidative toxicity risks. Source apportionment results from the excitation-emission matrix fluorescence fingerprinting technique with the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model demonstrated that the effective control of combustion sources was the main driver of changes in atmospheric concentrations, chemical composition, and optical properties. Based on the NMF model analysis of carbonaceous aerosol, the source contributions of atmospheric oxidation and photochemical reactions increased after the BSDB indicating the limited control of the secondary sources. Additionally, the ineffective control of dust sources and the increasing contribution of external transport to CDOM after the BSDB highlighted the importance of effective dust management and regional collaborative control.

 The COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the Omicron-22 lockdown in Shanghai, provided a unique opportunity to examine the influence of lockdown and decreasing human activities on the urban atmosphere environment. Here, we explored the chemical compositions and sources of carbonaceous aerosols during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods in 2022, Shanghai. The mean concentrations of organic carbon (OC) and element carbon (EC) were 4.40 ± 1.58 and 1.05 ± 0.41 μg/m3 pre-lockdown, 1.60 ± 0.99 and 0.30 ± 0.13 μg/m3 during lockdown, and 2.66 ± 2.01 and 0.47 ± 0.19 μg/m3 post-lockdown, respectively. Normal alkanes (n-alkanes) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations were 27.5 ± 9.77 and 1.81 ± 1.34 ng/m3 pre-lockdown, 10.6 ± 5.84 and 1.50 ± 0.67 ng/m3 during lockdown, and 7.27 ± 3.86 and 1.44 ± 0.23 ng/m3 post lockdown, respectively, with a further decline noted post-lockdown. A notable decrease in carbonaceous aerosols was observed during the lockdown. Carbonaceous aerosols showed a marked decrease during the lockdown, with OC and EC increasing by 60% post-lockdown, while n-alkanes and PAHs continued to decline. Although the composition of OC, EC, and PAHs remained stable, n-alkanes, particularly C29-C34, significantly increased due to plant wax emissions. Source apportionment indicated that coal combustion and industrial emissions were the primary contributors across all periods, with reduced transport emissions having limited impact on OC, EC, and PAH sources. This study highlights the air quality improvements from reduced anthropogenic activities, offering insights for future pollution mitigation policies."

 The extensive daily statistics of aerosol properties, cloud properties, and their mutual correlations provide crucial information for better assessing future climate change. In this paper, 14 years (2010–2023) of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are analyzed over the northern part of Arabian Sea (Latitude: 21°–25° N and Longitude: 62°–68° E) to assess the characteristics of aerosols and clouds and their relationships under different meteorological conditions. When aerosol optical depth (AOD) is less than ∼ 0.7, the observations exhibit a positive correlation between AOD and cloud droplet effective radius (CDR) but negative correlations between AOD and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), between AOD and cloud optical depth (COD), between AOD and cloud liquid water path (CLWP), and between AOD and cloud geometrical thickness (H). The corresponding aerosol-cloud correlations change signs when the AOD values are larger than 0.7. However, the single folded positive AOD-cloud fraction (CF) relationship is observed in both AOD regimes. Similar correlations are also observed between precipitable water vapor (PWV) and CDR, CDNC, COD, H, CF and CLWP, together with a positive correlation between PWV and AOD. Further isolation of the environmental effects from aerosol effects by stratifying AOD and cloud data into different LTS and PWV bins shows that the signature of the well-known Twomey effect is observed under high LTS-high PWV conditions, while an opposite effect (anti-Twomey) is observed under low PWV conditions, regardless of LTS values. Additionally, negative correlations between AOD and COD, AOD and CLWP, and AOD and H are observed under low LTS, regardless of PWV conditions, with a slight positive correlation when AOD >0.4 under high LTS and PWV conditions."

 A climatological study of 206 severe convective wind (SCW) events from April to September during 2016–2023 in Beijing was conducted. Results show events primarily occur in summer, with a peak in the afternoon and a much weaker secondary peak in the early morning. They are relatively more frequent in mountainous areas than in plains，with the southern foothills of Yanshan Mountain being the most affected area.Circulation patterns associated with SCW events, ranked by frequency, include the low-pressure vortex-subtropical high, deep trough, low-level jet, subtropical high periphery, transverse trough, dual low-pressure vortex, and easterly flow patterns. Convective organization modes, also ranked by frequency, consist of cluster cells, broken line, nonlinear-shaped systems, hybrid systems, squall line, individual cell, and bow echo. SCW events are mainly triggered by convective systems coming from the northwest and west. In environments with high precipitable water, such as the low-level jet and subtropical high periphery patterns, nonlinear-shaped and hybrid systems are more prevalent. In contrast, in very dry environments, such as the deep trough pattern, broken lines and cluster cells occur more frequently. Strongly organized convective systems, such as squall lines and bow echoes, often exist in circulations with a westerly low-pressure vortex. Generally, a drier atmospheric environment tends to produce stronger winds, while moist conditions increase the frequency of SCW events. These findings highlight the influence of circulation patterns and environmental conditions in SCW events."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.107994,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了中国东部和美国东部低云频率差异的原因，重点关注气溶胶的影响。研究利用无线电探空仪观测数据，发现中国东部的低云发生频率低于美国东部，并且中国东部的气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）较高，湿度较低。研究探讨了AOD和相对湿度（RH）对低云频率的影响，发现较高的AOD通常会增加低层大气稳定性并降低行星边界层高度，而较低的RH会增加抬升凝结高度。这些因素共同作用，降低了低云形成的概率。此外，AOD对低云频率的影响还取决于RH的条件。总的来说，这项研究有助于更深入地理解气溶胶对低云发生的影响机制，并有助于减少未来气候变化预测中模拟高度分辨低云频率的不确定性。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的空气质量监测技术，但它对大气成分（特别是气溶胶）与云之间的关系进行了研究，这与大气环境遥感技术领域密切相关。,"['aerosols', 'low cloud frequency', 'aerosol optical depth (AOD)', 'surface relative humidity (RH)', 'radiosonde observations', 'planetary boundary layer height (PBLH)', 'lifting condensation level (LCL)', 'climate change']",Hui Xu;Jianping Guo;Tianmeng Chen;Yinjun Wang;Jianbo Deng;Bing Tong,Do aerosols induce the differences in low cloud frequency between eastern China and eastern United States?,"•Radiosonde observations reveal less low cloud occurrence in eastern China than in eastern USA. •Higher AOD and drier climate result in a lower OFLC in eastern China. •The effect of AOD on OFLC depends on surface RH conditions. •Under high RH conditions, OFLC tends to decrease significantly with increasing AOD. 
 Low cloud exerts significant cooling effect on climate system. Nevertheless, the occurrence frequency of low clouds (OFLC) with height and its influential mechanism remain unclear, especially at the regional scale. In this study, high-vertical-resolution radiosonde measurements during the period 2018–2019 reveal that mean OFLC in eastern China (13.5 ± 6.4 %) is 21 % less than that in eastern United States (17.0 ± 4.5 %). Coincidentally, the regional distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is opposite, with the mean AOD in eastern China being 150 % larger than that in eastern United States. In the meantime, the spatial pattern of surface relative humidity (RH) is similar to OFLC, with lower RH in eastern China than in eastern United States. The impacts of AOD and RH on the OFLC are explored. Results show that higher AOD usually increases the lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and decreases the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), while lower RH increases the lifting condensation level (LCL) for a given air temperature. Lower PBLH and higher LCL jointly decrease the difference between PBLH and LCL, which decrease the chances for the low cloud formation, resulting in lower OFLC in eastern China. The effect of AOD on OFLC depends on the RH conditions. When RH < 40 %, AOD has almost no effect on OFLC in both regions. When 40 % ≤ RH ≤ 70 %, OFLC tends to decrease as AOD increases in eastern United States, but no obvious OFLC trend exists in eastern China. While AOD exerts significantly negative roles on OFLC to different extent in the two regions when RH > 70 %. As AOD increases, the OFLC in eastern United States shows a significantly decreasing tends, with the correlation coefficient (R) being −0.90 between OFLC and AOD. Similarly, in eastern China, the OFLC decreases significantly when AOD > 0.4, with a R of −0.80. These results deepen our understanding of regional-scale impact mechanisms of the aerosol on low cloud's occurrence and help to reduce the uncertainties in simulating the height-resolved OFLC in predicting future climate change."
