10.1088/1748-9326/ad786c,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是切萨皮克湾流域的氮磷管理问题，研究了不同时间和空间尺度下氮磷管理的差异，并利用CAFE框架评估了流域内不同层次的营养物质管理绩效。论文重点分析了氮磷预算、使用效率等指标，并探讨了如何通过回收利用废弃物中的营养物质来减少化肥的使用。总体而言，论文侧重于农业和水环境领域，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Tan Zou;Eric A Davidson;Robert D Sabo;Graham K MacDonald;Xin Zhang,Disparities in nitrogen and phosphorus management across time and space: a case study of the Chesapeake Bay using the CAFE framework,"Efficient management of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is imperative for sustainable agriculture, resource conservation, and reducing environmental pollution. Despite progress in on-farm practices and urban wastewater treatment in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) watershed, limited attention has been given to nutrient transport, use, and handling between farms and urban environments. This study uses the hierarchical CAFE (Cropping system, Animal-crop system, Food system, and Ecosystem) framework to evaluate nutrient management performances within the watershed. We first develop a three-decade, county-level nutrient budget database (1985–2019), then analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of N and P budgets, as well as N and P use efficiencies, within the four CAFE hierarchies. Our results indicate a sizable increase in potential N and P losses beyond crop fields (i.e. in the Animal-crop system, Food system, and Ecosystem), surpassing losses from cropland in over 90% of counties. To address these system-wide trade-offs, we estimate the nutrient resources in waste streams beyond croplands, which, if recovered and recycled, could theoretically offset mineral fertilizer inputs in over 60% of counties. Additionally, the growing imbalance in excess N versus P across systems, which increases the N:P ratio of potential losses, could pose an emerging risk to downstream aquatic ecosystems. By utilizing a systematic approach, our novel application of the CAFE framework reveals trade-offs and synergies in nutrient management outcomes that transcend agro-environmental and political boundaries, underscores disparities in N and P management, and helps to identify unique opportunities for enhancing holistic nutrient management across systems within the CB watershed."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad78e9,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注的是全球作物生产的水足迹演变，分析了1990年至2019年期间175种作物的绿色和蓝色水足迹变化趋势，并探讨了这些变化背后的驱动因素。研究发现，虽然大多数作物单位水足迹有所下降，但由于作物种植面积的扩张，全球作物生产的总水足迹仍然上升。论文强调了转向更可持续的农业粮食系统的重要性，包括提高作物用水效率、将生产转移到水资源较少的地区以及重新思考饮食和工业消费模式。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，主要关注的是水资源管理和农业可持续性问题。,[],Oleksandr Mialyk;Martijn J Booij;Joep F Schyns;Markus Berger,Evolution of global water footprints of crop production in 1990–2019,"Crop production has the largest water footprint (WF) of all economic sectors and ranks as a leading cause of water scarcity. Despite this, our understanding of historical changes in global WFs of crops remains limited. In this study, we analyse the recently published dataset on green and blue WFs of 175 individual crops in 1990–2019. We explore the main changes in unit WFs (expressed in m3t−1 yr−1) and WFs of production (m3 yr−1) and connect the observed changes to various physical and socio-economic drivers. We find that nearly 80% of crops reduced global average unit WFs (required less water per tonne) as crop yields improved and cultivation centred around more productive areas. However, the total WF of crop production increased by 30% as these productivity gains were insufficient to compensate for cropland expansion of mostly water-intensive crops. Close to 90% of the increase occurred between 2000–2019 likely driven by accelerated economic growth, globalisation, changing diets, and production of first-generation biofuels. Among crops, we observe the largest increases for oil palm fruit, soya beans, and maize as they became the main providers of crop-based nutrients, animal feed, and biofuels for the modern economy. Among regions, most of the increase occurred across the tropics, mainly in Indonesia, Brazil, and Nigeria. However, India, China, and the USA had the largest WFs of production over the study period. Humanity consumed 6.8 trillion m3 of water (87.1% green) to produce crops in 2019. This number is likely to increase in the future which may exacerbate already existing environmental and socio-economic issues. Thus, it is important to transition to more water-sustainable agrifood systems. Much potential still exists in increasing crop water productivity, shifting production to less water-scarce geographies, and rethinking our dietary and industrial consumption patterns."

Compared with technological emission reductions, structural emission reduction can provide cities with more stable and sustainable carbon-peaking solutions. This study constructs a scenario-based input–output optimization model, adopting a novel carbon emission accounting method for purchased electricity that considers shared responsibility, and systematically evaluates the decarbonization paths of megacities and their impacts on economic growth, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. The results show that (a) through industry substitution and manufacturing restructuring, Shenzhen is projected to peak at 57.68 MtCO2 emissions in 2026, with a 10.57% energy and a 19.55% carbon reduction by 2030. (b) Shenzhen can achieve its carbon emission peak target through the energy transition while accepting a loss of 0.97%–3.23% of GDP, requiring the maximum economic concession of 16.45% from the transportation sector (S10) in the early stage of transformation, while 12.24% from the extractive industry (S2) in the later stage. (c) The comprehensive structure adjustment proved to be more effective than other mitigation approaches, capable of achieving high-quality economic growth of 6.4% during the study period while reaching a peak target of 53.55 million tons of CO2 by 2026. (d) The emission reduction effect of the power sector was the most significant among all the scenarios, with emission reduction rates between 6.26% and 35.63%, and the cumulative emission reduction potential reached 38.1–110.6 MtCO2. The priority for emission reduction in the power sector is the coal phase-out plan, which is essential for achieving these significant reductions. This study provides an important reference for megacities facing similar challenges, especially those in developing countries, to achieve a stable and sustainable carbon peak pathway through structural adjustment."
10.5194/acp-24-10741-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了两种常用的水分追踪模型，即拉格朗日模型（FLEXPART-WaterSip）和欧拉模型（WAM2layers），在青藏高原不同气候区（受印度夏季风影响的雅鲁藏布江流域和受西风影响的塔里木河流域）的应用。研究发现，两种模型在水分来源的估算结果上存在差异，特别是对于来自西风带和远距离来源的水分，WAM2layers 估计的贡献更高，而 FLEXPART-WaterSip 估计的贡献更低。论文还探讨了模型差异的原因，包括模型本身的差异、输入数据的分辨率以及模型参数的校正。最终，论文建议在青藏高原的水分追踪研究中，应根据不同的模型和不同的研究目标选择合适的模型和参数设置。,"['moisture tracking', 'Lagrangian', 'Eulerian', 'Tibetan Plateau', 'WAM2layers', 'FLEXPART', 'WaterSip', 'precipitation', 'evaporation', 'forcing data', 'spatial resolution', 'temporal resolution', 'bias correction']",Ying Li;Chenghao Wang;Qiuhong Tang;Shibo Yao;Bo Sun;Hui Peng;Shangbin Xiao,Unraveling the discrepancies between Eulerian and Lagrangian moisture tracking models in monsoon- and westerly-dominated basins of the Tibetan Plateau,"For moisture tracking over the Tibetan Plateau, we recommend using high-resolution forcing datasets, prioritizing temporal resolution over spatial resolution for WAM2layers, while for FLEXPART coupled with WaterSip, we suggest applying bias corrections to optimize the filtering of precipitation particles and adjust evaporation estimates. 
 Eulerian and Lagrangian numerical moisture tracking models, which are primarily used to quantify moisture contributions from global sources to specific regions, play a crucial role in hydrology and (paleo)climatology studies on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Despite their widespread applications in the TP region, potential discrepancies in their moisture tracking results and their underlying causes remain unexplored. In this study, we compare the most widely used Eulerian and Lagrangian moisture tracking models over the TP, i.e., WAM2layers (the Water Accounting Model – 2 layers) and FLEXPART-WaterSip (the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model coupled with the “WaterSip” moisture source diagnostic method), specifically focusing on a basin governed by the Indian summer monsoon (Yarlung Zangbo River basin, YB) and a westerly-dominated basin (upper Tarim River basin, UTB). Compared to the bias-corrected FLEXPART-WaterSip, WAM2layers generally estimates higher moisture contributions from westerly-dominated and distant sources but lower contributions from local recycling and nearby sources downwind of the westerlies. These differences become smaller with higher spatial and temporal resolutions of forcing data in WAM2layers. A notable advantage of WAM2layers over FLEXPART-WaterSip is its closer alignment of estimated moisture sources with actual evaporation, particularly in source regions with complex land–sea distributions. However, the evaporation biases in FLEXPART-WaterSip can be partly corrected through calibration with actual surface fluxes. For moisture tracking over the TP, we recommend using high-resolution forcing datasets, prioritizing temporal resolution over spatial resolution for WAM2layers, while for FLEXPART-WaterSip, we suggest applying bias corrections to optimize the filtering of precipitation particles and adjust evaporation estimates."
10.5194/acp-24-10707-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了人类活动产生的气溶胶对全球气候的影响。气溶胶可以通过直接反射阳光和间接改变云的性质来影响气候。研究发现，尽管全球气溶胶排放量在下降，但气溶胶的直接效应却在增强，而间接效应却在减弱。这与气溶胶排放源的转移有关，即从北美和欧洲转移到东南亚。论文使用了全球气候模型 MPI-ESM1.2 进行模拟，并分析了气溶胶的辐射强迫效能。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到气溶胶的观测、分析和建模，以及卫星观测和空气质量监测等方面的应用。,"['aerosol', 'direct effect', 'indirect effect', 'emissions', 'global climate model', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Antoine Hermant;Linnea Huusko;Thorsten Mauritsen,Increasing aerosol direct effect despite declining global emissions in MPI-ESM1.2,"Aerosol particles, from natural and human sources, have a cooling effect on the climate, partially offsetting global warming. They do this through direct (sunlight reflection) and indirect (cloud property alteration) mechanisms. Using a global climate model, we found that, despite declining emissions, the direct effect of human aerosols has increased while the indirect effect has decreased, which is attributed to the shift in emissions from North America and Europe to Southeast Asia. 
 Anthropogenic aerosol particles partially mask global warming driven by greenhouse gases, both directly by reflecting sunlight back to space and indirectly by increasing cloud reflectivity. In recent decades, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols have declined globally and at the same time shifted from the North American and European regions, foremost to Southeast Asia. Using simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2), we find that the direct effect of aerosols has continued to increase despite declining emissions. Concurrently, the indirect effect has diminished in approximate proportion to the emissions. In this model, which employs parameterized aerosol effects with constant regional direct effect efficiency, the enhanced efficiency of aerosol radiative forcing in emissions is associated with less cloud masking, longer atmospheric residence times, and differences in aerosol optical properties."
10.5194/acp-24-10717-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文探讨了气候变化缓解措施对欧洲空气质量的潜在影响，特别关注了细颗粒物（PM2.5）和臭氧（O3）的浓度。研究使用了一个高分辨率的大气化学模型，模拟了三种不同程度的气候变化缓解情景下，2050 年的欧洲空气质量与 2014 年的对比。结果表明，强力气候缓解措施可以显著改善欧洲的空气质量，而较弱的缓解措施则不会带来这种协同效益。研究还分析了不同区域和部门在实现空气质量改善方面的差异，并强调了农业排放控制在实现气候变化缓解的协同效益方面的重要性。,"['air quality', 'PM2.5', 'ozone', 'atmospheric chemistry model', 'climate change mitigation', 'co-benefits']",Connor J. Clayton;Daniel R. Marsh;Steven T. Turnock;Ailish M. Graham;Kirsty J. Pringle;Carly L. Reddington;Rajesh Kumar;James B. McQuaid,The co-benefits of a low-carbon future for PM2.5 and O3 air pollution in Europe,"We demonstrate that strong climate mitigation could improve air quality in Europe; however, less ambitious mitigation does not result in these co-benefits. We use a high-resolution atmospheric chemistry model. This allows us to demonstrate how this varies across European countries and analyse the underlying chemistry. This may help policy-facing researchers understand which sectors and regions need to be prioritised to achieve strong air quality co-benefits of climate mitigation. 
 There is considerable academic interest in the potential for air quality improvement as a co-benefit of climate change mitigation. Few studies use regional air quality models for simulating future co-benefits, but many use global chemistry–climate model output. Using regional atmospheric chemistry could provide a better representation of air quality changes than global chemistry–climate models, especially by improving the representation of elevated urban concentrations. We use a detailed regional atmospheric-chemistry model (WRF-Chem v4.2) to model European air quality in 2050 compared to 2014 following three climate change mitigation scenarios. We represent different climate futures by using air pollutant emissions and chemical boundary conditions (from CESM2-WACCM output) for three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0: high-, medium- and low-mitigation pathways respectively).We find that in 2050, following SSP1-2.6, mean population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations across European countries are reduced by 52 % compared to 2014. Under SSP2-4.5, this average reduction is 34%. The smallest average reduction is 18 %, achieved following SSP3-7.0. Maximum 6-monthly-mean daily-maximum 8 h (6mDM8h) ozone (O3) is reduced across Europe by 15 % following SSP1-2.6 and by 3 % following SSP2-4.5, but it increases by 13 % following SSP3-7.0. This demonstrates clear co-benefits of climate mitigation. The additional resolution allows us to analyse regional differences and identify key sectors. We find that the mitigation of agricultural emissions will be key for attaining meaningful co-benefits of mitigation policies, as evidenced by the importance of changes in NO3 aerosol mass to future PM2.5 air quality and changes in CH4 emissions to future O3 air quality."
10.5194/acp-24-10689-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了冬季北大西洋涛动 (NAO) 和厄尔尼诺-南方涛动 (ENSO) 对次年春季华北地区沙尘活动的协同影响。研究发现，NAO 和 ENSO，特别是它们的负相位，对沙尘活动有显著影响。当两者都处于负相位时，它们对沙尘活动的综合影响甚至超过单个因素的影响。该研究强调了这些气候模式在预测华北地区春季沙尘活动中的重要性。论文使用了再分析数据集，分析了 NAO 和 ENSO 对华北地区春季沙尘活动的影响，并解释了其影响机制。该研究结果可用于预测华北地区春季沙尘活动，为大气环境遥感技术，尤其是空气质量监测和卫星观测提供了重要参考。,"['dust', 'aerosols', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring', 'climate change']",Falei Xu;Shuang Wang;Yan Li;Juan Feng,Synergistic effects of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on dust activities in North China during the following spring,"This study examines how the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affect dust activities in North China during the following spring. The results show that the NAO and ENSO, particularly in their negative phases, greatly influence dust activities. When both are negative, their combined effect on dust activities is even greater. This research highlights the importance of these climate patterns in predicting spring dust activities in North China. 
 Dust significantly influences global weather and climate by impacting the Earth's radiative balance. Based on reanalysis datasets, this study explores how the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during winter impact dust activities in North China in the following spring. It is found that both the NAO and the ENSO significantly affect dust activities in North China, especially during their negative phases. When both are in their negative phases, their combined impact on dust activities exceeds that of each factor individually. The previous winter's NAO notably affects sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the North Atlantic, associated with an anomalous tripole SST pattern. These SST anomalies persist into the following spring due to their inherent persistence, inducing an anomalous atmospheric teleconnection wave train that influences dust activities in North China. The ENSO, on the one hand, directly impacts dust activities in North China by modulating circulation over the western North Pacific. Moreover, the ENSO enhances the NAO's effect on North Atlantic SST, which explains the synergistic effects of the ENSO and NAO on dust activities in North China. This study elucidates the combined role of the NAO and ENSO in influencing dust activities in North China, providing one-season-ahead signals for predicting spring dust activities in North China."
10.5194/acp-24-10759-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究使用社区多尺度空气质量模型（CMAQ）评估了减少台湾冬季SO2、NOx和NH3排放对PM2.5二次无机物种（SO42-、NO3-和NH4+）的影响。研究发现，减少NOx或NH3排放比减少SO2排放更有效地缓解PM2.5污染。考虑到效率和成本，减少NH3排放似乎是台湾研究环境中更合适的政策。,"['air quality', 'PM2.5', 'sulfur dioxide (SO2)', 'nitrogen oxides (NOx)', 'ammonia (NH3)', 'emission reduction', 'air quality modeling', 'CMAQ']",Ping-Chieh Huang;Hui-Ming Hung;Hsin-Chih Lai;Charles C.-K. Chou,"Assessing the effectiveness of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emission reductions in mitigating winter PM2.5 in Taiwan using CMAQ","Models were used to study ways to reduce particulate matter (PM) pollution in Taiwan during winter. After considering various factors, such as physical processes and chemical reactions, we found that reducing NOx or NH3 emissions is more effective at mitigating PM2.5 than reducing SO2 emissions. When considering both efficiency and cost, reducing NH3 emissions seems to be a more suitable policy for the studied environment in Taiwan. 
 Taiwan experiences higher air pollution in winter when fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels frequently surpass national standards. This study employs the Community Multiscale Air Quality model to assess the effectiveness of reducing SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions on PM2.5 secondary inorganic species (i.e., SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+). For sulfate, ∼ 43.7 % is derived from the chemical reactions of local SO2 emission, emphasizing the substantial contribution of regionally transported sulfate. In contrast, nitrate and ammonium are predominantly influenced by local NOx and NH3 emissions. Reducing SO2 emissions decreases sulfate levels, which in turn leads to more NH3 remaining in the gas phase, resulting in lower ammonium concentrations. Similarly, reducing NOx emissions lowers HNO3 formation, impacting nitrate and ammonium concentrations by  decreasing the available HNO3 and leaving more NH3 in the gas phase. A significant finding is that reducing NH3 emissions decreases not only ammonium and nitrate but also sulfate by altering cloud droplet pH and SO2 oxidation processes. While the impact of SO2 reduction on PM2.5 is less than that of NOx and NH3, it emphasizes the complexity of regional sensitivities. Most of western Taiwan is NOx-sensitive, so reducing NOx emissions has a more substantial impact on lowering PM2.5 levels. However, given the higher mass emissions of NOx than NH3 in Taiwan, NH3 has a more significant consequence in mitigating PM2.5 per unit mass emission reduction (i.e., 2.43 × 10−5 and 0.85 × 10−5 µg m−3 (t yr−1)−1 for NH3 and NOx, respectively, under current emission reduction). The cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that NH3 reduction outperforms SO2 and NOx reduction (i.e., USD 0.06 billion yr−1 µg−1 m3, USD 0.1 billion yr−1 µg−1 m3, and USD 1 billion yr−1 µg−1 m3 for NH3, SO2, and NOx, respectively, under the current emission reduction). Nevertheless, the costs of emission reduction vary due to differences in methodology and regional emission sources. Overall, this study considers both the efficiency and costs, highlighting NH3 emissions reduction as a promising strategy for PM2.5 mitigation in the studied environment in Taiwan."

Remedios,Quantifying large methane emissions from the Nord Stream pipeline gas leak of September 2022 using IASI satellite observations and inverse modelling,"The leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 released a large amount of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. We provide observational data from a satellite instrument that shows a large CH4 plume over the North Sea off the coast of Scandinavia. We use this together with atmospheric models to quantify the CH4 leaked into the atmosphere from the pipelines. We find that 219–427 Gg CH4 was emitted, making this the largest individual fossil-fuel-related CH4 leak on record. 
 The sudden leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which began on 26 September 2022, released a substantial amount of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. From the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument onboard EUMETSAT's MetOp-B, we document the first satellite-based retrievals of column-average CH4 (XCH4) that clearly show the large CH4 plume emitted from the pipelines. The data display elevations greater than 200 ppb (parts per billion, ∼ 11 %) above observed background values (1882 ± 21 ppb). Based on the IASI data, together with an integrated mass enhancement technique and formal model-based inversions applied for the first time to thermal infrared satellite methane plume data, we quantify the total mass of CH4 emitted into the atmosphere during the first 2 d of the leaks to be 219–427 Gg CH4. Substantial temporal heterogeneity is displayed in our model-derived flux rate, with three or four distinct peaks in emission rate over the first 2 d. Our range overlaps with other previous estimates, which were 75–230 Gg CH4 and were mostly based on inversions that assimilated in situ observations from nearby tower sites. However, our derived values are generally larger than those previous results, with the differences likely due to the fact that our results are the first to use satellite-based observations of XCH4 from the days following the leaks. We incorporate multiple satellite overpasses that monitored the CH4 plume as it was transported across Scandinavia and the North Sea up to the evening of 28 September 2022. We produced model simulations of the atmospheric transport of the plume using the Eulerian atmospheric transport model, TOMCAT, which show good representation of the plume location in the days following the leaks. The performance of simulated CH4 mixing ratios at four nearby in situ measurement sites compared to the observed in situ values is mixed, which highlights the challenges inherent in representing short-term plume movement over a specific location using a model such as TOMCAT with a relatively coarse Eulerian grid. Our results confirm the leak of the Nord Stream pipes to clearly be the largest individual fossil-fuel-related leak of CH4 on record, greatly surpassing the previous largest leak (95 Gg CH4) at the Aliso Canyon gas facility in California in 2015–2016."
10.5194/amt-17-5581-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究主要关注的是森林生态系统中二氧化碳浓度变化对净生态系统交换（NEE）的影响。研究者利用涡度协方差技术测量了森林冠层上空的二氧化碳通量，并分析了复杂地形条件下气流波动对二氧化碳存储量（Fs）的影响。研究发现，复杂地形会加剧气流波动，导致二氧化碳存储量估计存在较大误差，从而影响NEE的准确性。该研究通过分析不同地形条件下二氧化碳波动特征，提出了改进二氧化碳存储量估计方法，以提高NEE测量的准确性。,"['CO2 concentration', 'turbulent mixing', 'eddy covariance', 'net ecosystem exchange', 'forest', 'remote sensing']",Dexiong Teng;Jiaojun Zhu;Tian Gao;Fengyuan Yu;Yuan Zhu;Xinhua Zhou;Bai Yang,Field assessments on the impact of CO2 concentration fluctuations along with complex-terrain flows on the estimation of the net ecosystem exchange of temperate forests,"Dense canopy weakens turbulent mixing, leading to significant CO2 storage (Fs), a key part of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measured using eddy covariance. Gust-biased Fs measurements complicate NEE estimation in forests with complex terrain. We analyzed gust-induced CO2 fluctuations and their impact on Fs. Fs and its contribution to NEE can be explained by terrain complexity and turbulent mixing. This work highlights how gusts over complex terrain affect the Fs and NEE measurements. 
 CO2 storage (Fs) is the cumulation or depletion in CO2 amount over a period in an ecosystem. Along with the eddy covariance flux and wind-stream advection of CO2, it is a major term in the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) equation. The CO2 storage dominates the NEE equation under a stable atmospheric stratification when the equation is used for forest ecosystems over complex terrains. However, estimating Fs remains challenging due to the frequent gusts and random fluctuations in boundary-layer flows that lead to tremendous difficulties in capturing the true trend of CO2 changes for use in storage estimation from eddy covariance along with atmospheric profile techniques. Using measurements from Qingyuan Ker Towers equipped with NEE instrument systems separately covering mixed broad-leaved, oak, and larch forest towers in a mountain watershed, this study investigates gust periods and CO2 fluctuation magnitudes and examines their impact on Fs estimation in relation to the terrain complexity index (TCI). The gusts induce CO2 fluctuations for numerous periods of 1 to 10 min over 2 h. Diurnal, seasonal, and spatial differences (P < 0.01) in the maximum amplitude of CO2 fluctuations (Am) range from 1.6 to 136.7 ppm, and these differences range from 140 to 170 s in a period (Pm) at the same significance level. Am and Pm are significantly correlated to the magnitude of and random error in Fs with diurnal and seasonal differences. These correlations decrease as CO2 averaging time windows become longer. To minimize the uncertainties in Fs, a constant [CO2] averaging time window for the Fs estimates is not ideal. Dynamic averaging time windows and a decision-level fusion model can reduce the potential underestimation of Fs by 29 %–33 % for temperate forests in complex terrain. In our study, the relative contribution of Fs to the 30 min NEE observations ranged from 17 % to 82 % depending on turbulent mixing and the TCI. The study's approach is notable as it incorporates the TCI and utilizes three flux towers for replication, making the findings relevant to similar regions with a single tower."

It systematically compares them and provides recommendations for robust comparisons, aiming to steadily engage more parties in using observational methods to complement their UNFCCC submissions. Anticipating improvements in atmospheric modelling and observations, future developments need to resolve knowledge gaps in both approaches and to better quantify remaining uncertainty. 
 Monitoring the spatial distribution and trends in surface greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, as well as flux attribution to natural and anthropogenic processes, is essential to track progress under the Paris Agreement and to inform its global stocktake. This study updates earlier syntheses (Petrescu et al., 2020, 2021, 2023), provides a consolidated synthesis of CH4 emissions using bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) approaches for the European Union (EU), and is expanded to include seven additional countries with large anthropogenic and/or natural emissions (the USA, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo)). Our aim is to demonstrate the use of different emission estimates to help improve national GHG emission inventories for a diverse geographical range of stakeholders.We use updated national GHG inventories (NGHGIs) reported by Annex I parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2023 and the latest available biennial update reports (BURs) reported by non-Annex I parties. Comparing NGHGIs with other approaches highlights that different system boundaries are a key source of divergence. A key system boundary difference is whether anthropogenic and natural fluxes are included and, if they are, how fluxes belonging to these two sources are partitioned.Over the studied period, the total CH4 emission estimates in the EU, the USA, and Russia show a steady decreasing trend since 1990, while for the non-Annex I emitters analyzed in this study, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and DR Congo, CH4 emissions have generally increased. Quantitatively, in the EU the mean of 2015–2020 anthropogenic UNFCCC NGHGIs (15±1.8 Tg CH4 yr−1) and the mean of the BU CH4 emissions (17.8 (16–19) Tg CH4 yr−1) generally agree on the magnitude, while inversions show higher emission estimates (medians of 21 (19–22) Tg CH4 yr−1 and 24 (22–25) Tg CH4 yr−1 for the three regional and six global inversions, respectively), as they include natural emissions, which for the EU were quantified at 6.6 Tg CH4 yr−1 (Petrescu et al., 2023). Similarly, for the other Annex I parties in this study (the USA and Russia), the gap between the BU anthropogenic and total TD emissions is partly explained by the natural emissions.For the non-Annex I parties, anthropogenic CH4 estimates from UNFCCC BURs show large differences compared to the other global-inventory-based estimates and even more compared to atmospheric ones. This poses an important potential challenge to monitoring the progress of the global CH4 pledge and the global stocktake. Our analysis provides a useful baseline to prepare for the influx of inventories from non-Annex I parties as regular reporting starts under the enhanced transparency framework of the Paris Agreement.By systematically comparing the BU and TD methods, this study provides recommendations for more robust comparisons of available data sources and hopes to steadily engage more parties in using observational methods to complement their UNFCCC inventories, as well as considering their natural emissions. With anticipated improvements in atmospheric modeling and observations, as well as modeling of natural fluxes, future development needs to resolve knowledge gaps in the BU and TD approaches and to better quantify the remaining uncertainty. TD methods may emerge as a powerful tool to help improve NGHGIs of CH4 emissions, but further confidence is needed in the comparability and robustness of the estimates.The referenced datasets related to figures are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12818506 (Petrescu et al., 2024)."

Tourian,Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM),"Our study addresses the need for better river discharge data, crucial for water management, by expanding global gauge networks with satellite data. We used satellite altimetry to estimate river discharge for over 8,700 stations worldwide, filling gaps in existing records. Our data set, SAEM supports a better understanding of water systems, helping to manage water resources more effectively, especially in regions with limited monitoring infrastructure. 
 River discharge is a crucial measurement, indicating the volume of water flowing through a river cross-section at any given time. However, the existing network of river discharge gauges faces significant issues, largely due to the declining number of active gauges and temporal gaps. Remote sensing, especially radar-based techniques, offers an effective means to this issue. This study introduces the Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of the global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM) data set, which utilizes multiple satellite altimetry missions and estimates discharge using the existing worldwide networks of national and international gauges. In SAEM, we have explored 47 000 gauges and estimated height-based discharge for 8 730 of them which is approximately three times the number of gauges of the largest existing remote sensing-based data set. These gauges cover approximately 88 % of the total gauged discharge volume. The height-based discharge estimates in SAEM demonstrate a median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.48, outperforming current global data sets. In addition to the river discharge time series, the SAEMdata set comprises three more products, each contributing a unique facet to better usage of our data: (1) A catalog of Virtual Stations (VSs), defined by certain predefined criteria. In addition to each station’s coordinates, this catalog provides information on satellite altimetry missions, distance to the discharge gauge, and relevant quality flags.(2) The altimetric water level time series of those VSs are included, for which we ultimately obtained good-quality discharge data. These water level time series are sourced from both existing Level-3 water level time series and newly generated ones within this study. The Level-3 data are gathered from pre-existing data sets, including Hydroweb.Next (former Hydroweb), the Database of Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI), the Global River Radar Altimeter Time Series (GRRATS), and HydroSat. (3) SAEM’s third product is rating curves for the defined VSs, which map water level values into discharge values, derived using a Nonparametric Stochastic Quantile Mapping Function approach. The SAEM data set can be used to improve hydrological models, inform water resource management, and address non-linear water-related challenges under climate change.

As lightning is an important cause of global wildfires, this new model development allows for more realistic projections of how wildfires may change in the future, responding to a changing climate. 
 Lightning is an important atmospheric process for generating reactive nitrogen, resulting in the production of tropospheric ozone, as well as igniting wildland fires, which result in potentially large emissions of many pollutants and short-lived climate forcers. Lightning is also expected to change in frequency and location with the changing climate. As such, lightning is an important component of Earth system models. Until now, the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM) did not contain an interactive-lightning parameterization. The fire parameterization in CanESM5.1 was designed to use prescribed monthly climatological lightning. In this study, we have added a logistical regression lightning model that predicts lightning occurrence interactively based on three environmental variables and their interactions in CanESM5.1's atmospheric model, CanAM5.1 (Canadian Atmospheric Model), creating the capacity to interactively model lightning, allowing for future projections under different climate scenarios. The modelled lightning and resulting burned area were evaluated against satellite measurements over the historical period, and model biases were found to be acceptable. Modelled lightning had a small negative bias and excellent land–ocean ratio compared to satellite measurements.The modified version of CanESM5.1 was used to simulate two future climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5; Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) to assess how lightning and burned area change in the future. Under the higher-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), CanESM5.1 predicts almost no change to the global mean lightning flash rate by the end of the century (2081–2100 vs. 2015–2035 average). However, there are substantial regional changes to lightning – particularly over land – such as a mean increase of 6 % in the northern mid-latitudes and decrease of −8 % in the tropics. By the century's end, the change in global total burned area with prescribed climatological lightning was about 2 times greater than that with interactive lightning (42 % vs. 26 % increase, respectively). Conversely, in the northern mid-latitudes the use of interactive lightning resulted in 3 times more burned area compared to that with unchanging lightning  (48 % vs. 16 % increase, respectively). These results show that the future changes to burned area are greatly dependent on a model's lightning scheme, both spatially and overall."

A preliminary budget identifies benthic CH4 release as the dominant source and two main sinks: CH4 oxidation in the water (92 % of sinks) and outgassing to the atmosphere (8 % of sinks). This study addresses CH4 emissions from coastal seas and is a first step toward understanding the relative importance of open-water outgassing compared with local coastal hotspots. 
 Methane (CH4) cycling in the Baltic Sea is studied through model simulations that incorporate the stable isotopes of CH4 (12C–CH4 and 13C–CH4) in a physical–biogeochemical model. A major uncertainty is that spatial and temporal variations in the sediment source are not well known. Furthermore, the coarse spatial resolution prevents the model from resolving shallow-water near-shore areas for which measurements indicate occurrences of considerably higher CH4 concentrations and emissions compared with the open Baltic Sea. A preliminary CH4 budget for the central Baltic Sea (the Baltic Proper) identifies benthic release as the dominant CH4 source, which is largely balanced by oxidation in the water column and to a smaller degree by outgassing. The contributions from river loads and lateral exchange with adjacent areas are of marginal importance. Simulated total CH4 emissions from the Baltic Proper correspond to an average ∼1.5 mmol CH4 m−2 yr−1, which can be compared to a fitted sediment source of ∼18 mmol CH4 m−2 yr−1. A large-scale approach is used in this study, but the parameterizations and parameters presented here could also be implemented in models of near-shore areas where CH4 concentrations and fluxes are typically substantially larger and more variable. Currently, it is not known how important local shallow-water CH4 hotspots are compared with the open water outgassing in the Baltic Sea."

Our study improves modeling of carbon cycling in Arctic ecosystems. We developed an automated method to fine-tune a model that simulates carbon and nitrogen flows, using computer-generated data. Using computer-generated data, we tested our method and found it enhances accuracy and reduces the time needed for calibration. This work helps make climate predictions more reliable in sensitive permafrost regions. 
 The permafrost region contains a significant portion of the world's soil organic carbon, and its thawing, driven by accelerated Arctic warming, could lead to the substantial release of greenhouse gases, potentially disrupting the global climate system. Accurate predictions of carbon cycling in permafrost ecosystems hinge on the robust calibration of model parameters. However, manually calibrating numerous parameters in complex process-based models is labor-intensive and further complicated by equifinality – the presence of multiple parameter sets that can equally fit the observed data. Incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological predictions. In this study, we employed the Model Analysis and Decision Support (MADS) software package to automate and enhance the accuracy of parameter calibration for carbon dynamics within the coupled Dynamic Vegetation Model, Dynamic Organic Soil Model, and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DVM-DOS-TEM), a process-based ecosystem model designed for high-latitude regions. The calibration process involved adjusting rate-limiting parameters to accurately replicate observed carbon and nitrogen fluxes and stocks in both soil and vegetation. Gross primary production, net primary production, vegetation carbon, vegetation nitrogen, and soil carbon and nitrogen pools served as synthetic observations for a black spruce boreal forest ecosystem. To validate the efficiency of this new calibration method, we utilized model-generated synthetic observations. This study demonstrates the calibration workflow, offers an in-depth analysis of the relationships between parameters and synthetic observations, and evaluates the accuracy of the calibrated parameter values."

Pollutants such as arsenic (As) in the soil can infiltrate groundwater through sinkholes and bedrock fractures in karst terrains. Despite this, the underlying mechanisms responsible for As release from karst soils under redox changes remain largely unexplored. Here, we used multiple synchrotron-based spectroscopic analyses to explore As mobilization and sequestration in As-polluted karstic soil under biogeochemical conditions that mimic field-validated redox conditions. We observed that As in the soil exists primarily as As(V), which is mainly associated with Fe(oxyhydr)oxides. The concentration of the dissolved As was high (294 μM) and As(III) was dominant (∼95%) at low Eh (≤−100 mV), indicating the high risk of As leaching under reducing conditions. This As mobilization was attributed to the fact that the dissolution of ferrihydrite and calcite promoted the release and reduction of associated As(V). The concentration of the dissolved As was low (17.0 μM) and As(V) was dominant (∼68%) at high Eh (≥+100 mV), which might be due to the oxidation and/or sequestration of As(III) by the recrystallized ferric phase. Our results showed that the combined effects of the reductive release of As(V) from both ferric and nonferric phases, along with the recrystallization of the ferric phase, govern the redox-induced mobilization and potential leaching of As in soils within karst environments."

In the present study, we characterized the developmental toxicity of metformin in zebrafish, utilizing a transcriptome-guided toxicological assessment framework. Transcriptomic analysis conducted at metformin concentrations within the μg/L range revealed significant disruptions in biological processes associated with nucleotide, hydrocarbon, and amino acid metabolism, suggesting a significant disturbance in energy homeostasis. This observation was corroborated by energy-targeted metabolomic analysis, wherein a considerable number of metabolites involved in purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and the citrate cycle displayed significant alterations. Notably, most intermediates in the citrate cycle such as acetyl-CoA exhibited remarkable decreases. Additionally, our study identified significant impediments in zebrafish embryonic development, including decreased yolk extension progress, spontaneous contraction and body length, and increased yolk sac area and yolk/while body lipid content ratio, at metformin concentrations as low as 0.12 μg/L. Furthermore, the disruption of energy homeostasis by metformin was observed to persist into adulthood even after a prolonged recovery period. The present findings highlighted the disruptive effects of metformin on energy homeostasis and embryonic development in teleost at environmentally relevant concentrations, thereby prompting a reevaluation of its environmental risk to nontarget aquatic organisms."

In the approach presented here, groundwater from beneath streambeds was analyzed for PFAS and age-dated using SF6 and 3H/3He. The results were coupled with groundwater flux measurements in a convolution approach to estimate past and future PFAS concentrations in groundwater discharge to the streams. At our test site near the Cape Fear River (CFR) of North Carolina, PFAS were detected in groundwater up to 43 years old, suggesting that some PFAS entered groundwater immediately or shortly after fluorochemical production began at the nearby Fayetteville Works. Results are consistent with little to no retardation in groundwater for perfluoroethers such as hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO–DA) and perfluoro-2-methoxypropanoic acid (PMPA), the two most abundant PFAS, with mean concentrations of 229 and 498 ng/L, respectively. Future PFAS concentrations in groundwater discharge to streams were estimated to remain above current MCL or health advisory levels through at least 2050 or 2060 (using 3H/3He and SF6, respectively). Recent atmospheric deposition data suggest lower but non-negligible amounts of PFAS may continue to enter groundwater, likely further extending PFAS persistence in groundwater and the adjacent CFR.

Here, a total of 428 genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes were screened from the gut microbiome of T. molitor larvae to identify poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)-degrading activities. Five genes were successfully expressed in E. coli, among which a feruloyl esterase-like enzyme named TmFae-PETase demonstrated the highest PET degradation activity, converting PET into MHET (0.7 mgMHETeq ·h–1·mgenzyme–1) and TPA (0.2 mgTPAeq ·h–1·mgenzyme–1) at 50 °C. TmFae-PETase showed a preference for the hydrolysis of ferulic acid methyl ester (MFA) in the presence of both PET and MFA. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations of TmFae-PETase revealed similar catalytic mechanisms for both PET and MFA. TmFae-PETase effectively depolymerized commercial PET, making it a promising candidate for application.

We hypothesized that gas chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) workflows could be enhanced by minimizing lipid coextractives, thereby enabling larger injection volumes and lower matrix interference for improved target sensitivity and nontarget molecular discovery. A simple protocol was developed for small plasma volumes (100–200 μL) by using isohexane (H) to extract supernatants of acetonitrile-plasma (A-P). The HA-P method was quantitative for a wide range of hydrophobic multiclass target analytes (i.e., log Kow > 3.0), and the extracts were free of major lipids, thereby enabling robust large-volume injections (LVIs; 25 μL) in long sequences (60–70 h, 70–80 injections) to a GC-Orbitrap HRMS. Without lipid removal, LVI was counterproductive because method sensitivity suffered from the abundant matrix signal, resulting in low ion injection times to the Orbitrap. The median method quantification limit was 0.09 ng/mL (range 0.005–4.83 ng/mL), and good accuracy was shown for a certified reference serum. Applying the method to plasma from a Swedish cohort (n = 32; 100 μL), 51 of 103 target analytes were detected. Simultaneous nontarget analysis resulted in 112 structural annotations (12.8% annotation rate), and Level 1 identification was achieved for 7 of 8 substances in follow-up confirmations.

In this study, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), typically inhabiting 30‰ high salinity, were gradually acclimated to low salinities of 20, 10, and 0‰. Following acclimation, the fish were exposed to arsenate (As(V)) in their diet for 30 days. Results showed a significant accumulation of total arsenic (As) and AsB concentrations in the muscle and head tissues of the exposed fish, with these accumulations exhibiting a positive correlation with water salinity. Transcriptome analyses revealed that exposure to As(V) at low salinity may disrupt membrane components and induce cytoskeletal injuries, while at high salinity, it triggered oxidoreductase activity and transmembrane transport. Metabolome analyses indicated that low salinity induced osmotic stress, resulting in an increased requirement for amino acids to upload intracellular osmotic equilibrium in O. melastigma. Furthermore, the key organic osmolytes and amino acids, including taurine, l-methionine, guanidinoethyl sulfonate, and N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid, exhibited a negative correlation with the AsB concentration.

This enhanced oxidation in ice is attributed to the concentration of protons, birnessite, or bromide in the ice grain boundary region. Furthermore, different types of commercial manganese oxides can also oxidize bromide to RBr and release Mn(II) in ice. The presence of fulvic acid (FA) further increases the simultaneous production of RBr and Mn(II) in ice, accompanying the formation of organobromine compounds (OBCs). In frozen δ-MnO2/Br–/FA system, a significant increase in OBCs, mainly highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds, was detected using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A marked contrast was observed in the number of OBCs formed in frozen solutions (853 and 415 OBCs at initial pH 3.0 and 5.8, respectively) compared to their aqueous counterparts (11 and 23 OBCs).

This study investigated the bioaccumulation of atmospherically deposited Cd in soybean using a three-year fully factorial atmospheric exposure experiment incorporating Cd isotope analysis. Results shown that atmospheric deposition accounted for 1–13% of soil Cd pools, yet contributed 11–72% of Cd to soybean tissues during the growing seasons. Over the course of soil exposure to atmospheric deposition ranging from 1 to 3 years, no notable variations were observed in Cd concentrations in soil solutions and soybean tissues, nor in isotope ratios. Newly deposited Cd was a major source in soybean plants, and the bioavailability of deposited Cd rapidly aged in soils. Atmospheric Cd enriched in lighter isotopes induced negative isotope shifts in soybean plants. By employing an optimized isotope mixing model in conjunction with a mass balance approach, foliar Cd uptake contributed 13–51%, 16–45%, and 21–56% to stem, leaf, and seed, respectively. This study highlights substantial contribution of foliar uptake of atmospheric deposition to Cd levels in soybean and controlling foliar uptake as a potential strategy in agroecological systems experiencing high atmospheric Cd deposition."

Herein, we screened for 21 emerging RDCs in plasma samples from pregnant women (n = 150), sanitation workers (n = 80), and rubber manufacturing workers (n = 162) to explore internal exposure to RDCs in these populations. The results revealed varying detection frequencies (DFs) and concentrations of selected RDCs among different populations.

E3SMv2 atmosphere model (EAMv2) is run at the uniform 0.25° horizontal resolution. We track MCSs consistently in the model and observations using PyFLEXTRKR algorithm, which defines MCSs based on both cloud top brightness temperature (Tb) and surface precipitation. Results from using only Tb to define MCSs are also discussed to understand the impact of different MCS tracking algorithms on MCS evaluation and provide additional insights into model errors in simulating MCSs. Our results show that EAMv2 simulated MCS precipitation is largely underestimated in tropical and extratropical regions. This is mainly attributed to the underestimated MCS genesis and underestimated precipitation intensity in EAMv2. Comparing the two MCS tracking methods, simulated MCS precipitation is increased if MCSs are defined with only cloud top Tb. The Tb‐based MCS tracking method, however, includes cloud systems with very weak precipitation. This illustrates the model issues in simulating heavy precipitation even though the convective cloud shield is overall well simulated from the moist convective processes. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments are performed to examine the impact of new cloud and convection parameterizations developed for EAMv3 on simulated MCSs. The new physics parameterizations help increase the relative contribution of convective precipitation to total precipitation in the tropics, but the simulated MCS properties are not significantly improved. This suggests that simulating MCSs still remain a challenge for the next version of E3SM."

 In March 2024, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 infections in dairy cows were first reported from Texas, USA1. Rapid dissemination to more than 190 farms in 13 states followed2. Here, we provide results of two independent clade 2.3.4.4b experimental infection studies evaluating (i) oronasal susceptibility and transmission in calves to a US H5N1 bovine isolate genotype B3.13 (H5N1 B3.13) and (ii) susceptibility of lactating cows following direct mammary gland inoculation of either H5N1 B3.13 or a current EU H5N1 wild bird isolate genotype euDG (H5N1 euDG). Inoculation of the calves resulted in moderate nasal replication and shedding with no severe clinical signs or transmission to sentinel calves. In dairy cows, infection resulted in no nasal shedding, but severe acute mammary gland infection with necrotizing mastitis and high fever was observed for both H5N1 isolates. Milk production was rapidly and drastically reduced and the physical condition of the cows was severely compromised. Virus titers in milk rapidly peaked at 108 TCID50/mL, but systemic infection did not ensue. Notably, adaptive mutation PB2 E627K emerged after intramammary replication of H5N1 euDG. Our data suggest that in addition to H5N1 B3.13, other HPAIV H5N1 strains have the potential to replicate in the udder of cows and that milk and milking procedures, rather than respiratory spread, are likely the primary routes of H5N1 transmission between cattle."

Tarnita,The evolution of private reputations in information-abundant landscapes,"In an information-abundant landscape, people can accurately judge the reputations of others by researching only a fraction of the available information while forgiving some instances of bad behaviour. 
 Reputations are critical to human societies, as individuals are treated differently based on their social standing1,2. For instance, those who garner a good reputation by helping others are more likely to be rewarded by third parties3–5. Achieving widespread cooperation in this way requires that reputations accurately reflect behaviour6 and that individuals agree about each other’s standings7. With few exceptions8–10, theoretical work has assumed that information is limited, which hinders consensus7,11 unless there are mechanisms to enforce agreement, such as empathy12, gossip13–15 or public institutions16. Such mechanisms face challenges in a world where empathy, effective communication and institutional trust are compromised17–19. However, information about others is now abundant and readily available, particularly through social media. Here we demonstrate that assigning private reputations by aggregating several observations of an individual can accurately capture behaviour, foster emergent agreement without enforcement mechanisms and maintain cooperation, provided individuals exhibit some tolerance for bad actions. This finding holds for both first- and second-order norms of judgement and is robust even when norms vary within a population. When the aggregation rule itself can evolve, selection indeed favours the use of several observations and tolerant judgements. Nonetheless, even when information is freely accessible, individuals do not typically evolve to use all of it. This method of assessing reputations—‘look twice, forgive once’, in a nutshell—is simple enough to have arisen early in human culture and powerful enough to persist as a fundamental component of social heuristics. In an information-abundant landscape, people can accurately judge the reputations of others by researching only a fraction of the available information while forgiving some instances of bad behaviour."

 Climate warming has caused a widespread increase in extreme fire weather, making forest fires longer-lived and larger1–3. The average forest fire size in Canada, the USA and Australia has doubled or even tripled in recent decades4,5. In return, forest fires feed back to climate by modulating land–atmospheric carbon, nitrogen, aerosol, energy and water fluxes6–8. However, the surface climate impacts of increasingly large fires and their implications for land management remain to be established. Here we use satellite observations to show that in temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere, fire size persistently amplified decade-long postfire land surface warming in summer per unit burnt area. Both warming and its amplification with fire size were found to diminish with an increasing abundance of broadleaf trees, consistent with their lower fire vulnerability compared with coniferous species9,10. Fire-size-enhanced warming may affect the success and composition of postfire stand regeneration11,12 as well as permafrost degradation13, presenting previously overlooked, additional feedback effects to future climate and fire dynamics. Given the projected increase in fire size in northern forests14,15, climate-smart forestry should aim to mitigate the climate risks of large fires, possibly by increasing the share of broadleaf trees, where appropriate, and avoiding active pyrophytes. Climate warming has increased forest fire sizes, amplifying postfire summer warming, with broadleaf trees mitigating this effect; climate-smart forestry should increase broadleaf tree cover to manage future fire risks."

 El Niño events, the warm phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, amplify climate variability throughout the world1. Uncertain climate model predictions limit our ability to assess whether these climatic events could become more extreme under anthropogenic greenhouse warming2. Palaeoclimate records provide estimates of past changes, but it is unclear if they can constrain mechanisms underlying future predictions3–5. Here we uncover a mechanism using numerical simulations that drives consistent changes in response to past and future forcings, allowing model validation against palaeoclimate data. The simulated mechanism is consistent with the dynamics of observed extreme El Niño events, which develop when western Pacific warm pool waters expand rapidly eastwards because of strongly coupled ocean currents and winds6,7. These coupled interactions weaken under glacial conditions because of a deeper mixed layer driven by a stronger Walker circulation. The resulting decrease in ENSO variability and extreme El Niño occurrence is supported by a series of tropical Pacific palaeoceanographic records showing reduced glacial temperature variability within key ENSO-sensitive oceanic regions, including new data from the central equatorial Pacific. The model–data agreement on past variability, together with the consistent mechanism across climatic states, supports the prediction of a shallower mixed layer and weaker Walker circulation driving more frequent extreme El Niño genesis under greenhouse warming. A combination of palaeoclimate proxies and simulations shows that a common mechanism controls El Niño variation in cold and warm states, which supports expectations of more extreme El Niño occurrence in the future."

 From industrial exoskeletons to implantable medical devices, robots that interact closely with people are poised to improve every aspect of our lives. Yet designing these systems is very challenging; humans are incredibly complex and, in many cases, we respond to robotic devices in ways that cannot be modelled or predicted with sufficient accuracy. A new approach, human-in-the-loop optimization, can overcome these challenges by systematically and empirically identifying the device characteristics that result in the best objective performance for a specific user and application. This approach has enabled substantial improvements in human–robot performance in research settings and has the potential to speed development and enhance products.

 Bacterial populations that originate from a single bacterium are not strictly clonal and often contain subgroups with distinct phenotypes1. Bacteria can generate heterogeneity through phase variation—a preprogrammed, reversible mechanism that alters gene expression levels across a population1. One well-studied type of phase variation involves enzyme-mediated inversion of specific regions of genomic DNA2. Frequently, these DNA inversions flip the orientation of promoters, turning transcription of adjacent coding regions on or off2. Through this mechanism, inversion can affect fitness, survival or group dynamics3,4. Here, we describe the development of PhaVa, a computational tool that identifies DNA inversions using long-read datasets. We also identify 372 ‘intragenic invertons’, a novel class of DNA inversions found entirely within genes, in genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates. Intragenic invertons allow a gene to encode two or more versions of a protein by flipping a DNA sequence within the coding region, thereby increasing coding capacity without increasing genome size. We validate ten intragenic invertons in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and experimentally characterize an intragenic inverton in the thiamine biosynthesis gene thiC.

 Cancer cells require high levels of iron for rapid proliferation, leading to significant upregulation of cell-surface transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which mediates iron uptake by binding to the iron-carrying protein transferrin1–3. Leveraging this phenomenon and the fast endocytosis rate of TfR1 (refs. 4,5), we developed transferrin receptor targeting chimeras (TransTACs), a heterobispecific antibody modality for membrane protein degradation. TransTACs are engineered to drive rapid co-internalization of a target protein of interest and TfR1 from the cell surface, and to enable target protein entry into the lysosomal degradation pathway. We show that TransTACs can efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native or synthetic membrane proteins, including epidermal growth factor receptor, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1, cluster of differentiation 20 and chimeric antigen receptor. In example applications, TransTACs enabled the reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells and the targeting of drug-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer with the exon 19 deletion/T790M/C797S mutations in a mouse xenograft model. TransTACs represent a promising new family of bifunctional antibodies for precise manipulation of membrane proteins and targeted cancer therapy. Transferrin receptor targeting chimeras have been developed that enable targeting of drug resistance in epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer and reversible control of human primary chimeric antigen receptor T cells, representing a promising new family of bifunctional antibodies for targeted cancer therapy."

 There are more ways to synthesize a 100-amino acid (aa) protein (20100) than there are atoms in the universe. Only a very small fraction of such a vast sequence space can ever be experimentally or computationally surveyed. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces1. However, these models are extremely complicated. Here, by experimentally sampling from sequence spaces larger than 1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable energy models. These models capture the nonlinear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and associated with structural contacts and backbone proximity. Our results indicate that protein genetics is actually both rather simple and intelligible.

 The prevailing methods to make large language models more powerful and amenable have been based on continuous scaling up (that is, increasing their size, data volume and computational resources1) and bespoke shaping up (including post-filtering2,3, fine tuning or use of human feedback4,5). However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, here we show that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. We also find that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, we observe that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount.

 Extracting the underlying temporal structure of experience is a fundamental aspect of learning and memory that allows us to predict what is likely to happen next. Current knowledge about the neural underpinnings of this cognitive process in humans stems from functional neuroimaging research1–5. As these methods lack direct access to the neuronal level, it remains unknown how this process is computed by neurons in the human brain. Here we record from single neurons in individuals who have been implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons, and show that human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons gradually modify their activity to encode the temporal structure of a complex image presentation sequence. This representation was formed rapidly, without providing specific instructions to the participants, and persisted when the prescribed experience was no longer present. Furthermore, the structure recovered from the population activity of hippocampal–entorhinal neurons closely resembled the structural graph defining the sequence, but at the same time, also reflected the probability of upcoming stimuli. Finally, learning of the sequence graph was related to spontaneous, time-compressed replay of individual neurons’ activity corresponding to previously experienced graph trajectories. These findings demonstrate that neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex integrate the ‘what’ and ‘when’ information to extract durable and predictive representations of the temporal structure of human experience. Single-neuron recordings from intracranial electrodes inserted into human brains for clinical reasons suggest that the temporal structure of human experience is encoded in human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons."

 The jet stream is an important dynamic driver of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes1–3. Modern variability in the position of summer jet stream latitude in the North Atlantic–European sector (EU JSL) promotes dipole patterns in air pressure, temperature, precipitation and drought between northwestern and southeastern Europe. EU JSL variability and its impacts on regional climatic extremes and societal events are poorly understood, particularly before anthropogenic warming. Based on three temperature-sensitive European tree-ring records, we develop a reconstruction of interannual summer EU JSL variability over the period 1300–2004 ce (R2 = 38.5%) and compare it to independent historical documented climatic and societal records, such as grape harvest, grain prices, plagues and human mortality. Here we show contrasting summer climate extremes associated with EU JSL variability back to 1300 ce as well as biophysical, economic and human demographic impacts, including wildfires and epidemics. In light of projections for altered jet stream behaviour and intensified climate extremes, our findings underscore the importance of considering EU JSL variability when evaluating amplified future climate risk.

 l-lactate modifies proteins through lactylation1, but how this process occurs is unclear. Here we identify the alanyl-tRNA synthetases AARS1 and AARS2 (AARS1/2) as intracellular l-lactate sensors required for l-lactate to stimulate the lysine lactylome in cells. AARS1/2 and the evolutionarily conserved Escherichia coli orthologue AlaRS bind to l-lactate with micromolar affinity and they directly catalyse l-lactate for ATP-dependent lactylation on the lysine acceptor end. In response to l-lactate, AARS2 associates with cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and mediates its lactylation and inactivation in cells and in mice. By establishing a genetic code expansion orthogonal system for lactyl-lysine incorporation, we demonstrate that the presence of a lactyl moiety at a specific cGAS amino-terminal site abolishes cGAS liquid-like phase separation and DNA sensing in vitro and in vivo. A lactyl mimetic knock-in inhibits cGAS, whereas a lactyl-resistant knock-in protects mice against innate immune evasion induced through high levels of l-lactate. MCT1 blockade inhibits cGAS lactylation in stressed mice and restores innate immune surveillance, which in turn antagonizes viral replication. Thus, AARS1/2 are conserved intracellular l-lactate sensors and have an essential role as lactyltransferases. Moreover, a chemical reaction process of lactylation targets and inactivates cGAS. The tRNA synthases AARS1 and AARS2 are identified as evolutionarily conserved sensors of intracellular l-lactate to mediate the global lysine lactylome."

 Primary production in the sunlit surface ocean is regulated by the supply of key nutrients, primarily nitrate, phosphate and iron (Fe), required by phytoplankton to fix carbon dioxide into biomass1–3. Below the surface ocean, remineralization of sinking organic matter rapidly regenerates nutrients, and microbial metabolism in the upper mesopelagic ‘twilight zone’ (200–500 m) is thought to be limited by the delivery of labile organic carbon4,5. However, few studies have examined the role of nutrients in shaping microbial production in the mesopelagic6–8. Here we report the distribution and uptake of siderophores, biomarkers for microbial Fe deficiency9 across a meridional section of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Siderophore concentrations are high not only in chronically Fe-limited surface waters but also in the twilight zone underlying the North and South Pacific subtropical gyres, two key ecosystems for the marine carbon cycle. Our findings suggest that bacterial Fe deficiency owing to low Fe availability is probably characteristic of the twilight zone in several large ocean basins, greatly expanding the region of the marine water column in which nutrients limit microbial metabolism, with potential implications for ocean carbon storage.

 The acquisition of the load-bearing dentary–squamosal jaw joint was a key step in mammalian evolution1–5. Although this innovation has received decades of study, questions remain over when and how frequently a mammalian-like skull–jaw contact evolved, hindered by a paucity of three-dimensional data spanning the non-mammaliaform cynodont–mammaliaform transition. New discoveries of derived non-mammaliaform probainognathian cynodonts from South America have much to offer to this discussion. Here, to address this issue, we used micro-computed-tomography scanning to reconstruct the jaw joint anatomy of three key probainognathian cynodonts: Brasilodon quadrangularis, the sister taxon to Mammaliaformes6–8, the tritheledontid-related Riograndia guaibensis9 and the tritylodontid Oligokyphus major. We find homoplastic evolution in the jaw joint in the approach to mammaliaforms, with ictidosaurs (Riograndia plus tritheledontids) independently evolving a dentary–squamosal contact approximately 17 million years before this character first appears in mammaliaforms of the Late Triassic period10–12. Brasilodon, contrary to previous descriptions6–8, lacks an incipient dentary condyle and squamosal glenoid and the jaws articulate solely using a plesiomorphic quadrate–articular joint. We postulate that the jaw joint underwent marked evolutionary changes in probainognathian cynodonts. Some probainognathian clades independently acquired ‘double’ craniomandibular contacts, with mammaliaforms attaining a fully independent dentary–squamosal articulation with a conspicuous dentary condyle and squamosal glenoid in the Late Triassic. The dentary–squamosal contact, which is traditionally considered to be a typical mammalian feature, therefore evolved more than once and is more evolutionary labile than previously considered.

 Endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as lysosome-targeting chimaeras1,2 (LYTACs) and cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras3 (KineTACs) have used this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. Although powerful, these approaches can be limited by competition with native ligands and requirements for chemical modification that limit genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and, more generally, there may be no native ligands that stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe computational design approaches for endocytosis-triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), sortilin and transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to soluble or transmembrane target protein binders leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation. As these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. EndoTag fusion to a PD-L1 antibody considerably increases efficacy in a mouse tumour model compared to antibody alone. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher-specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. By promoting endocytosis, EndoTag fusion increases signalling through an engineered ligand–receptor system by nearly 100-fold. EndoTags have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signalling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody–drug and antibody–RNA conjugates. Computationally designed genetically encoded proteins can be used to target surface proteins, thereby triggering endocytosis and subsequent intracellular degradation, activating signalling or increasing cellular uptake in specific tissues."

 Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide-bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis1. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis substantially different in their physical and chemical properties2. In the past three decades, the cation (gallium) face of GaN has been used for photonic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers3–5. Although the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) owing to favourable polarization discontinuities6. In this work, we introduce dualtronics, showing that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face and electronic devices on the anion face of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for making use of both faces of polar semiconductors in a single structure, in which electronic, photonic and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, markedly enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family.

 Current cancer immunotherapy predominately focuses on eliciting type 1 immune responses fighting cancer; however, long-term complete remission remains uncommon1,2. A pivotal question arises as to whether type 2 immunity can be orchestrated alongside type 1-centric immunotherapy to achieve enduring response against cancer3,4. Here we show that an interleukin-4 fusion protein (Fc–IL-4), a typical type 2 cytokine, directly acts on CD8+ T cells and enriches functional terminally exhausted CD8+ T (CD8+ TTE) cells in the tumour. Consequently, Fc–IL-4 enhances antitumour efficacy of type 1 immunity-centric adoptive T cell transfer or immune checkpoint blockade therapies and induces durable remission across several syngeneic and xenograft tumour models. Mechanistically, we discovered that Fc–IL-4 signals through both signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, augmenting the glycolytic metabolism and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) concentration of CD8+ TTE cells in a lactate dehydrogenase A-dependent manner. The metabolic modulation mediated by Fc–IL-4 is indispensable for reinvigorating intratumoural CD8+ TTE cells. These findings underscore Fc–IL-4 as a potent type 2 cytokine-based immunotherapy that synergizes effectively with type 1 immunity to elicit long-lasting responses against cancer. Our study not only sheds light on the synergy between these two types of immune responses, but also unveils an innovative strategy for advancing next-generation cancer immunotherapy by integrating type 2 immune factors.

 Monoatomic-layered carbon materials, such as graphene1 and amorphous monolayer carbon2,3, have stimulated intense fundamental and applied research owing to their unprecedented physical properties and a wide range of promising applications4,5. So far, such materials have mainly been produced by chemical vapour deposition, which typically requires stringent reaction conditions compared to solution-phase synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the solution preparation of free-standing nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon with mixed five-, six- and seven-membered (5-6-7-membered) rings through the polymerization of pyrrole within the confined interlayer cavity of a removable layered-double-hydroxide template. Structural characterizations and first-principles calculations suggest that the nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon was formed by radical polymerization of pyrrole at the α, β and N sites subjected to confinement of the reaction space, which enables bond rearrangements through the Stone–Wales transformation. The spatial confinement inhibits the C–C bond rotation and chain entanglement during polymerization, resulting in an atom-thick continuous amorphous layer with an in-plane π-conjugation electronic structure. The spatially confined radical polymerization using solid templates and ion exchange strategy demonstrates potential as a universal synthesis approach for obtaining two-dimensional covalent networks, as exemplified by the successful synthesis of monolayers of polythiophene and polycarbazole.

 Bacteria defend against phage infection through a variety of antiphage defence systems1. Many defence systems were recently shown to deplete cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in response to infection, by cleaving NAD+ into ADP-ribose (ADPR) and nicotinamide2–7. It was demonstrated that NAD+ depletion during infection deprives the phage of this essential molecule and impedes phage replication. Here we show that a substantial fraction of phages possess enzymatic pathways allowing reconstitution of NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells. We describe NAD+ reconstitution pathway 1 (NARP1), a two-step pathway in which one enzyme phosphorylates ADPR to generate ADPR pyrophosphate (ADPR-PP), and the second enzyme conjugates ADPR-PP and nicotinamide to generate NAD+. Phages encoding NARP1 can overcome a diverse set of defence systems, including Thoeris, DSR1, DSR2, SIR2–HerA and SEFIR, all of which deplete NAD+ as part of their defensive mechanism. Phylogenetic analyses show that NARP1 is primarily encoded on phage genomes, suggesting a phage-specific function in countering bacterial defences. A second pathway, NARP2, allows phages to overcome bacterial defences by building NAD+ using metabolites different from ADPR-PP. Our findings reveal a unique immune evasion strategy in which viruses rebuild molecules depleted by defence systems, thus overcoming host immunity. A study shows that many phages are capable of evading antiphage defence systems of bacteria by reconstituting NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells."

 Down syndrome predisposes individuals to haematological abnormalities, such as increased number of erythrocytes and leukaemia in a process that is initiated before birth and is not entirely understood1–3. Here, to understand dysregulated haematopoiesis in Down syndrome, we integrated single-cell transcriptomics of over 1.1 million cells with chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomics datasets using human fetal liver and bone marrow samples from 3 fetuses with disomy and 15 fetuses with trisomy. We found that differences in gene expression in Down syndrome were dependent on both cell type and environment. Furthermore, we found multiple lines of evidence that haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Down syndrome are ‘primed’ to differentiate. We subsequently established a Down syndrome-specific map linking non-coding elements to genes in disomic and trisomic HSCs using 10X multiome data. By integrating this map with genetic variants associated with blood cell counts, we discovered that trisomy restructured regulatory interactions to dysregulate enhancer activity and gene expression critical to erythroid lineage differentiation. Furthermore, as mutations in Down syndrome display a signature of oxidative stress4,5, we validated both increased mitochondrial mass and oxidative stress in Down syndrome, and observed that these mutations preferentially fell into regulatory regions of expressed genes in HSCs. Together, our single-cell, multi-omic resource provides a high-resolution molecular map of fetal haematopoiesis in Down syndrome and indicates significant regulatory restructuring giving rise to co-occurring haematological conditions. Using single-cell and multi-omics data of fetal blood, a high-resolution molecular map of dysregulated haematopoiesis in Down syndrome is provided."

 Despite a high response rate in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)1–3, approximately 50% of patients relapse within the first year4–6, representing an urgent question to address in the next stage of cellular immunotherapy. Here, to investigate the molecular determinants of ultralong CAR T cell persistence, we obtained a single-cell multi-omics atlas from 695,819 pre-infusion CAR T cells at the basal level or after CAR-specific stimulation from 82 paediatric patients with ALL enrolled in the first two CAR T ALL clinical trials and 6 healthy donors. We identified that elevated type 2 functionality in CAR T infusion products is significantly associated with patients maintaining a median B cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years. Analysis of ligand–receptor interactions revealed that type 2 cells regulate a dysfunctional subset to maintain whole-population homeostasis, and the addition of IL-4 during antigen-specific activation alleviates CAR T cell dysfunction while enhancing fitness at both transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. Serial proteomic profiling of sera after treatment revealed a higher level of circulating type 2 cytokines in 5-year or 8-year relapse-free responders. In a leukaemic mouse model, type 2high CAR T cell products demonstrated superior expansion and antitumour activity, particularly after leukaemia rechallenge. Restoring antitumour efficacy in type 2low CAR T cells was attainable by enhancing their type 2 functionality, either through incorporating IL-4 into the manufacturing process or by priming manufactured CAR T products with IL-4 before infusion. Our findings provide insights into the mediators of durable CAR T therapy response and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to sustain long-term remission by boosting type 2 functionality in CAR T cells. Elevated type 2 functionality in CAR T cell infusion products is significantly associated with maintenance of a median B cell aplasia duration of 8.4 years in paediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia."

 Covalent bonds share electron pairs between two atoms and make up the skeletons of most organic compounds in single, double and triple bonds. In contrast, examples of one-electron bonds remain scarce, most probably due to their intrinsic weakness1–4. Although several pioneering studies have reported one-electron bonds between heteroatoms, direct evidence for one-electron bonds between carbon atoms remains elusive. Here we report the isolation of a compound with a one-electron σ-bond between carbon atoms by means of the one-electron oxidation of a hydrocarbon with an elongated C–C single bond5,6. The presence of the C•C one-electron σ-bond (2.921(3) Å at 100 K) was confirmed experimentally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy, and theoretically by density functional theory calculations. The results of this paper unequivocally demonstrate the existence of a C•C one-electron σ-bond, which was postulated nearly a century ago7, and can thus be expected to pave the way for further development in different areas of chemistry by probing the boundary between bonded and non-bonded states.

 The ribonuclease FttA (also known as aCPSF and aCPSF1) mediates factor-dependent transcription termination in archaea1–3. Here we report the structure of a Thermococcus kodakarensis transcription pre-termination complex comprising FttA, Spt4, Spt5 and a transcription elongation complex (TEC). The structure shows that FttA interacts with the TEC in a manner that enables RNA to proceed directly from the TEC RNA-exit channel to the FttA catalytic centre and that enables endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA, followed by 5′→3′ exonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA and concomitant 5′→3′ translocation of FttA on RNA, to apply mechanical force to the TEC and trigger termination. The structure further reveals that Spt5 bridges FttA and the TEC, explaining how Spt5 stimulates FttA-dependent termination. The results reveal functional analogy between bacterial and archaeal factor-dependent termination, functional homology between archaeal and eukaryotic factor-dependent termination, and fundamental mechanistic similarities in factor-dependent termination in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.

 Earth system models have been continously improved over the past decades, but systematic errors compared with observations and uncertainties in climate projections remain. This is due mainly to the imperfect representation of subgrid-scale or unknown processes. Here we propose a next-generation Earth system modelling approach with artificial intelligence that calls for accelerated models, machine-learning integration, systematic use of Earth observations and modernized infrastructures. The synergistic approach will allow faster and more accurate policy-relevant climate information delivery. We argue a multiscale approach is needed, making use of kilometre-scale climate models and improved coarser-resolution hybrid Earth system models that include essential Earth system processes and feedbacks yet are still fast enough to deliver large ensembles for better quantification of internal variability and extremes. Together, these can form a step change in the accuracy and utility of climate projections, meeting urgent mitigation and adaptation needs of society and ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.

 Mutant selective drugs targeting the inactive, GDP-bound form of KRASG12C have been approved for use in lung cancer, but resistance develops rapidly. Here we use an inhibitor, (RMC-4998) that targets RASG12C in its active, GTP-bound form, to treat KRAS mutant lung cancer in various immune competent mouse models. RAS pathway reactivation after RMC-4998 treatment could be delayed using combined treatment with a SHP2 inhibitor, which not only impacts tumour cell RAS signalling but also remodels the tumour microenvironment to be less immunosuppressive. In an immune inflamed model, RAS and SHP2 inhibitors in combination drive durable responses by suppressing tumour relapse and inducing development of immune memory. In an immune excluded model, combined RAS and SHP2 inhibition sensitises tumours to immune checkpoint blockade, leading to efficient tumour immune rejection. These preclinical results demonstrate the potential of the combination of RAS(ON) G12C-selective inhibitors with SHP2 inhibitors to sensitize tumours to immune checkpoint blockade. GDP-bound form of KRASG12C inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced KRASG12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however resistance to these drugs is often observed. Here the authors report that combining a GTP-bound RAS G12C-selective inhibitor with SHP2 inhibition can sensitize lung tumours to immune checkpoint blockade."

 Cells harvest energy from ionic gradients by selective ion transport across membranes, and the same principle is recently being used for osmotic power generation from salinity gradients at ocean-river interfaces. Common to these ionic gradient conversions is that they require intricate nanoscale structures. Here, we show that natural submarine serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal vent (HV) precipitates are capable of converting ionic gradients into electrochemical energy by selective transport of Na+, K+, H+, and Cl-. Layered hydroxide nanocrystals are aligned radially outwards from the HV fluid channels, constituting confined nanopores that span millimeters in the HV wall. The nanopores change the surface charge depending on adsorbed ions, allowing the mineral to function as a cation- and anion-selective ion transport membrane. Our findings indicate that chemical disequilibria originating from flow and concentration gradients in geologic environments generate confined nanospaces which enable the spontaneous establishment of osmotic energy conversion.

 Marine phytoplankton are essential to ocean biogeochemical cycles. However, our understanding of changes in phytoplankton rely largely on satellite data, which can only assess changes in surface phytoplankton. How climate variability is impacting their vertical structure remains unclear. Here we use 33 years’ worth of data from the Sargasso Sea to show distinct seasonal and long-term phytoplankton climate responses in the surface mixed layer compared with the subsurface. Seasonally, the surface community alters their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio without changing their carbon biomass, whereas the chlorophyll a and carbon of the subsurface community covaries with no change in their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio. Over the last decade, the subsurface phytoplankton biomass has increased in response to warming, whereas the surface phytoplankton have altered their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio with minimal change in their carbon biomass. Given that satellites can only view the surface ocean, sustained subsurface monitoring is required to provide a full understanding of how phytoplankton are responding to climate change.

Cost–benefit analysis shows that the main barriers lie in the non-pecuniary costs of behaviour switching, and highlights opportunities for targeted policy intervention. 
 Demand-side mitigation relies on individuals’ and households’ willingness to alter their consumption habits and daily routines to reduce their carbon footprint. Despite optimistic forecasts for well-being improvements, broad adoption of these behavioural changes remains elusive. Our study analyses 12 behaviours in Beijing, China, using a cost–benefit approach that includes both tangible (pecuniary) and intangible (non-pecuniary) benefits. Our findings indicate that eight behaviours result in individual-level welfare loss. Even after accounting for mitigation benefits, seven behaviours still incur social-welfare loss. Monte Carlo simulations unveil substantial variability in welfare impacts, highlighting opportunities for targeted policy interventions. Depending on the perspective (individual versus societal) and the goal (welfare versus mitigation), we recommend four demand-side practices for Beijing policymakers. In addition, we propose actionable steps on the basis of sensitivity analyses. This study underscores the need for an objective and universally applicable framework to evaluate demand-side behaviours and optimize emissions reduction potential.

An analysis based on historical trends in policy-driven technologies, current plans and their failure rates shows that a number of 2 °C pathways are feasible, but most 1.5 °C pathways are not. 
 Climate change mitigation requires the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Recent plans indicate an eight-fold increase in CCS capacity by 2030, yet the feasibility of CCS expansion is debated. Using historical growth of CCS and other policy-driven technologies, we show that if plans double between 2023 and 2025 and their failure rates decrease by half, CCS could reach 0.37 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2030—lower than most 1.5 °C pathways but higher than most 2 °C pathways. Staying on-track to 2 °C would require that in 2030–2040 CCS accelerates at least as fast as wind power did in the 2000s, and that after 2040, it grows faster than nuclear power did in the 1970s to 1980s. Only 10% of mitigation pathways meet these feasibility constraints, and virtually all of them depict <600 GtCO2 captured and stored by 2100. Relaxing the constraints by assuming no failures of CCS plans and growth as fast as flue-gas desulfurization would approximately double this amount.

 Mantle plumes are responsible for the Earth’s largest volcanic provinces. In the prevailing paradigm, the deep mantle is less degassed than convecting shallow mantle, implying that plume-derived lavas have higher concentrations of primordial volatiles such as helium (He). Demonstrating this has led to explanations that question the established Earth model. Here, we show that the 3He/4He of basalts from the Red Sea display coherent relationships with trace elements, allowing the helium concentration of the Afar plume to be calculated. Contrary to the prevailing model it appears the helium concentration of the Afar plume is 10-25% of the upper mantle. This contradiction is resolved if the plume material itself is a mixture of helium-rich high-3He/4He deep mantle with helium-depleted low-3He/4He recently subducted oceanic crust. This implies that helium-depleted domains may exist in convecting mantle and that moderately high 3He/4He plumes likely do not contain a notable contribution of the deep mantle.

 The world’s first scientific satellite for sustainable development goals (SDGSAT-1) provides valuable data about offshore small-scale ocean phenomena, including the Kármán vortex street phenomenon. Although the simulation of the oceanic vortex street phenomenon is crucial for understanding not only the mechanisms of vortex formation in fluid dynamics but also their impact on the surrounding environment, the traditional simulation relies on the strong theoretical hypothesis of Navier–Stokes equations. Here, we propose a self-supervised neural network with high generalization ability to implement Navier–Stokes equations, simulating realistic oceanic vortex streets. Specifically, the physical informed convolutional neural network is first employed to determine the corresponding pressure and velocity fields, achieving accurate simulation of oceanic vortex streets with lower computational cost; Then, the observational islands in SDGSAT-1 imagery are embedded as obstacles, meanwhile, the marine background field including wind and terrain is synchronously incorporated to achieve more realistic simulation results compared with traditional methods; Finally, the morphological parameters of oceanic vortex streets are calculated and associated analysis are carried out to deepen our understanding of small scale vortex street phenomena. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated our proposed method can obtain promising time efficiency. With this partial differential equation deep learning solver framework combining observation and theory, there will be potential to expedite the cognitive process of oceanic phenomena."

 Urban green spaces (UGS) provide ecological and habitat benefits such as carbon sequestration, oxygen production, humidity increase, noise reduction, and pollution absorption. UGS maps derived from remote sensing images serve as the fundamental data for urban planning and carbon sequestration assessments. However, the spatial resolution of remote sensing image and the pattern of urban structures significantly influence UGS mapping, making it challenging to obtain accurate UGS maps. To investigate the impact of spatial resolution on UGS mapping, this study utilized five different spatial resolution datasets: Gaofen2 (1 m, 4 m), Sentinel2 (10 m), and Landsat8 (15 m, 30 m). Random forest, LightGBM, and support vector machine were employed to map UGS, and the accuracies of UGS maps at different spatial resolutions were compared. Subsequently, the spatial distribution patterns of uncertainties in UGS maps were analyzed from both overall and urban functional zone perspectives. Furthermore, the uncertainty analysis of UGS mapping was conducted considering different landscape patterns in urban functional zones. The results indicate: (1) UGS map varies at different spatial resolution. Higher uncertainties associated with coarser spatial resolutions. Medium and coarse spatial resolution images inadequately capture the fine-grained distribution of urban green spaces. (2) Uncertainty in UGS mapping at different spatial resolutions is generally consistent in spatial distribution. From a functional zoning perspective, the accuracy of green space mapping over non-natural zones is sensitive to spatial resolution. (3) The distribution pattern of UGS patches affects the accuracy of UGS mapping. Uncertainty can be reduced in UGS mapping at medium and coarse spatial resolutions based on UGS landscape pattern indices by multiple linear regression, random forest and LightGBM model. This study comprehensively reveals that uncertainties in mapping UGS from multi-spatial resolution remote sensing images vary across urban functional zones and landscape pattern indices, and it is the first attempt to propose methods for UGS area correction based on landscape pattern indices. The results of this study will facilitate the application of remote sensing data at different spatial resolutions in urban areas."

 As fine particulate matter (PM2.5) poses significant environmental and human health risks, there is an urgent need for accurate forecasting systems. In Taiwan, the current air quality forecasting (AQF) system based on the Weather Research and Forecasting meteorological model and Community Multiscale Air Quality model provides essential predictions but is limited by biases and computational complexities. This study introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based PM2.5 forecasting model to enhance prediction accuracy. The CNN model incorporates hourly PM2.5 concentrations from surface observations and the AQF system, along with synoptic weather patterns (SWPs), to predict PM2.5 levels up to 72 h in advance. Three CNN models were developed: CNN-BASE (without SWPs), CNN-SWP (with SWPs), and CNN-SWPW (with SWPs and a weighted loss function). Performance assessment reveals a significant reduction in the mean RMSE of 72-h PM2.5 prediction, from 10.48 μg/m3 with the AQF system to 6.88 μg/m3 with the CNN-BASE model. However, CNN-BASE showed the lowest prediction accuracy for high PM2.5 concentrations (only 26.2%) due to a small subset of samples. Including SWPs improves the model's ability to capture meteorological influences, enhancing predictions of high PM2.5 concentrations. Furthermore, CNN-SWPW incorporates a weighted loss function to address imbalanced sample size distributions, further enhancing the accuracy of high PM2.5 predictions. This study demonstrates the potential of CNNs in operational air quality forecasting."

Cordell;Robert S. Blake;Michael J. Wilde;Paul S. Monks,Impact of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown on the concentration of non-methane volatile organic compounds in a UK urban atmosphere,"•Lockdown brought about decrease (20–60%) for non-methane volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxideNO2but an increase in ozoneO3. •Alkanes had the highest contribution to atmosphere and ethanol was the most abundant compound. •Toluene benzene ratio during LD indicated additional sources of biomass, domestic heating other than traffic emissions. 
 The changes in air quality brought about by the COVID-19 lockdowns can provide valuable insight into how longer-term reductions in emissions might affect atmospheric composition. In urban Leicester UK, the 2020 COVID “lockdown” brought about several notable changes in atmospheric composition, including a considerable decrease (20–60%) in concentrations of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Given their varied emission sources and lifetimes, NMVOC data can give valuable insights into how behavioural change impact atmospheric composition. The total concentration of 48 NMVOCs at roadside (RS) sites decreased from a pre-lockdown (sampled 16th-24th March 2020) concentration of 181.3 ± 41.4 μg/m3 to 82.0 ± 12.8 μg/m3 during lockdown (LD, sampled 18th-21st May 2020), before rebounding to a concentration of 236.3 ± 23.9 μg/m3 post lockdown (post-LD, sampled 14th-17th Sept 2020). A similar pattern was observed at urban background (UB) sites with concentrations reducing during lockdown to 96.8 ± 39.5 μg/m3 from a pre-lockdown (pre-LD) concentration of 123.2 ± 24.6 μg/m3 and then increasing to 168.6 ± 29.1 μg/m3 post-LD.Generally, despite the decrease in NMVOC concentrations during the LD, an increase in O3 level was observed. This was attributed to decreased emissions of NOx and the subsequent repartioning of Ox. This research assessed the quantitative effect of changes in vehicular and related anthropogenic emissions on air quality, providing valuable insights for the formulation of future air pollution controls."

 In recent years, Chinese cities have faced persistent O3 pollution challenges. O3 concentrations at urban mountain sites, serving as proxies for urban background O3 levels, can help address data gaps in O3 research in China. This study, for the first time, analyzed O3 data from ten urban mountain sites during 2015–2022 using statistical methods like the Mann-Kendall test, Theil-Sen slope estimation, and Pearson correlation analysis to reveal characteristics and trends in urban background O3 and proposed a metric for assessing mountain sites as urban background stations. Results indicate that O3 at mountain sites were generally higher than at plain sites, regardless of mean, 10th percentile, or 90th percentile the average maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3. Although mountain sites exhibited similar annual and diurnal variations as plain sites, their amplitudes were significantly lower. Significant upward trends (P < 0.05) in MDA8 O3 were observed mainly at plain sites, whereas trends at mountain sites were insignificant (P > 0.05) during 2015–2022. The increase in urban ground-level O3 was largely due to changes in VOCs and NOx emission structures, which reduce nighttime titration effects while enhancing daytime O3 production. The insignificant trends observed at mountain sites suggest that these mountain sites may be in NOx-limited or transitional regimes rather than VOCs-limited regimes, which is also associated with their lower NOx concentrations compared to plain sites. These findings suggest that if China continues to prioritize the reduction of NOx emissions, urban ground-level O3 could further increase and approach the O3 at mountain sites. Finally, this study proposes that the correlation in nighttime O3 concentrations between mountain and plain stations can serve as a valuable indicator for evaluating the suitability of mountain stations as regional background stations in urban areas. It recommends mountain sites in cities such as Changji, Nanping for urban background O3 monitoring stations."

During this time, marine biota was affected by global climate cooling and the restriction of the Mediterranean’s connection to the Atlantic Ocean that peaked with the Messinian salinity crisis. Although the net change in species richness from the Tortonian to the Zanclean varies by group, species turnover is greater than 30% in all cases, reflecting a high degree of reorganization of the marine ecosystem after the crisis.

Here, we designed an “AND” logic gate–based supramolecular therapeutic platform (HA-BPY-GEF-NPs) for the treatment of EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC. This system integrates both internal and external stimuli–responsive mechanisms that need to be activated in a preset sequence, enabling it to precisely control drug release behavior for enhancing therapeutic precision. By programming the system to respond to sequential near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and enzyme (cathepsin B) inputs, the release of gefitinib is effectively confined to the tumor region. Moreover, the NIR irradiation induces reactive oxygen species production, suppressing tumor growth and inhibiting bypass signaling pathways. The designed drug delivery system offers a highly controlled and targeted therapeutic approach, effectively inhibiting tumor growth, suppressing bypass signaling pathways, and overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance, thus offering a potential solution for maximizing therapeutic benefits."

Drawing inspiration from the unparalleled selectivity of biological systems, which benefit from the sophisticated spatial organization of functionalities, we posit that manipulating the arrangement of the membrane’s building blocks, an aspect previously given limited attention, can address this challenge. We demonstrate that optimizing the face-to-face orientation of building blocks during the assembly of covalent-organic-framework (COF) membranes improves ion-π interactions with multivalent ions. This optimization leads to extraordinary selectivity in differentiating between monovalent cations and anions from their multivalent counterparts, achieving selectivity factors of 214 for K+/Al3+and 451 for NO3−/PO43−. Leveraging this attribute, the COF membrane facilitates the direct extraction of NaCl from seawater with a purity of 99.57%.

The fate of that carbon remains poorly constrained. The hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks, rich in Fe(II) and Mg, forms both abiotic methane, serpentine, and high-surface-area smectite clays. Given the abundance of ultramafic rocks and smectite in the Martian upper crust and the growing evidence of organic carbon in Martian sedimentary rocks, we quantify the effects of ultramafic alteration on the carbon cycle of early Mars. We calculate the capacity of Noachian-age clays to store organic carbon. Up to 1.7 bar of CO2can plausibly be adsorbed on clay surfaces. Coupling abiotic methanogenesis with best estimates of Mars’ δ13C history predicts a reservoir of 0.6 to 1.3 bar of CO2equivalent. Such a reservoir could be used as an energy source for long-term missions. Our results further illustrate the control of water-rock reactions on the atmospheric evolution of planets."

An attosecond pulse drives the excitations of an electronic wavepacket in water molecules. The process comprises two steps: a transition to core-excited states near the oxygen atoms accompanied by transition to valence-excited states. Thus, the wavepacket is impulsively created at a specific atomic site within a few hundred attoseconds through a nonlinear interaction between the water and the x-ray pulse. We observe this nonlinear signature in an intensity-dependent Stokes Raman sideband at 526 eV. Our measurements are supported by our state-of-the-art calculations based on the polarization response of water dimers in bulk solvation and propagation of attosecond x-ray pulses at liquid density."

Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the presence of a CD40-expressing CD206+CD163+macrophage population dominating the inflamed RA synovium, associated with disease activity and treatment response. In-depth RNA sequencing and metabolic analysis demonstrated that this macrophage population is transcriptionally distinct, displaying unique inflammatory and tissue-resident gene signatures, has a stable bioenergetic profile, and regulates stromal cell responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling of 67,908 RA and HC synovial tissue cells identified nine transcriptionally distinct macrophage clusters. IL-1B+CCL20+and SPP1+MT2A+are the principal macrophage clusters in RA synovium, displaying heightened CD40 gene expression, capable of shaping stromal cell responses, and are importantly enriched before disease onset. Combined, these findings identify the presence of an early pathogenic myeloid signature that shapes the RA joint microenvironment and represents a unique opportunity for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention."

Although specific cell types have been proposed to underlie itch, the neural basis for itch remains unclear. Here, we used two-photon Ca2+imaging of the dorsal horn to visualize neuronal populations that are activated by itch-inducing agents. We identify a convergent population of spinal interneurons recruited by diverse itch-causing stimuli that represents a subset of neurons that express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). Moreover, we find that itch is conveyed to the brain via GRPR-expressing spinal output neurons that target the lateral parabrachial nuclei. We then show that the kappa opioid receptor agonist nalfurafine relieves itch by selectively inhibiting GRPR spinoparabrachial neurons. These experiments provide a population-level view of the spinal neurons that respond to pruritic stimuli, pinpoint the output neurons that convey itch to the brain, and identify the cellular target of kappa opioid receptor agonists for the inhibition of itch."

Using an ultraviolet Raman and luminescence spectrometer, the Perseverance rover detected luminescence signals with maximal intensities at 330 to 350 nanometers and 270 to 290 nanometers that were initially reported as consistent with organics. Here, we test the alternative hypothesis that the 330- to 350-nanometer and 270- to 290-nanometer luminescence signals trace Ce3+in phosphate and silicate defects, respectively. By comparing the distributions of luminescence signals with the rover detections of x-ray fluorescence from P2O5and Si-bearing materials, we show that, while an organic origin is not excluded, the observed luminescence can be explained by purely inorganic materials. These findings highlight the importance of eventual laboratory analyses to detect and characterize organic compounds in the returned samples."

Complementation of brassinosteroid-blind receptor mutants byBRI1expression with various tissue-specific promoters implied that local brassinosteroid signaling may instruct growth non–cell autonomously. Here, we performed such rescues with a panel of receptor variants and promoters, in combination with tissue-specific transgene knockouts. Our experiments demonstrate that brassinosteroid receptor expression in several tissues is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. Moreover, complementation with tissue-specific promoters requires the genuineBRI1gene body sequence, which confers ubiquitous expression of trace receptor amounts that are sufficient to promote brassinosteroid-dependent root growth. Our data, therefore, argue for a largely cell-autonomous action of brassinosteroid receptors."

However, γThas declined since then. Understanding whether these variations in γTreflect forced changes or internal climate variability in the carbon cycle is crucial for future climate projections. We show that doubling sensitivity events can arise in simulations by Earth system models with perturbed initial conditions but are likely explained by internal climate variability. We show that the doubling sensitivity event is associated with the occurrence of a few, but very strong, El Niño events, such as 1982/83 and 1997/98. Such extreme events result in concurrent carbon release by tropical and extratropical ecosystems, increasing the variance of the global land carbon sink and its apparent sensitivity to tropical temperature.
