10.5194/acp-25-12811-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了2022年夏季热浪期间气溶胶光学吸湿性和新粒子生成的变化。研究发现，在热浪期间，新粒子生成日的气溶胶光学吸湿性通常高于非事件日，这可能是由于光氧化作用增强导致更多的二次生成和颗粒增长。这会进一步影响气溶胶的直接辐射强迫。该研究还识别了两种不同类型的新粒子生成事件，并分析了它们在热浪期间的差异。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶的物理化学性质、大气成分分析以及它们对气候的影响，这些都可以通过遥感技术进行监测和研究。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或其他遥感技术的使用，但其研究结果对于理解和验证遥感数据具有重要意义，并可以用于改进空气质量监测模型。,"['aerosol optical hygroscopicity', 'new particle formation (NPF)', 'aerosol direct radiative forcing', 'particle number size distribution (PNSD)', 'aerosol chemical composition', 'heatwave effects on aerosols', 'atmospheric aging', 'photooxidation', 'aerosol effective radius', 'aerosol hemispheric backscattering fraction', 'scattering Ångström exponent', 'air quality monitoring']",Yuhang Hao;Peizhao Li;Yafeng Gou;Zhenshuai Wang;Mi Tian;Yang Chen;Ye Kuang;Hanbing Xu;Fenglian Wan;Yuqian Luo;Wei Huang;Jing Chen,Divergent changes in aerosol optical hygroscopicity and new particle formation during a heatwave of summer 2022,"Intensified heatwaves under global warming have influenced new particle formation (NPF) and related aerosol physicochemical properties. We show that aerosol optical hygroscopicity (f(RH)) was generally higher on NPF days than in non-event cases, likely due to enhanced secondary formation and subsequent growth of both pre-existing and newly formed particles with stronger photooxidation, specifically under persistent heatwaves. This would further impact the aerosol direct radiative forcing. 
 As a crucial climate-forcing driver, the aerosol optical enhancement factor (f(RH)) is significantly modulated by chemical compositions and the evolution of particle number size distribution (PNSD), e.g., during new particle formation (NPF). However, mechanisms regulating aerosol optical hygroscopicity during different NPF days, particularly those under heatwaves due to global warming, remain poorly understood. In the hot summer of 2022 in urban Chongqing of southwest China, simultaneous measurements of aerosol optical and hygroscopic properties, PNSD, and bulk chemical compositions were conducted. Two distinct types of NPFs were identified: NPFs with relatively polluted periods (NPFpolluted) and  clean cases during heatwave-dominated periods (NPFclean, HW). Compared to the NPFpolluted events, NPFclean, HW occurred approximately 1 h earlier, and the subsequent growth was prolonged, accompanied by a smaller aerosol effective radius (Reff) and lower formation/growth rate during heatwaves. This agreed with the concurrently increased aerosol hemispheric backscattering fraction and scattering Ångström exponent. A generally higher f(RH) was observed on NPF days than in non-event cases, partly attributable to distinct changes in PNSD patterns during NPF days. Moreover, heatwave-induced stronger photooxidation may intensify the formation of more hygroscopic secondary components and prolong the atmospheric aging/subsequent growth of both pre-existing and newly formed particles, largely contributing to the enhanced f(RH), especially during NPFclean, HW days. The higher f(RH) and lowered Reff could synergistically elevate the aerosol direct radiative forcing, specifically under persistent heatwave conditions. Further in-depth exploration of molecular-level characterizations and the aerosol radiative impacts of both direct and indirect interactions under heatwaves in a warming climate is recommended."

Daellenbach;Matteo Rinaldi,"Unraveling Arctic submicron organic aerosol sources: a year-long study by H-NMR and AMS in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard","A year-long set of submicron aerosol samples (PM1) from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, was analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-NMR) and high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-AMS) to characterize the organic fraction. Positive matrix factorization identified five organic aerosol sources. Winter–spring was dominated by Eurasian pollution and summer by marine biogenic aerosols, with occasional wildfire events. 
 Understanding the chemical composition and sources of organic aerosol (OA) in the Arctic is critical given its importance for particle climate-relevant properties. This study presents a year-long analysis (May 2019–June 2020) of PM1 filter samples collected in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. A multi-instrumental approach is employed to characterize the comprehensive chemical composition of PM1, with a specific focus on its water-soluble organic fraction depicted combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-NMR) and high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-TOF-AMS), which provide complementary insights into the nature and structure of the organic aerosol classes characterizing the bulk OA mixture. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment identifies consistent OA sources from the H-NMR and AMS datasets, showing a pronounced seasonality in their relative contributions to total OA mass. Winter–spring aerosol is dominated by long-range transport of Eurasian anthropogenic pollution (up to 70 %), while summer is characterized by biogenic aerosols from marine sources (up to 44 %), including sulfur compounds, amines, and fatty acids. Occasional summertime high OA loadings are associated with wildfire aerosols enriched in levoglucosan and humic-like substances (HULIS; averagely 27 %–28 %). Eventually, about 28 %–40 % of the OA mass is attributed to an unresolved mixture of extremely oxidized compounds of difficult specific source attribution. This integrated approach provides valuable insights into the seasonal dynamics of OA sources in the Arctic."
10.5194/acp-25-12831-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了太阳天顶角、云光学厚度和地表反照率对北极低层云太阳辐射效应的影响，重点关注开阔海洋和海冰区域。虽然论文没有直接提及特定的卫星或传感器，但其研究结果与利用遥感技术（如卫星观测）监测云层特性、地表反照率以及评估辐射能量平衡密切相关。研究结果可以帮助改进气候模型中对这些过程的模拟，从而提高对北极气候变化的理解和预测能力。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的关联性，特别是在云和辐射研究领域。,"['solar zenith angle', 'cloud optical thickness', 'surface albedo', 'solar radiative effect', 'Arctic low-level clouds', 'radiative energy budget', 'airborne observations', 'climate models', 'surface temperature', 'satellite observations (implied)']",Sebastian Becker;André Ehrlich;Michael Schäfer;Manfred Wendisch,"Quantifying the impact of solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness, and surface albedo on the solar radiative effect of Arctic low-level clouds over open ocean and sea ice","Clouds interact with solar radiation and can alter the surface temperature. The strength of this cloud impact is driven by cloud properties as well as solar elevation and surface reflection. As these dependencies are poorly represented in climate models, cloud, surface, and radiation observations are used to quantify the contributions of the drivers in the Arctic. It is shown that the weaker surface reflection dominates the stronger cooling effect of clouds over open ocean compared to sea ice. 
 Arctic low-level clouds play an important, albeit uncertain, role in the Arctic climate system. Consequently, their effect on the radiative energy budget (REB) is subject to considerable uncertainty as well. To reduce this uncertainty and to assess the importance of processes driving the cloud radiative effect (CRE), it is crucial to quantitatively disentangle the impact of essential parameters that non-linearly affect the CRE. Therefore, this study uses a CRE parameterization and low-level airborne REB observations in combination with an approach similarly applied in climate dynamics to quantify the contributions of the concurrently observed solar zenith angle (SZA), cloud optical thickness, and surface albedo on the solar CRE at the surface. Based on a case study characterized by inhomogeneous cloud and surface conditions in the marginal sea ice zone, it is shown that the surface albedo contributed more than 95 % to the solar CRE difference between open ocean and sea ice. Using the same approach, the analysis is extended to observations from a series of aircraft campaigns and indicates that the variability in the non-cloud properties SZA and surface albedo between seasons and surface types, respectively, has a larger impact on the resulting difference in the solar CRE than the variability in cloud properties."
10.5194/acp-25-12843-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用MATS卫星对中间层和低热层的大气辉光进行了全球观测。重点关注了由大气潮汐和行星波引起的大尺度扰动对O2辉光的影响。观测结果显示，日落时分的赤道地区辉光强度达到最大值，而日出时分则出现最小值，这与大气潮汐的预期行为相符。此外，还在北半球高纬度地区观测到了一种向西传播的扰动，被解释为准10天纬向波数为1的行星波。因此，该研究与利用卫星观测进行大气成分分析和大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['O2 airglow', 'MATS satellite', 'Mesosphere', 'Lower thermosphere', 'Atmospheric tides', 'Planetary waves', 'Limb imager', 'Equatorial maximum', 'Dayglow']",Björn Linder;Lukas Krasauskas;Linda Megner;Donal P. Murtagh,The global O2 airglow field as seen by the MATS satellite: strong equatorial maximum and planetary wave influence,"The Swedish satellite MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) conducts global measurements of atmospheric airglow in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. In this article, we present the first global results from the mission. Observations from February to April 2023 show that the emission strength is largely controlled by atmospheric tides and by perturbations introduced by a propagating planetary wave. 
 The Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy (MATS) satellite was launched in November 2022, carrying as its main instrument a limb-viewing telescope with six spectral channels designed to image atmospheric O2 airglow and noctilucent clouds. Although the main objective of the satellite mission is to observe structures in the airglow introduced by propagating smaller-scale waves, the airglow emissions are also subjected to large-scale dynamic disturbances, such as atmospheric tides and planetary waves. This work presents large-scale structures in the airglow field, as observed by the MATS limb imager from February 2023 to April 2023. The ascending (north-going) node in the satellite orbit, corresponding to the local sunset, is dominated by a strong equatorial maximum in the dayglow. In contrast, the descending (south-going) node, corresponding to the local sunrise, indicates an accompanying equatorial minimum. These characteristics align with the expected behaviour of atmospheric tidal movements. Specifically, a downwelling of atomic oxygen is expected over the Equator at local sunset, contributing to airglow chemistry and enhancing the emissions. Another distinct feature in the data is a westward propagating disturbance observed at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere, maximising in February, interpreted as the quasi-10 d planetary wave of zonal wavenumber 1."
10.5194/amt-18-5349-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种新型的松弛涡度累积（REA）采样系统，专门用于基于放射性碳（14C）区分化石和非化石来源的城市二氧化碳（CO2）排放。该系统通过有条件地收集空气样本，并分析其中的14CO2含量，来估算空气中化石燃料CO2的浓度，从而实现对城市环境中总CO2排放中化石和非化石成分的区分。虽然该研究没有直接使用卫星观测或遥感技术，但它通过地面测量来监测大气成分，特别是CO2的来源，这与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。该研究的结果可以用于验证和校准基于遥感的CO2排放估算模型，从而提高空气质量监测的准确性。,"['CO2 fluxes', 'fossil fuel CO2', 'radiocarbon (14C)', 'urban CO2', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Ann-Kristin Kunz;Lars Borchardt;Andreas Christen;Julian Della Coletta;Markus Eritt;Xochilt Gutiérrez;Josh Hashemi;Rainer Hilland;Armin Jordan;Richard Kneißl;Virgile Legendre;Ingeborg Levin;Susanne Preunkert;Pascal Rubli;Stavros Stagakis;Samuel Hammer,A relaxed eddy accumulation flask sampling system for 14C-based partitioning of fossil and non-fossil CO2 fluxes,"We present, to our knowledge, the first relaxed eddy accumulation system explicitly tailored to a radiocarbon (14C)-based partitioning of fossil and non-fossil urban CO2 fluxes. Laboratory tests and in-depth quality and performance checks prove that the system meets the technical requirements. A pilot application on a tall tower in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, demonstrates the ability to separate fossil and non-fossil CO2 components within the typical precision of 14C measurements. 
 A relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system was developed and tested, enabling conditional sampling of air for subsequent 14CO2  analysis. This allows a 14C-based estimation of fossil fuel CO2 concentrations in the collected air samples and, thus, an observation-based partitioning of total CO2 fluxes measured in urban environments by eddy covariance into fossil and non-fossil components. This article describes the REA system, evaluates its performance, and assesses uncertainties in the concentration measurements. In the REA system, two separate inlet lines equipped with fast-response valves and loop systems adapted to the technical requirements enable the conditional collection of air in two sets of aluminum cylinders for updraft and downdraft samples, respectively. The switching between updraft sampling, downdraft sampling, and standby mode is thereby determined by the vertical wind measured at 20 Hz by a co-located ultrasonic 3D anemometer. A logger program provides different options for the definition of a deadband, which is used to increase the concentration differences between updraft and downdraft samples. After the sampling interval, the accumulated air is transferred by an automated 24-port flask sampler into 3 L glass flasks, which can be analyzed in the laboratory, and the cylinders are  re-evacuated for the next sampling. The REA system was tested in the laboratory, as well as on a tall tower near the city center of Zurich, Switzerland. Between July 2022 and April 2023, 103 REA updraft and downdraft flask pairs for flux measurements and 9 flask pairs for quality control purposes were selected from the tall tower for laboratory analysis based on suitable micro-meteorological conditions. Uncertainties in the CO2 concentration differences between updraft and downdraft flasks were estimated by simulations using 20 Hz in situ measurements of a closed-path gas analyzer and an open-path gas analyzer co-located with the ultrasonic anemometer. The measurements show that there is no significant bias in the concentration differences between updraft and downdraft samples and that uncertainties due to the sampling process are negligible when estimating fossil fuel CO2 signals. In the Zurich measurements, the CO2 concentration differences between the flask pairs agreed with the differences obtained from in situ measurements within −0.005 ± 0.227 ppm. The largest source of uncertainty, as well as the main limitation, in the separation of fossil and non-fossil CO2 signals in Zurich was the small signal-to-noise ratio of the Δ14C differences measured by accelerator mass spectrometry between the updraft and downdraft flasks. The novel REA flask sampling system meets the high technical requirements of the REA method and is a promising technology for observation-based estimation of fossil fuel CO2 fluxes."

We investigated the performance of four airborne hygrometers, deployed on aircraft or stratospheric balloon platforms and based on different techniques, in a climate simulation chamber. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of the involved sensors for atmospheric monitoring and research applications. 
 The AquaVIT-4 intercomparison of atmospheric hygrometers was conducted at the AIDA (Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere) climate simulation chamber of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, in March–April 2022, within the framework of the HEMERA H2020 EU project. The objectives were to document the performance of existing hygrometers and to support the development of novel methods for water vapor (H2O) measurements in the upper atmosphere. The AquaVIT-4 intercomparison involved seven hygrometers based on either infrared laser absorption spectroscopy or frost-point hygrometry techniques: four deployed on aircraft or stratospheric balloon platforms and three reference instruments. The simulated conditions in the AIDA chamber reproduced the characteristic atmospheric conditions of the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS, altitude range ∼ 5–28 km) in the tropics and midlatitudes, spanning  20–600 hPa pressure, 190–245 K temperature, and 0.5–530 ppm H2O mixing ratio. The campaign was divided into two phases, each consisting of 4 measurement days: an “open intercomparison”, where the simulated conditions were known to the participants, and a “blind intercomparison”, where the conditions were coordinated by independent referees and unknown to the participating teams. Here we present a statistical analysis of the entire dataset, which allows us to assess the accuracy and limitations of each instrument. For the accuracy evaluation, two sets of reference measurements were defined: one for in situ instruments, located inside the AIDA vessel, and one for extractive instruments, sampling the chamber gas through a heated inlet. This distinction accounts for H2O desorption effects, which are most prominent at low pressures and low H2O concentrations. All instruments showed  good agreement with the reference values in the range of H2O >2 ppm, with mean deviations within ± 7 % for H2O >10 ppm and ± 8 % between 2–10 ppm H2O. The largest differences were found for H2O <2 ppm, a rarely observed range in the atmosphere, though most of the instruments still achieved average deviations within ± 10 %. Overall, the results of AquaVIT-4 demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of the four involved sensors for upper-atmospheric monitoring and research applications."

It analyses key regional events in Southern California, Northeast Amazonia, Pantanal–Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, assessing their drivers and predictability and attributing them to climate change and land use. Seasonal outlooks and decadal projections are provided. Climate change greatly increased the likelihood of these fires, and without strong mitigation, such events will become more frequent. 
 Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires globally, yet our understanding of these high-impact events remains uneven and shaped by media attention and regional research biases. The State of Wildfires project systematically tracks global and regional fire activity of each annual fire season, analyses the causes of prominent extreme wildfire events, and projects the likelihood of similar events occurring in future climate scenarios. This, its second annual report, covers the March 2024 to February 2025 fire season. During the 2024–2025 fire season, fire-related carbon (C) emissions totalled 2.2 Pg C, 9 % above average and the sixth highest on record since 2003, despite below-average global burned area (BA). Extreme fire seasons in South America's rainforests, dry forests, and wetlands and in Canada's boreal forests pushed up the global C emissions total. Fire C emissions were over 4 times above average in Bolivia, 3 times above average in Canada, and ∼ 50 % above average in Brazil and Venezuela. Wildfires in 2024–2025 caused 100 fatalities in Nepal, 34 in South Africa, and 31 in Los Angeles, with additional fatalities reported in Canada, Côte d'Ivoire, Portugal, and Türkiye. The Eaton and Palisades fires in Southern California caused 150 000 evacuations and USD 140 billion in damages. Communities in Brazil, Bolivia, Southern California, and northern India were exposed to fine particulate matter at concentrations 13–60 times WHO's daily air quality standards. We evaluated the causes and predictability of four extreme wildfire episodes from the 2024–2025 fire season, including in Northeast Amazonia (January–March 2024), the Pantanal–Chiquitano border regions of Brazil and Bolivia (August–September 2024), Southern California (January 2025), and the Congo Basin (July–August 2024). Anomalous weather created conditions for these regional extremes, while fuel availability and human ignitions shaped spatial patterns and temporal fire dynamics. In the three tropical regions, prolonged drought was the dominant fire enabler, whereas in California, extreme heat, wind, and antecedent fuel build-up were compounding enablers. Our attribution analyses show that climate change made extreme fire weather in Northeast Amazonia 30–70 times more likely, increasing BA roughly 4-fold compared to a scenario without climate change. In the Pantanal–Chiquitano, fire weather was 4–5 times more likely, with 35-fold increases in BA. Meanwhile, our analyses suggest that BA was 25 times higher in Southern California due to climate change. The Congo Basin's fire weather was 3–8 times more likely with climate change, with a 2.7-fold increase in BA. Socioeconomic changes since the pre-industrial period, including land-use change, also likely increased BA in Northeast Amazonia. Our models project that events on the scale of 2024–2025 will become up to 57 %, 34 %, and 50 % more frequent than in the modern era in Northeast Amazonia, the Pantanal–Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, respectively, under a medium–high scenario (SSP370) by 2100. Climate action can limit the added risk, with frequency increases held to below 15 % in all three regions under a strong mitigation scenario (SSP126). In Southern California, the future trajectory of extreme fire likelihood remains highly uncertain due to poorly constrained climate–vegetation–fire interactions influencing fuel moisture, though our models suggest that risk may decline in future. This annual report from the State of Wildfires project integrates and advances cutting-edge fire observations and modelling with regional expertise to track changing global wildfire hazard, guiding policy and practice towards improved preparedness, mitigation, adaptation, and societal benefit. Thirteen new datasets and model codebases presented in this work are available from the State of Wildfires Project's Zenodo community, including updated annual statistics on wildfire extent (Jones et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15525674), outputs from modelling of fire causality using PoF model (Di Giuseppe, 2025; https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.8570224.v1) and codebase for the extreme event attribution/projections model,  ConFLAME (Barbosa et al., 2025a, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16790787)."

This study generated a global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite data and a deep learning model. The dataset accurately depicts global and regional XCO2 patterns, advancing the monitoring of carbon emissions and understanding of global carbon dynamics. 
 The irreversible trend for global warming underscores the necessity for accurate monitoring and analysis of atmospheric carbon dynamics on a global scale. Carbon satellites hold significant potential for atmospheric CO2 monitoring. However, existing studies on global CO2 are constrained by coarse resolution (ranging from 0.25 to 2°) and limited spatial coverage. In this study, we developed a new global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite observations, multi-source satellite products, and an improved deep learning model. We then investigated changes in global atmospheric CO2 and anomalies from 2015 to 2021. The reconstructed XCO2 products show a better agreement with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements, with R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.54 ppm. The products also provide more accurate information on the global and regional spatial patterns of XCO2 compared to origin carbon satellite monitoring and previous XCO2 products. The global pattern of XCO2 exhibited a distinct increasing trend with a growth rate of 2.32 ppm yr−1, reaching 414.00 ppm in 2021. Globally, XCO2 showed obvious spatial variability across different latitudes and continents. Higher XCO2 concentrations were primarily observed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in regions with intensive anthropogenic activity, such as East Asia and North America. We also validated the effectiveness of our XCO2 products in detecting intensive CO2 emission sources. The XCO2 dataset is publicly accessible on the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12706142 (Wang et al., 2024a). Our products enable enhanced ability in identifying regional- and county-level XCO2 hotpots, carbon emissions and fragmented carbon sinks, providing a robust basis for targeted global carbon governance policies."

This is important for understanding greenhouse gas emissions, as frozen soil is associated with methane release. The product provides accurate data on key events such as the first day of soil freezing in autumn, helping scientists to study climate change, ecosystem dynamics, and its impact on our planet. 
 The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is a valuable tool for monitoring global soil freeze–thaw dynamics, particularly in high-latitude environments where these processes are important for understanding ecosystem and carbon cycle dynamics. This paper introduces the updated SMOS Level-3 (L3) Soil Freeze–Thaw (FT) product and details its threshold-based classification algorithm, which utilizes L-band passive microwave measurements to detect soil freeze–thaw transitions; this is possible due to the difference in dielectric properties between frozen and thawed soils at this frequency band. The algorithm applies gridded brightness temperature data from the SMOS satellite, augmented with ancillary datasets of air temperature and snow cover, to generate global estimates of the freeze–thaw state. A recent update to the algorithm includes improved noise reduction through temporal filtering. Validation results against in situ soil moisture and temperature measurements and comparisons to ERA5-Land reanalysis data demonstrate the ability of the product to detect the day of first freezing, an important metric for better understanding greenhouse gas fluxes and ecosystem dynamics, with improved accuracy. However, limitations remain, particularly in regions affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) and during spring melt periods, when wet snow hinders soil thaw detection.

However, combining AI models with data assimilation, a process that improves weather forecasts by incorporating observation data, is still relatively unexplored. This study explored the coupling of ensemble data assimilation with an AI weather prediction model, ClimaX, which succeeded in employing weather forecasts stably by applying techniques conventionally used for physical models. 
 Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited, partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models and marked the first successful implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model, ClimaX, demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models, such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation."

Using object-oriented programming, GEOSPACE modularizes SPAC processes, focusing on infiltration, evapotranspiration, and root water uptake. The 1D deployment integrates plant transpiration, soil evaporation, and root growth, providing a flexible and validated framework for ecohydrological modeling and applications. 
 The soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) system is a complex and interconnected network of physical phenomena, encompassing heat transfer, evapotranspiration, precipitation, water absorption, soil water flow, substance transport, and gas exchange. These processes govern the exchange of energy and water within the SPAC system. Modeling the SPAC system involves multiple disciplines, including hydrology, ecology, and computational science, making a physically based approach inherently interdisciplinary for capturing the complexity of the system.The present study introduces the Soil–Plant–Atmosphere Continuum Estimator in GEOframe (GEOSPACE), a new ecohydrological modeling framework, in particular its one-dimensional development, GEOSPACE-1D. GEOSPACE leverages and extends selected components from the GEOframe modeling system, while also integrating newly developed modules, to comprehensively simulate water transport dynamics in the SPAC system. The framework of GEOSPACE-1D is a tool designed to facilitate robust, reliable, and transparent simulations of SPAC interactions. It embraces the principles of open-source software and modular design, aiming to promote open, reusable, and reproducible research practices. Instead of relying on a single monolithic model, we propose a component-based modeling approach,  where each component addresses a specific aspect of the system. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is adopted as the foundational framework for this approach, providing flexibility and adaptability to accommodate the ever-changing nature of the SPAC system. This compartmentalization serves two critical purposes: validating individual processes against analytical solutions and facilitating the integration of novel processes into the system.The paper emphasizes the significance of modeling the coupling between infiltration and evapotranspiration through two “virtual” simulations based on real-world input data from the “Spike II” experiment to explore the interplay between plant transpiration, soil evaporation, and soil moisture dynamics, highlighting the need to account for these interactions in SPAC models. Overall, GEOSPACE-1D represents an approach to SPAC modeling providing a flexible and extensible framework for studying complex interactions within the Earth's critical zone. It is worth recalling that the fundamental premise of GEOSPACE-1D is not to create a single soil–plant–atmosphere model but to establish a system that allows the creation of a series of soil–plant–atmosphere models adapted to the specific needs of the user's case study."

To understand these impacts, we calibrated a crop model using unique data from experiments where rice was grown in open fields under controlled O3 exposure (free air). This is the first time such data have been used to improve a model's ability to predict how rice responds to O3 pollution. Our work provides a more accurate tool to study O3's effects and guide strategies to protect agriculture. 
 Ozone (O3) pollution poses an escalating threat to rice production and food security in China, with concentrations projected to rise under future climate scenarios. Accurately quantifying O3 impacts on rice is thus crucial for informed agricultural planning. This study is the first to utilise free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) observations specific to rice for calibrating a crop model (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator with crops, JULES-crop) and assessing the impacts of O3. FACE experiments, which involve growing crops under natural field conditions while exposing them to elevated O3 levels, provide an ideal approach for studying the effects of O3 on crops. Utilising data from the only O3-FACE facility dedicated to rice, we calibrated physiological and O3-response parameters in JULES-crop and evaluated the model against additional independent FACE observations. The calibration establishes this as the first crop model refined with ideal open-air field observations, significantly enhancing its capability to simulate rice growth processes and O3-induced yield losses and surpassing the performance of simulations based on the default parameters in JULES-crop. With this newly calibrated model, JULES-crop is now equipped to assess the impacts of O3 on agriculture, offering a valuable tool to inform mitigation strategies."

We introduce a new method using graph convolutional neural networks, in which molecular graphs enable the model to capture molecular connectivity better than with non-structural embeddings. The method shows strong agreement with experimentally determined vapor pressures, and outperforms existing estimation methods. 
 The vapor pressures (pvap) of organic molecules play a crucial role in the partitioning of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Given the vast diversity of atmospheric organic compounds, experimentally determining pvap of each compound is unfeasible. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms allow the prediction of physicochemical properties based on complex representations of molecular structure, but their performance crucially depends on the availability of sufficient training data. We propose a novel approach to predict pvap using group contribution-assisted graph convolutional neural networks (GC2NN). The models use molecular descriptors like molar mass alongside molecular graphs containing atom and bond features as representations of molecular structure. The model's group contribution component is a shallow fully-connected neural network which processes numerical molecular descriptors and complements the model's graph component. Molecular graphs allow the ML model to better infer molecular connectivity compared to methods using other, non-structural embeddings. We achieve best results with an adaptive-depth GC2NN, where the number of evaluated graph layers depends on molecular size. We present two vapor pressure estimation models that achieve strong agreement between predicted and experimentally-determined pvap. The first is a general model with broad scope that is suitable for both organic and inorganic molecules and achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.69 log-units (R2= 0.86). The second model is specialized on organic compounds with functional groups often encountered in atmospheric SOA, achieving an even stronger correlation with the test data (MAE = 0.37 log-units, R2= 0.94). The adaptive-depth GC2NN models clearly outperform existing methods, including parameterizations and group-contribution methods, demonstrating that graph-based ML techniques are powerful tools for the estimation of physicochemical properties, even when experimental data are scarce."

We review key modelling approaches applied in estuaries analysing their set-ups and parameterizations.

 The study of microplastic transport and fate in estuaries poses significant challenges due to the complex, dynamic nature of these ecosystems and the diverse characteristics of microplastics. Process-based numerical models have become indispensable for studying microplastics, complementing observational data by offering insights into transport processes and dispersion trends that are difficult to capture through in situ measurements alone. Effective model implementations require an accurate representation of the hydrodynamic conditions, relevant transport processes, particle properties, and their dynamic behaviour and interactions with other environmental components. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the different process-based modelling approaches used to study the transport of microplastics in estuaries, including Eulerian analytical 2DV models, Eulerian numerical models, Lagrangian numerical models, and population balance equation models.  We detail each approach and analyse previous applications, examining key aspects such as parameterizations, input data, model set-ups, and validation methods.

This project produced algorithms (PyESPERs) for estimating biogeochemical seawater properties in Python, a freely available coding language. These algorithms were based on empirical seawater property estimation routines (ESPERs), which were originally written in the proprietary MATLAB coding language and can be used in studies of marine carbonate chemistry. 
 This project produced a Python language implementation of locally interpolated regression (LIR) and neural network (NN) algorithms from empirical seawater property estimation routines (PyESPERv1.0.0). These routines estimate total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, total pH, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, and oxygen from geographic coordinates, depth, salinity, and 16 combinations of zero to four additional predictors (temperature and biogeochemical information) and were previously available only in the MATLAB programming language. Here, we document modifications to reduce discrepancies between the implementations, calculate the disagreements between the methods, and quantify Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAPv2.2022) reconstruction errors with PyESPER. While the PyESPER routine based on neural networks (PyESPER_NN) faithfully reproduces the corresponding MATLAB routine estimates of properties that do not require anthropogenic carbon change information, PyESPER_LIR and – to a lesser extent – PyESPER_NN estimates for total pH and dissolved inorganic carbon do not exactly reproduce the MATLAB routine estimates due to differences in interpolation and extrapolation methods between the programming languages. While the MATLAB and Python LIR-based estimates are not identical, we show that they are similarly skilled at reproducing the GLODAPv2.2022 data product and are thus comparable. This project increases the accessibility of ESPERv1.01.01 algorithms by providing users with code in the freely available Python language and enables future ESPER updates to be released in multiple coding languages."

The sites included Syowa Station (69°00′S, 39°35′E) and site S17 (69°02′S, 40°05′E) on the coastal Antarctic ice sheet. Observations were conducted over three summers (2014/15, 2016/17, and 2017/18) as part of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE). Surface aerosol particles containing 7Be were collected daily or twice daily using a high‐volume air sampler. 7Be concentrations ranged from below the detection limit of approximately 1–12 mBq/m3. The 7Be concentrations are higher at higher latitudes than at midlatitudes, and the effects of removal by precipitation associated with storm track may be more pronounced at midlatitudes. Fluctuations in 7Be concentrations were correlated with the passage of synoptic‐scale disturbances over the sea to the west of 80°E, likely due to tropopause folding. Maximum concentrations were observed at site S17, where a stepwise increase from approximately 4 mBq/m3 (5–14 January) to approximately 8 mBq/m3 (15–28 January) was observed, likely due to repeated synoptic‐scale disturbances. A diurnal pattern was observed in 7Be concentrations at site S17, with nighttime (daytime) concentrations being highest (lowest) when katabatic winds were stronger (weaker). From January 2015 to January 2017, the increase rate in 7Be concentration at site S17 was similar to the increase rate in neutron counts observed at the Neumayer III station, suggesting a reflection of the elevated 7Be production due to increased galactic cosmic rays."

Kiladis,Remote Influence of Andean Convection on Amazonian Rainfall and Its Mechanisms,"Models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 produce too much precipitation over the Andes but too little over the Amazon or the Wet Andes‐Dry Amazon (WADA) bias pattern. Unlike the conventional view that convection parameterization and land model deficiencies can contribute to Amazonian rainfall biases, we approach this long‐standing biased model behavior through the lens of Andean convection. Using Community Earth System Model v1.1 and focusing on the wet season, our mechanism‐denial experiments demonstrate that Andean convection notably reduces precipitation over the Amazon during austral summer. The Andean forced Amazonian response operates on weather timescale. The reduction of Amazonian rainfall is detectable within a few hours after initial Andean forcing. The precipitation response is primarily driven by variations in the moisture budget and is moderated by changes in convective available potential energy over the Amazon. Changes in the total advection of moisture over the Amazon are dominated by the vertical advection term and can be attributed to discrepancies in the dynamic omega field. In the experiments, the Andean east flank region is scrutinized where the vertical velocity and moisture fields play an intermediary role for the Andean driven WADA connection. The Andean forcing induces descending anomalies on the Andean east flank. The disturbances of wind and geopotential fields over the Andean east flank propagate eastward via Kelvin waves. Over the Amazon, descending anomalies and advective drying lead to reduction of mid‐to‐high level cloud, increase of shortwave cloud forcing and surface net radiation, and enhancement of themodynamic stability and rainfall reduction."

We analyze in situ measurements of temperature, pressure, ClO, ClONO2, H2O, NO2, aerosol surface area density (SAD), and organic chlorine species obtained by instruments aboard the NASA ER‐2 over the continental US during the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) campaign to show that chlorine activation large enough to affect loss of ozone was not observed, for the summers of 2021 and 2022. During both deployments, tropopause‐overshooting convection with water vapor and temperature conditions suitable for chlorine activation were sampled. Due to their relatively young chemical age, most of these cold and wet air masses had abundances of inorganic chlorine (Cly) too low to support eventual enhancements of ClO that would lead to widespread ozone depletion. Even in the few air masses with higher levels of Cly, the abundance of nitrogen oxides was elevated and the ratio of ClONO2 to Cly was observed to be very low, limiting the availability of ClONO2 to react with HCl and sustain chlorine activation. However, we show that for the average chemical and meteorological conditions of cold, wet, overshooting air parcels observed during DCOTSS, significant chlorine activation could occur if stratospheric sulfate SAD were enhanced by major volcanic eruptions or climate intervention efforts."

This study evaluates state‐of‐the‐art S2S forecast systems for their representation of the rainy season through their climatology and forecast skill. These models reasonably capture the main features of the rainy season, such as onset and retreat dates, as well as the MSD characteristics. However, they overestimate the MSD duration by 5–10 days. Forecast skill for weekly precipitation is low beyond week 2, whereas rainy season onset and retreat remain predictable past 25 days, especially for the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts and United Kingdom Met Office forecasts. MSD onset forecasts are more skillful than MSD end forecasts, suggesting different modulating processes for each date. Because of the significant influence of the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the variability of MSD, we evaluate its effects on predictability and forecast skill. La Niña increases precipitation and enhances predictability and prediction skill of precipitation from June to September, whereas El Niño reduces mean rainfall and forecasts are more skillful during the MSD‐periods. These results highlight ENSO's role in subseasonal forecasting and suggest that ENSO phase information could help improve decision‐making in planning sowing dates and regional water resource management."

The average NR‐PM2.5 concentration is 4.7 ± 5.3 μg m−3 with a dominant contribution of organics. Our findings reveal distinct seasonal variations in NR‐PM2.5 mass loading and chemical composition, regulated by the alternation of the Asian summer monsoon and westerlies there, as well as the balance between the wet scavenging and dry deposition in each season. Specifically, enhanced aqueous‐phase chemical process during summer was observed contributing to stronger oxidation processes of organic aerosol with different oxidation pathways.

Mayta,MJO Energy Budget Residuals in CMIP6: A Focus on Vertical Resolution,"This study investigates the influence of model‐output vertical resolution on the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO)‐related moist static energy (MSE) budget. Using reanalysis data at varying vertical resolutions (raw levels, six standard layers of CMIP6 daily output, fine upper‐tropospheric, and fine lower‐tropospheric), we demonstrate that limiting vertical levels to six leads to substantial budget residuals, mirroring those in CMIP6 daily output. Notably, enhanced upper‐tropospheric resolution captures moist processes more accurately compared with high resolution in the lower troposphere. These budget residuals, which amplify with rainfall anomalies, stem from overestimated vertical MSE advection driven by an unrealistically strong vertical gradient in mean‐state dry static energy (DSE) in the upper troposphere. Sensitivity tests further indicate that including an additional 150 hPa level in the six standard layers substantially reduces the background DSE bias and budget residuals. In CMIP6 models, unrealistic mean DSE gradients also appear in daily output rather than in finer‐resolution monthly output, leading to overestimated vertical MSE advection. These findings suggest that limited vertical resolution in CMIP6 daily output partially contributes to the observed MSE budget residuals."

To disentangle these multiple influences, we used a preexisting process‐based ecophysiological model (MAIDENiso) to simulate tree growth changes during 1956–2010 in arid and semi‐arid regions of China. Results revealed that simulated tree growth was more dependent on climate trends than on atmospheric CO2 concentration. Mechanistic analysis showed that the regulation of stomatal conductance under water stress positively affected tree growth in the arid region, but had an opposite pattern in the semi‐arid region. Intrinsic water‐use efficiency (iWUE, measured from tree‐ring δ13C) has increased by 29% and 44% since 1900 CE in the arid and semi‐arid regions, respectively, but did not stimulate radial tree growth. This suggests that there will possibly be a continued increase (decrease) of radial forest growth in arid (semi‐arid) areas of northern China if the current climate trends remain in the next decades."

This study investigated decadal variability of CWs over China, focusing on intensity changes and thermodynamic processes. While CW frequency declined under global warming, its intensity has significantly increased during 2001–2021 compared with 1977–2000, with a marked cooling center over Inner Mongolia. Using Lagrangian trajectory analysis and clustering, we identified four major cold air pathways, with the common Northeast China–Inner Mongolia cluster contributing most to recent intensification. Although air masses were initially warmer in the later period, they underwent greater net cooling along this cluster. Compared with 1977–2000, median air parcel in 2001–2021 was ∼2.0 K colder during days −5 to −2, due to stronger diabatic (∼1.0 K) and adiabatic (∼0.9 K) cooling. This was compounded by ∼1.9 K weaker warming from days −2 to 0, driven by reduced adiabatic warming (∼0.7 K) and continued diabatic cooling (∼0.7 K). Adiabatic and diabatic processes contributed comparably (∼50%) to the enhanced cooling. Intensified CWs were associated with a stronger and more persistent Ural ridge, which extended into the Arctic, promoting deeper descent and stronger ascent motions. The deeper descent brought air masses downward to higher pressure levels, enabling more diabatic cooling and limiting later adiabatic warming while enhanced ascent increased adiabatic cooling. Additionally, a poleward shift in air trajectories further amplified diabatic cooling efficiency. The findings highlight northward‐shifted cold air pathways and thermodynamic processes that enhance CWs under a warming climate."

It is also an important chemical reactor that contributes to the multiphase chemistry of ozone destruction by halogen compounds. Sulfuric acid is the main chemical component of stratospheric aerosol, but the processes that control the composition and size of stratospheric particles remain uncertain. We report direct observations of the composition of individual particles of 0.12–1.2 μm geometric diameter, sampled in situ in the high latitude lower stratosphere during February and March of 2023, at altitudes up to 19 km. Polar vortex air was frequently sampled, enabling an investigation into the nature of particles formed in air descending from the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Over 90% of particles at the sampled sizes in very old polar vortex air contain metals from the ablation of meteors, suggesting that almost all sulfuric acid particles formed in such air grow onto meteoric smoke. Such particles contain extremely low levels of organic matter, typically less than about 0.3% by mass, and relatively high mass fractions of metals, around 5%–8%. These newly characterized “neat” meteoric‐sulfuric particles gain additional sulfuric acid and organic compounds by coagulation with background stratospheric aerosol, forming “aged” meteoric‐sulfuric particles, which are encountered throughout the stratosphere. On the basis of these observations, we estimate a meteoric iron flux into the Earth's atmosphere of about 0.3–1 Gg yr−1."

However, the mechanisms underlying MT production in plants and their subsequent release into the atmosphere remain poorly understood. Existing parameterization schemes for MT emissions in BVOC models require refinement, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where recent field observations provide new insights. In this study, the light‐temperature dependence algorithm in MEGAN2.1 was updated based on in situ measurements. The revised algorithm significantly reduced estimated MT emissions in South China, with reductions ranging from ∼9% (∼8 Gg) in summer to ∼60% (∼6.5 Gg) in winter over Guangdong province. As a result, chemical transport model simulations showed that the maximum daily 8‐hr average (MDA8) ozone (O3) concentrations decreased by 3%–5% (1.0–1.5 ppb), with a maximum reduction of up to 7% (2 ppb). Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) concentrations declined by 10%–20% (0.5–1 μg/m3), with the maximum reduction of 24% (1.2 μg/m3) in summer 2022. These decreases were primarily driven by a reduction in atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). Moreover, the revised algorithm amplified reduction of MTs‐derived SOA through various formation pathways. These findings suggest that previous models may overestimated BVOC emissions, leading to inflated predictions of both O3 and SOA concentrations. This overestimation could be further exacerbated by AOC changes and shifts in SOA formation pathways associated with MT emissions."

Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE‐Follow‐On (GRACE‐FO) gravity field solutions enable holistic monitoring of terrestrial water storage changes, but only after mathematically removing modeled atmospheric mass variations from the observations. While this removal typically accounts for atmospheric water vapor, extreme convective events also lead to mass changes arising from liquid and frozen cloud water, which are currently neglected in gravity field processing. Using ERA5 cloud water data, we identified over 50,000 extreme events (≥ ${\ge} $0.6 Gt) from 2002 to 2023, which we hypothesize to fall within the detection range of the GRACE‐FO laser ranging interferometer. Our global catalog provides details on the biggest events and the evolution of different atmospheric and terrestrial water storages over the affected regions. We show that cloud water mass changes during these events can be comparable in magnitude to water vapor variations. We also observed a steady annual increase of about 52 events, from 1,796 in 2002 to 2,791 in 2023, alongside increasing intensity, which we attribute to the intensification of the water cycle driven by global warming. Our findings suggest that atmospheric cloud water, predominantly during large convective events in the tropics, map into GRACE‐FO observations and that the integration of state‐of‐the‐art cloud water simulations into the dealiasing products will improve the exploitation of GRACE‐FO and Next Generation Gravity Mission data for ocean science and hydrological and climate research, particularly on submonthly timescales."

Canada is yet to implement a scale to characterize the severity of ARs and there has been little research into the specific features of ARs that cause extreme flooding, especially for regions outside of the US. Using ERA5 data and the Global AR Database (Guan, 2022, https://doi.org/10.25346/S6/YO15ON), we studied the effects of a range of AR characteristics on extreme precipitation and streamflow in the Alouette watershed, which includes an important reservoir. For this watershed, the majority of extreme‐event producing ARs (X‐ARs) approach the BC coast from compass directions of between 210 and 220°. ARs that approach from a more westerly direction can cause extreme events with an IVT as low as 400 kg m−1 s−1 compared to over 800 kg m−1 s−1 for ARs from a more southerly direction. IVT, the presence of rain‐on‐snow events, and high preceding soil moisture conditions strongly correlate with the production of extreme streamflow in the Alouette watershed. For the Alouette watershed, we recommend that the AR scale used in the US (Ralph, Rutz, et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1175/bams‐d‐18‐0023.1), be enhanced to better represent the severity of ARs in this watershed by including the surface air temperature, angle of approach, and antecedent conditions in the hazard calculation. A similar analysis should be applied to other high‐impact watersheds where accurate prediction of AR impacts is critical."

Hence, there is an urgent need to test these adaptation strategies. This study quantifies the performance of adaptation strategies for mitigating extreme heat in China under the future urbanization and climate conditions using a numerical model. Results are validated using observation data from 839 national meteorological stations in China. Simulation results show that implementing all three adaptation measures will decrease the heat exposure rate by 9.4% by enhancing ground reflection and lowering urban temperature. The contribution of enhancing the albedo of the building walls to reducing exposure is 1.5 times that of using roof planting. These adaptation strategies can reduce urban heat storage, but they may exacerbate urban water vapor accumulation. Most risks are concentrated on the southeast side of the Heihe‐Tengchong Line. The urban geographical locations and population will influence the cooling effect of adaptation strategies. The cool walls have greater cooling effects in southern cities, whereas green roofs are more effective in northern regions.

 Non-aromatic heterocycles and carbocycles form the skeleton of countless bioactive and functional molecules1,2. Of note, four-membered saturated cyclic molecules such as azetidines, thietanes and cyclobutanes have garnered increasing attention in medicinal chemistry3-7. These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species."

 Tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have emerged as a promising non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based devices1-3, with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted architectures now exceeding 16%4-8. Despite an ideal bandgap supporting a theoretical PCE over 33%, TPSCs still lag in performance and stability, partly due to suboptimal hole transport layers and poor buried interface that hinder hole extraction. Here, we report (E)-(2-(4',5'-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-[2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid at the buried interface, using a molecular film to optimize hole transport layers in inverted TPSCs. This molecular film forms a homogeneous interfacial layer with well-matched energy level alignment, significantly enhancing hole extraction. Moreover, this approach creates a superwetting underlayer that guides the growth of uniform, high-quality Sn-based perovskite films with reduced defect density and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resulting inverted small-area TPSCs demonstrate a record PCE of 17.89% (certified 17.71% under reverse scanning mode). Furthermore, the encapsulated device maintains over 95% of the initial PCE after 1344 h of ambient shelf storage and over 94% after 1550 h of continuous operation under 1-sun illumination.

EMR access is both retrospective and prospective, allowing longitudinal studies. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for those of Han Chinese ancestry that enable genome-wide association 3,4, phenome-wide association 5,6, and polygenic risk score 7,8 studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Participants also agree to be recontacted for future research and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations.

 Recalled memories become transiently labile and require stabilization1–3. The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear4. Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories. Emotional experience evokes signalling in astrocytes, which form an ensemble that is reinforced by secondary astrocytic state changes resulting from repeated experience, leading to memory stabilization."

 Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut1–3. However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations4,5. We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.

 Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail1. However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water2,3, in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered4,5. The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes6–9. Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM)10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m−1, close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores. Scanning dielectric microscopy of nanocapillaries filled with water reveals that interfacial and strongly confined water exhibits a large in-plane dielectric constant and an in-plane conductivity approaching superionic values. "

 Quantifying physical mechanisms driving sea-level change—including global mean sea level (GMSL) and regional-to-local components (that is, sea-level budget)—is essential for reliable future projections and effective coastal management1,2. Although previous research has attempted to resolve China’s sea-level budget from the 1950s3,4, these studies capture short timescales and lack the long-term context necessary to fully assess modern sea-level rise in southeastern China5—one of the world’s most densely populated regions with immense socioeconomic importance6. Here we show that GMSL followed three distinct stages from 11,700 years before present (BP) to the modern day: (1) rapid early Holocene rise driven by the deglacial melt of land ice; (2) 4,000 years of stability from around 4200 BP to the mid-nineteenth century when regional processes dominated sea-level change; and (3) accelerating rise from the mid-nineteenth century. Our results arise from spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data to produce site-specific sea-level budget estimates with uncertainty quantification. It is extremely likely (P ≥ 0.95) that the GMSL rise rate since 1900 (1.51 ± 0.16 mm year−1, 1σ) has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia. Moreover, our analysis indicates that at least 94% of rapid modern urban subsidence is attributable to anthropogenic activities, with localized subsidence rates often exceeding GMSL rise. Such concurrent acceleration of global sea-level rise and rapid localized subsidence has not been observed in our Holocene geological record. Spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data suggest that the modern global mean sea-level rise rate since 1900 has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia, breaking the long-term stability observed in southeastern China."

 Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces3,4. Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices.

 Compartmentalization of eukaryotic genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin is of critical biological significance1–3. Previous studies have suggested a self-templating pathway involving the reading and writing of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation by SUV39H as the core mechanism for heterochromatin reassembly during cell division1,3. In fission yeast, the mammalian SUV39H homologue Clr4 forms a complex containing ubiquitin ligase Cul4, which catalyses H3K14 mono-ubiquitination (H3K14ub) to promote heterochromatin formation. However, whether heterochromatin reassembly in dividing mammalian cells involves a similar pathway is unknown. Here we identified G2E3 as an H3K14ub-specific, pericentromeric heterochromatin-localized E3 ligase. G2E3-catalysed H3K14ub potentiates histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by SUV39H and is specifically required for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9me3 in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Mechanistically, we found that G2E3 is highly expressed in G2/M phase and associates with mitotic chromosomes in an RNA-dependent manner to catalyse H3K14ub, which is essential for the subsequent sequential recruitment of SUV39H and HP1. The SUV39H chromodomain is a reader of dual H3K9me3 and H3K14ub modifications and SUV39H associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin primarily through its H3K14ub-binding activity. Notably, loss of G2E3 severely impairs pericentromeric heterochromatin organization and results in the aberrant accumulation of SUV39H and H3K9me3 in numerous euchromatin regions and widespread transcriptional repression. Thus, our findings revealed the H3K14ub-dependent SUV39H compartmentalization as a unified mechanism of pericentromeric heterochromatin formation, which is essential for proper euchromatin compartmentalization and transcriptional regulation. G2E3-catalysed H3K14 mono-ubiquitination is crucial for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9 trimethylation in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which is essential for proper euchromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in mammalian cells."

 Spectroscopy is a pivotal tool for determining the physical structures and chemical compositions of materials and environments, and it is commonly used across diverse scientific fields1–16. Conventionally, spectroscopic techniques rely on narrow slits or gratings, which impose a trade-off between spectral resolution and optical transmittance17–22, thus precluding measurements with simultaneous high sensitivity and high efficiency. Here we introduce RAFAEL, a sub-ångström ultra-high-transmittance snapshot spectroscopic technique, which targets this trade-off with integrated and reconfigurable photonics based on lithium niobate. Its design comprises bulk lithium niobate as an interference mask with a pixel-wise electrically tunable spectral response and delivers picometre-scale modulation with a high optical transmittance. Our approach achieves 88-Hz snapshot spectroscopy with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.5 Å at 400–1,000 nm (R = 12,000), spatial resolution of 2,048 × 2,048 and 73.2% total optical transmittance. Compared with state-of-the-art spectroscopic imagers23–34, RAFAEL offers double the total transmittance and a nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in spectral resolving power, as verified by extensive experiments. In particular, RAFAEL captured sub-ångström spectra, including all atomic absorption peaks, of up to 5,600 stars in a single snapshot, indicating ×100–10,000 improvement in observational efficiency compared with world-class astronomical spectrometers17–21.

 Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3–7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8–10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes.

 During the Late Triassic epoch (237–201 million years ago), the terrestrial ecosystems of Pangaea underwent drastic changes1,2 that led to the rise and diversification of mammaliaforms3, crocodylomorphs4 and dinosaurs5. Although the Carnian sedimentary rocks of South America provided much of the available evidence for understanding the early evolution of these clades, key discoveries have remained restricted to the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión6,7 and Paraná basins8 in Argentina and Brazil, respectively.

Littman,Niche-specific dermal macrophage loss promotes skin capillary ageing,"Capillary-associated macrophages are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. 
 All mammalian organs depend on resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair and facilitate tissue-specific functions1–3. Functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through a combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment4,5. Declines in macrophage abundance and function have been linked to age-associated pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegeneration6–8. However, the mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within ageing tissues remain largely unclear. Here we show that capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behaviour in vivo, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in live mice to non-invasively image the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined vascular niche that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost at a rate exceeding capillary loss, resulting in macrophage-deficient vascular niches in both mice and humans. CAM phagocytic activity was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-deficient niches selectively vulnerable under homeostatic and injury conditions. Our study demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is less precisely regulated than previously suggested9–11. Specifically, neighbouring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize to compensate for macrophage loss without injury or increased growth factors, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). These limitations in macrophage renewal may represent early and targetable contributors to tissue ageing. Capillary-associated macrophages are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice."

 When Mary Leakey discovered the OH 5 cranium of Paranthropus boisei alongside Oldowan stone artefacts, it was declared “the oldest yet discovered maker of stone tools”1. Whether Paranthropus made and used tools has been debated ever since2–4, largely because there are no known hand bones that can be definitively attributed to this genus. Here we report fossil hand and foot bones unambiguously associated with craniodental material of P. boisei. KNM-ER 101000 demonstrates that P. boisei shared key manipulative and bipedal adaptations with the genus Homo. Moreover, the hand morphology of KNM-ER 101000 converges on that of gorillas in ways that are consistent with manual food processing and would have facilitated powerful grasping, such as that used in climbing. These fossils suggest that P. boisei was capable of tool making and use in some capacity while also supporting the proposed dichotomy of distinct dietary adaptations between Paranthropus and Homo. In addition to offering insights into the poorly known postcranial functional anatomy of Paranthropus, this discovery illuminates broader patterns of hominin hand evolution and tool use.

 Unravelling the genetic basis of the remarkable phenotypic diversity observed in natural populations remains a central challenge in biology1–4. Despite major advances5–19, no species has yet been characterized with a truly comprehensive atlas of genetic variation. Here we present an extensive genomic and phenotypic resource for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on near telomere-to-telomere assemblies of 1,086 natural isolates. Leveraging these high-contiguity assemblies, we generated a highly complete species-wide structural variant atlas, gene-based pangenome and graph pangenome. By incorporating the full spectrum of genetic variation captured across the species, we conducted genome-wide association studies across 8,391 molecular and organismal traits19–22. The inclusion of structural variants and small insertion–deletion mutations improved heritability estimates by an average of 14.3% compared with analyses based only on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Structural variants were more frequently associated with traits and exhibited greater pleiotropy than other variant types. Notably, the genetic architecture of molecular and organismal traits differed markedly. Together, this work provides a unique dataset that illuminates how diverse forms of genetic variation shape phenotypic diversity and lays the groundwork for integrative, genome-scale studies in other eukaryotic systems.

 The site-specific encoding of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides a powerful tool for expanding the functional repertoire of proteins1–4. Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by the low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. Here we reveal poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter5 to actively import easily synthesizable isopeptide-linked tripeptides that are processed into ncAAs within the cell. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal6 and crosslinker7 moieties, post-translational modifications8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that engineering of uptake systems is a powerful strategy for programmable import of chemically diverse building blocks.

 The properties of mammalian cells depend on their location within organs. Gene expression in the liver varies between periportal and pericentral hepatocytes1–3, and in the intestine from crypts to villus tips4,5. A key element of tissue spatial organization is probably metabolic, but direct assessments of spatial metabolism remain limited. Here we map spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine. We develop an integrated experimental–computational workflow using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), isotope tracing and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (>90%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in the liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their isotope labelling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also localized periportally, consistent with a high periportal energy demand. In the intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, aligning with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than in the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Thus, we both provide foundational knowledge regarding intestine and liver metabolic organization and identify fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism.

 Most stony corals are obligate symbionts that are dependent on nutrients provided by the photosynthetic activity of dinoflagellates residing within specialized cells1. Disruption of this symbiotic consortium leads to coral bleaching and, ultimately, mortality2. However, a few coral species exhibit facultative symbiosis, allowing them to survive extended periods of bleaching3,4. Despite this resilience, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the genomic and cellular basis of facultative symbiosis in Oculina patagonica, a thermotolerant Mediterranean coral5,6. We sequenced and annotated a chromosome-scale genome of O. patagonica and built cell atlases for this species and two obligate symbiotic corals. Comparative genomic analysis revealed karyotypic and syntenic conservation across all scleractinians, with species-specific gene expansions primarily driven by tandem duplications. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of symbiotic and naturally aposymbiotic wild specimens identified an increase in phagocytic immune cells and a metabolic shift in gastrodermal gene expression from growth-related functions to quiescent, epithelial-like states. Cross-species comparison of host cells uncovered Oculina-specific metabolic and signalling adaptations indicative of an opportunistic, dual-feeding strategy that decouples survival from symbiotic state.

 Beyond the canonical K48-linked homotypic polyubiquitination for proteasome-targeted proteolysis, K11/K48-branched ubiquitin (Ub) chains are involved in fast-tracking protein turnover during cell cycle progression and proteotoxic stress. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of human 26S proteasome in a complex with a K11/K48-branched Ub chain. The structures revealed a multivalent substrate recognition mechanism involving a hitherto unknown K11-linked Ub binding site at the groove formed by RPN2 and RPN10 in addition to the canonical K48-linkage binding site formed by RPN10 and RPT4/5 coiled-coil. Additionally, RPN2 recognizes an alternating K11-K48-linkage through a conserved motif similar to the K48-specific T1 binding site of RPN1. The insights gleaned from these structures explain the molecular mechanism underlying the recognition of the K11/K48-branched Ub as a priority signal in the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.

 Cancer immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DC) pulsed ex vivo with tumour antigens is considered safe, but its clinical efficacy is generally modest. Here we engineer DC progenitors (DCP), which can replenish conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1) in mice, to constitutively express IL-12 together with a non-signalling chimeric receptor, termed extracellular vesicle-internalizing receptor (EVIR). By binding to a bait molecule (GD2 disialoganglioside) expressed on cancer cells and their EVs, the EVIR enforces EV internalization by cDC1 to promote their cross-dressing with preformed, tumour-derived MHCI-peptide complexes. Upon systemic deployment to mice, the engineered DCPs cause only mild and transient elevation of liver enzymes, acquire tumour-derived material, engage tumour-specific T cells, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an immunotherapy-resistant melanoma model comprising both GD2-positive and -negative cancer cells, without the need for ex vivo antigen pulsing. These results indicate that EVIR-engineered DCPs may avert the positive selection of antigen-negative cancer cells, potentially addressing a critical limitation of immunotherapies targeting defined tumour antigens.

They reveal the key role of δTubulin and ε-Tubulin in this transition during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. 
 Axoneme assembly constitutes a pivotal process in male gametogenesis of Plasmodium. Plasmodium possesses a unique nuclear envelope-anchored basal body that templates axoneme assembly, distinct from the basal body that templates the axoneme of cilia or flagella to protrude from the cell surface. In the canonical basal body, the microtubule (MT) triplet extends and forms the axonemal MT doublet. However, this characteristic MT triplet has not been detected in Plasmodium. Indeed, the MT organization and the mechanism underlying the axonemal MT doublet assembly remain elusive in Plasmodium. Here we utilize high-resolution imaging methods including iterative ultrastructure expansion microscopy (iU-ExM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to resolve the native MT organization in the basal body of male gametes from the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii. The parasite exhibits an MT singlet-to-doublet transition, distinct from the canonical MT triplet-to-doublet transition. Furthermore, we reveal that δ-Tubulin and ε-Tubulin are expressed in male gametocytes and regulate axoneme formation during male gametogenesis. δ-Tubulin is localized at the proximal end of the MT B-tubule and modulates B-tubule assembly of MT doublet. Our work provides the native architecture of MT singlet-to-doublet transition and reveals the key role of δ-Tubulin and ε-Tubulin in MT singlet-to-doublet transition in the basal body of Plasmodium.

 Spatial biology pursues the analysis of cells in their native microenvironment, often with regard to morphology and gene- or protein expression. The spatial analysis of lipid and metabolic profiles by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) can add another layer of molecular information. A seamless integration of MSI data with other (multimodal) methods at a single-cell level is often hampered by insufficient co-registration and resolution. Here, we introduce a MALDI-MSI based method that integrates in-source bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, allowing for a coupled (sub-)cellular investigation of the same sample in both modalities. Presented examples from cell culture and tissue analysis include the visualization of intracellular lipid distributions in macrophages during phagocytosis, and the heterogeneity of lipid profiles of tumor infiltrating neutrophils correlated to their individual microenvironments. The achieved combination of lipid profiling with morphological features and protein expression on the single-cell level constitutes a powerful method for cell biology.

Here, authors engineer muscle-specific virus-like particles that fuse with skeletal muscle cells to deliver CRISPR tools and restore dystrophin in a DMD model. 
 Muscle genetic defects can lead to impaired movement, respiratory failure, and other severe symptoms. The development of curative therapies is challenging due to the need for the delivery of gene-editing tools into skeletal muscle cells throughout the body. Here, we use muscular fusogens (Myomaker and Myomerger) to engineer muscle-specific virus-like particles (MuVLPs) for the systemic delivery of gene-editing tools. We demonstrate that MuVLPs can be loaded with diverse payloads, including EGFP, Cre and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs), and can be delivered into skeletal muscle cells via targeted membrane fusion. Systemic administration of MuVLPs carrying Cas9 RNPs enables skeletal muscle-specific gene editing, which excised the exon containing a premature terminator codon mutation in a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This treatment restores dystrophin expression in various skeletal muscle tissues, including the diaphragm, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and triceps. As a result, the treated mice exhibit a significantly increased capacity for exercise and endurance. This study established a platform for precise gene editing in skeletal muscle tissues.

They are linked with perturbed Antarctic Bottom Water formation caused by West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat. 
 Millennial-scale deoxygenation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the Atlantic Southern Ocean during past interglacials was linked to West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) melt-driven suppression of dense water formation along the Antarctic margin. However, the circum-Antarctic extent of these ‘AABW stagnation events’ and drivers of WAIS retreat remain unclear. Here, we identify recurring bottom water O2 minima in the central Pacific Southern Ocean during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (424–374 ka ago) that are synchronous with their Atlantic Southern Ocean counterparts. As they (partially) align with Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) warming above present-day levels and/or a reorganization of deep-ocean circulation, we postulate recurring and synchronized Pacific-Atlantic AABW perturbation events during MIS11 through WAIS retreat and enhanced exposure to ocean heat (i.e., CDW) from below. This indicates a significant contribution of WAIS meltwater to sea-level high-stands during MIS11 and, by analogy, to sea-level rise due to ocean warming in the future.

 Nuclear laser spectroscopy at the 10−12 precision level (Nature 633.8028 (2024): 63–70) determined the fractional change in the nuclear quadrupole moment of 229Th upon excitation, ΔQ0/Q0 = 1.791(2)%. Such high-accuracy nuclear parameters enable stringent tests and refinement of 229Th nuclear models. Using a semi-classical prolate-spheroid model, we quantify the transition frequency’s sensitivity to fine-structure constant variations as K = 5900(2300), with uncertainty dominated by the measured charge-radius change Δ〈r2〉. This supports the predicted higher α-sensitivity of nuclear clocks over atomic clocks, important for new-physics searches. We find ΔQ0 strongly dependent on nuclear volume, challenging the constant-volume approximation. The deviation between measured and predicted ΔQ0/Q0 underlines the need for improved modeling and measurement of additional nuclear parameters. We explicitly assess the octupole contribution to α-sensitivity.

Here the authors modify printing temperature or light intensity to modify the material properties and achieve property differentiation from a single feedstock. 
 Multi-material 3D printing concerns the use of two or more 3D printable materials within a single printed part. The result is a composite that benefits from the combined properties of the individual 3D printed materials. Typically, a distinct differentiation between material properties can only be achieved using multiple feedstocks and advanced engineering solutions. In this work, we create multi-material 3D printed photopolymer parts from a single monomer mixture through simple adjustments in printing temperature and light intensity. We achieve this by employing a liquid crystalline (LC) monomer that forms a highly stable LC phase in conjunction with a trifunctional thiol crosslinker. A drastic change in mechanical and optical properties was achieved depending on the presence of an LC phase during polymerization. The proof of principle from bulk experiments could be translated fully into 3D printing, achieving pixel-to-pixel resolution of the material properties solely guided by changing the printing parameters temperature and light intensity. The versatility of produced multi-material composite parts is demonstrated in shape memory applications and methods for chemical data storage and encryption. 3D printing can be used to manufacture composite materials, but to modify material properties multiple feedstocks are required.

 Chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl/BrPAHs) are emerging organic pollutants that pose severe risks to both the natural environment and public health. However, the limited understanding of their global emission sources and levels hinders effective control measures. Here we present a comprehensive global inventory and source attribution analysis of Cl/BrPAH emissions from 11 key industrial sectors. By integrating emission data with machine learning models, we estimate that global industrial Cl/BrPAH emissions in 2018 were 5,143 kg (94.3% ClPAHs and 5.7% BrPAHs) across 184 countries. Emission hotspots, in terms of total estimated Cl/BrPAH emissions, were concentrated in Oceania, East Asia and Latin America, collectively accounting for over 66% of the global total emissions. Iron ore sintering was identified as the largest industrial source (86.1% of total emissions). These findings can facilitate policy-making and the development of mitigation strategies for Cl/BrPAH emissions, and eventually contribute to greener industries.

 Enforcement of national and international laws banning illegal tropical timber trade hinges on independent origin verification, such as with genetic or chemical wood properties. This is of particular concern in Central Africa, where illegal trade prevails. However, tracing methods have not yet consistently achieved high accuracy (>90%) at small spatial scales (<100 km). Where high precision is required but individual methods fall short, combining methods may improve results, because drivers of wood properties differ. Here, we assessed the individual and combined identification potential of three methods (genetics with 238 plastid Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, 3 stable isotopes, and 41 elemental concentrations). The combined approach achieved unprecedented accuracy in Central Africa, identifying 94% of samples within 100 km of their origin, outperforming individual methods (50–80%), and verifying real origin for 88%.

 On September 8, 2023, an Mw 6.8 earthquake struck the High Atlas Mountains southwest of Marrakesh, Morocco, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Beyond its devastating near-field effects, the earthquake also triggered unexpected far-field deformation anomalies in Oulad Berhil, approximately 50 km from the epicenter—challenging conventional seismic impact models that typically emphasize near-field responses. This study combines satellite radar time-series analysis, fault slip modeling, and Coulomb stress change (ΔCFS) calculations to investigate the mechanisms responsible for these anomalous post-seismic deformations. Prior to the earthquake, Oulad Berhil experienced persistent subsidence (∼4 cm/year), attributed to long-term groundwater over-extraction. However, deformation rates accelerated markedly following the earthquake, indicating a significant perturbation to the region’s pre-existing subsidence regime. ΔCFS modeling reveals considerable stress loading (up to 0.5 bar) on a shallow fault beneath Oulad Berhil, likely inducing aseismic slip at depths of 2–7 km, with a maximum slip of 0.345 m—equivalent to an Mw 5.6 event. In parallel, intensified groundwater withdrawal associated with post-seismic reconstruction may have contributed to the deformation, evidenced by abrupt changes of vegetation index. While the relative contributions of stress transfer and groundwater extraction remain uncertain due to data limitations, both mechanisms warrant careful monitoring. These findings demonstrate that moderate-magnitude earthquakes can destabilize distant regions through far-field fault reactivation and anthropogenic interactions, underscoring the importance of incorporating far-field stress effects into seismic hazard assessments, especially in areas experiencing active subsidence or groundwater exploitation."

 Daily high-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is critical for air quality monitoring and public health. However, current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy over large spatial and temporal scales due to limitations in modeling complex spatiotemporal dependencies. This study proposed a novel hybrid deep learning model—CNN-Transformer-KAN Network (CTKNet)—which utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to capture spatial features, Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies, and the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for nonlinear representation learning. Utilizing spatially continuous satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and other multi-source spatiotemporal inputs, CTKNet estimated daily PM2.5 at a spatial resolution of 1 km across China for the period 2015–2020, marking the first application of KAN in PM2.5 estimation. It outperformed existing models, achieving a high cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95 (sample-based), 0.90 (station-based), and 0.78 (time-based), and corresponding RMSEs of 8.13, 11.03, and 17.76 µg/m3. Yearly sample-based cross-validation R2 values ranged from 0.91 to 0.96 with RMSEs below 11.74 µg/m3, while seasonal R2 values ranged from 0.82 to 0.89 with RMSEs below 22.14 µg/m3. Analysis reveals a significant decline in PM2.5 nationwide, especially in eastern and central China. Seasonal peaks occur in winter, with minima in summer, influenced by meteorology. Spatially, PM2.5 is highest in eastern and northern regions; urban agglomerations like Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) show severe pollution, while Pearl River Delta (PRD) exhibits the lowest levels due to favorable conditions.

 Nitrogen (N) is crucial for crop and ecosystem health in agricultural settings. Traditional remote sensing (RS) methods, using regression models and indices like NDVI, face challenges in transferability across time and space. This study aims to enhance in-season N concentration assessment by integrating RS data with a hybrid approach, combining the PROSPECT-PRO and 4SAIL models to create PROSAIL-PRO. This Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) excels in parsing leaf protein, crucial for accurate crop N content estimation. PROSAIL-PRO forms the basis for a robust learning database, guiding the training of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models—Bayesian-based machine learning known for precision and insights into uncertainties. The Gezira irrigation scheme in Sudan serves as a case study. Using Sentinel-2 bands, this research informs agricultural resource management and assesses crop health in the scheme. Fertilizer application data and yield records drawn from three farms within the Gezira scheme to form the basis for validation. Wheat, the primary crop in this context, experienced varying fertilizer application scenarios across these farms during the 2021-22 cropping season resulting in varying yields. Similar results were found in the crop N content and biomass estimation. GPR models, trained on PROSAIL-PRO, effectively predict above ground N content and biomass. Validation against field records shows promising outcomes, with GPR models exhibiting an RMSE of 7.9 kg/ha for N content and 0.54 tonnes/ha for yield estimation. Moreover, the model’s spatiotemporal scalability was assessed, showing an RMSE of 1.01 tonnes/ha at the Nimra level and 1.6 tonnes/ha at the farm level, highlighting the applicability of this approach to larger areas. A significant correlation (0.7) was found between estimated N concentration and actual recorded yield at the field level, further corroborated by an 0.83 correlation at the Nimra level. These results emphasize the robustness of this hybrid modeling approach, particularly in linking nitrogen dynamics to primary productivity, as evidenced by stronger correlations between NPP and nitrogen content than between N content and fAPAR. This study therefore highlights the benefits of adoption hybrid modeling, based on PROSAIL-PRO, in global agricultural monitoring. The synergy found between remote sensing, radiative transfer modeling, and real-world dynamics promises a sustainable future for agriculture applications."

We formalize fire scenarios as heterogeneous graphs and develop a knowledge graph-based fire susceptibility assessment model. By leveraging graph neural networks, we perform representation learning on these fire scenarios, analyze and visualize the results of fire susceptibility assessments, and evaluate the importance of environmental factors.

 Urban metropolises in low-lying coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to inundation due to localized ground subsidence and relative sea level rise (RSLR), amplified by climate change. Thus, vertical land movement (VLM) is a pivotal factor in projecting RSLR, especially at regional and local scales over short to medium timeframes. However, VLM is difficult to calculate due to the scarcity of long-term dense instrumental records (e.g., GPS, tide gauges). Consequently, RSLR projections often neglect local VLM, introducing significant uncertainties in coastal hazard assessments and mitigation strategies, particularly in regions experiencing rapid SLR rates, like the South Korean coastal region. To address this, the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data (2017–2023; n = 402) were analyzed using advanced PS-InSAR technique to model land subsidence in South Korea’s low-lying coastal regions. The updated RSLR projections indicate that the integration of localized subsidence with the geocentric sea-level rise presents a more immediate and severe threat to low-lying coastal regions under IPCC AR6 low and high emissions scenarios. The land use/land cover (LULC) exposure analysis to land subsidence reveals that subsidence significantly exacerbates the vulnerability of coastal built-up and wetland regions to RSLR. The calculated coastal vertical resilience (CVR) shows that most of the persistent scatterer points (PSPs) lose elevation relative to SLR, and more than 90 % of PSPs located along the low-elevated (MSL < 5 m) coastal region of South Korea are vulnerable. The findings highlight the importance of high-resolution localized VLM to address coastal deterioration and safeguard the infrastructure of the major metropolitan coastal cities from the impacts of future coastal inundation."

 Trace metal elements in atmospheric particulate matter (PM) have significant adverse health effects. However, emissions of some metals, such as copper (Cu), are not yet consistently reported to the EMEP program by European countries under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), as their reporting is only encouraged but not mandatory. Other unregulated metals such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), are not considered at all. In this study, we improved the current European Cu inventory by correcting and adjusting existing data and completing the inventory through gap-filling. In addition, we developed the first European anthropogenic inventories for Fe and Mn, considering key anthropogenic sources such as brake wear, road abrasion, engine lubricant combustion, fuel combustion, waste incineration and rail wear. These emissions were geographically distributed based on the spatialization of PM10 emissions proposed in the reference inventories. For Cu, our new inventory shows that the heterogeneity of emissions between different countries is greatly reduced; for Fe and Mn, the inventory confirms the importance of abrasion processes in the rail and road traffic sectors, as well as that of combustion processes. To evaluate the emission inventory, the Fe/Cu and Mn/Cu ratios in the emissions were directly compared to ambient measurements. The results indicate an underestimation of Fe and Mn emissions compared to Cu, potentially due to the omission of certain emission sources, such as industrial activities or resuspension by traffic, or to contributions from natural sources such as desert mineral dust. We also compared our inventory with existing national and global inventories. This comparison suggests an underestimation of emissions from industrial activities in our inventory but also a potential misrepresentation of road traffic (or railway) sources in other inventories. Further work, including simulations using a chemistry and transport model, and comparison with extended concentration data, is needed to better assess and improve the accuracy of these inventories."

 Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS) have efficient light absorption properties, significantly affecting atmospheric oxidative capacity and radiative forcing. However, the effects of photooxidation on light absorption properties of ambient HULIS remain poorly understood. In this study, the light absorption properties of HULIS in winter and summer, daytime and nighttime, were investigated in Xi'an, northwest China, as well as their changes during the aqueous-phase photooxidation process. The light absorption coefficient of HULIS at 365 nm (Abs365) in winter was 2.3–16.4 times that in summer, and the mass absorption efficiency of HULIS at 365 nm (MAE365) in winter was 1.9–2.8 times that in summer, indicating the chromophores in HULIS in winter had higher light absorption capacity. The absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) values of HULIS were lower in winter in the high pollution period (5.79–5.89) than in the low pollution period (6.41–6.79) and in summer (6.58–6.85), suggesting that the chromophores in HULIS in the winter high pollution period could contain more conjugated systems and aromatic ring structures. During the photooxidation experiment, the Abs365 value continued to decrease, indicating the photobleaching nature of HULIS. The atmospheric half-lives (τ1/2) of HULIS were estimated to be 6.5–14.8 h in different seasons.
