10.5194/acp-25-16775-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注北极地区夏季气溶胶的来源和控制因素，探讨了区域大气环流和冰况对气溶胶的影响。通过分析1990年至2018年间多次北极考察的数据，发现冰冻期海冰的融化和冻结对气溶胶粒径分布有显著影响，尤其是在冻结期，与霜花的形成有关。研究还利用1991年至2023年的数据，探讨了气候变暖背景下气溶胶源的变化趋势，发现海冰融化和冻结的时间延长，可能会增加北极地区生物气溶胶的浓度。虽然论文没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，但其研究的气溶胶成分、粒径分布以及与气候变化的关系，与遥感监测大气成分和空气质量的应用密切相关，可以为相关遥感研究提供重要参考。,"['aerosol', 'Arctic aerosol', 'biogenic aerosol', 'particle number size distributions', 'sea ice', 'air temperature', 'remote sensing (indirectly through aerosol properties and climate implications)', 'atmospheric composition analysis (aerosol)', 'air quality monitoring (related to aerosol)', 'climate change']",Caroline Leck;Jost Heintzenberg;Tiina Nygård;Tuomas Naakka,Is the summer aerosol over the Arctic controlled by regional atmospheric circulation or ice conditions? Trends and future implications,"Five summer cruises of the Swedish icebreaker Oden in the inner Arctic in 1990, 1996, 2001, 2008, and 2018 provided a unique dataset on the seasonal distribution of atmospheric aerosol. Coupling these data with the seasonal sea ice distribution strongly indicated a regional biogenic aerosol source during late summer and early autumn freeze-up conditions. Given the expected further warming of the Arctic, we hypothesize an increase in biogenic aerosol in late summer and autumn. 
 Based on aerosol particle number size distributions measured ≥ 85° N on I/B Oden covering the summers of 1991, 1996, 2001, 2008, and 2018, regional atmospheric circulation regimes (nodes) delineated with self-organizing maps (SOMs) were investigated as potential controllers of Arctic aerosol sources. The three most prominent nodes were not connected to regional source-related differences and did not vary systematically throughout the study period. Instead, the seasonal course of sea ice melt and freeze-up appeared to affect the shape of the aerosol size distributions significantly. High sub-Aitken concentrations occurred during the “freeze-up”, most commonly associated with the low wind, restricted sea ice movement, and effective radiative cooling. The high concentrations of newly formed particles measured during “freeze-up” were interpreted as deriving from frost flower formation. With the data on ice and atmospheric conditions and their seasonal course, the study was extended to cover all years from 1991 to 2023 to enable speculations about changing aerosol source conditions in the warming Arctic climate. Over the 33 years of the study, the significant increases in seawater and air temperatures nearly doubled the favorable ice conditions for new particle formation ≥ 85° N, lengthening both “melt” and “freeze-up” parts of the illuminated Arctic by more than a week. Whereas the sum effect of counteracting processes during the ice melt season on the airborne biogenic Arctic aerosol in a warming climate is unclear, the net effect of the changing the freeze-up of sea ice is expected to enhance the biogenic Arctic aerosol in late summer/autumn."
10.5194/acp-25-16713-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了Criegee中间体与HONO的反应，认为该反应可能是Criegee中间体的一个重要消耗途径，同时也是OH自由基的一个潜在来源。研究还指出，该反应能够循环OH• ↔ HO•2，有助于解决观测到的OH和HO2自由基浓度与模型预测之间的差异。由于OH和HO2自由基在空气质量和大气成分中扮演重要角色，且Criegee中间体和HONO也是大气中的重要成分，因此这项研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星或传感器，但其研究结果可以用于改进大气化学模型，从而提高遥感数据的解释和应用。,"['Criegee intermediates', 'HONO', 'OH radicals', 'HO2 radicals', 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'Air quality', 'Atmospheric composition']",Vishva Jeet Anand;Philips Kumar Rai;Pradeep Kumar,"Criegee + HONO reaction: a bimolecular sink of Criegee, and the missing non-photolytic source of OH•","We have studied the energetics and kinetics of the bimolecular reaction of simple and dimethyl-substituted Criegee intermediates with HONO computationally. The investigation suggests that HONO can be an important sink for Criegee intermediates and a potential source of OH radicals. Our study also reveals that this reaction is also capable of recycling OH • ↔ HO•2 , and hence, can be key in resolving the discrepancy between observed and modeled concentrations of OH and HO2 radicals. 
 One of the most important puzzles in atmospheric chemistry is a mismatch between observed and modelled concentrations of OH•/HO2• in the presence of high concentration of volatile organic compounds. It is now well established that to fulfill this gap, one needs a reaction that is not only capable of producing OH• but also able to act as a sink of HO2•. In the present work, we are proposing the Criegee + HONO reaction as a possible solution of this puzzle. Our quantum chemical and kinetic calculations clearly suggest that this reaction can not only be an important source of OH radical but can also act as a sink of HO2 radical. Our study also suggests that HONO has the potential to act as a bimolecular sink of Criegee intermediates, and for some Criegee intermediates under certain atmospheric condition it can even surpass the traditionally known bimolecular sinks such as SO2 and water dimer, even in high humid conditions."

Limited studies have characterized light absorbing aerosol emissions from these biomasses, thus necessitating this work. Brown carbon (BrC) emitted from laboratory-scale biomass burning had weak light absorptivities based on their complex refractive index values. A combustion temperature dependent light absorptivity continuum existed for emitted BrC. Photochemical aging decreased BrC light absorptivity. 
 Warming climate is predicted to increase forest fires which can be a major source of black and brown carbon (BC and BrC) into the atmosphere. Unlike North American forest fires, very limited studies have characterized North Eurasian biomass burning (BB) emissions. In this work, we determined the emission factors (EF) of carbonaceous aerosols and characterized light absorption of BrC emitted from boreal and peat burning through offline filter extraction method. The results were compared to African savanna emissions. Effects of atmospheric dilution and oxidative aging on BrC absorptivity were investigated for selected BB emissions sampled into an environmental chamber. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) EFs of fresh BB emissions ranged between 1.30–89.9 and 0.01–4.80 g kg−1 respectively. Methanol soluble OC (MSOC) represented more than 92 % of fresh BB emissions, irrespective of fuel type, and consisted of weakly absorbing BrC with imaginary refractive index at 550 nm (kMSOC_550) ranging from 0.002 to 0.011. Water soluble OC (WSOC) fractions varied among fresh BB emissions but overall exhibited higher mass absorption efficiencies at 365 nm (MAE365) than MSOC. Dilution-related evaporative loss in environmental chamber resulted in less volatile OC, making them less soluble in methanol. Photochemical and dark oxidative aging further increased the low volatility OC fractions of the organics along with its oxidation state. Our estimated OC-EC emission factors and kMSOC for fresh BB emissions can be used for future modelling purposes. Further online measurements are needed to account for non-soluble strong BrC in aged BB emissions."
10.5194/acp-25-16729-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要研究大气近地面层中雪花的下落速度，以及大气湍流如何影响雪花的下落。研究方法包括使用激光片和热板设备测量雪花的质量、大小、密度和下落速度。研究结果表明，湍流和雪花的微观结构共同影响其下落速度，并提出了用于数值天气和气候模型的新参数化方案。虽然该研究与大气有关，但它更侧重于雪花物理学和天气预报，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Snowflake fall speed', 'Atmospheric turbulence', 'Snowflake microphysics', 'Numerical weather models', 'Climate models']",Spencer Donovan;Dhiraj K. Singh;Timothy J. Garrett;Eric R. Pardyjak,Quantification and parameterization of snowflake fall speeds in the atmospheric surface-layer,"Accurate snowfall prediction requires quantifying how snowflakes interact with atmospheric turbulence. Using field-based imaging techniques, we directly measured the mass, size, density, and fall speed of snowflakes in surface-layer turbulence. We found that turbulence and microstructure jointly modulate fall speed, often deviating from the terminal velocity in still air. These results inform new parameterizations for numerical weather and climate models. 
 The modeled settling speed of frozen hydrometeors has important implications for the prediction of weather and climate. However, it is usually assumed, erroneously, that they fall in still air. Here, we present novel field measurements of individual snowflake microphysical properties and their settling velocities in atmospheric surface-layer turbulence. Individual snowflake motions are tracked in a laser light sheet using particle streak velocimetry (PSV). A hotplate device, the Differential Emissivity Imaging Disdrometer (DEID), is used to obtain precise estimates of snowflake mass, density, and size. Relative to calculated terminal velocities in still air, we present enhancements and reductions of snowflake settling speeds in turbulent air for a broad range of Reynolds and Stokes numbers. Functional forms describing actual snowflake fall speeds are presented and explored. In particular, a promising non-dimensional functional form for the ratio of actual particle fall speed to terminal velocity is presented in terms of turbulence intensity and a new variable called the shape density index or SDI, which is related to an individual hydrometeor's microphysical structure."
10.5194/acp-25-16679-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了人为活动减少对HONO（亚硝酸）形成的影响，通过在北京进行的综合观测发现，减少交通流量可以显著降低HONO、CO和NO2的浓度。研究还发现，NO2在地面上的非均相反应是HONO的主要来源，并且模拟结果表明减少NOx排放可以有效降低HONO的浓度。虽然该研究与大气环境有关，但它更侧重于地面观测和化学过程模拟，而非遥感技术，如空气质量监测卫星或大气成分分析。,"['HONO', 'Air pollution control', 'Anthropogenic activities', 'NOx reduction', 'Secondary pollution', 'Vehicle emissions', 'Particulate nitrate photolysis']",Mingzhu Zhai;Shengrui Tong;Wenqian Zhang;Hailiang Zhang;Xin Li;Xiaoqi Wang;Maofa Ge,Measurement report: Anthropogenic activities reduction suppresses HONO formation: direct evidence for secondary pollution control,"To explore how anthropogenic activities affect HONO formation, we conducted comprehensive observations in Beijing. During clean periods with a 53 % drop in Traffic Performance Index, HONO, CO, and NO2 levels decreased by 2–3 times compared to polluted periods. Emission reduction simulations showed that a 50 % NOx reduction could lower HONO by up to 46.3 %, indicating that reducing anthropogenic activities significantly suppresses HONO formation and provides direct evidence for pollution control. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key precursor of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH) and significantly influences the formation of secondary pollutants, making it essential for understanding and controlling air pollution. While many studies have focused on its formation mechanisms, few have explored the impact of variations in anthropogenic activities on HONO formation. Therefore, we investigated the impact of variations in anthropogenic activities on HONO formation based on comprehensive observations conducted in urban Beijing during autumn and winter of 2022. During clean periods with a 53 % drop in Traffic Performance Index, HONO, CO, and NO2 levels decreased by 2–3 times compared to polluted periods and significantly lower than previously reported wintertime levels in Beijing. Source apportionment revealed that NO2 heterogeneous reaction on ground was the dominant HONO source across all periods. Vehicle emissions contributed more to HONO during clean periods, suggesting that reducing anthropogenic activities has a stronger influence on secondary HONO formation. Particulate nitrate (pNO3) photolysis contributed more to HONO during polluted periods, due to higher pNO3 fractions in PM2.5 under more polluted conditions. Despite including all known formation pathways in the model, unidentified HONO sources still remained. This was strongly associated with intense solar radiation and high OH concentrations at daytime, as well as elevated NH3 concentrations at nighttime. Emission reduction simulations further revealed that a 50 % NOx reduction during polluted periods could lower HONO by up to 46.3 %, directly demonstrating that reducing anthropogenic activities significantly suppresses HONO formation and provides a scientific basis for the development of air pollution control strategies."
10.5194/acp-25-16697-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注大气中水溶性有机分子标记物（WSOMMs）的采样和分析方法，特别是通过滤膜采样来评估测量的不确定性和采样伪像。研究探讨了颗粒物浓度差异、气体吸附以及化学处理对WSOMMs的影响，旨在优化采样方法。虽然涉及大气成分分析，但重点在于实验室分析和采样技术，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测等）的关联性不强。,"['water-soluble organic molecular markers (WSOMMs)', 'particulate matter', 'sampling artifacts', 'filter-based sampling', 'gaseous adsorption', 'heterogeneous reactions']",Wei Feng;Xiangyu Zhang;Zhijuan Shao;Guofeng Shen;Hong Liao;Yuhang Wang;Mingjie Xie,Measurement report: Collocated speciation and potential mechanisms of gaseous adsorption for integrated filter-based sampling and analysis of water-soluble organic molecular markers in the atmosphere,"In this work, the relative differences in particle concentrations of water-soluble organic molecular markers (WSOMMs) between the collocated filter samples represent the uncertainties in the measurements. The comparisons between the measurements of chemically treated and untreated backup filter samples indicate that the WSOMMs detected on the backup filters may originate from heterogeneous reactions on the filter surfaces, but are not caused by the adsorption of gaseous molecules. 
 To better understand the measurement uncertainties and sampling artifacts of particulate water-soluble organic molecular markers (WSOMMs), three quartz filters were stacked and installed in two collocated samplers (Sampler I and II) to simultaneously collect ambient WSOMMs. The paired top filters (Qf) loaded with PM2.5 were analyzed to determine the duplicate-derived uncertainty of particulate WSOMM concentrations. For several WSOMMs (e.g., levoglucosan) specifically associated with aerosol sources, the uncertainty was well below 20 %, which was commonly assumed in previous studies for the analysis of particulate WSOMMs. If the WSOMMs detected in the other two filters (Qb and Qbb) below Qf were caused by gaseous adsorption, the breakthrough value ([Qbb]/([Qb]+[Qbb])) can be used to estimate the sampling artifact of particulate WSOMMs due to gaseous adsorption on Qf. To understand the influence of acidic and alkaline conditions on the adsorption of gaseous WSOMMs or their precursors on quartz filters, the bottom filter (Qbb) of Sampler I was treated with (NH4)2SO4 or KOH on different sampling days. From the comparison of the measurement results between chemically treated and untreated Qbb samples, it was inferred that (NH4)2SO4 can increase the formation of isoprene secondary organic aerosol by reactive uptake of the oxidative intermediates; KOH can promote the adsorption of organic acids through neutralization reactions. Future studies are warranted to develop a suitable method for sampling gaseous WSOMMs using chemically treated adsorbents."
10.5194/acp-25-16797-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注中国福建沿海地区亚硝酸（HONO）的形成机制及其对环境氧化剂的影响。研究通过一个月的观测数据，发现沿海地区HONO的日变化模式独特，中午浓度较高。利用改进的化学传输模型，成功地模拟了观测到的HONO浓度及其时间变化。进一步的过程分析和敏感性实验量化了HONO在沿海地区的形成机制，并阐明了其对羟基自由基（OH）和臭氧形成的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它涉及空气质量监测、大气成分分析，并使用WRF-Chem模型进行模拟，该模型可以结合卫星观测数据进行验证和改进。此外，研究还考虑了船舶排放对HONO形成的影响，这与利用遥感技术监测船舶排放有关。,"['HONO', 'Nitrous acid', 'Ozone', 'OH radicals', 'Air quality monitoring', 'WRF-Chem model', 'Shipping emissions', 'Photolysis', 'NO2', 'NOx']",Haoran Zhang;Chengchun Shi;Chuanyou Ying;Shengheng Weng;Erling Ni;Lanbu Zhao;Peiheng Yang;Keqin Tang;Xueyu Zhou;Chuanhua Ren;Xuguang Chi;Derong Zhou;Mengmeng Li;Nan Li;Tengyu Liu;Xin Huang,"HONO formation mechanisms and impacts on ambient oxidants in coastal regions of Fujian, China","This study reports a unique diurnal pattern of nitrous acid (HONO), featuring higher concentrations around noon, based on one-month measurements in coastal Fujian, southeast China. Using an improved chemical transport model, we successfully reproduced the observed HONO levels and temporal variations. Further process analyses and sensitivity experiments quantified the formation mechanisms of HONO in coastal areas and shed light on its impact on the formation of OH radicals and ozone. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a vital precursor of hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the troposphere, leading to the formation of secondary air pollutants, including ozone (O3) and secondary aerosols. Previous studies have mainly focused on investigating the chemical fate of HONO in polluted urban areas of China and found a general diurnal variation featuring the minimum concentration around noon due to the fast self-photodissociation. However, this study reported a significantly higher daytime HONO concentrations based on one-month measurement during May 2024 over the coastal regions of Fujian in southeastern China. Using an updated Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model, we captured the magnitude and temporal variation of HONO concentrations observed in coastal areas, and improved the model performance on diurnal patterns of the NO2 and O3. Further process analysis revealed that two light-dependent chemical sources, i.e., the heterogeneous uptake of NO2 on the ground surface and NOx photo-oxidation, were the main contributors to HONO formation, particularly at high concentrations around noon in the presence of persistent intensive solar radiation. In addition, we assessed that shipping emissions contributed 20 % to the midday HONO production rate in coastal regions. Subsequently, model results indicated that HONO photolysis accounted for 34 % of primary OH sources during the daytime. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrated that incorporating multiple HONO sources increased the daily maximum OH and average O3 concentrations by 61 % and 44 %, respectively, in coastal regions. Overall, this study highlights the unique formation mechanisms of HONO and its significant contribution to ambient oxidants in typical coastal regions."
10.5194/amt-18-7039-2025,False,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该论文主要研究电离层垂直漂移的测量方法，比较了基于Digisonde的直接测量方法和基于电离图的间接测量方法。研究重点在于评估不同方法在不同太阳活动周期下的测量一致性、时间相干性以及采样频率和平均策略对漂移估计的影响。虽然该研究与大气有关，但它主要关注电离层物理，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['ionosphere', 'vertical plasma drift', 'Digisonde', 'ionogram', 'radio communication', 'satellite navigation']",Daniel Kouba;Zbyšek Mošna;Petra Koucká Knížová,Apparent vertical ionospheric drift: a comparative assessment of digisonde and ionogram-based methods,"Understanding how the upper atmosphere moves is important for improving radio communication and satellite navigation. We compared two techniques that use radio signals from the ground to estimate vertical motion – one based on direct Doppler shifts, the other on changes in reflection height. We found that under certain conditions, especially at night and with proper timing, the results from both methods are comparable and consistent. 
 Reliable estimation of vertical plasma drift in the ionosphere is crucial for interpreting ionospheric dynamics and enhancing the accuracy of space weather models. This study provides a comparative assessment of direct Digisonde Drift Measurements (DDM) and indirect ionogram-based methods using parameters such as hmF2, h′F2, h′(3.5 MHz), and h′(0.8foF2). Two high cadence measurement campaigns were conducted at the mid-latitude observatory in Pruhonice, Czech Republic, during different phases of the solar cycle. The analysis focuses on evaluating measurement consistency, temporal coherence, and the influence of sampling step and averaging strategy on drift estimation. While DDM yields stable and robust results even at 1 min resolution, ionogram-derived methods are strongly affected by measurement uncertainty and ambiguity in virtual height interpretation – particularly at short time scales. However, at night, all methods converge when a 15 min time interval is consistently applied both as the computation step and for subsequent smoothing. Under these conditions, coherent wave-like features in the vertical drift are reliably captured. The study outlines the strengths and limitations of each technique and provides recommendations for optimizing temporal resolution in ionospheric drift measurements, supporting improved methodology for future observational campaigns and model validation."

We found strong correlations between the online instruments and the reference method (better so for the Xact625i), while in terms of absolute concentrations, some elements were over- and underestimated. Overall, we determined both instruments can be used as powerful tools to produce high-time resolution elemental data for use in air quality monitoring. 
 This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Xact625i and PX-375 online energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) instruments for real-time trace elemental monitoring at a rural background site over six months. This represents the first direct comparison between the two instruments, assessing their performance against inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the reference method for elemental analysis. Both instruments demonstrated strong measurement capabilities, with the Xact625i achieving higher sensitivity for trace metals and showing closer agreement with ICP-MS using 24 h averaging of 2 h data (r2=0.89 vs. 0.78 for the PX-375). The PX-375 reported higher overall concentrations, primarily due to overestimations of Si and S. Both instruments correlated well for Ca, Fe, Zn, and Pb, while detection limits affected Ni and Cd. The Xact625i exhibited superior performance in measuring elements such as S, V, and Mn. While correlations with ICP-MS were high, systematic over- and underestimations in absolute concentrations were found, particularly for the PX-375. When directly comparing the two online instruments using raw 2 h data, a strong agreement was observed (mean r2=0.95). However, systematic slope discrepancies persisted, in line with comparisons against ICP-MS. The findings confirm the reliability of these two ED-XRF instruments for high-time-resolution elemental monitoring as a complementary technique to traditional filter analysis, enabling detailed source apportionment studies, improved trend analysis, and more responsive air quality management strategies. Future work comparing ED-XRF to laboratory-based methods could refine harmonisation efforts and address systematic differences in absolute concentrations."

Green,The Carbon Mapper emissions monitoring system,"We describe the Carbon Mapper emissions monitoring system including methane and carbon dioxide observations from the constellation of Tanager hyperspectral satellites, a global monitoring strategy optimized for enabling mitigation impact at the scale of individual facilities, and a data platform that delivers timely and transparent information for diverse stakeholders. We present early findings from Tanager-1 including the use of our data to locate and repair a leaking oil and gas pipeline. 
 The Carbon Mapper emissions monitoring system contributes to the broader ecosystem of greenhouse gas observations by locating and quantifying CH4 and CO2 super emitters at facility scale across priority regions globally and making the data accessible and actionable. The system includes observing platforms, an operational monitoring strategy optimized for mitigation impact, and a data platform that delivers CH4 and CO2 data products for diverse stakeholders. Operational scale-up of the system is centered around a new constellation of hyperspectral satellites. The Carbon Mapper Coalition (hereafter Tanager) satellites are each equipped with an imaging spectrometer instrument designed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory that are assembled, launched and operated by Planet Labs. The first Tanager satellite (Tanager-1) was launched 16 August 2024 completed commissioning in January 2025 and continued to improve observational efficiency through summer 2025. Planet is currently working to expand the constellation to four Tanagers. Each imaging spectrometer instrument has a spectral range of about 400–2500 nm, 5 nm spectral sampling, a nadir spatial resolution of 30 m, and nadir swath width of about 19 km at the lowest orbital altitude. Each satellite is capable of imaging 250 000 km2 per day on average. By combining the results of independent controlled release testing with empirical evaluation of the radiometric, spectral, spatial, and retrieval noise performance of the Tanager-1 spectrometer, we predict minimum detection limits of about 64–126 kgCH4 h−1 for CH4 point sources and about 10 078–18 994 kgCO2 h−1 for CO2 point sources for images with 25 % albedo, 45° solar zenith angle, and 3 m s−1 wind speed. A review of the first 11 months of Tanager-1 CH4 and CO2 observations including initial validation with coordinated aircraft under-flights and non-blind controlled release testing indicates that the system is meeting performance requirements and, in many cases, surpassing expectations. We also present early evaluations in challenging onshore and offshore observational conditions and summarize the first use of Tanager data to guide the timely mitigation of a CH4 super emitter."

Spanning 1980 to 2020 with spatial resolution of 0.5° and 1°, BMA-ET uses Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to combine thirty evapotranspiration (ET) datasets. A key innovation is dynamic weighting scheme, which adjusts for vegetation types and non-common coverage years among ET datasets. BMA-ET provides a comprehensive resource for understanding global ET patterns and trends, addressing the limitation of prior ET fusion efforts. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the terrestrial water cycle, carbon cycle, and energy balance. Currently, there are four main types of ET datasets: remote sensing–based, machine learning–based, reanalysis–based, and land–surface–model–based. However, most existing ET fusion datasets rely on a single type of ET dataset, limiting their ability to effectively capture regional ET variations. This limitation hinders accurate quantification of the terrestrial water balance and understanding of climate change impacts. In this study, the accuracy and uncertainty of thirty ET datasets (across all four types) are evaluated at multiple spatial scales, and a fusion dataset BMA (Bayesian model averaging)-ET, is obtained using BMA method and dynamic weighting scheme. ET from FLUXNET2015 as reference, the study recommends remote sensing- and machine learning-based ET datasets, especially Model Tree Ensemble Evapotranspiration (MTE), Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) and Process-based Land Surface Evapotranspiration/Heat Fluxes (PLSH), but the optimal selection depends on season and vegetation type. At the basin scale, most of ET datasets demonstrate superior performance. Relative uncertainty based on remote sensing and machine learning is low at the grid point scale. The fusion dataset BMA-ET accurately captures trends in ET, showing a global terrestrial increasing trend of 0.65 (0.51–0.78) mm yr−1 during the period 1980–2020. BMA-ET has higher correlation coefficients and lower root-mean-square errors than most individual ET datasets. Validation using ET from FLUXNET2015 as reference shows that correlation coefficients of more than 70 % of the flux sites exceed 0.6. Validation results based on independent data sources show that the correlation coefficients of BMA-ET with AmeriFlux, ChinaFlux, and ICOS reach 0.61, 0.72, and 0.74, respectively.

Here, we present a dataset of sediment-water fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus from the Baltic Sea, an area with a long history of eutrophication. The fluxes were measured in situ with three types of benthic chamber landers at 59 stations over 20 years. The data show clear spatial patterns and will be important for marine management and studies on mechanisms in benthic phosphorus cycling. 
 Sedimentary recycling of phosphorus is a key aspect of eutrophication. Here, we present data on benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from the Baltic Sea, an area with a long eutrophication history. The presented dataset contains 498 individual fluxes measured in situ with three types of benthic chamber landers at 59 stations over 20 years, and data cover most of the Baltic Sea subbasins (Hylén et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14812160). The dataset further contains information about bottom-water dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations, sedimentary organic carbon (OC) content and sediment type. The DIP fluxes differ considerably between basins depending on OC loading and the level of O2 depletion and generally increase from the coast to the central basins. Several stations have been visited on multiple occasions, also at times with different O2 concentrations, which enables investigation of the immediate effects of shifting bottom-water O2 concentrations on the benthic DIP release. The Baltic Sea-wide benthic DIP release is estimated to be 389–484 kton yr−1 based on a data integration based on sediment type and O2 conditions during three years with varying extents of hypoxia and anoxia (2004, 2013 and 2018). The dataset reveals a lack of flux measurements in winter months, coastal areas, and sandy and coarse sediments; these should be targeted in future studies. Overall, intercomparisons between samplings and landers as well as rigorous data evaluation show that the data are of high quality. As such, this data set will, alone and together with other environmental data, be important for marine management and studies on mechanisms in benthic phosphorus cycling."

The resulting datasets cover 256 assets and include detailed information on damage, building features, and mitigation measures. 
 Accurate flood damage data are essential for developing reliable flood risk assessments and designing effective risk management strategies. However, empirical flood damage data remain limited, particularly at the object level, hindering the calibration and validation of predictive models. Existing datasets are often highly aggregated and lack the granularity required for detailed analysis. This paper presents two comprehensive, micro-scale datasets documenting flood damage to 256 buildings, comprising both residential buildings and business premises, surveyed in the aftermath of the 2022 flood event in the Marche region of Italy. The georeferenced datasets include information on hazard characteristics, buildings' vulnerability features, physical damage description across structural and non-structural components, indirect damage, and implemented mitigation measures.

Alongside national inventories, independent databases provide yearly globally consistent emission inventories. Comparing independent inventories with countries submissions provides clear and consistent track of the real progress. Improvement of emissions inventories, reporting timelines, and statistical systems are essential to ensure reliable and comparable data. 
 Tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential for understanding the drivers of climate change and guiding global mitigation strategies. The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and submissions by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are two key sources of GHG emissions data. While EDGAR provides comprehensive and globally consistent estimates, UNFCCC submissions are based on nationally reported inventories, which adhere to specific guidelines and reflect country-specific circumstances and practices. This study presents a detailed comparison between EDGAR and UNFCCC GHG emissions inventories, focusing on G20 countries, which account for nearly 80 % of global emissions, as well as Annex I countries, including the EU27. By examining sectoral discrepancies, methodological variations, and the impact of reporting timelines, the paper identifies key areas of alignment and divergence in emissions estimates. While CO2 emissions show strong agreement between the datasets, CH4 and N2O estimates exhibit substantial discrepancies due to differences in methodologies, emission factors, uncertainties, and reporting practices. Our findings emphasise the need for enhanced methodological harmonization and more frequent reporting, particularly in non-Annex I countries, where limited capacity and irregular updates reduce comparability. Addressing these inconsistencies is crucial for improving transparency, aligning national and independent datasets, and strengthening climate policy decisions under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC Secretariat, 2021b)."

The data was processed exploiting exceptional instrumental redundancy to provide best quality turbulence statistics and ensure their reliability. This resource can benefit weather and climate models by providing a clearer picture of how turbulence below clouds influences their formation and organization. 
 The MAESTRO airborne field campaign took place between August 10 and September 10 2024 over the North Atlantic tropical ocean near the Cabo Verde Islands. Its goal was to investigate the processes that control the mesoscale organization of clouds with a payload of probes and sensors, as well as vertically and horizontally-pointing radars and lidars. A particular attention was paid to the role of coherent structures in the boundary layer and mesoscale cloud organization. This focus motivated the acquisition of high-resolution measurements of temperature and water vapor to capture turbulence dynamics in the subcloud layer. To achieve this, six hygrometers and four temperature sensors were deployed, including a new fast-rate hygrometer called FAST-WAVE. This article describes the turbulence dataset, prepared on the basis of these measurements. It consists in 25 Hz segmented time series of calibrated water vapor mixing ratio, temperature, and three-dimensional wind, their corresponding fluctuations, as well as turbulent moments, and integral length scales. In total, 40 hours of stabilized legs data were gathered in a wide range of mesoscale and local cloud conditions, with nearly 13 hours consisting of high-quality boundary-layer samples. This paper describes the methodological choices made for all the computations, calibrations, and corrections that were applied to the original measurements.

A climatology is derived separately for each station and each month of the year. Along with the dataset, SEEPS4ALL also resembles a set of verification tools. In a nutshell, SEEPS4ALL helps promote the benchmark of daily precipitation forecasts against in-situ observations over Europe. 
 Forecast verification is an essential task when developing a forecasting model. How well does a model perform? How does the forecast performance compare with previous versions or other models? Which aspects of the forecast could be improved? In weather forecasting, these questions apply in particular to precipitation, a key weather parameter with vital societal applications. Scores specifically designed to assess the performance of precipitation forecasts have been developed over the years. One example is the Stable and Equitable Error in Probability Space (SEEPS, Rodwell et al., 2010). The computation of this score is however not straightforward because it requires information about the precipitation climatology at the verification locations. More generally, climate statistics are key to assessing forecasts for extreme precipitation and high-impact events. Here, we introduce SEEPS4ALL, a set of data and tools that democratize the use of climate statistics for verification purposes. In particular, verification results for daily precipitation are showcased with both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts."

Demattê,"Proximal surface pedogeophysical characterization in Maritime Antarctica: assessing pedogeomorphological, periglacial, and landform influences","The study explores Maritime Antarctica's geology, shaped by periglacial forces, using pioneering gamma-spectrometric and magnetic surveys on igneous rocks due to limited Antarctic surveys. Machine learning predicts radionuclide and magnetic content based on terrain features, linking their distribution to landscape processes, morphometrics, lithology, and pedogeomorphology. Inaccuracies arise due to complex periglacial processes and landscape complexities. 
 Maritime Antarctica (M.A.) contains the most extensive and diverse lithological exposure compared to the entire continent. This lithological substrate reveals a rich history encompassing lithological, pedogeomorphological, and glaciological aspects of M.A., all of with are influenced by periglacial processes. Although pedogeophysical surveys can detect and provide valuable information to understand Antarctic lithologies and their history, such surveys are scarce on this continent and, in practice, almost non-existent. In this sense, we conducted a pioneering and comprehensive γ-spectrometric (natural radioactivity) and magnetic susceptibility (κ) survey on various igneous rocks. This study aimed to improve the geoscientific understanding of periglacial and pedogeomorphological processes in Keller Peninsula by integrating radiometric and magnetic data with advanced spatial analysis. It investigates the spatial variability of natural radiouclides and magnetic susceptibility across different substrates, evaluates a machine learning approach for data modelling, and interprets γ-ray and κ maps to reveal soil and landscape-forming processes. For that, we used proximal γ-spectrometric and κ data in different lithological substrates associated to terrain attributes. The pedogeophysical variables were collected in the field from various lithological substrates, by use field portable equipment. The pedogeophysical variables were collected in the field from various lithological substrates using portable equipment. These variables, combined with relief data and lithology, served as input data for modeling to predict and spatially map the content of radionuclides and κ by random forest algorithm (RF). In addition, we use nested-LOOCV as a form of external validation in a geophysical data with a small number of samples, and the error maps as evaluation of results. The RF algorithm successfully generated detailed maps of γ-spectrometric and κ variables. The distribution of radionuclides and ferrimagnetic minerals was influenced by morphometric variables. Nested-LOOCV method evaluated algorithm performance accurately with limited samples, generating robust mean maps. The highest thorium levels were observed in elevated, flat, and west beach areas, where detrital materials from periglacial erosion came through fluvioglacial channels. Lithology and pedogeomorphological processes-controlled thorium contents. Steeper areas formed a ring with the highest uranium contents, influenced by lithology and geomorphological-periglacial processes (rock cryoclasty, periglacial erosion, and heterogeneous deposition). Felsic rocks and areas less affected by periglacial erosion had the highest potassium levels, while regions with sulfurization-affected pyritized-andesites near fluvioglacial channels showed the lowest potassium contents. Lithology and pedogeochemical processes governed potassium levels. The κ values showed no distinct distribution pattern. Hydrothermal alteration affected the pyritized andesites, with heat and magmatic fluids driving iron enrichment and the formation of hydrothermal magnetite, which in turn led to elevated κ values. Conversely, Cryosol areas, experiencing freezing and thawing activity, had the lowest κ values due to limited ferrimagnetic mineral formation. In regions characterized by diverse terrain attributes and abundant active and intense periglacial processes, the spatial distribution of geophysical variables does not reliably reflect the actual lithological composition of the substrate. The complex interplay of various periglacial processes in the area, along with the morphometric features of the landscape, leads to the redistribution, mixing, and homogenization of surface materials, contributing to the inaccuracies in the predicted-spatialized geophysical variables."

Observational constraints (OCs) decrease this uncertainty using real-world observations. The article proposes a new rigorous statistical OC model that provides updated estimates of confidence intervals as used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. It allows the use of multiple observations simultaneously and proposes an innovative and proper illustration of this OC approach. 
 Projections of future climate are key to society's adaptation and mitigation plans in response to climate change. Numerical climate models provide projections, but the large dispersion between them makes future climate very uncertain. To refine them, approaches called observational constraints (OCs) have been developed. They constrain an ensemble of climate projections using some real-world observations. However, there are many difficulties in dealing with the large literature on OC: the methods are diverse, the mathematical formulation and underlying assumptions are not always clear, and the methods are often limited to the use of the observations of only one variable. To address these challenges, this article proposes a new statistical model called ClimLoco1.0, which stands for “CLimate variable confidence Interval of Multivariate Linear Observational COnstraint”. It describes, in a rigorous way, the confidence interval of a projected variable (its best guess associated with an uncertainty at a confidence level) obtained using a multivariate linear OC. The article is built up in increasing complexity by expressing three different cases – the last one being ClimLoco1.0, the confidence interval of a projected variable: unconstrained, constrained by multiple real-world observations assumed to be noiseless, and constrained by multiple real-world observations assumed to be noisy. ClimLoco1.0 thus accounts for observational noise (instrumental error and climate-internal variability), which is sometimes neglected in the literature but is important as it reduces the impact of the OC. Furthermore, ClimLoco1.0 accounts for uncertainty rigorously by taking into account the quality of the estimators, which depends, for example, on the number of climate models considered. In addition to providing an interpretation of the mathematical results, this article proposes graphical interpretations based on synthetic data. ClimLoco1.0 is compared to some methods from the literature at the end of the article and is used in a real case study in the appendix."

The model's predictions are compared with satellite measurements over a recent period, during polar ozone depletion events, and after the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. The system performs well for sulfate aerosols, ozone and several other key gases but not as well for several nitrogen-containing gases. Chemical processes in aerosols and polar clouds should be improved. 
 The daily analyses and forecasts of atmospheric composition delivered by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) are produced by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System configured for COMPOsition (IFS-COMPO). In 2023 this system was upgraded to Cy48 which solves explicitly for stratospheric chemistry through a module extracted from the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). In 2024 the system was further upgraded to Cy49 which improves the representation of stratospheric composition with an adjusted parameterization of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC), updated chemical rates for heterogeneous chemistry, and the implementation of missing processes to simulate an accurate distribution of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere.Here we report on these improvements and evaluate the resulting stratospheric composition in chemical forecast mode, where the model is constrained by assimilation of meteorological observations but not by assimilation of composition observations. These evaluations comprise 13 gas-phase species and sulfate aerosols in three case studies: a global-scale assessment during a quiescent period (July 2023 to May 2024) in the context of the operational upgrade of the CAMS system; the evolution of key tracers related to polar ozone depletion during the winter and spring seasons across several years; and the evolution of stratospheric aerosols over the three years following the June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption.The model captures the rapid increase of the sulfate burden after the Pinatubo eruption, with the peak of stratospheric sulfate burden timed correctly, gradual recovery, and expected vertical profiles for quiescent periods. A scorecard assessment of chemical forecasts in the stratosphere of IFS-COMPO Cy49 highlights good performance for O3, CH4, N2O, and H2O and adequate performance for HCl, ClO, BrO and BrONO2 in the polar lower stratosphere. The model performance is poorer for HNO3, N2O5, NO2 and ClONO2, highlighting the need to improve the representation of heterogeneous chemistry, particularly the interactivity between aerosols and gas-phase composition, and refine the parameterization of PSC to better capture their impact on gas-phase composition. Overestimations of CH4 and N2O in the upper stratosphere are potentially related to the Brewer–Dobson Circulation, and long-standing biases of NO2 and O3 in the upper stratosphere remain unresolved.Despite these points for further development, IFS-COMPO will be a useful tool for studies of the couplings between stratospheric aerosols and gas-phase chemistry. The current cycle paves the way for assimilating stratospheric composition observations beyond ozone."

 Cancer is generally thought to be caused by expansion of a single mutant cell1. However, analyses of early colorectal cancer lesions suggest that tumors may instead originate from multiple, genetically distinct cell populations2,3. Detecting polyclonal tumor initiation is challenging in patients, as it requires profiling early-stage lesions before clonal sweeps obscure diversity. To investigate this, we analyzed normal colorectal mucosa, benign and dysplastic premalignant polyps, and malignant adenocarcinomas (123 samples) from six individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Individuals with FAP have a germline heterozygous APC mutation, predisposing them to colorectal cancer and numerous premalignant polyps by early adulthood4. Whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing revealed that many premalignant polyps—40% with benign histology and 28% with dysplasia—were composed of multiple genetic lineages that diverged early, consistent with polyclonal origins. This conclusion was reinforced by whole-genome sequencing of single crypts from multiple polyps in additional patients which showed limited sharing of mutations among crypts within the same lesion. In some cases, multiple distinct APC mutations co-existed in different lineages of a single polyp, consistent with polyclonality. These findings reshape our understanding of early neoplastic events, demonstrating that tumor initiation can arise from the convergence of diverse mutant clones. They also suggest that cell-intrinsic growth advantages alone may not fully explain tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of microenvironmental and tissue-level factors in early cancer evolution."

Sansom,MAPK-driven epithelial cell plasticity drives colorectal cancer therapeutic resistance,"MAPK-driven epithelial cell plasticity drives colorectal cancer therapeutic resistance 
 The colorectal epithelium is rapidly renewing, with remarkable capacity to regenerate following injury. In colorectal cancer (CRC), this regenerative capacity can be co-opted to drive epithelial plasticity. While oncogenic MAPK signalling in CRC is common, with frequent mutations of both KRAS (40-50%) and BRAF (10%)1, inhibition of this pathway typically drives resistance clinically. Given the development of KRAS inhibitors, and licensing of BRAF inhibitor combinations2-4, we have interrogated key mechanisms of resistance to these agents in advanced preclinical CRC models. We show that oncogenic MAPK signalling induces epithelial state changes in vivo, driving adoption of a regenerative/revival stem like population, while inhibition leads to rapid transcriptional remodeling of both Kras- and Braf-mutant tumours, favoring a Wnt-associated, canonical stem phenotype. This drives acute therapeutic resistance in Kras- and delayed resistance in Braf-driven models. Importantly, where plasticity is restrained, such as in early metastatic disease, or through targeting ligand-dependent Wnt-pathway Rnf43 mutations, marked therapeutic responses are observed. This explains the super response to BRAF+EGFR targeted therapies previously observed in a BRAF/RNF43 co-mutant patient population, highlighting the criticality of cellular plasticity in therapeutic response. Together, our data provides clear insight into the mechanisms underpinning resistance to MAPK targeted therapies in CRC. Moreover, strategies that aim to corral stem cell fate, restrict epithelial plasticity or intervene when tumours lack heterogeneity may improve therapeutic efficacy of these agents."

 Calcium carbonate precipitation in ageing ocean crust sequesters carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater through seafloor weathering reactions, influencing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on million-year timescales. However, this crustal carbon sink, and the extent it balances CO2 degassing during crustal formation at mid-ocean ridges, remain poorly quantified due to limited sampling of the vast ridge flanks where CO2 uptake continues for millions of years. Here we quantify the carbon sink hosted within talus breccias that accumulated through mass wasting 61 million years ago during rift faulting at the slow spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, cored during International Ocean Discovery Program South Atlantic Transect Expedition 390. After 40 million years of carbonate cementation, these breccias contain ~7.5 wt% seawater-derived CO2, 2 to 40 times more than previously cored upper crust. Our estimates of talus breccia abundance based on fault geometries indicate that talus formed at slow-spreading ridges can accommodate a CO2 sink equivalent to a large proportion of the CO2 released during accretion of the underlying crust. The proportion of plate divergence accommodated by faulting, and hence talus abundance, increases nonlinearly with decreasing spreading rate. Consequently, past variations in spreading rate may have impacted the balance between ocean crust CO2 release and uptake in Earth’s carbon cycle. Mass-wasting deposits that accumulated against mid-ocean ridge faults have high porosity in which calcium carbonate precipitated, storing seawater carbon dioxide, as revealed by cores of a 61-million-year-old seafloor talus deposit."

 The integration of high-κ dielectrics with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors has long been limited by the low reactivity of their dangling-bond-free surfaces and the scalability issues of conventional deposition techniques. Here, we report a universal van der Waals (vdW) integration strategy using HfSe2 as a high-κ precursor that is dry-transferred onto MoS2 and WSe2 and fully converted into amorphous HfO2 via plasma oxidation, while preserving atomically flat vdW interfaces. The resulting HfO2/MoS2 and HfO2/WSe2 gate stacks exhibit suppressed interface trap densities (Dit ≈ 7–8 × 1010 cm-2 eV-1) and high dielectric constants (κ ≈ 23). MoS2 n-type field-effect transistors (nFETs) and WSe2 p-type field-effect transistors (pFETs) fabricated with this approach achieve nearly ideal subthreshold swing ( ≈ 60 mV/dec) and negligible hysteresis ( ≈ 3 mV). This scalable methodology enables the vertical integration of complementary logic, demonstrated by complementary FET inverters and ring oscillators, establishing a promising route toward three-dimensional, energy-efficient logic technologies.

Here the authors report the emergence of partially reprogrammed hepatocytes persisting in plastic states during liver tissue injury, which are resistant to proliferation thereby limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis. 
 The liver has remarkable regenerative capacity owing to the boundless proliferative potential of hepatocytes. During liver injury, sustained regeneration must be balanced by mechanisms limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis. Epithelial plasticity is frequently observed during liver damage and is thought to mediate production of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) or hepatocytes, depending on tissue needs. Here we show that hepatocytes persisting in plastic states are present in virtually all liver injury contexts, representing the predominant outcome of hepatocyte reprogramming rather than their full BEC conversion. By developing tools to trap mouse hepatocytes in plastic states in vivo and using models of regeneration and transplantation, we show that plastic hepatocytes are refractory to proliferation cues from the microenvironment. Unlike terminally differentiated hepatocytes, plastic hepatocytes resist proliferation driven by endogenous oncogenic stimuli. Thus, acquisition of plastic states represents a protective mechanism that constrains hepatocyte proliferation, limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis during liver disease. The balance between cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest is essential for liver regeneration. Here the authors report the emergence of partially reprogrammed hepatocytes persisting in plastic states during liver tissue injury, which are resistant to proliferation thereby limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis."

This study demonstrates an integrated medicinal chemistry workflow that effectively diversifies hit and lead structures, enabling an acceleration of the critical hit-to-lead optimization phase. Employing high-throughput experimentation (HTE), we generated a comprehensive data set encompassing 13,490 novel Minisci-type C-H alkylation reactions. These data served as the foundation for training deep graph neural networks to accurately predict reaction outcomes. Scaffold-based enumeration of potential Minisci reaction products, starting from moderate inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), yielded a virtual library containing 26,375 molecules. This virtual chemical library was evaluated using reaction prediction, physicochemical property assessment, and structure-based scoring, identifying 212 MAGL inhibitor candidates. Of these, 14 compounds were synthesized and exhibited subnanomolar activity, representing a potency improvement of up to 4500 times over the original hit compound. These ligands also showed favorable pharmacological profiles. Co-crystallization of three computationally designed ligands with the MAGL protein provided structural insights into their binding modes. This study demonstrates the potential of combining miniaturized HTE with deep learning and optimization of molecular properties to reduce cycle times in hit-to-lead progression. Efficient lead optimization in drug discovery requires improving potency, synthetic accessibility, and physicochemical properties. Here, the authors utilize machine learning to screen large chemical spaces, demonstrating automated selection of optimized molecules to improve cycle times."

Here, the authors show that genomic compartments with silent variant genes are spatially segregated from transcribed chromatin and identify the silencing machinery. 
 Genome three-dimensional organization is essential for eukaryotic gene expression. The chromosomes of the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei contain hundreds of silent variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes in subtelomeric regions. T. brucei transcribes a single VSG gene and periodically changes the VSG expressed, altering its surface coat to escape host antibodies by antigenic variation. We show that T. brucei core and subtelomeric chromosome compartments are separated by distinct boundaries and display topologically associating domains and loops. Chromosomes co-interact through compartment boundaries, which insulate silent subtelomeric from transcribed core compartments. We uncover chromatin-associating factors at the boundaries, including repressor-activator protein 1 (RAP1), which spreads over silent compartments. Inactivation of the RAP1 regulator, phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-phosphatase, removes RAP1 from boundaries and subtelomeric compartments, disrupting chromatin compartment contacts and activating all VSG genes. The data show spatial segregation of repressed from transcribed chromatin and phosphoinositide regulation of compartment assembly and genome organization.

 Despite recent advances, current brain organoid technologies face ongoing challenges in managing heterogeneity and representing the diverse structure and cell types of the human brain. Here, we develop a module-based cellular reconstitution technology to sequentially build uniform cortical assembloids with mature cortical structures and functional connectivity. The uniformity and maturity of the cortical assembloids are achieved by creating single-rosette-based organoids at the early stage, whose sizes were big and consistent with the treatment of Wnt and Hedgehog agonists, followed by spatial reconstitution with the Reelin-expressing neuronal layer and non-neuronal glial cells. The resulting single-rosette-based cortical assembloids are highly uniform and reproducible without significant batch effects, solving major heterogeneity issues caused by difficulties in controlling the number and size of rosettes in conventional multi-rosette organoids. Furthermore, these cortical assembloids structurally and functionally recapitulate the physiology of the human brain, including the six-layered cortical structure, functional connectivity, and dynamic cellular interplay between neurons and glial cells. Our study thus provides an innovative preclinical model to study a range of neurological disorders, understanding the pathogenesis of which requires an organoid system capable of representing the dynamic cellular interactions and the maturity of the human brain.

The authors introduce an asymmetric bulk flux equation, suggesting that the global ocean may absorb ~15% more CO2 than previously estimated. 
 Sea-air carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is typically estimated from the product of the gas transfer velocity (K) and the CO2 fugacity difference between the ocean surface and atmosphere. Total gas exchange comprises interfacial transfer across the unbroken surface and bubble-mediated transfer from wave breaking. While interfacial transfer is symmetric for invasion and evasion, bubble-mediated transfer theoretically favours invasion due to hydrostatic pressure, though field evidence has been lacking. Here we provide direct field evidence of this asymmetry and develop an asymmetric flux equation. Applying the asymmetric equation reduces bias in K, and increases global oceanic CO2 uptake by 0.3-0.4 Pg C yr-1 (~15% on average from 1991 to 2020) relative to conventional estimates. Further evasion data are needed to better quantify the asymmetry factor. Our study suggests that the ocean may have absorbed more CO2 than previously thought, and the asymmetric equation should be used for future CO2 flux assessments.

Here, the authors show that triadic interactions modulate mutual information between linked nodes and propose an algorithm to mine them in real biological data. 
 Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions that go beyond pairwise networks. Triadic interactions, where one node regulates the interaction between two others, are a fundamental form of higher-order dynamics found in many biological systems, from neuron-glia communication to gene regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose the Triadic Perceptron Model (TPM) which shows that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical states of two connected nodes. Leveraging this result, we formulate the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to extract triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our findings highlight crucial aspects of triadic interactions that are often ignored, offering a framework that can deepen our understanding of complex systems across biology, ecology, and climate science.

 Multiple climate-related stressors affect the ocean, including warming, acidification, deoxygenation and variations in salinity, with profound effects on Earth system cycles, marine ecosystems and human well-being. Nevertheless, a global perspective on the combined impacts of these changes on both surface and subsurface ocean conditions remains unclear.

This uncertainty-aware techno-economic analysis suggests that pyridinic-graphene membranes, which perform better as CO2 concentration decreases, offer a viable solution. 
 Membrane-based carbon capture offers an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional absorption-based processes, yet adoption remains limited by its performance with dilute CO2 sources such as natural gas power plants. Here we present a techno-economic assessment of pyridinic-graphene membranes—porous graphene membranes hosting pyridinic nitrogen—that yield increasingly high CO2 permeance and selectivity as CO2 concentration in the feed decreases. This unique behaviour substantially reduces energy consumption, process footprint and capture costs, even when considering the non-ideal effects such as concentration polarization and pressure drops. Using uncertainty-aware cost modelling, including membrane cost, electricity prices, contingency factors and learning curves, we show that capture costs can reach US$50–100 per ton CO2 for natural gas power plants and as low as US$25–50 per ton CO2 for coal and cement plants, positioning this technology favourably against state-of-the-art capture processes.

 Extreme flooding and prolonged, intensifying droughts have played a critical role in the rise and collapse of preindustrial states and empires worldwide, triggering cascading impacts such as crop failure, famine, and migration that undermined socio-political stability and economic resilience. We present a multicomponent hydroclimatic vulnerability model for crop supply networks to estimate the contribution of climatic stressors as one of several factors contributing to the decline of the late Tang Dynasty in northern China between 800 and 907 CE. We demonstrate that recurrent flooding and prolonged droughts, combined with an unsustainable shift in crop production from drought-tolerant millet to less resilient wheat and rice, led to harvest failures and food shortages during the cooler and drier climatic conditions of the late 9th and early 10th centuries CE. Intensifying raiding from competing polities and climatic extremes further affected grain supplies for the late Tang’s northern military frontier and partly contributed to the sudden decline of the dynasty.

 The northwestern Pacific has exhibited an anomalously rapid warming since 2011, causing significant climate disasters and marine ecosystem destruction.

During 2011 − 2022, aerosol reduction induces a 2.3 ± 0.91% decline in cloud cover over the downwind northwestern Pacific region, generating a 6.1 ± 2.4 W m−² enhancement in surface shortwave radiation that explains 72 ± 28% of the observed sea surface temperature rise. Aerosol-driven ocean warming manifests a five-year lag post-emission reductions, governed by threshold-triggered nonlinear aerosol-cloud interaction, where cloud decrease occurs only below critical aerosol thresholds.

But contrary to expectations, we find that scaling up fuel production by converting more cropland and more non-cropland from existing uses to energy crops lowers its net greenhouse gas intensity, due to high soil carbon sequestration rate of energy crops, even after considering land use change emissions.The potential savings in emissions are larger than the foregone soil carbon accumulation benefits from keeping that land in current uses.

 Alpine lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are rapidly expanding under climate change, yet their role in the regional carbon budget remains unclear. Here we analyze carbon flux data from 156 alpine lakes of varying sizes and find that these lakes acted as a net carbon sink of 6.7 Tg C yr−1 during 2011–2022, approximately one-fifth of the terrestrial carbon sink over the QTP. This sink is dominated by alpine large alkaline lakes that sequester substantial carbon dioxide far outweighs carbon emissions from smaller lakes. Projected lake expansion under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios indicates an increase in the lake carbon sink by 2100, with the magnitude of this increase varying inversely with scenario level due to the effect of rising water temperatures. When combined with reduced terrestrial carbon sequestration by inundated grasslands, the overall impact of lake expansion on regional carbon budgets depends on future warming rates.

Here we comprehensively assess coal mine methane emissions in China from 2000 to 2023 by combining provincial production data with coal mine-specific emission factors. We employ a methodological framework to identify key factors affecting emission factors of individual coal mines, estimate provincial production-weighted average emission factors, and assess their associated uncertainties using bootstrap simulations. The findings reveal distinct geographic patterns in emission factors, with higher values observed in the Southwest (e.g., Guizhou and Sichuan), while the North and Northwest regions (e.g., Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang) exhibit comparatively lower emission factors. Mine production shifts from high-emitting provinces to low-emitting regions resulted in total coal mine methane emission reduction after 2016. Our analysis highlights the critical role of regional production shifts and mine-specific characteristics in shaping coal mine methane emissions. Varying geological conditions lead to difference in emission factors across regions, implying the important role of regional production shifts and mine specific characteristics on coal mine methane emissions in China, according to a study based on mine specific data and actual production"

 The Asian monsoon (AM) region has experienced frequent extreme precipitation (EP) over the past decades. Effects of different drivers of water vapor transport process on EP remain unexplored. We thus investigate linear and nonlinear relationships between EP and concurrent precipitable water vapor (PWV) or vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT), using ERA5 reanalysis and 15 CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs), and quantify relative contributions of dynamic and thermodynamic water vapor transport processes to EP. PWV is purely thermodynamic, whereas IVT combines thermodynamic and dynamic drivers. Results show that consistently stronger correlations exist for PWV-EP than IVT-EP over the AM region for both ERA5 and GCMs. However, water vapor budget analysis reveals transient dynamic term dominates EP. Two apparently opposite conclusions result from greater variability in horizontal wind than specific humidity, mathematically causing dynamic term being larger than thermodynamic term, and destabilizing IVT-EP correlations. In a word, the thermodynamic water vapor transport process provides the robust basis for EP, while the dynamic water vapor transport process serves as a direct trigger, jointly controlling EP."

 This study investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics and decadal changes of extreme aerosol events over China from 2013 to 2022, a critical period marked by China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and the Blue Sky Defense Campaign. While previous studies have documented general declines in aerosol levels, the behavior of extreme aerosol events and their associated climate impacts remain poorly quantified. By integrating multi-sensor remote sensing data, this study revealed that: (1) The eastern monsoon region exhibits a significant aerosol optical depth (AOD) decreasing trend (MERRA-2: −0.11 ± 0.05 decade−1), primarily driven by reduced sulfate aerosol (SU) concentrations (−0.005 ± 0.01 decade−1), whereas the Tarim Basin shows increasing AOD (0.012 ± 0.005 decade−1) due to enhanced dust (DU) activity; (2) Extreme aerosol events (EAEs) frequency displays a marginal decline in eastern China (−0.005 ± 0.03 day month−1 decade−1) but a marked increase in the Tarim Basin (0.012 ± 0.016 decade−1); (3) Intercomparison reveals MERRA-2 overestimates AOD by 4 % in central-southern China (0.7–1.2) and shows stronger clear-sky top of the Atmosphere (TOA) positive radiative trends (0.50 W m−2 decade−1) in eastern monsoon regions, indicating limitations in black carbon (BC) mixing-state parameterization; (4) Aerosol-cloud interactions amplify uncertainties in all-sky radiation trends, with CERES showing surface SW positive trends (0.36 ± 0.57 W m−2 decade−1) but TOA negative trends (−0.09 ± 0.36 W m−2 decade−1) over eastern China, establishing clear climate feedbacks associated with AOD reductions. Our observation-derived findings provide critical evidence for evaluating climate co-benefits of air quality policies and identifies key priorities for improving aerosol monitoring and model parameterizations, thereby constraining the uncertainty in assessing aerosol impacts in a changing environment."
