10.1088/1748-9326/ada170,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了北半球森林碳汇在干旱胁迫下的恢复能力，以及大气和土壤水分亏缺的复合影响。研究发现，干旱加剧导致森林NEP恢复能力下降，而高蒸汽压差(VPD)加剧了土壤水分亏缺的负面影响，降低了树木的参考冠层导度(Gcref)，从而削弱了NEP的恢复能力。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术，特别是卫星观测，可以用于监测大气中的蒸汽压差、土壤水分和植被状况，从而评估森林碳汇的动态变化和对干旱的响应。研究中使用的气象观测数据很可能就来自于此类遥感技术。因此，该研究结果对于利用遥感技术监测和预测森林碳汇对气候变化的响应具有重要意义。,"['atmospheric water deficit', 'vapor pressure deficit', 'soil moisture', 'remote sensing', 'satellite observations', 'drought monitoring', 'carbon sink', 'forest ecosystem', 'Net ecosystem productivity (NEP)']",Xiaoyun Wu;Hang Xu;Jianzhuang Pang;Zhiqiang Zhang,Declining resilience of forest carbon sinks linked to increased atmospheric water deficit during droughts in the Northern Hemisphere,"Droughts have posed intense threats to the forest carbon sink (i.e. net ecosystem productivity, NEP), potentially elevating the risk of forest degradation and challenging the achievement of climatic and ecological goals. While global forest NEP endured, the resilience of NEP served as the ability of ecosystems to withstand and recover from perturbations and the underlying maintenance mechanisms during droughts remain unclear. Here, we explored the responses of NEP resilience, quantified by the lag-1 temporal autocorrelation coefficient (TAC) of two consecutive time series, to droughts based on 87 drought events across 45 forest sites with flux and meteorological observations in the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, an interpretable machine learning algorithm was utilized to disentangle the synergistic effects of environmental and biotic factors on TAC, achieving a mean coefficient of determination of 0.87 for drought events with significantly increasing TAC and 0.91 for other drought events. Here, we found that the increase in NEP resilience could alleviate the negative effects of droughts, in contrast to a 2.5 times increase in the probability of NEP decline events associated with decreased NEP resilience. However, NEP resilience declined with the rise of drought intensification. The reduced reference canopy conductance (Gcref) was the primary constraint on NEP resilience maintenance, contributing 48% to the total influence of biotic factors. In addition, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbated the negative effects of soil moisture deficit, jointly leading to the decline in NEP resilience. Specifically, elevated VPD during droughts significantly reduced Gcref, indicating the vulnerability of tree hydraulic systems to compound stress. Overall, our study emphasizes the potential risks of the compound soil and atmospheric water deficit on forest NEP resilience and carbon sink across the Northern Hemisphere in the future."
10.1021/acs.est.4c07098,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文介绍了一种用于连续测量冰芯中水不溶性颗粒物的新方法——单颗粒消光散射法 (SPES)。该方法结合了连续流动分析 (CFA) 技术，能够高分辨率地表征冰芯中的微小颗粒物（小于1μm），这在之前的CFA技术中是难以实现的。SPES不仅可以测量颗粒物的浓度和粒径分布，还可以测定有效折射率，从而区分不同来源的颗粒物，例如矿物颗粒、野火和化石燃料燃烧产生的颗粒物。研究人员利用SPES方法分析了东北格陵兰浅层冰芯，结果表明SPES方法获得的颗粒物浓度记录与已有的冰芯尘埃含量连续测量方法结果吻合良好。这项研究对理解过去大气环境，特别是气溶胶的时空变化具有重要意义，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如通过对冰芯中颗粒物信息的分析，可以反演过去大气中气溶胶的组成、浓度和来源等信息，为研究气候变化和空气质量提供重要数据支持。,"['Aerosol', 'Particle size distribution', 'Ice core analysis', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality', 'Remote sensing']",Chantal Zeppenfeld;Tobias Erhardt;Camilla Marie Jensen;Hubertus Fischer,Continuous Characterization of Insoluble Particles in Ice Cores Using the Single-Particle Extinction and Scattering Method,"This study presents the integration of the single-particle extinction and scattering (SPES) method in a continuous flow analysis (CFA) setup. Continuous measurements with the instrument allow for the characterization of water-insoluble particles in ice cores at high resolution with a minimized risk of contamination. The SPES method can be used to investigate particles smaller than 1 μm, which previously could not be detected by instruments typically used in CFA. Moreover, the SPES method provides not only the particle concentration and size distribution but also the effective refractive index. We show that nonabsorbing mineral particles and absorbing particles from both wildfires and fossil fuel burning can be detected with the SPES method in shallow ice cores from North–East Greenland. The concentration record retrieved with SPES correlates well with established methods used in continuous measurements of dust content in ice cores. Year-to-year variations in the number distribution of the diameter are only detectable by stacking annual layers because of the low nonabsorbing particle concentration of late Holocene ice of approximately 6 × 104 mL–1. The median diameter in the bottom 20 m of the EGRIP-S7 core is found to be 0.75 μm (0.72 μm) during the annual maximum (minimum) in dust concentration."
10.1021/acs.est.4c06123,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了生物质燃烧产生的棕色碳气溶胶在硝酸盐存在下的光氧化过程。棕色碳是影响地球辐射平衡的重要气溶胶成分，而硝酸盐是重要的光化学活性物质。研究发现，硝酸盐的浓度、温度和pH值都会影响棕色碳的光解速率，硝酸盐的增加会显著加快光解过程，缩短棕色碳在大气中的寿命。论文利用高分辨质谱分析了光氧化过程中的产物，发现形成了许多更小、含氧量更高的分子。这项研究对于理解棕色碳在大气中的老化过程及其辐射强迫作用具有重要意义，尤其考虑到近年来中国气溶胶中硝酸盐质量分数的增加。研究结果可用于改进大气成分分析模型，提高空气质量监测和卫星观测数据的解释精度，从而更好地评估棕色碳对气候变化的影响。,"['Brown carbon', 'Aerosols', 'Biomass burning', 'Nitrate', 'Photooxidation', 'Atmospheric lifetime', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Radiative forcing']",Yi Liu;Ru-Jin Huang;Chunshui Lin;Wei Yuan;Yong Jie Li;Haobin Zhong;Lu Yang;Ting Wang;Wei Huang;Wei Xu;Dan Dan Huang;Cheng Huang,Nitrate-Photolysis Shortens the Lifetimes of Brown Carbon Tracers from Biomass Burning,"Biomass burning is an important source of brown carbon (BrC) aerosols, which influence climate by affecting the Earth’s radiative balance. However, the transformation pathways of BrC chromophores, especially in the presence of photochemically active species, such as nitrate, are not well understood. In this study, the nitrate-mediated aqueous-phase photooxidation of three typical BrC chromophores from biomass burning was investigated, including 4-nitrocatechol, 3-nitrosalicylic acid, and 3,4-dinitrophenol. Variations in nitrate concentrations, pH, and temperatures were systematically examined to assess their impacts on the apparent photolysis rates of these BrC chromophores. The results show that increasing nitrate concentrations significantly enhances apparent photolysis rates to 3–3.5 times compared to nitrate-free conditions. Also, a temperature rise from 0 to 30 °C increases apparent photolysis rates by a factor of 1.3–2.5 for these chromophores. However, the effect of pH varies among these chromophores, depending on the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis suggests that the photooxidation of these chromophores initiates with the addition of nitro and/or hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring, followed by a ring-opening reaction and the formation of smaller, highly oxygenated molecules including formic acid, glyoxylic acid, malonic acid, and nitropropanoic acid. This study highlights the key role of nitrate in the aqueous-phase photooxidation of BrC, altering the aging pathways and shortening the atmospheric lifetimes of BrC. These results are of particular importance for a better understanding of BrC aging and its radiative forcing, given the increase of the nitrate mass fraction in aerosols of China in recent years."
10.1021/acs.est.4c11256,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇研究论文关注的是大气中细颗粒物（PM2.5）对人体呼吸系统短期毒性的影响，特别是黑碳（EC）和多环芳烃（PAHs）的贡献。研究使用体外肺部类器官和细胞系，评估了EC和PAHs的毒性效力。结果表明，虽然EC与PM2.5的毒性呈正相关，但其毒性效力远低于PAHs，PAHs才是导致PM2.5急性毒性的主要原因。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为PM2.5、EC和PAHs都是大气成分的重要组成部分，可以通过空气质量监测和卫星观测等遥感技术进行监测。研究结果有助于改进空气污染控制策略，减少与PM2.5相关的呼吸健康风险。,"['Particulate Matter (PM2.5)', 'Black Carbon (EC)', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Toxicity']",Xiu Chen;Di Wu;Yifei Tan;Xiwen Song;Jianmin Chen;Qing Li,Absence of a Causal Link between Elemental Carbon Exposure and Short-Term Respiratory Toxicity in Human-Derived Organoids and Cellular Models,"Black carbon or elemental carbon (EC) in the atmosphere plays an ambiguous role in acute respiratory toxic effects. Here, we evaluate the contribution of EC to the short-term toxicity (including cytotoxicity and oxidative stress potency) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the human respiratory tract using in vitro airway  organoids and cell lines. The toxic potency of EC per unit mass, including char and soot, is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are coemitted from incomplete combustion. EC contributes approximately 1 order of magnitude less to PM2.5 toxicity than PAHs, despite its positive associations with PM2.5-induced toxic potency (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, PAHs contribute 71.9 ± 12.2% and 61.9 ± 32.8% of the overall toxic potency of PM2.5 emitted from typical incomplete burning of solid and liquid fuels, respectively, while the PM2.5 toxicity significantly correlates with PAHs content (r = 0.94, p = 0.002). Hence, EC is not a cause of inducing acute toxicity, likely attributed to coemitted PAHs. These findings provide causal evidence for understanding the respiratory health risks associated with exposure to PM2.5 and further benefit to establishing efficient air pollution control policies."

However, quantification of the entrainment‐mixing mechanisms based on the Z‐LWC relationship is still lacking. To address this gap, 12,218 entrainment‐mixing cases are simulated using the Explicit Mixing Parcel Model. We examine the variations of the parameters in the power‐law relationship Z = aLWCb, and the relationship between parameter b and homogeneous mixing degree (ψ), a measure quantifying entrainment‐mixing processes. The results indicate that parameter b distributes within the range of 1–2, with a positive correlation between parameter b and ψ. The b‐ψ relationship is fitted, which connects the Z‐LWC relationship for various entrainment‐mixing types. The results suggest the potential for employing a remote sensing approach to investigate the entrainment‐mixing mechanisms of non‐precipitating small cumulus/stratocumulus clouds, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional observational studies that rely solely on aircraft observations."

ACRs intend to provide a climatological description based on cloud vertical structure (CVS) of the most prevalent monthly CVS mixtures encountered at large spatial scales of ∼400 km. ACRs are thus a way to create a gridded data set of a vertically resolved cloud mask that can facilitate joint analysis with other gridded data sets. The detailed 2D cloud mask comes from the 2B‐CLDCLASS‐LIDAR CloudSat data set fusing CALIPSO (lidar) and CloudSat (cloud radar) cloud detections. We show that the global classification of cloudiness under the ACR framework provides valuable insights on how the world's dominant cloud systems regulate the two major components of atmospheric energetics, precipitation and radiative cooling. NASA's GEOS model allows us to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the ACR concept in Earth System Models that have the capability to produce subgrid cloudiness obeying pre‐specified vertical overlap rules. Comparison of observed and simulated ACRs provides thus another means to assess the realism of modeled clouds."

 This study comprehensively analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution of the meteorological variables and large-scale atmospheric patterns that produce high concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in South Korea. Through self-organizing map (SOM) analysis of upper-level geopotential height fields and aerosol optical depth (AOD), the recurring coupled patterns of the large-scale circulation and the AOD are classified into three clusters associated with high pollution episodes that frequently occur in spring and winter. In addition, the long-range transport is investigated for each SOM type using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing PM2.5 levels. An analysis of frequency shows an increasing trend in one of the three spring patterns. Results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 indicate a continued increase in frequency for the aforementioned pattern with rising surface temperatures. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding synoptic-scale effects on PM2.5 variability to inform mitigation strategies in the context of climate change."

 Precipitation and its diurnal cycle are closely connected with the thermodynamic and dynamic processes of the Earth system, significantly influencing the climate. This study evaluates the performance of reanalysis and CMIP6 datasets in reproducing hourly precipitation events during warm seasons across China from 1980 to 2014. Statistical results indicate that while these datasets better reproduce the distribution of mean intensity than mean duration, neither fully captures the trends in mean duration or intensity. The reanalysis and CMIP6 datasets can reproduce the late afternoon precipitation peak, but it is difficult to capture the early morning peak of long-duration events except for ERA5 and HadGEM3-GC31-MM. Short-duration events show advanced peak time trends over most stations, while long-duration events exhibit delayed trends, a pattern not comprehensively replicated by other datasets. Additionally, the impact of aerosols on precipitation peak times varies across three regions: North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD). In the NCP, early morning and midnight peaks advance for precipitation that lasts 4–6 h, potentially linked to aerosol radiative effects. In contrast, in the YRD and PRD, both early morning and late afternoon peaks are delayed 1–2 h, associated with the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols. This study also highlights that aerosol impacts on precipitation peak times are dependent on meteorological conditions. In the NCP, the radiative effect of absorbing aerosols is enhanced under low-CAPE conditions. In the YRD, the aerosol invigoration effect is inhibited under high-WS conditions, whereas in the PRD, a low-WS environment enhances the microphysical effect of aerosols."

 Short-term forecasting of extreme weather is crucial for disaster warning and prevention. Many extreme weather events are often accompanied by significant water vapor changes, therefore, assimilating high-precision, high-resolution water vapor observations into numerical models is essential. This study explores the impact of GNSS ZTD assimilation on short-term forecasting of extreme weather using the WRF model on the case of “21.7” Henan extreme heavy rain. The impacts of GNSS ZTD assimilation on model fields and forecast results are analyzed, compared with scenarios where no data or only conventional observational data are assimilated. The results indicate that GNSS products outperform radiosonde data in temporal and spatial resolution, significantly affecting humidity fields in assimilation and providing more detailed water vapor distribution. In terms of precipitation forecasting, the analysis of POD, FAR, and ETS scores shows that GNSS data assimilation primarily impacts moderate to heavy rainfall for this case. During most simulation periods, the scores are higher when GNSS products are assimilated, with the most notable improvements observed at the threshold of 30 mm for 3-h accumulated precipitation, where ETS scores increase by an average of 21 %. However, despite the general improvement in precipitation forecast accuracy, limitations remain in forecasting peak rainfall periods."

 To understand the formation and evolution of tropical rainfall, this study examines macro- and micro-physical features and vertical structures of tropical precipitation systems (TPSs) using 9-years observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission's dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR). TPSs are primarily convective-dominated, and their precipitation rate (PR) concentrated in 20–40 mm/h, which can be largely attributed to liquid hydrometeors, especially in convective regions. However, TPSs with low PR (below 10 mm/h) are stratiform-dominated. The mean levels of 0 °C and − 40 °C within the TPSs are 4.9 km and 11 km, respectively. Warm core is observed in the TPS, which is related to the development of precipitation system. TPSs have distinct characteristics during different stages of their lifecycle. Condensation and autoconversion processes in convective cores contribute to the formation of initial small droplet below 3 km. With the development of TPSs, strong updrafts in convective cores transport droplets from cloud base to higher levels, facilitating the collision-coalescence process in liquid phase layers. During the developing and mature stages, aggregation and riming processes become active above the melting layers. The large hydrometeors within the convective cores contribute to high PR of mature-stage TPSs. In stratiform region, droplets sizes are larger during mature stage than dissipating stage, and these larger droplets may detach from the convective cores. It makes the dominate microphysical process in stratiform regions of mature (dissipating) stage is breakup (evaporation) of raindrops. These results advance the understanding of tropical rainfall and establish a foundation for future research into validating and improving cloud microphysical parameterization schemes in numerical models."

 The radiative effects caused by a massive desert dust outbreak that took place in the Western Sahara Desert, in the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean, in June 2020 are studied. This outbreak featured two significant dust plumes, the second of which is the focus of the present study.For the identification of the dust plume, we adopted a multi-platform set of remote sensing data, including satellite retrievals from the sensors VIIRS, MODIS and SEVIRI onboard the NOAA-20, Aqua and MSG spacecrafts, respectively. The analysis of aerosol-radiation effects is based on a regional simulation with the WRF-Chem model, implementing the coupling between the aerosols of the GOCART speciation and the radiative modules defined in WRF-Chem model by the “New Goddard Shortwave and Longwave Schemes”. In this context, two sets of simulations are proposed: the first one (CTL) without any feedback, and the second (CPL) adopting the fully-coupling strategy.From the comparison between the simulated and the observed (SEVIRI) incoming SW/LW radiation it follows that: (i) the presence of dust in the domain causes a reduction of the incoming SW radiation in the CPL runs; (ii) this reduction is fully in agreement with experimental data; (iii) conversely, the LW component appears to be insensitive to model coupling. Hence, the Goddard radiative coupling is effective in reducing the incoming SW radiation: the difference in terms of average daily values between model and SEVIRI is 123.7 vs 37.0 W m−2 for CTL and CPL runs, respectively. The incoming longwave radiation seems to be less correlated with the coupling strategy, being the difference of 31.15 vs 15.8 W m−2 for CTL and CPL runs, respectively.The dust radiative forcing (DRF), that characterises the aerosol–radiation interactions, results in an average surface cooling of −16.9 W m−2 between the CPL and the CTL runs that could be attributed to a reduction of SW radiation absorbed and scattered by dust particles in the coupled run. At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), a warming, caused by the decrease in atmospheric transparency to the terrestrial thermal radiation, results in an average DRF of +1.5 W m−2.Finally, the space- and time-averaged surface energy balance results in a difference (E(CPL) - E(CTL)) of about −7.5 W m−2. Similarly, the dynamic response of the dust forcing within the Planetary Boundary Layer is characterised by a mean temperature difference (CPL-CTL) of about −0.7 K near the surface.Our findings strongly encourage the use of fully-coupled modelling strategy, between aerosols and meteorology, for regional-scale studies and in climate risk assessments."

Increased tropospheric blocking frequency in November favored vertically propagating planetary waves to weaken the stratospheric polar vortex. The stratospheric response that persisted into December was characterized as the shift of polar vortex towards Eurasia and away from North America, linked to the enhanced zonal wavenumber-1 planetary waves. Downward propagation of the amplified wavenumber-1 component into the troposphere in December contributed to stronger continental high pressure over Eurasia and weaker ridge over Alaska, causing the “colder North Eurasia, warmer North America” pattern. High consistency between the results of observations and two sets of numerical simulations confirms the critical role of preceding tropospheric blocking, which is valuable for sub-seasonal prediction of the dipole temperature pattern across northern mid-latitudes."

These organics adsorbed at the air‐water interface can interact with the atmospheric oxidants and influence the exchange of organic materials between the water and the atmosphere. Here, we assess the chemical interaction between gaseous NO2 and authentic surface microlayers collected at the lake water (Dianchi Lake) situated in China. The formation of the gas‐phase product compounds was evaluated in real time using a novel secondary electrospray ionization ultrahigh‐resolution quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (SESI‐UHR‐MS) upon exposure of surface microlayer to gaseous NO2 (20 or 50 ppb) in dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation at two different temperatures: 5°C and 25°C. The obtained results revealed that the sampling sites of the lake impacted by human activities (municipal sewage and agricultural activities) significantly impact the number and the composition of the formed gas‐phase product compounds. The formation of nitrogen (N)‐containing compounds was observed as well, which contain most likely nitro or amino functional groups, or alternatively, they could be aromatic compounds. The observed N‐containing compounds may contribute to the “brown carbon” which act as light‐absorbing compounds, thus influencing the radiative forcing of aerosols in the atmosphere."

 Asia is one of the largest dust source regions in the world. However, the temporal variations and drivers of different types of dust events in this region remain unclear. Based on surface observation data, we explored spatiotemporal changes in three types of dust events and their driving factors in Asia by using machine learning methods. Results indicated that the frequency of moderate dust events (MDE) and severe dust events (SDE) decreased significantly from 2000 to 2022, which could be primarily attributed to a decrease in strong wind days (contribution >50%), and to a lesser extent to increases in soil moisture, precipitation, and leaf area index (LAI). When the daily maximum wind speed exceeds 13.0 m/s, the probability of MDE tends to decrease, while the probability of SDE tends to increase. These findings enhance our understanding of the variation in frequency and intensity of dust events in response to climate change."

 In this study, the thermodynamic feedback effect of excess cloud ice possibly originating from tropical cyclones (TCs) on the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and, in turn, the TC track was investigated by use of sensitivity experiments with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. The results indicated that excess cloud ice in the area north of the TC track can alter the temperature and the geopotential height there via latent heat release (cooling due to melting and evaporation) of hydrometeors in the upper (lower) troposphere, accompanying by the enhanced local downdrafts. Moreover, under the influence of the changed steering flow, the TC turns northward ahead of time relative to its original track. The sensitivity experiments confirm that the thermodynamic feedback effect of hydrometeors aloft can ultimately affect the TC track, which is also supported by observations of some selected northward-turning TCs."

We find that offshore wind power has great potential in mitigating the negative impacts of existing coal-fired power emissions. By deploying cost-competitive offshore wind power, it is projected that by 2050, offshore wind power would contribute 2% to 5% (306–654 TWh) of China’s total electricity generation, cumulatively reducing pollutants from the electricity sector by 3% and preventing 165,000 premature deaths.

This study collected ambient PM2.5 in Shanghai, China, along with particulate matter from biodiesel/diesel-fueled vehicles, bio-oil pyrolysis, and laboratory-scale experiments conducted using a Miniature Combustion Aerosol Standard (lab-MINICAST) experiments. Targeted MS/MS using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS methodology and machine learning were applied to investigate and decode the light-absorbing chromophores of methanol-extracted organic aerosols. The results showed emissions from biomass burning and vehicles are the main contributors to ambient organic aerosols. CHO compounds accounted for the largest proportion. A fraction of the identified light-absorbing chromophores were long-chain CHO-containing compounds, including fatty acids (C18H34O2, C18H32O2, C16H30O2, C5H8O2, and a subset of CnH2nO2 (12 < n < 25)) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, the remaining CnH2nO2 (12 < n < 25))  originatimg from vehicle emissions, accounting for 65.256% of the organic aerosol light-absorbing during nonbiomass burning days, but only accounting for 7.12% of the CHO compounds and 3.06% of the organic aerosols. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models revealed that all the light-absorbing molecules of the methanol-extracted samples identified in this study typically exhibit higher weights of atomic around oxygen-containing functional groups (>0.5), contrasting with non-light-absorbing substances, which display more uniformly distributed lower atomic weights. This may provide some explanation for the light-absorbing ability of fatty acids and FAMEs."

Four scenarios for spatial and temporal allocation of hydraulic fracturing NOx emissions were developed. In one scenario, NOx emissions were evenly distributed to all active wells in the Eagle Ford region, with continuous emissions throughout the year. In other scenarios, NOx emissions from hydraulic fracturing engines in Karnes County were allocated only to fractured wells, with durations ranging from 2 days to 2 weeks.

Earth system modeling of this scenario under pre‐industrial conditions reveals a compound event with maximum northern extratropics surface cooling of ∼2° ${\sim} 2{}^{\circ}$C in summer‐autumn of 939 and 940 CE, prolonged Arctic sea ice growth, and large‐scale precipitation changes, concurrent with stratospheric ozone depletion and elevated pollution.

Using ERA5 composites arranged according to active RMM phases, we found that a three‐part mechanism, traced approximately 10–15 days before MJO Phase 1 events, roughly corresponding to RMM phases 7 and 8, explains these precipitation anomalies. This mechanism is composed of three Rossby wave trains in response to convective perturbations: two cross equatorial teleconnections attributed to suppressed convection in the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent, and an interhemispheric Rossby wave linked to enhanced convection over the warm pool of the western hemisphere. Composite analyses of OLR and wave activity flux, complemented with Rossby wave ray tracing, support these findings. This research provides insights into the MJO's influence on additional large‐scale teleconnection patterns across the Southern Hemisphere besides the Pacific South American (PSA) teleconnection mode. The dispersion of the convective RMM phase at different lags and the interaction between multiple wave trains introduce uncertainty when associating a specific RMM phase with precipitation anomalies."

The IEIs based on different references and source‐specific emission ratios show a large range of emissions in China (4.8–14 Tg yr−1) and also significant differences in major sources and spatial distributions. Among them, the IEI relative to nonMethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) with a total emission of 12 Tg yr−1, dominated by solvent use, better captures observed spatial distributions of IVOCs and SOA. In contrast, IEIs relative to primary organic aerosols (POA) misinterpret the major sources and tend to have a negative bias in megacities even when the total emission is scaled up to 14 Tg yr−1.

 Cloud particle phase is an important controlling factor for the Earth's surface heat budget, through the radiative balance. Thus, it exerts a strong influence on climate change in the Arctic. Aerosols transported from lower latitudes modify Arctic cloud properties, including cloud phase. In this study, we investigated ice cloud formation and high aerosol concentrations over the Arctic Ocean using a combination of observations obtained by an Arctic voyage, reanalysis data, and backward trajectory analyses. On 12 September 2023, in an atmospheric river over the Arctic Ocean, ice clouds at temperatures warmer than −15 °C were observed in the middle troposphere by a Cloud Particle Sensor sonde. In the lower troposphere, a particle counter onboard a drone detected particle counts two orders of magnitude higher than the voyage average. Backward trajectories indicated that a lower tropospheric air mass with a high concentration of organic carbon (OC) aerosols over northern and coastal western Canada, where wildfire-induced OC emissions were evident, reached the mid-troposphere over the Arctic Ocean. These results suggest that OC aerosols from severe Canadian wildfires in the summer of 2023 acted as ice-nucleating particles for ice cloud formation under high-temperature conditions exceeding −15 °C over the Arctic Ocean."

Further investigations reveal asymmetric effects linked to the phase of ENSO and IOD: positive ENSO events (El Niño) and negative IOD events are followed by enhanced intraseasonal mesoscale activities in the BoB, potentially triggered by the warmer background in the tropical Indian Ocean and the bay during these events, respectively. However, influences from the opposite phases are neglectable."
10.1029/2024GL112073,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了南大洋海冰对海气甲烷通量的影响。研究发现，在海冰浓度较低的区域，海冰融化导致低温和低盐度，增加了甲烷的溶解度，从而导致大气中甲烷的吸收。而在海冰浓度较高的区域，海冰的阻挡作用则减弱了甲烷的通量。该研究使用了湍流协方差和整体通量公式测量方法，结果表明南大洋东部在夏季是一个甲烷汇，并且南极边缘海冰区对全球甲烷收支的影响比之前认为的更为重要。虽然论文本身没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，例如卫星观测数据，但其研究结果对改进大气甲烷浓度遥感反演模型和估算全球甲烷收支具有重要意义。  可以使用卫星遥感数据监测海冰覆盖范围和海冰融化情况，从而更好地理解海冰对海气甲烷通量的影响。,"['Atmospheric CH4', 'Air-sea interaction', 'Satellite remote sensing of sea ice', 'Oceanic CH4 emissions', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Gong Zhang;Qinghua Yang;Bo Han;John Prytherch;Brett F.

Using both eddy covariance and bulk formula flux measurements from the icebreaker R/V Xuelong2, we found that the eastern SO during an austral summer was a sink for CH4. The strongest downward CH4 fluxes occurred in areas of low sea ice concentration (10%–40%), where sea‐ice melting resulted in low temperature and salinity, increasing CH4 solubility. The CH4 fluxes are weak in regions of high sea ice concentration (>50%) due to the blocking effect of sea ice.

Although it is well established that majority of rainfall from mid‐ to‐high latitudes originates from ice, there is a lack of consensus on the major thermodynamic phase of raining clouds over low latitudes. Previous CloudSat‐based studies have yet reached consistent results on the fraction of ice‐phase raining clouds Fice $\left({F}_{\mathit{ice}}\right)$ over Southern China. In this work, we found that CloudSat‐based approaches are subject to metrics used for flagging rainfall events, which may lead to different Fice ${F}_{\mathit{ice}}$ estimates. Analysis of multi‐year surface radar observations suggests that Fice ${F}_{\mathit{ice}}$ has diurnal variation and increases with rain rate, while the surface rainfall originating from warm clouds does not exceed 50 mm/h $\mathrm{m}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{h}$. Using disdrometer observations to flag surface rainfall events, we found that about 71% $\%$ and 95% $\%$ of surface rainfall events and rainfall accumulation come from cold clouds, respectively.

This study investigates molecular composition of BrC derived from combustion of five types of residential solid fuels (i.e., firewood, corn cob, bituminous coal, anthracite, and biomass briquette) and their photooxidation evolution mechanisms using an oxidation flow reactor. Results show that nitrogen‐containing and sulfur‐containing organic compounds are the main components of molecular composition of methanol‐soluble organic compounds (MSOC) emitted from these fuels, with their intensity being 33%–43% and 23%–56%, respectively, depending on fuel type. The photooxidation processes mediated by NO3⋅ and ⋅ OH significantly altered the molecular composition and distribution of aged MSOC. The formation of typical nitrogen‐containing BrC chromophores (e.g., nitro‐aromatic compounds) also proves the role of NO3 ⋅ in the photooxidation reaction. However, the photo‐enhancement effect of NO3 ⋅ mediated photooxidation reaction could not offset the destruction of the molecular conjugation degree and aromaticity of BrC by ⋅ OH oxidation, resulting in a significant reduction in the light absorption capacity of BrC. The mass absorption coefficient at 365 nm of BrC aged for 12 days derived from the remaining fuels decreased by 47.0%–55.8% compared to that of fresh BrC, except for firewood, which only decreased by 5.3%.

The present study explored the spatiotemporal attributes of spring frost days (FD) over northeast China in recent decades, and the potential mechanisms underlying their interannual variations. The results indicated an evident decline in spring FD over northeast China, accompanied by substantial interannual variation. Further analyses suggested that anomalous springtime North Atlantic tripole sea surface temperature (SST) and Eurasian snow depth are critical factors controlling the interannual variations of spring FD in northeast China. Rossby wave trains can be stimulated by the anomalous North Atlantic tripole SST (NAT), which propagates eastward through the Eurasian continent to northeast China, significantly affecting the atmospheric circulation along the pathways. This results in anomalous negative geopotential heights and cyclonic circulation over northeast China, causing low‐temperature anomalies by moderating wind‐induced alterations in surface heat fluxes and cloud‐induced modifications in surface radiation. Meanwhile, Eurasian snow depth anomalies represent a consistent effect with NAT. The anomalous Eurasian snow depth may modify the atmosphere thickness by regulating surface heat flux, promoting the propagation of wave trains as a snow‐atmosphere bridge, which enhances the impact of NAT on FD. In addition, it also triggers the Rossby wave trains to spread from high‐latitude Siberia to northeast China. Both of these processes have a considerable impact on the local atmospheric circulation. Consequently, these two factors contribute to local surface cooling, thereby increasing the spring frost occurrence over northeast China."

Observational and experimental evidence reveals an unidentified competitive mechanism involving transition metal ions (TMIs) that catalyze the heterogeneous oxidation of isoprene. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) were generated through the reaction of singlet oxygen (O(1D)) with molecular water at the surface of earth‐abundant manganese (Mn) nanoparticles. The energy threshold for OH production was minimized to 213 kJ mol−1 in the presence of alkali K+ ions, significantly lower than the 392 kJ mol−1 required for ozone photolysis. The rapid loss of isoprene (1.60 × 10−2 s−1) for the particulate mixtures resulted in the formation of approximately 70% C1–C4 carbonyl oligomers via interfacial binding modes, which promoted particle growth. This contrasts with the higher yields of C5 products typically observed in gas‐phase reactions of isoprene with OH radicals. The findings could enhance the understanding of severe haze formation, particularly under complex air pollution conditions."

 Patterns of ionospheric luminosity provide a unique window into our complex, coupled space environment. The aurora, for example, indicates plasma processes occurring thousands of km away, depositing immense amounts of energy into our polar ionospheres. Here we show observations of structured continuum emission associated with the dynamic aurora. The presence of weak ambient continuum emission has long been recognized. However, studies of its relationship to aurora are scarce and limited by observational constraints. We use spectrally resolved measurements to analyze these previously unexplained emissions, adding critical information about spatial structure, characteristic spectra, and location within auroral dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that the coupling among auroral processes, the plasma, and the neutral atmosphere can unfold at meso-scales and is more complex than previously reported. We suggest that the meso-scale auroral precipitation may, under certain circumstances, effectively couple to atmospheric chemistry and conditions to produce the continuum structure.

 A number of recent source apportionment studies have explored high-time resolution organic particulate matter, elemental particulate matter (PM), and Black Carbon (BC) datasets and attributed them independently to specific sources. However, proper unmixing of the actual sources operational on the ground most of the time cannot be achieved based on such an independent source apportionment approach, especially owing to the presence of secondary aerosol factors. Therefore, a combined analysis of all major PM2.5 species is needed to better recognize the actual physical sources. Accordingly, in this study, using a combined dataset consisting of non-refractory PM2.5 organic factors/major m/z signals from organics, elements, and BC, we evaluated two disparate factor analytic methodologies – namely, double-PMF (D-PMF) and Tracer-conjugate PMF (TC-PMF), to apportion PM2.5 sources in Delhi winter (from December 15, 2020 to February 28, 2021) through real-time instrumentation (ACSM, Xact, and Aethalometer(AXA)). During the study period, the average PM2.5 concentration was 182 μg/m3 (C-PM2.5 = sum of NR-PM2.5 (Organics, NO3−, SO4−2, NH4+), BC, and elements). For D-PMF, organic aerosols (OA) were initially deconvolved with positive matrix factorization (PMF) into hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), low volatile oxidized OA (LVOOA 1 and 2) and semi-volatile oxidized organic aerosols (SVOOA) before being coupled with elemental species and BC for a second PMF. The TC-PMF combined the major m/z signals from organics with the elemental species and BC. Both D-PMF and TC-PMF identified biomass burning, industrial, waste incineration, dust-related, traffic, secondary chloride, Pb-rich, power plant, and LVOOA dominated as the sources. Both solutions (D-PMF, TC-PMF) were found to be dominated by biomass burning (33.3% and 26.5%), followed by the power plant (27.4% and 18.4%) and the LVOOA dominant (14.2% and 18.6%) factors. The D-PMF and TC-PMF improved the interpretation of organic factor sources, such as apportioning considerable contributions of LVOOA2 (85%) to the power plant factor, which is often linked with regionally carried aged OA in the Organics PMF (O-PMF). Lastly, the D-PMF results significantly agreed with TC-PMF, indicating that either of the two techniques could be used to unmix the complex variety of PM2.5 sources in the Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) region and, arguably, the larger Indo-Gangetic Plains."

 Deep learning has attracted more and more attention in the field of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation (TCIE). It is able to achieve promising results when the testing data follows the same distribution as the training data. However, due to the difference of geographical locations, TC intensity distributions, and imaging sensors, TC in different basins often show diverse distributions, making deep learning models trained on one basin can hardly be generalized to other basins. In this paper, we propose a cross-basin incremental learning model (CBIL-TCIE) to estimate the intensity of TC in multiple basins. CBIL-TCIE consists of domain-shared and domain-specific layers within the framework of multi-task learning. The domain-shared layers learn the common knowledge of all basins, and the domain-specific layers learn the specific knowledge of the current basin. Additionally, most of the existing studies have primarily focused on utilizing either maximum sustained wind (MSW) or minimum sea level pressure (MSLP) to represent TC intensity. Differently, in order to better characterize the intensity of TCs, our model can output MSW and MSLP concurrently as the TC intensity in different basins. To test the performance of our proposed model, we conduct experiments on a widely used dataset named GridSat, which consists of TC data across multiple basins. The performance of the CBIL-TCIE in multiple basins can improve by 19.2 % compared to the widely used fine-tuning method. Furthermore, the experiment demonstrates that concurrently outputting MSW and MSLP can effectively facilitate the ability of TC intensity estimation."

 Global Precipitation Measurement satellite equipped with space-borne dual-frequency precipitation radar (GPM-DPR) allows to investigate the precipitating cloud microphysics and precipitation structures, irrespective of the terrain's ruggedness. Ten years (from March 2014 to December 2023) of continuous GPM-DPR level2 V07A data is processed to understand the decadal changes in precipitation microphysics across the Western Ghats (8°N-20°N and 73°E-77°E) during the monsoon season including before onset (pre-monsoon) and withdrawal (post-monsoon) periods. The spatial distribution of rain rate (R: mm/h), mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm: mm), and normalized intercept parameters (Nw: m−3 mm−1) shows considerable variations depending on cloud types and seasons. During the stratiform precipitation, low-intensity rainfall dominates, characterized by low Dm and high Nw, indicating a significant concentration of smaller raindrops. In contrast, the escalation of high-intensity rainfall due to increased convective activity and strong updrafts during the convective precipitation causes the enlargement of raindrops, augments the concentration of bigger raindrops. Dm-Nw joint histogram displayed distinguishable patterns; range and peak varied with the cloud type and season. It may result from differences in the occurrence rate of various microphysical processes. The share of collision-coalescences process is a maximum of 72.35 % for the convective precipitation in the monsoon season. At the same time, the highest break-up process contribution is 52.05 % during stratiform rainfall of the post-monsoon season."

Isotope-based source apportionment of NH4+ is essential for ammonia (NH3) mitigation but the role of kinetic vs equilibrium controls on nitrogen isotope (δ15N) fractionation between NH3 and NH4+ remains unresolved. Based on concurrent  measurements of NH3 and NH4+ in winter Beijing, we observed that the difference of δ15N between NH3 and NH4+ on clean days (3.3 ± 13.3‰) was significantly lower than that during polluted periods (30.2 ± 11.8‰). This difference signified  incomplete  equilibrium fractionation and that kinetic fractionation may have occurred between NH3 and NH4+, especially during clean days. Assuming that kinetic and equilibrium fractionation occurred successively, the contribution of nonagricultural emissions to NH4+ was apportioned to 60.3 ± 12.8%, higher than that of 50.4 ± 17.7% considering only equilibrium fractionation. These results indicate that the source apportionment of NH4+ considering only equilibrium fractionation in the conventional scenario would underestimate the contribution of nonagricultural emissions by 16.4% (up to 33.1% on clean days). Our analysis highlighted the importance in considering both kinetic and equilibrium fractionation scenarios to improve the precision of NH4+ source apportionment by using nitrogen isotopes."

While these CO2 sequestration technologies offer low-cost routes to net-zero emissions, namely, the CST benefits, they impede progress to the Sustainable Development Goals, namely, the CST disbenefits. Focusing on China, we assess both the CST disbenefits and benefits in the climate-energy-air-health cascade by an integrated modeling framework. We show that, CST can save 4.98–15.65 trillion CNY in achieving net-zero emissions while compromising the sustainability on non-fossil energy penetration, air quality, and public health improvement, leading to a substantial loss up to 7.82 trillion CNY during 2020–2060. Given the high likelihood of a large-scale deployment of CSTs in the future, pursuing policy coherence that balances trade-offs between CST disbenefits and benefits is vital. To that end, CSTs should be allocated to power sectors as a priority and stringent end-of-pipe equipment should be retrofitted into non-power sectors before CST allocation."

In this manuscript, CBH is retrieved using a multi‐linear regression equation, while CBVV used a random forests model. Both retrievals combine satellite and numerical weather prediction data. The satellite data used are the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite imagery, while measurements of CBH and CBVV include DL and radiosonde data at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observatory. Data from 83 summer days (May‐August) in 2018–2021 featuring cumulus clouds forced by solar heating were examined and used to train the models, with years 2022–2023 used for validation. Various spatial domains were defined with one large (2.4° longitude by 2.0° latitude) SGP domain being split into smaller sections (smallest being 0.99° and 0.61° longitude and latitude respectably). CBH and CBVV values obtained from the DL as compared to the models show root mean square errors between 150 and 200 m, with CBVV values between 0.45 and 1 ms−1. It was found that the CBH formulation performs well over all domains, while the CBVV retrievals become less accurate due to more turbulence being introduced into the observations as the number of DL stations decreases in the smaller domains."

 Satellite technologies are essential for global conservation actions through providing continuous, real-time Earth monitoring. However, development of these technologies necessitates an increase in rocket launches, which introduces new threats to biodiversity. Here, we mapped rocket launch sites and assessed their threats on protected areas and terrestrial biodiversity. Our analysis revealed that over 90% launch sites are within areas where unprotected habitats excesses 50% and over 62% of operating sites are located within or near protected areas. The threats from rocket launches are potentially associated with biomes, coordinates, and proximity to oceans. In particular, threatened terrestrial species in Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests are more vulnerable to these risks compared to species in other biomes. Without strategic planning, the continued growth of rocket launches could create conflicts between technological development and conservation efforts, undermining the achievement of UN Biodiversity Goals.

 The importance of water resources in supporting food production is ever increasing, especially in the face of climate change, urbanization and population growth. This study aims to map and analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of irrigated agricultural areas to support improved planning of irrigation water and irrigation sector in Nepal. Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, this study classifies and analyzes change in irrigated and rainfed areas over the past two decades. NDVI time series analysis across different physiographic regions uncovered two cropping cycles annually in the Terai and Siwalik regions. In contrast, predominantly a single cropping cycle was observed in the Middle and High Mountain regions. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to NDVI time series within the agriculture land use database of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) for Nepal. The obtained irrigated areas distribution were also analyzed across different provinces of Nepal as provinces are the main functional administrative divisions after federal level that are responsible for irrigation development. The produced irrigation areas distribution showed reasonable accuracy as compared to the statistical irrigation areas database of the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation (DWRI), Nepal. The results showed that, on average, approximately 60% (2.18 million hectares) of agricultural land was irrigated annually over the past decade.

 Temperature inversion is an important meteorological phenomenon that affects the diffusion and migration of air pollutants. To forecast air quality accurately, it is essential to understand the characteristics, formation, and dissipation mechanisms of temperature inversion. The sounding data used in this study came from 24 radiosonde stations in northwest China. We systematically analyzed the characteristics of inversions and their effects on air pollution in northwest China. Additionally, we developed a conceptual model of inversion formation mechanisms over the region's complex underlying surfaces. The results indicated that inversions are prevalent throughout the year in northwest China, occurring more frequently at 08:00 Beijing time than at 20:00. The annual average number of inversion days across multiple stations is 330.4 days, with an average inversion strength of 1.20 °C/100 m and an average inversion depth of 291.2 m. The spatial distribution of the number of inversion days, strength and depth in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region is smaller than that in the Arid region of northwest China and the Eastern monsoon marginal zone. The occurrence of inversions in Northwest China exacerbates air pollution, demonstrating with inversions accounted for more than 70% of the days of occurrence in the daily statistics of air pollution. In particular, SBIs(surface-based inversions) and NSIs(near-surface inversions) have a significant impact on air pollution. Both representative indicators of air pollution, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, exhibited parabolic relationships with inversion strength. The PM2.5 concentration reached its maximum value (108.27 μg/m³) at an inversion strength of 1.51 °C/100m, showing a linear positive correlation with inversion depth and a negative correlation with O3 concentration. The formation of inversions in northwest China is primarily influenced by two factors: the concave topography and the unique geographic environment of the Tibetan Plateau, and the atmospheric circulation. These findings provide a scientific basis for understanding the structural characteristics of inversions in northwest China and for developing strategies to mitigate air pollution."

Yet, the potential impact of ozone (O3) exposure on anemia remains uncertain. The study included 1,467,887 eligible women from 83 surveys of 45 LMICs between 2004 to 2020. Monthly O3 exposure was estimated using machine learning, with the year preceding the survey as the primary exposure window. Fixed-effects models evaluated the association between O3 and anemia. An exposure-response function (ERF) was constructed using a varying-coefficient regression model, and then extrapolated to estimate the anemia burden in relation to O3 in 123 LMICs. In the fully adjusted regression model, each 10 ppb increase in annual O3 concentration was associated with an 8% elevation in anemia risk. The nonlinear ERF indicated a threshold effect of O3 on anemia at approximately 47.2 ppb. In 2020, more than 7.6 million anemic WRA (1.58%) in 123 LMICs were associated with O3 exposure. The potentially attributable burden has generally decreased from 2004 to 2020, notably in South Asia.

 Urban ozone (O3) pollution correlates with temperature, and higher O3 often occurs during heatwaves, threatening public health. However, limited data on how anthropogenic volatile organic compound (AVOC) precursor emissions vary with temperature hinders understanding their impact on O3. Here we show that the increase in non-combustion AVOC emissions (for example, from volatile chemical products) during a heatwave in Shanghai contributes significantly to increased O3, on the basis of ambient measurements, emissions testing and air quality modelling. AVOC concentrations increase ~twofold when the temperature increases from 25 °C to 35 °C due to air stagnation and increased emissions. During the heatwave, higher concentrations result in an 82% increase in VOC OH reactivity. Air quality simulations reveal that temperature-driven AVOC emissions increases account for 8% (1.6 s–1) of this reactivity increase and enhance O3 by 4.6 ppb. Moreover, we predict a more profound (twofold) increase in OH reactivity of oxygenated VOCs, facilitating radical production and O3 formation. Enhanced AVOC emissions trigger O3 enhancements in large cities in East China during a heatwave, and similar effects may also happen in other AVOC-sensitive megacities globally. Reducing AVOC emissions, particularly non-combustion sources, which are currently less understood and regulated, could mitigate potential O3 pollution in urban environments during heatwaves. Ozone pollution is enhanced by increased non-combustion anthropogenic volatile organic compound emissions during heatwaves, according to atmospheric measurements and modelling of ozone concentrations in a heatwave in Shanghai."

Our model demonstrates strong performance, achieving a mean bias of less than -1.5 parts per billion against in-situ measurements. We estimate that 66.2% of the global population is exposed to excess ozone for short term (> 30 days per year), and 94.2% suffers from long-term exposure. Furthermore, severe ozone exposure levels are observed in Cropland areas, particularly over Asia. Importantly, the all-cause ozone-attributable deaths significantly surpass previous recognition from specific diseases worldwide. Notably, mid-latitude Asia (30°N) and the western United States show high mortality burden, contributing substantially to global ozone-attributable deaths.

 Fluvial sediment transport, a key pathway for global biogeochemical cycling, has changed markedly in the Anthropocene. However, disaggregating the compound effects of anthropogenic stresses on fluvial sediment transport at the global scale remains a challenge. Here we map the suspended sediment concentrations for global river channels, based on satellite observations, between 1985 and 2020, and estimate long-term changes in land–ocean sediment transfer.

 African easterly waves significantly influence regional hydroclimate, making it crucial to understand how global warming will impact their activity. Here, we investigate future changes in wave activity and assess the underlying mechanisms using an ensemble of Earth system models. We find a robust increase in wave activity over the Sahel–Sahara region by the end of the 21st century under two emission scenarios. This intensification is linked to increased baroclinicity associated with a strengthening of the meridional temperature gradient between the Guinea Coast and the Sahara. Our results also indicate that low-level warming enhances the waves by reinforcing monsoon flow, leading to increased convergence and vertical motion along the intertropical discontinuity. These energetic alterations significantly modify the conditions that currently produce these waves. Overall, our findings suggest that changes in wave activity could impact the transport of Saharan dust and mesoscale convective activity over the Sahel.

 Ultrafine particles (UFPs) are both directly emitted from human activities and produced through atmospheric processes. The origins of ultrafine particles were explored in an urban area by analyzing 6 to 520 nm particle size data collected from 2006 to 2021 near a busy roadway in downtown Toronto, Canada. Days were classified into five categories: Strong Nucleation, Midday Pollution, Traffic Pollution, Baseline, and Mixed. Strong Nucleation days, which comprised about 6% of the days, showed long nucleation events (¿ 3 hr) with an average particle number concentration of 3.1±0.1×104 #/cm3 around noon (10 am to 2 pm). Midday Pollution days also exhibited higher particle concentrations around noon with an average of 3.3±0.06×104 #/cm3. The higher number concentrations on these days appeared to arise from locally emitted UFP and be associated with enhanced production of UFP within vehicle exhaust plumes. The Traffic Pollution days showed morning traffic emissions, with no midday rise. The average total UFP concentration around the morning rush hour (6 am to 9 am) on these days was 2.1±0.2×104 #/cm3. About 27% of the days had lower particle number concentrations (daily average: 1.2±0.2×104 #/cm3) throughout the day. The number concentrations were lower on these “Baseline days” and the influence of traffic emissions was also lower but still observable in the diurnal pattern. Lastly, Mixed days were the days that showed higher than Baseline concentrations of UFP around the morning rush hour (2.0±0.06×104 #/cm3) or midday (2.3±0.1×104 #/cm3); UFP on these days came from a mix of traffic pollution, nucleation event, or a midday process, with no one of these sources clearly dominant. These days could not be categorized into any of these categories with confidence. Analysis of the organic and inorganic speciation, trace elements, and traffic-related air pollutants suggested that the UFP on Midday Pollution days came from vehicle emissions enhanced by reactions within their exhaust plumes. Moreover, the time series analysis of these categories showed that the frequency of Midday Pollution days has decreased over the years with the number of Baseline days correspondingly increasing. Meteorological analysis showed that Midday and Traffic Pollution days happened more often in winter while Strong Nucleation days were more frequent in summer. This study has shown that higher midday UFP concentrations do not arise only due to nucleation events and that a previously unrecognized Midday Pollution process can be a large contributor."

About 6% (0.54 to 14.64%) of the modeled areas show significant increases in the number of days conducive to high-severity burning during 1981 to 2020, most of which were found during 2001 to 2020 and in the spring and autumn. The extraordinary 2023 fire season demonstrated similar spatial patterns but more-widespread escalations in burn severity."

The impact is strongly linked to BC mass, with deep snowpacks showing greater sensitivity. Snowmelt and land–atmosphere interactions are crucial. High-resolution modelling is necessary to better understand these effects on Arctic climate change. 
 The rapid warming of the Arctic, driven by glacial and sea ice melt, poses significant challenges to Earth's climate, ecosystems, and economy. Recent evidence indicates that the snow-darkening effect (SDE), caused by black carbon (BC) deposition, plays a crucial role in accelerated warming. However, high-resolution simulations assessing the impacts from the properties of snowpack and land–atmosphere interactions on the changes in the surface energy balance of the Arctic caused by BC remain scarce. This study integrates the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model with a polar-optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar-WRF) to evaluate the impacts of snow melting and land–atmosphere interaction processes on the SDE due to BC deposition. The simulation results indicate that BC deposition can directly affect the surface energy balance by decreasing snow albedo and its corresponding radiative forcing (RF). On average, BC deposition at 50 ng g−1 causes a daily average RF of 1.6 W m−2 in offline simulations (without surface feedbacks) and 1.4 W m−2 in online simulations (with surface feedback). The reduction in snow albedo induced by BC is strongly dependent on snow depth, with a significant linear relationship observed when snow depth is shallow. In regions with deep snowpack, such as Greenland, BC deposition leads to a 25 %–41 % greater SDE impact and a 19 %–40 % increase in snowmelt compared to in areas with shallow snow. Snowmelt and land–atmosphere interactions play significant roles in assessing changes in the surface energy balance caused by BC deposition based on a comparison of results from offline and online coupled simulations via Polar-WRF and the community Noah land surface model (LSM) with multiple parameterization options (Noah-MP) and SNICAR. Offline simulations tend to overestimate SDE impacts by more than 50 % because crucial surface feedback processes are excluded. This study underscores the importance of incorporating detailed physical processes in high-resolution models to improve our understanding of the role of the SDE in Arctic climate change."

 Formaldehyde (HCHO) in the atmosphere is an intermediate product from the oxidation of methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds. In remote marine regions, HCHO variability is closely related to atmospheric oxidation capacity, and modeled HCHO in these regions is usually added as a global satellite HCHO background. Thus, it is important to understand and validate the levels of satellite HCHO over the remote oceans. Here we intercompare three satellite retrievals of total HCHO columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (OMI SAO (v004)) algorithm, Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (OMPS-NPP SAO) algorithm, and Ozone Monitoring Instrument Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (OMI BIRA) algorithm and validate them against in situ observations from the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) mission. All retrievals are correlated with ATom-integrated columns over remote oceans, with OMI SAO (v004) showing the best agreement. This is also reflected in the mean bias (MB) for OMI SAO (−0.73 ± 0.87) × 1015 molec. cm−2, OMPS SAO (−0.76 ± 0.88) × 1015 molec. cm−2, and OMI BIRA (−1.40 ± 1.11) × 1015 molec. cm−2. We recommend the OMI-SAO (v004) retrieval for remote-ocean atmosphere studies. Three satellite HCHO retrievals and in situ ATom columns all generally captured the spatial and seasonal distributions of HCHO in the remote-ocean atmosphere. Retrieval bias varies by latitude and season, but a persistent low bias is found in all products at high latitudes, and the general low bias is most severe for the OMI BIRA product. Examination of retrieval components reveals that slant column corrections have a larger impact on the retrievals over remote marine regions, while AMFs play a smaller role. This study informs us that the potential latitude-dependent biases in the retrievals require further investigation for improvement and should be considered when using marine HCHO satellite data, and vertical profiles from in situ instruments are crucial for validating satellite retrievals."

 The chemical properties of aerosols in the atmosphere significantly influence their impact on the global climate forcing and human health. However, a real-time molecular-level characterisation of aerosols remains challenging due to the complex nature of their chemical composition. The current study constructed an instrumental system for the real-time chemical characterisation of aerosol particles. The proposed setup consists of a custom-built high-efficiency aerosol collector (HEAC) used to collect aerosol samples into a working fluid and an electrospray ionisation (ESI) Orbitrap Mass spectrometer (MS) for the subsequent chemical analysis of the liquid sample. The HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS was calibrated against six chemical compounds to investigate the system’s sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD). Results showed that the coupled system has high sensitivities towards the tested chemical compounds and a similar, if not better, LOD than other related instrumental techniques. The capability of the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system to identify the chemical composition of organic aerosols (OA) was also examined. Sample OA was generated by α-pinene ozonolysis, and the chemical characterisation results were compared to similar studies. Our data showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system can identify most of the α-pinene ozonolysis products reported in the literature, including cis-pinonic acid, pinalic acid and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA). Monomeric and dimeric reaction products were accurately identified in the mass spectra, even at a total OA mass concentration < 2 µg m-3.

We use the state‐of‐the‐art automated feature tracking software TempestExtremes (TE) to detect and track LPS features globally in ERA5 and compute 16 parameters from commonly found atmospheric variables for classification. A Python classifier is implemented to classify all LPSs at once. The framework assigns 16 different labels (classes) to each LPS data point and designates four different types of high‐impact LPS tracks, including tracks of tropical cyclone (TC), monsoonal system, subtropical storm and polar low. The classification process involves disentangling high‐altitude and drier LPSs, differentiating tropical and non‐tropical LPSs using novel criteria, and optimizing for the detection of the four types of high‐impact LPS. A comparison of our labels with those in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) revealed an overall accuracy of 95% in distinguishing between tropical systems, extratropical cyclones, and disturbances. SyCLoPS produces a better TC detection skill compared to the previous algorithms, highlighted by an approximately 6% reduction in the false alarm rate compared to the previous TE algorithm. The vertical cross section composite of the four types of high‐impact LPS we detect each shows distinct structural characteristics. Finally, we demonstrate that SyCLoPS is valuable for investigating various aspects of LPSs in climate data, such as the evolution of a single LPS track, patterns of LPS frequencies, and precipitation or wind influence associated with a particular LPS class."

Our analysis shows that the EAD pattern is driven by local thermodynamic and dynamic processes associated with an anomalous low‐pressure system over the Weddell Sea, which is linked to a Rossby wave train triggered by tropical sea surface temperature variabilities, particularly those over the Indian Ocean.

Using 27‐year satellite data and numerical simulations, we examined the response and feedback of mesoscale eddies to TCs over the SCS, based on TCs' interaction with 183 cyclonic ocean eddies (COEs) and 152 anticyclonic ocean eddies (AOEs). TCs induce a symmetric sea surface height reduction with maximum reduction (∼5 cm on average) appearing at the TC center. Pre‐existing COEs (AOEs) are enhanced (weakened) by TCs with an average 24% increase (17% decrease) in amplitude and enlarged (shrunk) with an average 19% increase (13% decrease) in radius. Stronger or slower‐moving TCs enhance COEs more significantly. Pre‐TC existing COEs (AOEs) enhance (suppress) TC‐induced sea surface cooling, and thus suppress (fuel) TC intensification, with the effect of COEs statistically stronger than AOEs. This modulating effect is more pronounced under stronger or slower‐moving TCs. Eddy's location also influences the modulating effect, with pre‐TC COEs located to the left (right) of TC track shifting the largest cooling leftwards (rightwards). Furthermore, the left‐located COEs increase cooling amplitude by 61%, stronger than right‐located COEs (26%). These results suggest that the combination of mesoscale eddies and TC attributes complicates TC‐induced sea surface cooling, which potentially affects TC intensification, wind structure, and rainfall."

A sliding window method was used to achieve high‐resolution (100 m) large‐area sea surface wind speed estimations. More importantly, this study provides new insights into the impact of different wind and wave conditions on W and regional variations in the whitecap coverage‐sea surface wind speed model from an optical satellite perspective, which can effectively quantify the wind‐wave breaking and distinguish the regional variations of them in different offshore seas. By comparing with 10‐m resolution data from the Sentinel‐2 Multi‐Spectral Instrument, we further clarified the impact of spatial resolution on the selection of methods for calculating W, revealing scale effects in optical remote sensing of whitecap detection and proposing corresponding W calculation strategies.

 Productivity in the Pleistocene glacial Southern Ocean was probably enhanced owing to iron fertilization by aeolian dust. Marine sediments indicate such an increase north of the modern Antarctic Polar Front but reduced biogenic activity south of it. However, quantitative estimates for the integrated net effect are difficult to obtain. Here we use the SO42− isotopic composition and other geochemical ice core records from the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean to reconstruct net changes in integrated biogenic sulfur productivity in the surface ocean over the penultimate glacial termination. We show that biogenic SO42− aerosol contributes 58% and 85% to the sulfate budget in Dronning Maud Land during glacial and interglacial times, respectively, and that biogenic sulfate is derived predominately from the seasonal sea ice zone. Using our quantitative reconstruction of biogenic aerosol production in the Southern Ocean source region, we show that the average biogenic sulfate production integrated over the Atlantic sector was 16% higher in the penultimate glacial 137,000–153,000 years ago compared with the later Last Interglacial 120,000–125,000 years ago. An intermittent decrease in productivity observed during early peak interglacial warming suggests that a reduction in the seasonal sea ice zone may disrupt Southern Ocean ecosystems.

 Skillful seasonal climate prediction is critical for food and water security over the world’s heavily populated regions, such as in continental East Asia. Current models, however, face significant difficulties in predicting the summer mean rainfall anomaly over continental East Asia, and forecasting rainfall spatiotemporal evolution presents an even greater challenge. Here, we benefit from integrating the spatiotemporal evolution of rainfall to identify the most crucial patterns intrinsic to continental East-Asian rainfall anomalies. A physical-statistical prediction model is developed to capture the predictability offered by these patterns through a detection of precursor signals that describe slowly varying lower boundary conditions. The presented model demonstrates a prediction skill of 0.51, at least twice as high as that of the best dynamical models available (0.26), indicating improved prediction for both the spatiotemporal evolution and summer mean of rainfall anomalies. This advance marks a crucial step toward delivering skillful seasonal predictions to populations in need of new tools for managing risks of both near-term climate disasters, such as floods and droughts, and long-term climate change. This study proposes a physical-statistical model that significantly improves seasonal predictions of the spatiotemporal evolution of East-Asian rainfall anomalies, outperforming current state-of-the-art dynamical models in forecasting climate disasters."

 Climate change and human-induced land degradation threaten dryland ecosystems, vital to one-third of the global population and pivotal to inter-annual global carbon fluxes. Early warning systems are essential for guiding conservation, climate change mitigation and alleviating food insecurity in drylands. However, contemporary methods fail to provide large-scale early warnings effectively. Here we show that a machine learning-based approach can predict the probability of abrupt shifts in Sudano–Sahelian dryland vegetation functioning (75.1% accuracy; 76.6% precision) particularly where measures of resilience (temporal autocorrelation) are supplemented with proxies for vegetation and rainfall dynamics and other environmental factors. Regional-scale predictions for 2025 highlight a belt in the south of the study region with high probabilities of future shifts, largely linked to long-term rainfall trends. Our approach can provide valuable support for the conservation and sustainable use of dryland ecosystem services, particularly in the context of climate change projected drying trends.

Using an aircraft-based measurement method, we provide large-scale estimates of total gas-phase organic carbon deposition rates and fluxes. Observed deposition rates downwind of large-scale unconventional oil operations reached up to 100 tC hour−1, with fluxes exceeding 0.1 gC m−2hour−1. The observed deposition lifetimes (τdep) were short enough (i.e., 4 ± 2 hours) to compete with chemical oxidation processes and affect the fate of atmospheric reactive carbon. Yet, much of this deposited organic carbon cannot be accounted for using traditional gas-phase deposition algorithms used in regional air quality models, signifying underrepresented, but influential, chemical-physical surface properties and processes. Furthermore, these fluxes represent a major unaccounted contribution of reactive carbon to downwind freshwater ecosystems that outweigh terrestrial sources, necessitating the inclusion of dry deposition in aquatic carbon balances and models."

Presently, adverse health effects of ambient SBTEX exposure in highly polluted regions, such as the Gulf States, must be evaluated. Epidemiologists, however, are limited by inadequate estimates of ambient SBTEX. Using Bayesian Maximum Entropy, SBTEX estimation methods of varying resource intensity were evaluated, including simple kriging (least intense), incorporation of observational and emissions data trends (moderately intense), and data fusion of observed and Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions (CAMx) data (most intense). Generally, as resource intensity increased, so did SBTEX estimation performance, where SBTEX Spearman R values increased by 0.48 on average from the least to most intense methods. Data fusion of observed and CAMx data was identified as the best ambient SBTEX estimation method in the Gulf States. Exposure estimates revealed that Gulf States residences within commuting distance of high industrial activity experienced 1.64 times higher 97.5th percentile daily exposures to SBTEX on average than those living in less industrialized areas, which could contribute to total occupational and ambient exposure disparities. Furthermore, ambient benzene exposure was greater than the acceptable one-in-a-million excess cancer risk threshold for 75% of estimated residence locations in the Gulf States."

The intentional emission of oxidants into the atmosphere has been proposed as a geoengineering solution to accelerate the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, thereby reducing surface warming. However, there has been little consideration for competing atmospheric oxidation pathways that will reduce CH4 oxidation efficiencies and result in the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter. Using a global chemical-transport model, we simulate a proposed technology to intentionally emit H2O2 into the atmosphere to elevate OH concentrations and enhance CH4 oxidation. We find that proposed emission rates of oxidants have minimal impacts on monthly average tropospheric ozone and particulate matter concentrations. However, competition for the oxidation of CH4 would necessitate widespread adoption of such technology to remove substantial concentrations of atmospheric CH4, which would in-turn cause considerable increases in regional winter-time particulate matter. Our work underscores the need to consider competing chemistry in evaluating the efficacy and side effects of proposals to enhance the atmospheric oxidation of CH4 as a climate solution."

However, the meteorological feedback mechanisms affecting smoke dispersion and wildfire emissions on a synoptic scale remain unclear. This study focused on the largest wildfires occurring between December 25, 2019 and January 10, 2020, under the enhanced subtropical high, when the double peak in wildfire evolution was favored by sustained low humidity and two synchronous increases in temperature and wind. Based on the coupled atmospheric chemical transport model, we revealed an abnormal downdraft and a lowered planetary boundary layer over southeastern Australia, caused by the radiative cooling effects (exceeding −100 W m–2 at surface) of carbonaceous aerosols (CAs) from wildfires. These changes hindered the smoke dispersion and increased the PM2.5 concentration by ∼27.8%. By contrast, the low-level anomalous cyclonic circulation induced by CAs brought more water vapor toward the fire zone. This, combined with surface cooling and low wind speeds, suppressed wildfire emissions, thereby reducing PM2.5 concentration by ∼11.6%. These findings highlight the critical role of aerosol-radiation interaction in wildfire behavior."

In recent years, advanced microwave sounders have been proposed to be onboard future CubeSats that are less expensive than traditional satellites, providing unprecedented rapid‐update and low‐earth‐orbit microwave observations that can follow the evolution of the typhoon and convective weather systems. In this study, the potential values of assimilating future CubeSat constellation microwave radiances in clear‐sky condition for regional NWP are preliminarily assessed with observing system simulation experiments using the convection‐permitting 4DEnVar for the prediction of typhoon “Infa” and its associated “7.20” heavy rainfall event that occurred in China in July 2021. This constellation is assumed to include 12 CubeSats equipped with microwave sounders obtaining radiances sensitive to water vapor and temperature. The results show the CubeSat constellation radiances demonstrate positive impacts on the analyses and forecasts of typhoon's track, intensity, precipitation, and dynamical conditions. The forecast errors of typhoon's maximum wind speed, minimum sea level pressure, and track are reduced by 17.9%, 14.3%, and 27.9%, respectively.

 Given the significant environmental and health risks associated with near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2), machine learning is frequently employed to estimate near-surface NO2 concentrations (SNO2) from satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 column densities (CNO2). However, data-driven methods often face challenges in explaining the complex relationships between these variables. In this study, the correlation between CNO2 and SNO2 is examined using vertical profile observations from China’s MAX-DOAS network. Cloud cover and air convection substantially weaken (R = −0.68) and strengthen (R = 0.71) the CNO2-SNO2 correlation, respectively. Meteorological factors dominate the correlation (R2 = 0.58), which is 31% stronger in northern regions than in the southwest. Additionally, anthropogenic emissions impact SNO2, while topographical features shape regional climate patterns. At the Chongqing site, the negative impacts of unfavorable meteorological conditions, high emissions, and basin topography lead to significant contrasts and delays in daily CNO2 and SNO2 variations. This study enhances understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics and influencing mechanisms of CNO2 and SNO2, supporting improved air quality assessments and pollution exposure evaluations."

 Numerical prediction of warm-sector heavy precipitation under weak synoptic-scale forcing in South China remains a challenging problem. In this study, the simulation capabilities of four microphysics schemes (WSM6, Thompson, Thompson aerosol-aware, and Morrison) for the heavy rainfall event that occurred during 10–11 May 2022, which featured both a coastal warm-sector rain belt and an inland frontal rain belt, have been evaluated and improved by using polarimetric radar and 2DVDs. The results showed that four schemes effectively reproduced the coastal and inland heavy precipitation amounts but exhibited poor performance in describing raindrop size and number concentration, with noticeable differences among these schemes. Compared to observations, the microphysics schemes tended to produce raindrops with larger size and fewer number concentration. By incorporating the observed relationship between rainwater and generalized intercept parameter into the WSM6 scheme, the simulated raindrop size and number concentration were optimized with real-time diagnosis of raindrop intercept parameter. For the Thompson and Morrison double-moment schemes, modifying the diameter threshold parameter in raindrop self-collection process to enhance raindrop breakup efficiency was the most direct and effective method for improving simulation. Even though the impact of vertical wind shear on raindrop breakup was considered here, there remained a discrepancy between the simulated and observed raindrop sizes and number concentrations. Therefore, the reasons for adjusting this threshold parameter were still unclear. Additionally, using ECMWF-CAMS aerosol reanalysis data as input for Thompson aerosol-aware scheme showed a better representation of aerosol spatial distribution, thereby improving precipitation distribution, especially for the inland rain belt."

 Detailed characterization of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and mixing layer height (MLH) is essential for gaining insights into air quality, pollutant dispersion, and the dynamics of the lower atmosphere. This research involves MLH from four atmospheric models—ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5), Reanalysis, GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System), and GFS (Global Forecast System), representing diverse approaches commonly applied in atmospheric research, mainly in air quality studies. The intercomparison analyzes the simulated MLH from the models, comparing them with observations from radiosondes and ceilometers to capture diurnal and seasonal variations in boundary layer dynamics. The study reveals significant diurnal and seasonal variations, with a close alignment between ERA5 boundary layer and ceilometer mixing layer observations, Reanalysis consistently underestimating MLH altitude, and both GFS and GDAS models demonstrating reasonable diurnal cycles of MLH. During summer, all models underestimate MLH compared to ceilometer observations by 34–42 %, while in winter, overestimation relative to ceilometer observations ranges from 11 to 20 %. Factors contributing to this discrepancy, including meteorological variables and synoptic situations, were examined. GFS and GDAS tend to overestimate global radiation after 12:00 but underestimate MLH, while ERA5 consistently underestimated both radiation and MLH. Dependence in agreement between models and ceilometer observations was also observed for various synoptic situations. The interconnected nature of atmospheric stability and turbulence, highlighted by Richardson number analysis, further emphasizes the importance of understanding turbulence patterns for accurate MLH predictions."

Here, we find that models with excessive sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical western Pacific (WP) during spring and greater surface warming trends over the northern mid‐high latitudes (NMHL) during autumn in the present day tend to overestimate future delays to ISM onset and withdrawal, respectively. This can be attributed to the influence of surface thermal conditions on upper‐tropospheric warming patterns. Constrained by the observational WP SST and NMHL surface warming trends, projected ISM duration under a high‐emission scenario is shortened by 6 days compared to the current climate, with a reduction of inter‐model uncertainty by 46% relative to the unconstrained results."

By considering errors of both radiative fluxes and atmospheric heating rates, optimizations are made to select the overlapping method and the number of k‐distribution quadrature points in each band. The new CKD model exhibits a remarkable improvement in heating rates and radiative fluxes relative to the previous 17‐band model when performing the identical radiative transfer calculations under 50 atmospheric profiles. The heating rate root‐mean‐square errors (RMSEs) of the 36‐band model are 0.101 and 0.075 K d−1 below 4 hPa for longwave and shortwave, respectively, when validated against the line‐by‐line benchmarks.

Furthermore, the cases simulating radiative forcing induced by varying gas concentrations demonstrate the ability of the 36‐band model to study the warming effect of greenhouse gases."

Here, the molecular composition of OSCs and its associations with methanol‐soluble BrC (MS‐BrC) absorption during a haze event in North China were revealed using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis. By combining aggregated boosted tree model and partial least squares regression estimation, our results suggested that OSCs were mainly composed of potential aromatic structures, and the MS‐BrC absorption was closely related to OSCs. Specifically, OSCs contribute a notable 26% of the total potential BrC molecular number and an upper limit of 10.4% of total MS‐BrC absorption. Furthermore, we found that OSCs were mainly influenced by coal combustion, and the potential desulfurization reactions showed associations with the variations of MS‐BrC absorption. Since the residential coal combustion (an important primary source of OSs) was the major energy in North China, our research underscores the potential of aromatic OSCs as tracers for assessing the impact of fossil fuel combustion on BrC and highlights the important atmospheric influences of OSCs (e.g., light absorption and health), which need more works to uncover the origins, fates, and environmental effects of OSCs."

It is found that the GW hotspots produced by WAMT254 in the troposphere and stratosphere agree well with previously well‐studied orographic and nonorographic sources. In the ionosphere‐thermosphere (IT) region, GWs spread out forming latitudinal band‐like hotspots. During solstices, a primary maximum in GW activity is observed in WAMT254 and GOCE over winter mid‐high latitudes, likely associated with higher‐order waves with primary sources in polar night jet, fronts, and polar vortex. During all the seasons, the enhancement of GWs around the geomagnetic poles as observed by GOCE (at ∼ ${\sim} $250 km) is well captured by simulations. WAMT254 GWs in the IT region also show dependence on local time due to their interaction with migrating tides leading to diurnal and semidiurnal variations. The GWs are more likely to propagate up from the MLT region during westward/weakly eastward phase of thermospheric tides, signifying the dominance of eastward GW momentum flux in the MLT. Additionally, as a novel finding, a wavenumber‐4 signature in GW activity is predicted by WAMT254 between 6 and 12 local times in the tropics at ∼ ${\sim} $250 km, which propagates eastward with local time. This behavior is likely associated with the modulation of GWs by wave‐4 signal of nonmigrating tides in the lower thermospheric zonal winds."

Takegawa,Homogeneous Mixing of Sea Spray and Biomass Burning Tracer Elements Within Single Particles Observed Over Southeast Asia,"Aerosols from sea spray and biomass burning play an important role in climate due to their considerable abundance in the atmosphere. The magnitude of their atmospheric impact depends on the chemical and physical properties of individual particles. The elemental composition of aerosol particles from Thailand, Southeast Asia, was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X‐ray spectrometer, with a special focus on sodium (Na) and potassium (K) as tracer elements for sea spray and biomass burning, respectively. Our analysis revealed that nearly all particles with aerodynamic diameters between 300 and 700 nm contained either Na or K, with approximately 74% of the particles containing both elements, that is, homogeneously mixed in the form of sulfate. While both Na and K were present in the same particles and K‐rich particles were generally more abundant than Na‐rich particles in all samples, higher Na fractions were observed when the particles were mainly transported from the ocean. The Na and K containing aerosol particles were often mixed with soot and organic particles. These results demonstrate the significant mixing of sea spray and biomass burning aerosols during their atmospheric transport. Such mixing can affect the hygroscopicity, viscosity, and optical properties of aerosols. This study highlights the significant mixing of natural aerosols from different sources at the individual particle level and suggests the need for accurate representation of aerosol properties in climate models."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121026,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了利用气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）数据，特别是细模态气溶胶光学厚度（AODf）数据，估算中国区域PM2.5浓度的方法。研究使用了AODf和AOD两种数据构建PM2.5估算模型，并运用SHAP和偏差依赖算法分析了影响因素及其相互作用，以及基于多模态AOD的PM2.5估算的区域差异。结果表明，基于AODf的PM2.5估算精度略高于基于AOD的估算；PM2.5浓度在2001年至2013年呈上升趋势，之后有所下降；季节差异显著，冬季浓度最高，夏季最低；主要影响因素包括AODf、相对湿度、2米温度和总蒸发量；区域差异明显，西部地区粗模态气溶胶占主导地位，限制了AODf估算的精度，而东部地区细模态气溶胶作用更大。该研究对深入了解PM2.5变化规律，制定因地制宜的空气污染控制政策具有重要意义。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据（AOD和AODf）进行大气成分（PM2.5）分析，并应用于空气质量监测。,"['PM2.5', 'Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)', 'Fine-mode Aerosol Optical Depth (AODf)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Satellite Observation', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis', 'Remote Sensing']",Cheng Wan;Haifeng Xu;Wenhui Luo;Jinji Ma;Zhengqiang Li,Estimation of regional PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in China based on fine-mode aerosol optical thickness (AODf) and study of influencing factors,"•Using AODf data instead of AOD data for PM2.5estimation in Chinese regions will improve the estimation accuracy to some extent. •Quantitatively analyzed the influence and synergistic effect of multiple factors on PM2.5. •The variability of PM2.5estimation by different modal aerosols was comparatively analyzed. 
 In recent years, rapid industrialization and urbanization in China have resulted in severe air pollution, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) being a major issue. PM2.5 estimation typically relies on aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, while PM2.5 is primarily composed of fine-mode aerosols, better represented by fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AODf). This study constructed PM2.5 estimation models using both AODf and AOD data to obtain long-term PM2.5 concentration datasets for China. SHAP and biased dependence algorithms were applied to analyze influencing factors and interactions, along with regional differences in PM2.5 estimation based on multimodal AOD. The results indicate that AODf-based PM2.5 estimation slightly improves accuracy compared to AOD. PM2.5 concentrations showed an increasing trend from 2001 to 2013, peaking during this period, followed by a decline after 2013. Seasonally, the highest concentration was observed in winter (64.49 ± 19.8 μg/m³), followed by spring and autumn, with the lowest in summer (33.07 ± 8.8 μg/m³). The main influencing factors include AODf (26.97%), relative humidity (14.33%), 2m temperature (10.75%), and total evaporation (9.93%). Regional differences are evident: in the west, coarse-mode aerosols dominate, limiting the accuracy of AODf-based estimation, while in the east, fine-mode aerosols play a larger role. Furthermore, the continued decline in PM2.5 is attributed to the decreasing proportion of fine-mode aerosols. This study is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the changing pattern of PM2.5 and the formulation of air pollution control policies according to local conditions."

 In this study, the observation site Himalayan Cloud Observatory is located at the high-altitude location (30.34 N, 78.40 E, 1706 m above mean sea level) and established at Swami Ram Tirth Campus, Badshahithaul, Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand in the western Himalaya. We have identified and characterized the new particle formation events for 12-months period (January to December 2021) of continuous monitoring of the aerosol size distribution using NanoScan Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer. We have observed 51 new particle formation events out of 278 days of observations having 14 % frequency of new particle formation occurrence. New particle formation events were most frequent in March-April-May (pre-monsoon) and least frequent in June-July-August-September (monsoon). This trend is linked to high temperatures, strong solar radiation, and low relative humidity in pre-monsoon, which enhance the formation of low-volatility organic compounds, while in monsoon, wet scavenging reduces aerosol precursor gases. The seasonal mean of growth rate (GR11.5-27.4 nm), formation rate (J11.5), coagulation sink (CoagS11.5-27.4) and condensation sink (CSTOT, 11.5-154 nm) during the study period were 1.27 ± 0.23 nm h-1, 0.12 ± 0.08 cm-3 s-1, 2.92 ± 1.65 × 10-5 s-1 and 9.91 ± 3.13 × 10-3 s-1 respectively. Seasonal distributions show particles within 11.5–100 nm predominantly originate from secondary emissions, while particles 100–154 nm result from both direct and nucleated process, highlighting the seasonal sources of particles at Himalayan Cloud Observatory. A significant reduction (by 25 %) found in incoming solar radiation on non-event days limits the oxidation of precursor gases, thereby inhibiting particle formation. Polar bivariate analysis reveals that winter airmasses, transported via mountain winds from the southwest and northeast, introduce mixed particle sizes. In contrast, the localized concentration of particles with elevated GR11.5-27.4 nm and J11.5 during pre-monsoon highlights the role of aerosol precursors, condensable vapours, and favorable meteorological conditions, emphasizing new particle formation as the dominant particle source. Comparison with prior cloud condensation nuclei study at Himalayan Cloud Observatory reveals that new particle formation significantly supplements cloud condensation nuclei production beyond primary emissions, especially in pre-monsoon. The satellite-based observation of sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde complement and support the condensable vapours during event days at Himalayan Cloud Observatory. In summary, this research offers fresh perspectives on the characterization of new particle formation events in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand. These insights are crucial for comprehending secondary aerosol formation processes worldwide, particularly at the process level."

Satellite-based dust estimates are often overestimated because dust and cloud measurements can be confused. Illustrations are given with an emphasis on the flawed claim that a classic indicator of dust (negative brightness temperature differences) is proof of the presence of airborne Arctic dust. Low-altitude warm-water plumes are the likely source of such negative values. 
 Remote-sensing (RS)-based estimates of Arctic dust are oftentimes overestimated due to a failure in separating out the dust contribution from that of spatially homogeneous clouds or low-altitude cloud-like plumes. A variety of illustrations are given with a particular emphasis on questionable claims of using brightness temperature differences (BTDs) as a signature indicator of Arctic dust transported from mid-latitude deserts or generated by local Arctic sources. While there is little dispute about the presence of both Asian and local dust across the Arctic, the direct RS detectability of airborne dust, as ascribed to satellite (MODIS and AVHRR) measurements of significantly negative brightness temperature differences at 11 and 12 µm (BTD11–12), has been misrepresented in certain cases. While it is difficult to account for all examples of strongly negative BTD11–12 values in the Arctic, it is unlikely that airborne dust plays a significant role. One much more likely contributor would be water clouds in the Arctic inversion layer.The RS detectability of the impact of Arctic dust (notably due to Arctic dust from local sources) can, however, be of significance. Sustained dust deposition can substantially decrease (visible to shortwave IR) snow and ice reflectance albedo (pan-chromatic reflectance) and the signal measured by satellite sensors. Significantly negative BTD11–12 values would, however, only represent a limited area near the drainage basin sources according to our event-level case studies. The enhanced ice-nucleating particle (INP) role of local Arctic dust can, for example, induce significant changes in the properties of low-level mixed-phase clouds (cloud optical depth changes <∼ 1) that can readily be detected by active and passive RS instruments. It is critical that the distinction between the RS detectability of airborne Arctic dust versus the RS detectability of the impacts of that dust be understood if we are to appropriately parameterize, for example, the radiative forcing influence of dust in this climate-sensitive region."

Diskin,Widespread trace bromine and iodine in remote tropospheric non-sea-salt aerosols,"Using single-particle mass spectrometry, we show that trace concentrations of bromine and iodine are ubiquitous in remote tropospheric aerosol and suggest that aerosols are an important part of the global reactive iodine budget. Comparisons to a global climate model with detailed iodine chemistry are favorable in the background atmosphere; however, the model cannot replicate our measurements near the ocean surface, in biomass burning plumes, and in the stratosphere. 
 Reactive halogens catalytically destroy O3 and therefore affect (1) stratospheric O3 depletion and (2) the oxidative capacity of the troposphere. Reactive halogens also partition into the aerosol phase, but what governs halogen-aerosol partitioning is poorly constrained in models. In this work, we present global-scale measurements of non-sea-salt aerosol (nSSA) bromine and iodine taken during the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom). Using the Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry instrument, we found that bromine and iodine are present in 8 %–26 % (interquartile range, IQR) and 12 %–44 % (IQR) of accumulation-mode nSSA, respectively. Despite being commonly found in nSSA, the concentrations of bromine and iodine in nSSA were low but potentially important, at 0.11–0.57 pmol mol−1 (IQR) and 0.04–0.24 pmol mol−1 (IQR), respectively. In the troposphere, we find two distinct sources of bromine and iodine for nSSA: (1) a primary source from biomass burning and (2) a pervasive secondary source. In the stratosphere, nSSA bromine and iodine concentrations increased with increasing O3 concentrations; however, higher concentrations of stratospheric nSSA bromine and iodine were found in organic-rich particles that originated in the troposphere. Finally, we compared our ATom nSSA iodine measurements to the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System); nSSA bromine concentrations could not be compared because they were not tracked in the model. We found that the model compared well to our ATom nSSA iodine measurements in the background atmosphere but not in the marine boundary layer, biomass burning plumes, or stratosphere."

However, many important ROC compounds in the atmosphere are difficult to measure. We demonstrate measurement of diverse ROC compounds in a single instrument at a forested site. This approach can improve our ability to measure a broad range of atmospheric ROC. 
 Reactive organic carbon (ROC) is diverse in its speciation, functionalization, and volatility, with varying implications for ozone production and secondary organic aerosol formation and growth. Chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) approaches can provide in situ ROC observations, and the CIMS reagent ion controls the detectable ROC species. To expand the range of detectable ROC, we describe a method for switching between the reagent ions NH4+ and H3O+ in a Vocus chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Vocus-CI-ToFMS). We describe optimization of ion–molecule reactor conditions for both reagent ions, at the same temperature, and compare the ability of NH4+ and H3O+ to detect a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds (SVOCs and IVOCs), including oxygenates and organic sulfur compounds. Sensitivities are comparable to other similar instruments (up to ∼5 counts s−1 pptv-1), with detection limits on the order of 1–10 s of pptv (1 s integration time). We report a method for characterizing and filtering periods of hysteresis following each reagent ion switch and compare use of reagent ions, persistent ambient ions, and a deuterated internal standard for diagnosing this hysteresis. We deploy NH4+/H3O+  reagent ion switching in a rural pine forest in central Colorado, US, and use our ambient measurements to compare the capabilities of NH4+ and H3O+ in the same instrument, without interferences from variation in instrument and inlet designs. We find that H3O+ optimally detects reduced ROC species with high volatility, while NH4+ improves detection of functionalized ROC compounds, including organic nitrates and oxygenated SVOCs and IVOCs that are readily fragmented by H3O+."

Gijsbert Tilstra;J. Pepijn Veefkind,Improvements in aerosol layer height retrievals from TROPOMI oxygen A-band measurements by surface albedo fitting in optimal estimation,"The TROPOMI aerosol layer height is constantly being improved since its release in 2019. Over land, the ALH was too low (closer to the surface than expected), especially over bright scenes. This paper describes the latest improvements of the product, especially the treatment of the surface albedo over land. The results are compared with space-based aerosol profiles for a set of situations, ranging from multiple layers of smoke, thick desert dust plumes and low-altitude industrial pollution. 
 The Aerosol Layer Height (ALH), from the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI L2__AER_LH product, is based on an optimal estimation (OE) approach, fitting cloud-free measurements to synthetic reflectances in the strongest oxygen absorption band, provided by a neural network trained with high resolution simulated reflectances. The ALH has been continuously improved since its release in 2019, focusing especially on (bright) land surfaces, over which the ALH product showed underestimated aerosol layer heights (biased towards the surface). This paper describes the latest updates of the ALH product, that includes first the introduction of the Directional Lambertian-Equivalent Reflectance (DLER) climatology to improve the surface albedo characterisation over land. Second, the paper describes a further improvement, adding the surface albedo in the feature vector of the OE inversion, using the DLER as prior information. Using this approach, the retrievals over land largely match the retrievals over ocean, which have shown a good comparison with validation data since its release, most notably with CALIOP weighted extinction heights. The albedo is fitted for both land and ocean surfaces, but the implementation is different over land and ocean because of the large range of land surface albedos. Over land, the a priori surface albedo values are relaxed so the fitting procedure can incorporate the albedo effects in the retrieval over land. Over ocean, the retrievals are optimised by tuning the a priori error settings. The current implementation improves retrievals over land with about 1.5 times more converged results, and decreases land-ocean contrasts in the aerosol layer height retrievals. The average difference between CALIOP weighted extinction height decreased for selected cases from about −1.9 km to −0.9 km over land and from around −0.8 km to +0.1 km over ocean."

MIDAS is developed at Environment and Climate Change Canada for both operational and research applications, including all atmospheric data assimilation (DA) elements of the Canadian operational numerical weather prediction systems. The described version of MIDAS is part of the Canadian prediction systems that became operational in June 2024. The software is designed to be sufficiently general to enable other DA applications, including atmospheric constituents (e.g. ozone), sea ice, and sea surface temperature. In addition to describing the current MIDAS applications, a sample of the results from these systems is presented to demonstrate their performance in comparison with either systems from before the switch to using MIDAS software or similar systems at other numerical weather prediction (NWP) centres. The modular software design also allows the code that implements high-level components (e.g. observation operators, error covariance matrices, state vectors) to easily be used in many different ways depending on the application, such as for both variational and ensemble DA algorithms, for estimating the observation impact on short-term forecasts, and for performing various observation pre-processing procedures. The use of a single common DA software package for multiple components of the Earth system provides both practical and scientific benefits, including the facilitation of future research on DA approaches that explicitly include the coupled connections between multiple Earth system components. To this end, work is currently underway to allow the use of MIDAS DA algorithms for initializing both deterministic and ensemble three-dimensional ocean model forecasts."

However, models including chemistry are very slow. Hence, any computation speedup of such models is important for advancing the understanding of interactions within the Earth System. In this study we analysed and optimized the time stepping for chemistry calculations. Our results show that atmospheric chemistry models could be run notably faster without any loss in the accuracy. 
 Numerical integration of multiphase chemical kinetics in atmospheric models is challenging. The underlying system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is stiff and thus difficult to solve. Rosenbrock solvers are a popular choice for such tasks. These solvers provide the desired stability and accuracy of results at an affordable yet large computational cost. The latter is crucially dependent on the efficiency of the step size control. Our analysis indicates that the local error, which is the key factor for the step size selection, is often overestimated, leading to very small sub-steps. In this study, we optimized the first-order step size controller most commonly employed in Rosenbrock solvers. Furthermore, we compared its efficiency to a second-order step size controller. We assessed the performance of the controllers in both a box and a global model for very stiff ODEs. Significant reductions of the computation time were accomplished with only marginal deviations in the results compared to the standard first-order controller. This was achieved not only for gas-phase chemistry but also for the more complex aqueous-phase chemistry in cloud droplets and deliquescent aerosols. Depending on the selected chemical mechanism, significant improvements were already achieved by simply adjusting heuristic parameters of the default controller. However, especially for the global model, the best results were achieved with the second-order controller, which reduced the number of function evaluations by 43 %, 27 % and 16 % for gas-phase, cloud and aerosol chemistry, respectively. The overall computational time was reduced by over 11 % while requiring only minimal adjustments to the original code. Analysis of a 1-year integration period showed that with the second-order controller, the deviations from the reference simulation stays below 1 % for the main tropospheric oxidants. The results presented here show the possibility of more efficient atmospheric chemistry simulations without compromising accuracy."

Herein, Ru supported on SnO2 (Ru/SnO2) was prepared with the lattice matching principle. As RuO2 and SnO2 are both rutile phases, Ru species were present as highly dispersed RuO2 particles on the Ru/SnO2 catalyst. These particles adsorbed chlorine species with greater efficiency during the CVOCs combustion, thereby protecting the oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the double sites, oxygen vacancy to oxidize and RuO2 to adsorb chlorine species, on the Ru/SnO2 catalyst led to a notable enhancement in activity, stability, and byproduct selectivity. In contrast, the high dispersion of Ru species on the CeO2 support, as the typical catalyst for chlorinated hydrocarbon combustion, gave rise to a predominantly Ru–O–Ce structure. This structure did not prevent the adsorption of chlorine species on the oxygen vacancies, resulting in deactivation at low temperatures and an increased polychlorinated byproduct concentration. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) further corroborated the variation in the adsorption sites of chlorine species on the two catalysts. This work provides a new strategy for designing efficient Ru-based catalysts for catalytic CVOCs combustion."

In contrast, rivers flowing across seasonally frozen ground exhibited a decline in migration rate by 11.1%, driven by vegetation greening and riverbank stabilization.

Integrating late spring frost into models can increase the accuracy of predictions of spring timings and carbon cycling. 
 Under climate warming, earlier spring phenology has heightened the risk of late spring frost (LSF) damage. However, the intricate interplay among LSF, spring phenology and photosynthetic carbon uptake remains poorly understood. Using 286,000 ground phenological records involving 870 tree species and remote-sensing data across the Northern Hemisphere, we show that LSF occurrence in a given year reduces photosynthetic productivity by 13.6%, resulting in a delay in spring phenology by ~7.0 days in the subsequent year. Our experimental evidence, along with simulations using modified process-based phenology models, further supports this finding. This frost-induced delay in spring phenology subsequently leads to a decrease in photosynthetic productivity during the next year following an LSF event. Therefore, it is essential to integrate this frost-induced delay in spring phenology into current Earth system models to ensure accurate predictions of the impacts of climate extremes on terrestrial carbon cycling under future climate change.

 Forest cover in Guangdong Province, southern China, has doubled over the last four decades. A large proportion of these forests consists of young planted forests (PFs), which have significant potential as carbon sinks. Yet given the declining carbon accumulation rates as forests mature and limited land for further planting, how best to manage these forests to maximize their future carbon uptake remains poorly studied. Here we employed fine-resolution satellite data, forest growth models, and machine learning to identify key drivers of carbon accumulation. Terrain variables were identified as the most important drivers, followed by climate conditions and soil nutrients. We further assessed the carbon sink potential under five forest management scenarios, each involving different harvest and regeneration strategies. Our results indicate that under the optimal scenario with the highest carbon sink potential, harvesting PFs over a 20-year period and progressively replanting each year could yield a potential carbon stock of 0.53 ± 0.01 PgC by 2060, without expanding forest cover. This represents 2.5 times greater than the baseline scenario, where all PFs and are simply preserved. Our findings suggest that a progressive management approach with a well-planned rotation period could significantly enhance carbon sequestration in planted forests.

 This study presents a novel approach for identifying natural dust source regions, utilizing a combination of satellite and ground-based measurements. Unlike previous methods that relied solely on either satellite-derived land-cover characteristics or surface dust observations, this new method harmoniously integrates both. Its strength lies in accurately identifying natural dust source regions and their spatio-temporal variations by reflecting the satellite-based land-cover characteristics, ground vegetation, and snow-cover conditions obtained from natural dust source regions. Vegetation bareness index (B) and snow coverage index (S) were defined to represent the ground conditions, and their threshold values were determined by statistically combining satellite-derived data and ground dust detection records. A comparison of the new method against previous methods in identifying natural dust source regions in East Asia showed that the new method could accurately identify major dust source regions spanning the Tibetan Plateau, inner Mongolia, and the Horqin Desert in northeastern China, along with parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. In contrast, previous satellite-based methods either significantly underestimated the dust source regions, including only the Gobi and Taklimakan deserts, or overestimated by broadly covering the East Asian regions. The new method also proved superior in detecting monthly variation of the East Asian dust source regions due to short vegetation. The findings indicate that this new method effectively overcomes the limitations of previous methods, suggesting being beneficial in natural dust modeling through an accurate representation of natural dust source regions."

 The study examined sensitivity analysis of aerosol optical and radiative properties due to different versions of SKYRAD.pack module (i.e. versions 4.2 and 5.0) along with stability and performance of sky radiometer instruments (POM-01), operating at Hanle, Leh and Merak, located at high-altitude background sites in the most climate sensitive Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The study utilized long-term aerosol measurements during 2008–2024 for examining the stability and performance of the instruments. As a part of sensitivity analysis, coarse-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found to be higher at version 4.2, while fine-mode AOD showed higher at version 5.0, but interestingly the variation of total AOD was found to be insignificant. Further, single scattering albedo (SSA) at version 5.0 was overestimated from 4.2 version. Among the parameters, aerosol asymmetry parameter (AS) showed significantly larger difference between the two versions with overestimation at 4.2 version. Such large differences of AS may be attributed to variations in aerosol radiative forcing parameters. Further, variation of ±2% calibration constants (F0I) in the sensitivity analysis showed significant variation in the retrieval parameters. Aerosol volume size distribution at three sites showed dominantly tri-modal pattern at version 4.2, while version 5.0 showed dominance of bi-modal distribution, which may be attributed from significant variation of AS between the two versions. These findings highlighted the importance of performing calibration procedures frequently to ensure the quality controlled data at background sites in particular, and sensitivity analysis for aerosol retrieval parameters in different versions of the SKYRAD.pack software tool."

This study leverages inter-basin/region teleconnectivity (IB(R)T) analysis to unveil the key teleconnected regions responsible for the connection between autumn Arctic temperature and tropical sea surface temperature (SST). A robust positive correlation is identified between North American Arctic (NAA) temperatures and North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) SST, with the NTA SST leading by one season. Observational evidence reveals that western Pacific (WP) subtropical high (WPSH) and SST play an intermediary role in this cross-seasonal tropical-Arctic connection. Summertime NTA warming triggers an intensification of the WPSH, subsequently inducing autumnal warming of WP SST via inter-basin interactions. This intensified WP convection generates a Rossby wave train propagating from the Northern WP eastward towards the NAA, ultimately leading to an anomalous high over the NAA. The increased atmospheric thickness and air temperature enhances downward longwave radiation, further contributing to surface warming over the NAA. The linear baroclinic model experiments, forced with thermal anomalies corresponding to WP SST warming, successfully reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation response and the associated air temperature changes over the NAA. Our findings provide insights into the role of inter-basin connections in Tropical-Arctic linkages."

To address this, the present study proposes a scalable spatial decomposition method to separate spatiotemporal air pollution data into background (nationwide), intercity-scale (tens of kilometers), and neighborhood-scale (several kilometers) components. This decomposition was achieved by introducing spatially varying effective ranges for intercity-scale variability at each station, based on the correlation coefficient distance of the background-removed component. Applying this approach to hourly fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations from 535 monitoring stations across South Korea for 2021–2022, we evaluated the effectiveness of PM2.5 management policies. During the polluted cold season (December to March), the intercity-scale component contributed an average of approximately 18% of the total PM2.5 concentration in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and Central Area (CA), which are densely populated and industrialized regions. In contrast, this component helped reduce PM2.5 levels in southeastern coastal areas, where high winds facilitate dispersion. The neighborhood-scale component contributed positively to PM2.5 levels near industrial complexes and ports but negatively in residential and commercial areas. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of central government-led intercity-scale regulations on total emissions allowances in the SMA and CA and highlight the need for additional local management targeting individual point sources near industrial complexes and ports. This study provides intuitive spatial decomposition tools for understanding PM2.5 pollution across spatial scales and offers policymakers a foundation for developing multi-scale mitigation strategies."

Monitoring ambient particulate matter concentrations can provide information on potential exposures and inform mitigation strategies, but ground-based measurements are sparse. Data fusion approaches that integrate data from multiple sources can complement existing observation networks and reveal insights that single-sensor data might miss to better manage pollutant exposure risks. However, data fusion approaches face multiple challenges, including incompatible measurement units, varying data resolutions, and differing levels of uncertainty. As a result, the optimal method for data fusion remains an open question. Here, we propose a probabilistic spatiotemporal model, based on the stochastic advection–diffusion (SAD) equation, as a data fusion method to process multimodal air quality data to predict hourly concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We employ a variational inference method to calibrate the probabilistic model using ground-level observations and the numerical output of two simulation models. We then evaluate the prediction performance of our model for two scenarios: (1) incorporating simulation outputs and ground-level observations from sparse regulatory-grade stations and (2) using ground-level observations from both low-cost and regulatory-grade stations. For the first scenario, the data fusion method reduces prediction error by 14% compared to the nearest regulatory-grade air monitor located 20 km away. For the second scenario, error is reduced by 40% compared to the nearest regulatory-grade monitor and 11% compared to the nearest low-cost sensor located approximately 1 km away. The model captures 78% of observed data within a 75% confidence interval across both scenarios, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent uncertainty.

10.5194/acp-25-73-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了中国南京市冬季雾霾天气中PM2.5的分子水平特征及其来源。研究发现，生物质燃烧是导致有机碳的主要来源，并加剧了真菌孢子的排放和二次气溶胶的形成。非化石燃料来源的贡献随着雾霾污染的加重而增加，表明生物质燃烧可能是冬季雾霾事件的重要驱动因素。该研究使用了高时间分辨率的采样方法，对PM2.5中的多种组分进行了全面分析，包括有机物、硝酸盐等。结果表明，有机物是PM2.5的主要成分，其次是硝酸盐。放射性碳分析显示，化石燃料占水溶性有机碳（WSOC）的61%–82%，这可能是由于冬季取暖期间化石燃料消耗增加所致。然而，随着雾霾加重，非化石燃料来源对WSOC的贡献增加，这与生物质燃烧的加剧相吻合。生物质燃烧被认为是导致有机碳增加的主要因素。此外，生物质燃烧还可能促进其他来源的排放，例如与生物质燃烧示踪物与其他各种来源示踪物之间存在显著相关性。该研究结果突出了生物质燃烧对冬季严重雾霾的重大贡献。  研究中虽然没有直接使用卫星遥感数据，但其研究结果可以为改进大气环境遥感技术，特别是用于监测生物质燃烧和雾霾污染的卫星观测和大气成分分析模型提供重要的基础数据和科学依据。,"['PM2.5', 'Aerosol', 'Biomass Burning', 'Air Quality', 'Satellite Observation', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Haze', 'Organic Carbon', 'Secondary Aerosol', 'Winter Haze']",Mingjie Kang;Mengying Bao;Wenhuai Song;Aduburexiati Abulimiti;Changliu Wu;Fang Cao;Sönke Szidat;Yanlin Zhang,"Significant role of biomass burning in heavy haze formation in Nanjing, a megacity in China: molecular-level insights from intensive PM2.5 sampling on winter hazy days","Reports on molecular-level knowledge of high-temporal-resolution particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) on hazy days are limited. We investigated various PM2.5 species and their sources. The results show biomass burning (BB) was the main source of organic carbon. Moreover, BB enhanced fungal spore emissions and secondary aerosol formation. The contribution of non-fossil sources increased with increasing haze pollution, suggesting BB may be an important driver of haze events in winter. 
 Reports on the molecular-level characterization of primary and secondary constituents in PM2.5 at high temporal resolution, particularly during haze events, are still limited. This study employed comprehensive analytical methods to examine the molecular composition and source contributions of PM2.5, with samples collected approximately every 2 h during hazy winter days. Results show that organic matter was the predominant species, followed by nitrate (NO3-). Radiocarbon analysis of carbonaceous fractions reveals that fossil fuels account for 61 %–82 % of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), likely resulting from increased fossil fuel consumption during cold heating months. Interestingly, the contribution of non-fossil sources to WSOC enhanced with worsening haze pollution, coinciding with significantly intensified biomass burning (BB). BB was identified as the largest contributor to organic carbon (OC) in both concentration and proportion, due to intensive BB emissions in the surrounding areas, especially on heavily polluted days. For secondary sources, naphthalene-derived secondary organic carbon (SOC) contributed more to OC in PM2.5 (0.27 %–2.46 %) compared to biogenic SOC (0.05 %–1.10 %), suggesting anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as those from fossil fuel and biomass combustion, play a major role in SOC formation in urban aerosols during winter. In addition to promoting secondary aerosol formation, BB could also enhance emissions from other sources, as evidenced by significant correlations between BB tracers and various other source tracers. These findings highlight the significant role of BB in contributing to heavy winter haze."

ML can further improve the results of Bayesian interpolation, a state-of-the-art method to map RO observations. The results display improvements in horizontal and temporal domains, at heights ranging from the planetary boundary layer up to the lower stratosphere, and for all seasons. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) is a space-based remote sensing technique that measures the bending angle of GNSS signals as they traverse the Earth's atmosphere. Profiles of the microwave index of refraction can be calculated from the bending angles. High accuracy, long-term stability, and all-weather capability make this technique attractive to meteorologists and climatologists. Meteorologists routinely assimilate RO observations into numerical weather models. RO-based climatologies, however, are complicated to construct as their sampling densities are highly non-uniform and too sparse to resolve synoptic variability in the atmosphere.In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) to construct RO climatologies and compare the results of an ML construction with Bayesian interpolation (BI), a state-of-the-art method to generate maps of RO products. We develop a feed-forward neural network applied to Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-2 (COSMIC-2) RO observations and evaluate the performance of BI and ML by analysis of residuals when applied to test data. We also simulate data taken from the atmospheric analyses produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in order to test the resolving power of BI and ML. Atmospheric temperature, pressure, and water vapor are used to calculate microwave refractivity at 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, and 20 km in geopotential height, with each level representing a different dynamical regime of the atmosphere. The simulated data are the values of microwave refractivity produced by ECMWF at the geolocations of the COSMIC-2 RO constellation, which fall equatorward of 46° in latitude. The maps of refractivity produced using the neural networks better match the true maps produced by ECMWF than maps using BI. The best results are obtained when fusing BI and ML, specifically when applying ML to the post-fit residuals of BI. At the six iso-heights, we obtain post-fit residuals of 10.9, 9.1, 5.3, 1.6, 0.6, and 0.3 N units for BI and 8.7, 6.6, 3.6, 1.1, 0.3, and 0.2 N units for the fused BI&ML. These results are independent of season.The BI&ML method improves the effective horizontal resolution of the posterior longitude–latitude refractivity maps. By projecting the original and the inferred maps at 2 km in iso-height onto spherical harmonics, we find that the BI-only technique can resolve refractivity in the horizontal up to spherical harmonic degree 8, while BI&ML can resolve maps of refractivity using the same input data up to spherical harmonic degree 14."

Stettler,Ground-based contrail observations: comparisons with reanalysis weather data and contrail model simulations,"The radiative forcing due to contrails is of the same order of magnitude as aviation CO2 emissions but has a higher uncertainty. Observations are vital to improve our understanding of the contrail lifecycle, improve models, and measure the effect of mitigation action. Here, we use ground-based cameras combined with flight telemetry to track visible contrails and measure their lifetime and width. We evaluate model predictions and demonstrate the capability of this approach. 
 Observations of contrails are vital for improving our understanding of the contrail formation and life cycle, informing models, and assessing mitigation strategies. Here, we developed a methodology that utilises ground-based cameras for tracking and analysing young contrails (< 35 min) formed under clear-sky conditions, comparing these observations against reanalysis meteorology and simulations from the contrail cirrus prediction model (CoCiP) with actual flight trajectories. Our observations consist of 14 h of video footage recorded over 5 different days in Central London, capturing 1582 flight waypoints from 281 flights. The simulation correctly predicted contrail formation and absence for around 75 % of these waypoints, with incorrect contrail predictions occurring at warmer temperatures than those with true-positive predictions (7.8 K vs. 12.8 K below the Schmidt–Appleman criterion threshold temperature). When evaluating contrails with observed lifetimes of at least 2 min, the simulation's correct prediction rate for contrail formation increases to over 85 %. Among all waypoints with contrail observations, 78 % of short-lived contrails (observed lifetimes < 2 min) formed under ice-subsaturated conditions, whereas 75 % of persistent contrails (observed lifetimes > 10 min) formed under ice-supersaturated conditions. On average, the simulated contrail geometric width was around 100 m smaller than the observed (visible) width over its observed lifetime, with the mean underestimation reaching up to 280 m within the first 5 min. Discrepancies between the observed and simulated contrail formation, lifetime, and width can be associated with uncertainties in reanalysis meteorology due to known model limitations and sub-grid-scale variabilities, contrail model simplifications, uncertainties in aircraft performance estimates, and observational challenges, among other possible factors. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of ground-based cameras to create essential observational and benchmark datasets for validating and improving existing weather and contrail models."

Important progress has been made in the reaction mechanisms of H2O and water resistance strategies for VOC oxidation in recent years. Despite advancements in catalytic technology, most catalysts still exhibit low activity under humid conditions, presenting a challenge in reducing the adverse effects of H2O on VOC oxidation. To develop water-resistant catalysts, understanding the mechanistic role of H2O and implementing effective water-resistance strategies with influencing factors are imperative. This Perspective systematically summarizes related research on the impact of H2O on VOC oxidation, drawing from over 390 papers published between 2013 and 2024. Five main influencing factors are proposed to clarify their effects on the role of H2O. Five inhibition/promotion mechanisms of H2O are introduced, elucidating their role in the catalytic oxidation of various VOCs. Additionally, different kinds of water resistance strategies are discussed, including the fabrication of hydrophobic materials, the design of specific structures and morphologies, and the introduction of additional elements for catalyst modification.

Forest area change alters not only the surface albedo but also heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes, which in turn modify the atmosphere's radiative, thermodynamical, and dynamical properties. These so‐called radiative forcing “adjustments” have been little examined in re‐/afforestation contexts, and many questions remain surrounding their relevance in relation to the instantaneous forcing from the surface albedo change—and whether they can affect Earth's radiative energy balance in regions remote from where the re‐/afforestation occurs. Here, we quantified biogeophysical radiative forcings and adjustments from realistically scaled re‐/afforestation in Europe at high spatial resolution and found that adjustments with high signal‐to‐noise were largely confined to only a few months and to the region of re‐/afforestation. Adjustments were dominated by perturbed low‐level clouds and rarely exceeded ±25% of the annual albedo change forcing."

Studies have found that air pollution is a potential risk factor for dementia, but the literature remains inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the association between three major air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, O3, and NO2) and cognitive impairment among the Chinese elderly population. Study participants were selected from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS) after 2005. We define cognitive impairment as a Chinese Mini‐Mental‐State Exam (CMMSE) score <24. The associations of air pollution with cognitive impairment and CMMSE score were evaluated with a logistic regression model and a linear mixed‐effect model with random intercepts, respectively. A total of 3,887 participants were enrolled in this study. Of the 2,882 participants who completed at least one follow‐up visit, 931 eventually developed cognitive impairment. In single‐pollutant models, we found that yearly average PM2.5 and NO2 as well as warm season O3, were positively associated with cognitive impairment. NO2 remained positively associated with cognitive impairment in the multi‐pollutant model. The linear mixed‐effect models revealed that warm season O3 and yearly average NO2 were significantly associated with decreased CMMSE scores. Our research has established a positive association between cognitive impairment and air pollution in China. These findings underscore the imperative for the next iteration of China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan to broaden its focus to encompass gaseous air pollutants since mitigating single air pollutant is insufficient to protect the aging population."

 Observations reveal Antarctic sea ice expansion and Southern Ocean surface cooling trends from 1979 to 2014, whereas climate models mostly simulate the opposite. Here I use historical ensemble simulations with multiple climate models to show that sea-ice natural variability enables the models to simulate an Antarctic sea ice expansion during this period under anthropogenic forcings. Along with sea-ice expansion, Southern Ocean surface and subsurface temperatures up to 50oS, as well as lower tropospheric temperatures between 60oS and 80oS, exhibit significant cooling trends, all of which are consistent with observations. Compared to the sea-ice decline scenario, Antarctic sea ice expansion brings tropical precipitation changes closer to observations. Neither the Southern Annular Mode nor the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation can fully explain the simulated Antarctic sea ice expansion over 1979–2014, while the sea-ice expansion is closely linked to surface meridional winds associated with a zonal wave 3 pattern."

 More frequent and intense heatwave events (HWEs) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) present substantial threats to the ecological and hydrological systems. However, understanding the changes in HWEs on the TP is limited, primarily from analyses at individual stations or single elements (glaciers, lakes). Here, using refined data, we quantify the heatwave magnitude by aggregating multiple indicators into a comprehensive index and explore the influence of environmental factors on the heatwave magnitude over the TP. Our findings indicate that the heatwave magnitude has significantly increased since the 21st century, especially in autumn. From 1979–2000 to 2001–2022, the heatwave magnitude hotspots migrated toward the northwestern TP, whereas the regions with the most rapid increase shifted in the opposite direction. During the inter-seasonal, from spring to winter, the migration direction of the heatwave magnitude hotspots changed from the northwest in the first 22 years (1979–2000) to the southeast in the recent 22 years (2001–2022). We also find that downward shortwave radiation plays a significant role in the spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) of the heatwave magnitude, while the trend of temperature plays a dominant role in the SSH of the trend of heatwave magnitude. Moreover, elevation is correlated with the heatwave magnitude variability. The elevation-dependence of the heatwave magnitude has become more pronounced in the recent 22 years, with a high-heatwave magnitude migrating to higher elevations. Furthermore, the difference in land cover type can also affect the intensity of the heatwave magnitude to some extent. Our findings underscore the migration patterns of the heatwave magnitude evolution around the 21st century and provide a scientific basis for understanding the interaction between environmental factors and the heatwave magnitude in different periods."

 In 2020, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread across China and the globe. In response to this severe challenge, China swiftly enforced a series of rigorous lockdown measures, significantly improving air quality. However, O3 levels increased, and their potential impact on ecosystems remains unclear. Therefore, this research systematically assessed the ecological risks from O3 during the warm season of 2020 across China and further quantified its effect on the yields of major crops. The findings revealed that during the warm season of 2020, the values of the five ecological risk indicators across China were 42.1 ± 0.5 ppb for M12, 43.0 ± 0.5 ppb for M7, 32.5 ± 1.3 ppm h for SUM06, 22.1 ± 0.7 ppm h for AOT40, and 27.2 ± 1.0 ppm h for W126.

Correspondingly, the total national yield losses were 6.61 × 107 metric tons and 1.37 × 107 metric tons, respectively. Our findings reveal that O3 posed significant harmful risks to ecosystems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) is prevalent in European and North American urban air due to the use of personal care products. China accounts for 55% of global siloxane production, yet the atmospheric concentration and sources of D5 in China remain largely unexplored. Using the Vocus mobile laboratory, here we performed high time-resolved measurements of D5 along a north-south transect (∼700 km) in eastern China. Prior to reaching the destination, Nanjing Chemical Industry Park (NCIP), D5 concentration had a low variability of minute-mean concentration (2.6 ± 1.3 pptv). Population density didn't exhibit a correlation with D5 concentration (1-min average concentration) (R2 = 0.06), whereas a significant correlation was observed between the city-scale population and D5 concentration (R2 = 0.74). Concentrated spikes in D5 concentrations (peaking at 384.8 pptv per second) were observed around NCIP, home to nearly 400 energy and chemical companies. These D5 concentrations were highly correlated with agrochemical-related dichlorobenzenes (R2 = 0.99) rather than other petrochemical-related tracers. Unlike developed countries, D5 in China's air may primarily originate from emissions released during production processes."

Barsanti,Derivation of atmospheric reaction mechanisms for volatile organic compounds by the SAPRC mechanism generation system (MechGen),"This paper describes the scientific basis for gas-phase atmospheric chemical mechanisms derived using the SAPRC mechanism generation system, MechGen. It can derive mechanisms for most organic compounds with C, H, O, or N atoms, including initial reactions of organics with OH, O3, NO3, and O3P or by photolysis, as well as the reactions of the various types of intermediates that are formed. The paper includes a description of areas of uncertainty where additional research and updates are needed. 
 This paper describes the methods that are used in the SAPRC mechanism generation system, MechGen, to estimate rate constants and derive mechanisms for gas-phase reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the lower atmosphere. Versions of this system have been used for over 20 years in the development of the SAPRC mechanisms for air quality models, but this is the first complete documentation of the scientific basis for the chemical mechanisms it derives. MechGen can be used to derive explicit gas-phase mechanisms for most compounds with C, H, O, or N atoms. Included are reactions of organic compounds with hydroxy (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals, O3, and O3P; photolysis or unimolecular reactions; and the reactions of the radicals they form in the presence of O2 and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) at lower-atmospheric temperatures and pressures. Measured or theoretically calculated rate constants and branching ratios are used when data are available, but in most cases rate constants and branching ratios are estimated using various structure–reactivity or other estimation methods. Types of reactions include initial reactions of organics with atmospheric oxidants or by photolysis; unimolecular and bimolecular reactions of carbon-centered, alkoxy, and peroxy radicals; and those of Criegee and other intermediates that are formed. This paper documents the methods, assignments, and estimates currently used to derive these reactions and provides examples of MechGen predictions. Many of the estimation methods discussed here have not been published previously, and others have not been used previously in developing comprehensive mechanisms. Our knowledge of atmospheric reactions of organic compounds rapidly and continuously evolves, and therefore mechanism generation systems such as MechGen also need to evolve to continue to represent the current state of the science. This paper points out areas where MechGen may need to be modified when the system is next updated. This paper concludes with a summary of the major areas of uncertainty where further experimental, theoretical, or mechanism development research is most needed to improve predictions of atmospheric reaction mechanisms of volatile organic compounds."

Differences are traced back to biases in ERA5 relative humidity fields. Those biases are addressed by applying a quantile mapping technique that significantly improved contrail estimation based on post-processed ERA5 data. 
 Aviation contributes to global emissions of carbon dioxide, aerosol particles, water vapor (WV), and other compounds. WV promotes the formation of condensation trails (contrails), which are known for their net warming effect on the climate. Contrail formation is often estimated using the Schmidt–Appleman criterion (SAc) together with meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis model. We compare ERA5 output of temperature and relative humidity in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere with 5 years of In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) observations over the North Atlantic. Good agreement was found for the temperature fields, with a maximum bias of −0.4 K (200 hPa level), while larger biases were found for relative humidity of up to −5.5 % (250 hPa level). Using original ERA5 data, conditions prone to contrail formation occurred 50.3 % and 7.9 % of the time for non-persistent and persistent contrails, respectively, while 44.0 % and 12.1 % were flagged in the IAGOS data. We propose a multivariate quantile mapping (QM) correction to remove systematic biases by post-processing ERA5 temperature and relative humidity fields with respect to contrail formation. The QM correction was applied to post-process ERA5 data, reducing the temperature bias to less than 0.1 K and the relative humidity bias to less than −1.5 %, resulting in 44 % and 10.9 % of the data points now being flagged for non-persistent and persistent contrail formation, respectively. Our bias correction generalizes well compared to the IAGOS observations. How it generalizes outside the IAGOS regions remains to be investigated."

Our finding suggests the BC emission factor and/or inventory could be potentially improved by using FRP. 
 Forest wildfires in interior Alaska represent an important black carbon (BC) source for the Arctic and sub-Arctic. However, BC observations in interior Alaska have not been sufficient to constrain the range of existing emissions. Here, we show our observations of BC mass concentrations and carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios in the Poker Flat Research Range (65.12° N, 147.43° W), located in central Alaska, from April 2016 to December 2020. The medians, 10th percentile ranges, and 90th percentile ranges of the hourly BC mass concentration and CO mixing ratio throughout the observation period were 13, 2.9, and 56 ng m−3 and 124.7, 98.7, and 148.3 ppb, respectively. Sporadically large peaks in the BC mass concentration and CO mixing ratio were observed at the same time, indicating influences from common sources. These BC peaks coincided with peaks at other comparative sites in Alaska, indicating large BC emissions in interior Alaska. Source estimation by FLEXPART-WRF (Flexible Particle Dispersion–Weather Research and Forecast) confirmed a contribution of boreal forest wildfires in Alaska and western Canada when high BC mass concentrations were observed. For these cases, we found a positive correlation (r=0.44) between the observed BC/ΔCO ratio and fire radiative power (FRP) observed in Alaska and Canada. This finding implies that the variability of the BC and CO emission ratio is associated with the intensity and time progress of forest wildfires and suggests that the BC emission factor and/or inventory could be potentially improved by FRP. We recommend that FRP be integrated into future bottom-up emission inventories to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of pollutants from frequently occurring forest wildfires under the rapidly changing climate in the Arctic."

In humid conditions pollen can rupture and release a large number of fine sub-pollen particles (SPPs). The paper investigates what kind of birch pollen concentrations are needed for the pollen and SPPs to start playing a noticeable role in cloud processes and alter precipitation formation. In the studied cases only the largest observed pollen concentrations were able to noticeably alter the precipitation formation. 
 Large primary bioparticles such as pollen can be abundant in the atmosphere; for example near-surface pollen concentrations above 10 000 particles per cubic metre can occur during intense pollination periods. On one hand, due to their large size (10–100 µm), pollen can act as giant cloud condensation nuclei and enhance the collision–coalescence process in clouds that leads to drizzle formation. On the other hand, in humid conditions pollen is known to rupture and release many fine particles that can increase the cloud stability by reducing the droplet size. Additionally, both whole pollen grains and the sub-pollen particles released by pollen rupture are known to act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Due to these complex interactions, the role of pollen in modulating the cloud cover and precipitation remains uncertain.We used the UCLALES-SALSA (UCLA Large-Eddy Simulation Code and Sectional Aerosol module for Large-Scale Applications) large eddy simulator for simulating birch pollen effects on liquid- and mixed-phase clouds. Our simulations show that the pollen concentrations observed during the most intense pollination seasons can locally enhance precipitation from both liquid- and mixed-phase clouds, while more commonly encountered pollen concentrations are unlikely to cause a noticeable change. The liquid precipitation enhancement depended linearly on the emitted pollen flux in both liquid- and mixed-phase clouds; however, the slope of this relationship was case-dependent. Ice nucleation happened at a relevant degree only if the process of rupturing pollen producing large number of fine ice-nucleating particles was included in the simulations. The resulting precipitation saturated for the highest INP concentrations. Secondary ice formation by rime splintering had only a minor effect in the considered 1 d timescale."

Tsimpidi;Thomas Hickler;Jos Lelieveld;Holger Tost,"Influence of land cover change on atmospheric organic gases, aerosols, and radiative effects","This study examines how land cover changes influence biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and atmospheric states. Using a coupled chemistry–climate–vegetation model, we compare present-day land cover (deforested for crops and grazing) with natural vegetation and an extreme reforestation scenario. We find that vegetation changes significantly impact global BVOC emissions and organic aerosols but have a relatively small effect on total aerosols, clouds, and radiative effects. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are emitted in large quantities from the terrestrial biosphere and play a significant role in atmospheric gaseous and aerosol compositions. Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) resulting from BVOC oxidation affect the radiation budget both directly, through the scattering and absorption of sunlight, and indirectly, by modifying cloud properties. Human activities have extensively altered natural vegetation cover, primarily by converting forests into agricultural land. In this work, a global atmospheric chemistry–climate model, coupled with a dynamic global vegetation model, was employed to study the impacts of perturbing the biosphere through human-induced land use change, thereby exploring changes in BVOC emissions and the atmospheric aerosol burden. A land use scheme was implemented to constrain tree plant functional type (PFT) cover based on land transformation fraction maps from the year 2015. Two scenarios were evaluated: (1) one comparing present-day land cover, which includes areas deforested for crops and grazing land, with potential natural vegetation (PNV) cover simulated by the model, and (2) an extreme reforestation scenario in which present-day grazing land is restored to natural vegetation levels. We find that, compared to the PNV scenario, present-day deforestation results in a 26 % reduction in BVOC emissions, which decreases the global biogenic SOA (bSOA) burden by 0.16 Tg (a decrease of 29 %), while the total organic aerosol (OA) burden decreases by 0.17 Tg (a reduction of 9 %). On the other hand, the extreme reforestation scenario, compared to present-day land cover, suggests an increase in BVOC emissions of 22 %, which increases the bSOA burden by 0.11 Tg and the total OA burden by 0.12 Tg – increases of 26 % and 6 %, respectively. For the present-day deforestation scenario, we estimate a positive total radiative effect (aerosol + cloud) of 60.4 mW m−2 (warming) relative to the natural vegetation scenario, while for the extreme reforestation scenario, we report a negative (cooling) effect of 38.2 mW m−2 relative to current vegetation cover."

Also, varying a priori data have substantial impacts on the observed NO2 columns. The a priori data from different chemical transport models resulted in differences of up to −18.3 %. Notably, diurnal patterns of observed NO2 columns are similar for all datasets, although their a priori data exhibit contrasting diurnal patterns. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), launched in 2020, provides both temporally and spatially continuous air quality data from geostationary Earth orbit (GEO). This study first investigates the seasonal variations and diurnal behavior of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tropospheric vertical column densities (TropVCDs) over the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) using GEMS data, retrieved by the IUP-UB algorithm. We find that the magnitude of the NO2 TropVCDs and their diurnal behavior have significant seasonal dependences. In January, the highest NO2 TropVCD values in the range 27.5–28.9×1015 molec.cm-2 during the four seasons were observed at 15:00 local time (LT) and NO2 TropVCD increases from the first retrieved values at 10:00 LT. On the other hand, we find the lowest values (7.4–8.8×1015 molec.cm-2) are at ∼14:00 LT in July. The VCD values in July increased up to 10:00 LT and then decreased until 14:00 LT but then began to increase again. These different diurnal behaviors of the TropVCDs in the different seasons reflect the differences in photochemical and meteorological conditions as well as the emissions of NOx. Photochemical transformations are typically more rapid in July and slower in January. The absolute values and diurnal behavior of NO2 TropVCDs are significantly influenced by the wind speed, except in July. Moderate (wind speed ≥3 m s−1) or strong wind (wind speed >5 m s−1) reduced the magnitude of the diurnal behavior in January, implying that the NO2 plumes were transported downwind. Finally, we compared the retrieved NO2 TropVCDs by using different a priori NO2 data simulated by TM5 and WRF-Chem, calculated using the most recent emission inventories. Although simulated VCDs from WRF-Chem and TM5 show differences of up to a factor 2.75, retrieved NO2 TropVCDs using each a priori data have almost identical values and diurnal behaviors, except in July. Notably, the diurnal behavior of the retrieved NO2 TropVCDs is independent of that from the two chemical transport models, indicating that observations of slant column densities are the dominant factor in determining the diurnal behavior of NO2 TropVCDs. Changes in the model horizontal resolution and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission inventory do not significantly affect the retrieved NO2 TropVCDs in this study. However, when the a priori NO2 vertical profile was fixed as the values at 13:45 LT, the diurnal patterns of NO2 TropVCDs showed significant changes, with differences of up to −18.3 %."
10.5194/amt-18-73-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了Sentinel-5P卫星搭载的TROPOMI传感器观测到的气溶胶数据中云影效应的影响。研究人员使用云影检测算法和三维辐射传输模型模拟，发现云影对气溶胶吸收指数(AAI) 的平均影响很小，接近于零。虽然云影区域的反射率在340-380nm波段显著增加（比周围区域更蓝），但传统的AAI算法能够部分自动校正这种效应。模拟结果表明，这种校正并非完美无缺，有时会产生一些小的偏差，其大小取决于云的特性。因此，研究结论认为，对TROPOMI AAI进行云影校正可能复杂且不必要。总的来说，这项研究关注的是利用卫星遥感技术监测大气气溶胶，特别是改进气溶胶数据处理算法，以提高空气质量监测的精度。,"['absorbing aerosol index', 'TROPOMI', 'Sentinel-5P', 'air quality monitoring', 'cloud shadow effect', 'radiative transfer']",Victor J.

Pier Siebesma,Cancellation of cloud shadow effects in the absorbing aerosol index retrieval algorithm of TROPOMI,"Our study investigates the impact of cloud shadows on satellite-based aerosol index measurements over Europe by TROPOMI. Using a cloud shadow detection algorithm and simulations, we found that the overall effect on the aerosol index is minimal. Interestingly, we found that cloud shadows are significantly bluer than their shadow-free surroundings, but the traditional algorithm already (partly) automatically corrects for this increased blueness. 
 Cloud shadows can be detected in the radiance measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)  on board the Sentinel-5P satellite due to its high spatial resolution and could possibly affect its air quality products. The cloud-shadow-induced signatures are, however, not always apparent and may depend on various cloud and scene parameters. Hence, the quantification of the cloud shadow impact requires the analysis of large data sets. Here we use the cloud shadow detection algorithm DARCLOS to detect cloud shadow pixels in the TROPOMI absorbing aerosol index (AAI) product over Europe during 8 months. For every shadow pixel, we automatically select cloud- and shadow-free neighbour pixels in order to estimate the cloud-shadow-induced signature. In addition, we simulate the measured cloud shadow impact on the AAI with our newly developed three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer algorithm MONKI. Both the measurements and simulations show that the average cloud shadow impact on the AAI is close to zero (0.06 and 0.16, respectively). However, the top-of-atmosphere reflectance ratio between 340 and 380 nm, which is used to compute the AAI, is significantly increased in 95 % of the shadow pixels. So, cloud shadows are bluer than surrounding non-shadow pixels. Our simulations explain that the traditional AAI formula intrinsically already corrects for this cloud shadow effect via the lower retrieved scene albedo. This cancellation of cloud shadow signatures is not always perfect, sometimes yielding second-order low and high biases in the AAI which we also successfully reproduce with our simulations. We show that the magnitude of those second-order cloud shadow effects depends on various cloud parameters which are difficult to determine for the shadows measured with TROPOMI. We conclude that a potential cloud shadow correction strategy for the TROPOMI AAI would therefore be complicated if not unnecessary."

ARMTRAJ data include ensemble run statistics that enhance consistency and serve as uncertainty metrics for air mass coordinates and state variables. ARMTRAJ will soon become a near real-time product that will accompany past, ongoing, and future ARM deployments. 
 Ground-based instruments offer unique capabilities such as detailed atmospheric, thermodynamic, cloud, and aerosol profiling at a high temporal sampling rate. The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility provides comprehensive datasets from key locations around the globe, facilitating long-term characterization and process-level understanding of clouds, aerosol, and aerosol–cloud interactions. However, as with other ground-based datasets, the fixed (Eulerian) nature of these measurements often introduces a knowledge gap in relating those observations with air-mass hysteresis. Here, we describe ARMTRAJ (https://doi.org/10.5439/2309851, Silber, 2024a; https://doi.org/10.5439/2309849, Silber, 2024b; https://doi.org/10.5439/2309850, Silber, 2024c; https://doi.org/10.5439/2309848, Silber, 2024d), a set of multipurpose trajectory datasets that helps close this gap in ARM deployments. Each dataset targets a different aspect of atmospheric research, including the analysis of surface, planetary boundary layer, distinct liquid-bearing cloud layers, and (primary) cloud decks. Trajectories are calculated using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model informed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis dataset at its highest spatial resolution (0.25°) and are initialized using ARM datasets. The trajectory datasets include information about air-mass coordinates and state variables extracted from ERA5 before and after the ARM site overpass. Ensemble runs generated for each model initialization enhance trajectory consistency, while ensemble variability serves as a valuable uncertainty metric for those reported air-mass coordinates and state variables. Following the description of dataset processing and structure, we demonstrate applications of ARMTRAJ to a case study and a few bulk analyses of observations collected during ARM's Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) field deployment. ARMTRAJ will soon become a near real-time product accompanying new ARM deployments and an augmenting product to ongoing and previous deployments, promoting reaching science goals of research relying on ARM observations."

The product reconstructed sea surface pCO2 from 1993 to 2021 using machine-learning and environmental data, capturing seasonal cycles, regional variations, and long-term trends of pCO2 for coastal carbon research. 
 Insufficient spatiotemporal coverage of observations of the surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) has hindered precise carbon cycle studies in coastal oceans and justifies the development of spatially and temporally continuous pCO2 data products. Earlier pCO2 products have difficulties in capturing the heterogeneity of regional variations and decadal trends of pCO2 in the North American Atlantic Coastal Ocean Margin (NAACOM). This study developed a regional reconstructed pCO2 product for the NAACOM (Reconstructed Coastal Acidification Database-pCO2, or ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2) using a two-step approach combining random forest regression and linear regression. The product provides monthly pCO2 data at 0.25° spatial resolution from 1993 to 2021, enabling investigation of regional spatial differences, seasonal cycles, and decadal changes in pCO2. The observation-based reconstruction was trained using Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) observations as observational values, with various satellite-derived and reanalysis environmental variables known to control sea surface pCO2 as model inputs. The product shows high accuracy during the model training, validation, and independent test phases, demonstrating robustness and a capability to accurately reconstruct pCO2 in regions or periods lacking direct observational data. Compared with all the observation samples from SOCAT, the pCO2 product yields a determination coefficient of 0.92, a root-mean-square error of 12.70 µatm, and an accumulative uncertainty of 23.25 µatm. The ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2 product demonstrates its capability to resolve seasonal cycles, regional-scale variations, and decadal trends of pCO2 along the NAACOM. This new product provides reliable pCO2 data for more precise studies of coastal carbon dynamics in the NAACOM region.

The comparison of CNSIF with tower-based SIF observations, tower-based GPP observations, MODIS GPP products, and other SIF datasets has validated CNSIF's ability to capture photosynthetic activity across different vegetation types and its potential for estimating carbon fluxes. 
 Satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) offers valuable opportunities for monitoring large-scale ecosystem functions. However, the inherent trade-off between satellite scan range and spatial resolution, along with incomplete spatial coverage and irregular temporal sampling, limits its broader application. In this study, we developed a 500-m spatial resolution monthly SIF dataset for the China region (CNSIF) from 2003 to 2022, using a data-driven deep learning approach based on high-resolution apparent reflectance and thermal infrared data. The results indicate that CNSIF effectively captures the spatial patterns of vegetation photosynthetic activity and exhibits a positive annual growth trend of 0.054. Comparisons with tower-based observations validated the ability of CNSIF to track changes in photosynthetic intensity over time across different ecosystems. Furthermore, the strong correlation (R2_2016 = 0.768, R2_2020 = 0.743; P<0.001) between CNSIF and the MODIS monthly Gross Primary Production (GPP) product demonstrates its potential for estimating carbon flux. CNSIF's higher-resolution estimation of photosynthetic activity offers a promising tool for monitoring vegetation dynamics across China and estimating fragmented agricultural production. It enables the incorporation of ecosystem fragmentation effects into earth observation and carbon cycle systems.

However, understanding the underlying chemical mechanisms still faces challenges due to the limited interpretability of the ML models. In this study, interpretable ML models were established to predict the second-order rate constants between hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and organics (k•OH). It was found that the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), the number of aromatic rings (NAR), and the number of carbon atoms of organics (NC) have important impacts on k•OH. The positive correlation between k•OH and EHOMO can be explained by the regularity of electrophilic reaction, while the relationship between k•OH and NAR and NC seems to be related with reactive sites. Furthermore, a rapid judgment method for reaction mechanism was developed based on an unsupervised learning approach which automatically divided organics into three clusters. Additionally, this methodology was applied to the reaction between organics and sulfate radicals. This study offers a rational model for predicting reaction mechanisms and provides more insights into the impact of organic structures on the reaction mechanism from the perspective of big data."

The measured fluxes from water to headspace (F) varied with water mass type, with lowest fluxes observed with Subtropical and Subantarctic waters and highest fluxes from Frontal waters. Measured DMS fluxes were consistent with fluxes calculated using a two‐layer model and seawater DMS concentrations. The MeSH:DMS flux ratio was 11%–18% across the three water mass types, confirming that MeSH may represent a significant unaccounted contribution to the atmospheric sulfur budget, with potentially important implications for marine aerosol formation and growth in models. Combining data from the ASITs and ambient surface seawater identified significant Spearman rank correlations for both dissolved DMS and MeSH with nanophytoplankton cell abundance (pvalue < 0.012), suggesting an important role for this phytoplankton size class in determining regional DMS and MeSH emissions. Applying a nanophytoplankton‐based parameterization to estimate DMSw provided good agreement with a recent DMS climatology. Consequently, the observed relationship between DMSw, MeSHw and nanophytoplankton cell abundances may be applicable for modeling atmospheric fluxes."

Buck,The Hawaii Dust Regime: Patterns and Variability in Aerosol Mineral Dust From MERRA‐2 at Station ALOHA and the Hawaii Aerosol Time‐Series,"The transport and delivery of low‐abundance, bioactive trace elements to the surface ocean by aerosol mineral dust is a major planetary control over marine primary production and hence the global carbon cycle. Variations in the concentration of atmospheric dust have established links to global climate over geologic timescales and to regional biogeographic shifts over seasonal timescales. Constraining atmospheric dust variability is thus of high value to understanding oceanographic systems, especially vast, constitutively low‐nutrient subtropical gyre ecosystems and high‐nutrient/low‐chlorophyll ecosystems where availability of the trace element iron is a dominant ecological control. Here we leverage the MERRA‐2 reanalysis product to examine over four decades of surface‐level atmospheric mineral dust concentrations in a domain of the subtropical North Pacific centered at Ocean Station ALOHA. This study region has been sampled regularly since the mid‐1980s and was the site of the Hawaii Aerosol Time‐Series (HATS) project in 2022–2023. Two unequal semi‐annual periods of elevated dust evident in the long‐term results are described and constrained. We look for evidence of shifts in total and seasonal atmospheric dust abundances or in the timing of the onset of the dominant spring/summer dusty period, finding year‐to‐year variations but little evidence for long‐term trends. We observe significant but complex relationships between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and both dust and precipitation.

 Extreme climate events have increasingly threatened global terrestrial ecosystems in recent decades. In spring 2023, Southwest China (SWC) experienced unprecedented heatwaves and droughts. Using multiple satellite-based datasets, we found that these events led to the most significant declines in gross primary productivity (GPP) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for the past two decades, with lagged effects persisting until August in the drought-affected area. Unlike the widespread and persistent drought of 2010, the record-breaking heatwaves in April and May 2023 sustained and intensified the drought stress. Elevated temperatures and suppressed precipitation, driven by anomalous atmospheric circulations, exacerbated the soil moisture (SM) shortages and increased the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), restricting water availability and carbon uptake for vegetation photosynthesis. Our findings reveal that, during the 2023 extreme event in SWC, the decreases in forest productivity were primarily driven by low SM anomalies, while the decreases in the grassland and cropland productivity mainly resulted from abnormally high VPDs. This study highlights the combined effects of low SM and high VPD anomalies caused by a compound heatwave–drought event on vegetation growth in SWC and provides valuable insights for future assessments of regional extreme climate events on vegetation growth."

 Impacts of aerosol particles on clouds, precipitation, and climate remain one of the significant uncertainties in climate change. Aerosol particles entrained at cloud top and edge can affect cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties, but the process is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the cloud microphysical responses to the entrainment of aerosol-laden air in the Pi convection-cloud chamber. Results show that cloud droplet number concentration increases and mean radius of droplets decreases, which leads to narrower droplet size distribution and smaller relative dispersion. These behaviors are generally consistent with the scenario expected from the first aerosol-cloud indirect effect for a constant liquid water content (L). However, L increases significantly in these experiments. Such enhancement of L can be understood as suppression of droplet sedimentation removal due to small droplets. Further, an increase in aerosol concentration from entrainment reduces the effective radius and ultimately increases cloud optical thickness and cloud albedo, making the clouds brighter. These findings are of relevance to the entrainment interface at stratocumulus cloud top, where modeling studies have suggested sedimentation plays a strong role in regulating L. Therefore, the results provide insights into the impacts of entrainment of aerosol-laden air on cloud, precipitation, and climate."

 Fossil methane, a key component of the atmospheric greenhouse gas budget, is emitted by fugitive leaks from petroleum industry activities and natural geologic seepage. Since the gas from these two sources can exhibit similar isotopic compositions, differentiating them using atmospheric observations is often challenging. Here, we provide a conceptual model that helps distinguish the two sources. Using molecular and isotopic data from global seep and reservoir gas inventories, and new seep analyses from major hydrocarbon-bearing basins in California, we identify six post-genetic changes in gas chemistry. These changes include alterations of molecular ratios among alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) and 13C enrichment of propane and carbon dioxide due to oxidation and secondary methanogenesis. Such changes are typical of seepage, and do not occur in deep reservoir gas that may leak during extraction and transport. Our model can aid in source attribution of fossil gas analyzed in airborne or field surveys and serve as a foundation for future work on regional emissions of natural gas.

 A high-resolution carbon dioxide emission inventory is essential for accurate carbon emission assessment and management. This study used a top-down spatial proxy model to develop a high-resolution (1 km) carbon dioxide emission inventory for East Asia from 2012 to 2021. Combining multiple data sources with geographically weighted regressions can improve the accuracy of the spatial distribution of sectors within carbon dioxide inventories. To demonstrate accuracy, we compared our inventory with existing carbon dioxide inventories, such as the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China, which uses a ‘bottom-up’ approach. We outline and discuss the convergence and divergence in the estimation results of the different approaches, finding generally consistent results. Based on the high-resolution carbon dioxide grid, nationally, China accounted for over 80% of East Asia’s carbon dioxide emissions, followed by Japan and South Korea. The results of the hotspot and driver analyses reveal persistent hotspots in Northern and Eastern China, as well as new trends in Northwestern China. The main drivers of emissions growth in hotspots are economic growth and changes in the energy mix. The drivers of emission changes in cold hotspot regions vary depending on regional characteristics. Actionable insights are provided for targeted regional carbon reduction strategies.

 Quantitative vegetation structural parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and leaf inclination angle (LIA) are important for controlling biophysical processes, such as carbon dynamics and transpiration. The generation of remote sensing vegetation structural products using geostationary satellite data may allow for near real-time monitoring of vegetation change and associated biophysical processes. However, operational algorithms for retrieving the vegetation structure from geostationary satellite imagery are rare. Herein we developed a bidirectional model of reflectance and difference vegetation index (DVI) which requires LAI and other vegetation parameters as inputs, allowing these parameters to be estimated via an optimization scheme. The developed radiative transfer model specifically considers the high-frequency and multi-angle features of geostationary satellite data to separate the sun-angle related variables from the sun-angle independent variables. This parameterization facilitates the retrieval of vegetation structural products by reducing the number of variables while maintaining the generality of the model. The inversion of this physical radiative transfer model produced daily LAI and FVC with a spatial resolution of 1 km from the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of Himawari-8 high-frequency observations for Australia. In contrast to most other readily available LAI products, this approach to generating Himawari-8 LAI did not rely on MODIS LAI or land cover data. Compared with field-measured data, the RMSE of Himawari-8 LAI was 1.009 and the bias was −0.354, and for FVC the RMSE was 0.132 and the bias was −0.014; these were more accurate than MODIS LAI and GLASS LAI, and GEOV3 FVC, respectively. The intercomparison of these products showed that the Himawari-8 LAI and FVC products performed well having realistic spatio-temporal distributions. For the first time, a mean leaf inclination angle (MLIA) product was generated only using satellite data. Similarity was found between the spatial patterns of MLIA and the land cover map over Australia. Independent validation data showed that the uncertainty of MLIA was generally less than 10°. The high-frequency nature of geostationary satellite imagery coupled with the radiative transfer model developed herein enables the derived vegetation structural products to facilitate improved monitoring of both short-term (i.e., daily to weekly) and long-term (i.e., seasonal to annual) vegetation dynamics."

 The presence and variability of clouds have a significant effect on surface solar radiation (SSR). The range of cloud products currently available for SSR estimation vary in spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. Since the effect of different cloud products on the accuracy of SSR estimation has not been adequately quantified in existing studies, this study evaluates the performance of four cloud products (Himawari-8, ISCCP, CERES, and MERRA-2) in estimating SSR and analyzes them in comparison with the MODIS cloud product. The accuracy of SSR estimation of the four cloud products is verified using measured data from BSRN and CERN ground-based observatories. The results show that Himawari-8 has the best performance with R-squared (R2) values of 0.94 and 0.74 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 71.03 W/m2 and 141.36 W/m2 on the sub-daily scales at the BSRN and CERN sites, respectively. CERES and ISCCP have similar performances, but they vary by site and month. While MERRA-2 grossly underestimates SSR, probably related to misclassification of clear skies as cloudy and overestimation of cloud optical thickness under cloudy conditions. Compared to MODIS, Himawari-8 provides better agreement with MODIS results in cloud classification and cloud phase identification, while CERES provides better agreement with MODIS results in cloud optical thickness. Overall, Himawari-8 performs best in SSR estimation. This comprehensive assessment not only highlights the crucial role of cloud observations on SSR estimations but also details the strengths and weaknesses of each cloud product in enhancing the understanding of solar radiation dynamics."

 Short-term ambient ozone (O3) exposure is widely linked to heightened mortality risk, while its effects on life expectancy remain largely unstudied. This multi-city time-series study aims to assess the potential gain in life expectancy (PGLE) from reduced O3 concentrations in eastern China. Generalized additive model was applied to quantify city-specific effects of short-term O3 exposure on years of life lost (YLL), and associations at the provincial level were pooled through random-effects meta-analysis. By assuming that daily O3 level met the World Health Organization air quality guideline 2021 (WHO AQG 2021) and interim target 2 (IT-2), we estimated PGLE and attributable fraction (AF) of YLL on the basis of counterfactual analysis. Approximately 1.9 million nonaccidental deaths were included in the analysis. We observed a pooled estimate of 0.44% (95% confidence interval: 0.36%, 0.52%) in excess risk and 0.56 (0.39, 0.72) years increase in YLL (per million population) for each 10-μg/m3 rise in 2-day moving average O3. By reducing daily O3 concentrations to WHO IT-2 and WHO AQG 2021, we estimated that 0.13 million (AF = 0.56%) and 0.22 million (AF = 0.97%) years of YLL could be avoided per million population, equivalent to the PGLE of 0.054 (0.038, 0.070) years and 0.094 (0.066, 0.121) years for each death, respectively. This study provided province-wide evidence for prolonged population life expectancy by achieving cleaner air quality for ambient O3 in eastern China, underscoring the great public health significance through implementing more stringent standards."

By upward transport in tropical regions, mercury enters into the stratosphere, but the contribution of the stratosphere to global mercury dispersion and deposition remains unknown. We find that between 5 and 50% (passing through the 400-kelvin isentropic surface and tropopause, respectively) of the mercury mass deposited on Earth’s surface is chemically processed in the lower stratosphere. Our results show the stratosphere as a unique chemical environment where elemental mercury is efficiently converted to long-lived oxidized species. Subsequent downward transport contributes substantially to the oxidized mercury burden in the troposphere. The results show that the stratosphere facilitates the global dispersion of large amounts of mercury from polluted source regions to Earth’s remote environments. We find that stratospheric transport is as important as tropospheric transport in interhemispheric mercury dispersion. Future projections suggest that expected changes in atmospheric circulation will increase the transport of mercury into the stratosphere."

Parrish;Ian C. Faloona;Richard G. Derwent,Maximum ozone concentrations in the southwestern US and Texas: implications of the growing predominance of the background contribution,"Observation-based estimates of contributions to maximum ozone (O3) concentrations show that background O3 can exceed the air quality standard of 70 ppb in the southwestern US, precluding standard attainment. Over the past 4 decades, US anthropogenic O3 has decreased by a factor of ~ 6.3, while wildfire contributions have increased, so that the background now dominates maximum concentrations, even in Los Angeles, and the occurrence of maximum O3 has shifted from the eastern to the western US. 
 We utilize a simple, observation-based model to quantitatively estimate the US anthropogenic, background and wildfire contributions to the temporal and spatial distributions of maximum ozone concentrations throughout the southwestern US, including Texas and parts of California. The very different temporal variations in the separate contributions provide the basis for this analysis: over the past 4 decades the anthropogenic contribution has decreased at an approximately exponential rate by a factor of ∼ 6.3, while the US background concentration rose significantly through the 1980s and 1990s, reached a maximum in the mid-2000s, and has since slowly decreased. We primarily analyze ozone design values (ODVs), the statistic upon which the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are based. The ODV is an extreme value statistic that quantifies the relatively rare maximum observed ozone concentrations; thus, ODV time series provide spatially and temporally resolved records of maximum ozone concentrations throughout the country. Recent contributions of US background ozone to ODVs (primarily due to transported baseline ozone) are 64–70 ppb (parts per billion) over most of the southwestern US, and wildfires (also generally considered a background contribution) add further enhancements of 2–6 ppb in southwestern US urban areas. US anthropogenic emissions from urban and industrial sectors now produce only relatively modest enhancements to ODVs (less than ∼ 6 ppb in 2020) outside of the three largest urban areas considered (Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles), where the 2020 enhancements were in the 17–30 ppb range. As a consequence, US background ozone concentrations now dominate over US anthropogenic contributions in the western US, including the Los Angeles urban basin, where the largest US ozone concentrations are observed. In the southwestern US, this predominance is so pronounced that the US background plus wildfire contributions to ODVs approach or exceed the US NAAQS threshold for ozone of 70 ppb (implemented in 2015) and 75 ppb (implemented in 2008); consequently, NAAQS achievement has been precluded in this region. The large background contribution in this region has led to a pronounced shift in the spatial distribution of maximum US ozone concentrations; once ubiquitous nearly nationwide, ODVs of 75 ppb or greater have nearly disappeared in the eastern US, but such values are still frequent in the southwestern US. By 2021, the trend in maximum ODVs in two of the more highly populated eastern urban areas (i.e., New York City and Atlanta) had decreased to the point that they were smaller than those in significantly less populated southwestern US urban areas and nearly as small as ODVs recorded at isolated rural southwestern US sites. Two implications arise from these findings. First, alternate emission control strategies may provide more effective approaches to ozone air quality improvement; as background ozone makes the dominant contribution to even the highest observed concentrations, an international effort to reduce northern midlatitude baseline ozone concentrations could be pursued, or a standard based on the anthropogenic increment above the regionally varying US background ozone concentration could be considered to provide a regionally uniform emission reduction challenge. Second, the predominant contribution of US background ozone across the southwestern US presents a profound challenge for air quality modeling, as a manifold of stratospheric and tropospheric processes occurring at small spatial scales but over hemisphere-wide distances must be accurately treated in detail to predict present and future background contributions to daily maximum ozone concentrations at local scales."

We found diametrically opposed trends in peak (decreasing) and low (increasing) ozone concentrations. Anthropogenic emissions primarily drive trends in low and peak ozone concentrations in eastern China, though meteorological effects also play a role. 
 Due to considerable reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone trends and variations in eastern China remain inadequately understood. Long-term observations of ozone precursors were conducted to explore the factors influencing ozone trends in this region. Combined with satellite and surface measurements, we evaluated the trends in low (2nd percentile), typical (50th percentile), and peak (98th percentile) ozone concentrations in detail. Observations indicate a significant decrease in peak ozone concentrations (−0.5 % yr−1), alongside an increase in low ozone concentrations (0.3 % yr−1), across eastern China during May–September from 2017 to 2022. The decline in typical ozone concentrations is notably slower than that of peak ozone concentrations, which is approximately −0.02 ppb yr−1 (−0.0 % yr−1) during the same period. Anthropogenic emissions primarily drive trends in low and peak ozone concentrations in eastern China, though meteorological effects also play a role. Ozone formation sensitivity shifts from volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited or transitional regimes in the morning (08:00–11:00 local time, LT), when ozone concentrations rise sharply, to NOx-limited regimes around peak concentrations (∼ 14:00 LT). The reduction in NOx concentrations is identified as a key factor driving the decline in peak ozone concentrations, aiming to further reduce ozone exceedance days. Thus, controlling NOx concentrations emerges as crucial for mitigating peak ozone levels. Moreover, the increase in low ozone concentrations can also be attributed to both anthropogenic emissions and meteorological factors. Our findings underscore the beneficial impacts of NOx reduction on managing peak ozone levels. Regular changes in ozone formation sensitivity throughout the day should be considered when formulating effective ozone control policies."

Carslaw,Gaps in our understanding of ice-nucleating particle sources exposed by global simulation of the UK Earth System Model,"Aerosol particles that help form ice in clouds vary in number and type around the world and with time. However, in many weather and climate models cloud ice is not linked to aerosols that are known to nucleate ice. Here we report the first steps towards representing ice-nucleating particles within the UK Earth System Model. We conclude that in addition to ice nucleation by sea spray and mineral components of soil dust, we also need to represent ice nucleation by the organic components of soils. 
 Changes in the availability of a subset of aerosol known as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) can substantially alter cloud microphysical and radiative properties. Despite very large spatial and temporal variability in INP properties, many climate models do not currently represent the link between (i) the global distribution of aerosols and INPs and (ii) primary ice production in clouds. Here we use the UK Earth System Model to simulate the global distribution of dust, marine-sourced, and black carbon INPs suitable for immersion-mode freezing of liquid cloud droplets over an annual cycle. The model captures the overall spatial and temporal distribution of measured INP concentrations, which is strongly influenced by the world's major mineral dust source regions. A negative bias in simulated versus measured INP concentrations at higher freezing temperatures points to incorrectly defined INP properties or a missing source of INPs. We find that the ability of the model to reproduce measured INP concentrations is greatly improved by representing dust as a mixture of mineralogical and organic ice-nucleating components, as present in many soils. To improve the agreement further, we define an optimized hypothetical parameterization of dust INP activity (ns(T)) as a function of temperature with a logarithmic slope of −0.175 K−1, which is much shallower than existing parameterizations (e.g. −0.35 K−1 for the K-feldspar data of Harrison et al., 2019). The results point to a globally important role for an organic component associated with mineral dust."

Antonov's rule led to the strongest reductions in the onset relative humidity of liquid–liquid phase separation and reproduced measured interfacial tensions for highly immiscible systems. A modified form of the Butler equation was able to best reproduce measured interfacial tensions in more miscible systems. 
 Atmospheric aerosol particles span orders of magnitude in size. In ultrafine particles, the energetic contributions of surfaces and interfaces to the Gibbs energy become significant and increase in importance as particle diameter decreases. For these particles, the thermodynamic equilibrium state depends on size, composition, and temperature. Various aerosol systems have been observed to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), impacting equilibrium gas–particle partitioning, modifying physicochemical properties of the particle phases, and influencing cloud droplet activation. Numerous laboratory experiments have characterized the onset relative humidity of LLPS in larger aerosol particles and macroscopic bulk systems. However, in sufficiently small particles, the interfacial tension between two liquid phases constitutes an energetic barrier that may prevent the formation of an additional liquid phase. Determining said small-size limit is a key question.We introduce a predictive droplet model based on the Aerosol Inorganic–Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients (AIOMFAC) model. This model enables size-dependent computations of surface and interfacial tension effects on bulk–surface partitioning within phase-separated and single-phase particles. We evaluate four approaches for computing interfacial tension in multicomponent droplets, including a new method introduced in this work. Of the approaches tested, Antonov's rule best matches observed liquid–liquid interfacial tensions in highly immiscible mixtures, while a modified Butler equation fits well in more miscible systems. We find that two approaches substantially lower the onset relative humidity of LLPS for the studied systems."

Fry,Development and validation of a NOx+ ratio method for the quantitative separation of inorganic and organic nitrate aerosol using CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM,"It is of increasing importance to monitor nitrate pollution that can harm ecosystems. However, commonly used aerosol monitoring equipment cannot distinguish inorganic from organic forms of nitrate, which may have different consequences for the environment. We describe a method to differentiate types of nitrates that can be applied to ambient monitoring to improve understanding of its formation and impact. 
 Particulate nitrate is a major component of ambient aerosol around the world, present in inorganic form mainly as ammonium nitrate, and also as organic nitrate. It is of increasing importance to monitor ambient particulate nitrate, a reservoir of urban nitrogen oxides that can be transported downwind and harm ecosystems. The unit-mass-resolution time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitoring equipped with capture vaporizer (CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM) is designed to quantitatively monitor ambient PM2.5 composition. In this paper, we describe a method for separating the organic and ammonium nitrate components measured by CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM based on evaluating the NO2+/NO+ ratio (NOx+ ratio). This method includes modifying the ACSM fragmentation table, time averaging, and data filtering. By using the measured NOx+ ratio of NH4NO3 and a plausible range of NOx+ ratio for organic nitrate aerosol, the measured particulate nitrate can be split into inorganic and organic fractions. Time averaging and data filtering results in a concentration limit of 0.6 μg m-3 total particulate nitrate, above which this method could be used. We show that this method is able to distinguish periods with inorganic or organic nitrate as major components at a rural site in the Netherlands. A comparison to a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer equipped with a standard vaporizer (SV-HR-ToF-AMS) shows a good correlation of particulate organic nitrate fraction between the instruments (CV/SV = 1.59; r2 = 0.92). We propose that researchers use this NOx+ ratio method for CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM to quantify the particulate organic nitrate fraction at existing monitoring sites in order to improve understanding of nitrate formation and speciation."

Hopkins,"Contrasting Summertime Trends in Vehicle Combustion Efficiency in Los Angeles, CA and Salt Lake City, UT","Policy interventions and technological advances are mitigating emissions of air pollutants from motor vehicles. As a result, vehicle fleets are expected to progressively combust fuel more efficiently, with a declining ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide (CO/CO2) in their emissions. We assess trends in traffic combustion efficiency in Los Angeles (LA) and Salt Lake City (SLC) by measuring changes in summertime on-road CO/CO2 between 2013 and 2021 using mobile observations. Our data show a reduction in CO/CO2 in LA, indicating an improvement in combustion efficiency that likely resulted from stringent regulation of CO emissions. In contrast, we observed an increase in CO/CO2 values in SLC. While slower progress in SLC compared to LA may be partially due to a later adoption of vehicle emission regulations in Utah compared to California, differing driving conditions and fleet composition may also be playing a role. This is evidenced by increased CO/CO2 in LA during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to faster driving speeds and changes to the fleet composition. Our results demonstrate the success of California’s CO-reducing policy interventions and illustrate the impacts of traffic characteristics on vehicle combustion efficiency and air pollutant emissions."

Their complex formation processes have been studied predominantly in the context of multiphase chemistry. However, the substantial contribution of gas-phase condensation of sulfuric acid (SAcond) to sulfate aerosol formation has not been fully recognized, primarily due to the challenges associated with the long-term measurement of gaseous sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Using the comprehensive data set from the SORPES station, we elucidated the influence of gaseous H2SO4 on sulfate aerosol generation across different meteorological and pollution contexts. Our analysis indicates a marked increase in gaseous H2SO4 concentrations enhances its role in sulfate formation, with cumulative five-day production accounting for up to 50% of the total sulfate levels. Detailed analysis of stable meteorological conditions revealed that SAcond initially increases and then stabilizes with higher levels of PM2.5, while its relative influence on sulfate formation diminishes. This implies that in high-polluted environments, multiphase reactions primarily drive sulfate formation.

10.1029/2024EF005256,True,Earth's Future,这篇论文研究了北半球夏季极端高温事件的并发性，及其与全球变暖、大气环流和陆面反馈之间的关系。研究发现，1950年至2023年，北半球不同区域的并发高温事件显著增加，其空间并发强度也较强。全球变暖是导致并发高温事件频率和强度长期增加的主要因素，尤其是在热带地区影响最为显著。在没有变暖趋势的情况下，并发高温事件的时空变化主要由大尺度环流控制下的高气压同时出现引起，尤其是在中纬度地区。虽然低土壤湿度通过陆气反馈增强区域高温事件，但它在单独驱动并发高温事件方面作用较小，但在与高压异常共同作用时可能有所贡献。该研究使用了统计框架来估计北半球极端高温事件的空间并发强度，并确定了其与全球变暖、大气环流和陆面反馈的关系，这与大气环境遥感技术，例如卫星观测、大气成分分析（温度、气压、土壤湿度）密切相关，可用于改进高温热浪的预测和缓解工作。,"['Atmospheric temperature', 'Atmospheric pressure', 'Land surface temperature', 'Soil moisture', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Heatwave prediction', 'Climate change']",Dalai Nasong;Sha Zhou;Kai Kornhuber;Bofu Yu,"Concurrent Heat Extremes in Relation to Global Warming, High Atmospheric Pressure and Low Soil Moisture in the Northern Hemisphere","Summer heat extremes increasingly co‐occur worldwide, posing disastrous impacts on our society and the environment. However, the spatial pattern and underlying mechanisms of concurrent heat extremes remain unclear. We used a statistical framework to estimate the spatial concurrence strength of heat extremes in the Northern Hemisphere and identified their relationships to global warming, atmospheric circulation, and land‐atmosphere feedbacks. Concurrent heat extremes over different regions have significantly increased in the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 2023. Moreover, heat extremes show strong spatial concurrence strength, and the driving factors vary geographically. Global warming is responsible for long‐term increases in the frequency and strength of concurrent heat extremes, with most pronounced impact in tropical regions. In the absence of warming trends, the temporal and spatial variations in concurrent heat extremes are mainly caused by simultaneous high atmospheric pressure controlled by large‐scale circulations, particularly in mid‐latitude regions. While low soil moisture enhances regional heat extremes through land‐atmosphere feedbacks, it plays a minor role in driving concurrent heat extremes alone but can contribute in combination with high‐pressure anomalies. Given the ever‐increasing risks of heat extremes, our study underscores the importance of identifying the mechanisms of spatially concurrent heat extremes to improve prediction and mitigation of widespread heatwaves and their adverse impacts on socio‐economic sustainability and human well‐being."

 Satellite observations provide valuable information on the rapidly increasing marine heatwaves over the Arctic Ocean, yet current assessments of these events lack reliability because the satellite-based temperature in ice-covered regions heavily relies on ice conditions. Here we compared the marine heatwaves derived from two commonly used satellite products to evaluate the potential influences of sea ice in the pan-Arctic. We found inconsistent behaviors of marine heatwaves in both mean fields and temporal variations on interannual and seasonal timescales using two datasets, which became even larger in recent years when they showed opposite tendencies over regions with higher ice concentrations (>50%). Our findings revealed our knowledge of marine heatwaves in the Arctic is facing challenges due to the large influences of sea ice and datasets that were ignored in previous studies, highlighting an urgent need for in situ observations and consistent and reliable long-time datasets for the warming Arctic.

 Deposition of aeolian (windblown) dust and sand in drylands, such as the El Paso, Texas, USA/Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico metropolitan area within the Chihuahuan Desert, impacts soils, ecosystems, human infrastructure, and air quality. We monitored dry bulk deposition using marble dust collectors (MDCOs), a passive sampler, deployed atop a university building 21m above ground level during synoptic-scale wind events in urban El Paso, for five years (2011–2016). A nearby Texas Commission on Environmental Quality air monitor continuously measured particulate matter concentrations. MDCO sediment deposition rates over five synoptic dust event seasons (October–May) averaged 111 gm−2yr−1 (range 85–164 gm−2yr−1), higher than almost all other North American sites but generally lower than Global Dust Belt locations. These deposition rate values, representing only synoptic-scale wind events, underestimate total annual aeolian deposition (augmented by convective dust events and inputs during non-windstorm conditions). Deposition rates were ∼2x those reported for rural El Paso County, suggesting urban fugitive dust enhances total dry deposition. Mean grain size of deposited sediment in all events was >50 μm (sand), even though collected ∼20 m above the height of saltation, indicating that events in El Paso can be considered “blowing sand” rather than “blowing dust.” PM10 concentrations averaged 28 μg/m3 over all collection years but 200 μg/m3 during hours dust was observed, were extremely variable, and were significantly higher during years of strong drought. PM2.5/PM10 ratios averaged 0.13–0.14 during collection periods and dust hours. PM2.5 concentrations were less strongly variable, showing the roles of dust and drought in PMcoarse in El Paso. Back trajectories during synoptic events were predominantly from the southwest and west, crossing sandy, erodible desert soils and remote-sensing-identified dust hotspots. MDCO sediments were comprised primarily of predominant Chihuahuan Desert soil minerals (quartz, feldspars, and calcite). Compared to global average aeolian deposition of major and minor elements, El Paso samples were enriched in silicon but depleted in aluminum, titanium, and manganese, as well as iron, an element with important ecological, radiative, and human health impacts. El Paso, Texas appears to be one of the dustiest/sandiest cities in North America."

 The latest Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) IMERG V07B Final Run (Hereafter IMERG) has been validated for rainfall estimates in the North West Himalayan (NWH) region during the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) season (June–September) of 2000–2022. The validation is assessed against daily 0.25o x 0.25o India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rainfall data. We found that IMERG inherently underestimates rainfall, particularly low-intensity (< 50 mm day−1) rainfall. However, an overestimation is evident in high-intensity rainfall (50 mm day−1–200 mm day−1). This is consistent across all elevation ranges, from <1000 m to >5000 m, with the most significant negative bias observed at lower elevations. The proportion of such underestimated rainfall events increases with elevation, while the proportion of overestimated rainfall events decreases. Conclusively, IMERG is negatively skewed (−0.94). The proportion of accurate estimation of rainfall intensity is low and lies between 3 mm day−1 to 21 mm day−1 for <1000 m. IMERG performs the best in classifying a ‘rain event’ in Uttarakhand (UK) and Himachal Pradesh (HP), which is evident from near-optimal values of categorical metrics like False Alarm Ratio (FAR) (0.19 and 0.30 respectively), Probability of Detection (POD) (0.86 and 0.86 respectively), and Critical Success Index (CSI) (0.71 and 0.62 respectively). The classification of a “no rain event” by IMERG exhibits relatively low accuracy in the two states (Probability of False Detection (POFD) = 0.54 and 0.65 respectively). Overall, the Accuracy (ACC) in classifying a ‘rainfall event’, irrespective of it being a ‘rain event’ or a ‘no rain event’, is fairly good in UK (ACC = 0.75) and HP (ACC = 0.67) including the estimation of ‘rain event’ (Frequency Bias Index FBI = 1.07 and 1.23 respectively). The manifestation of stratiform rainfall in UK and HP could account for the underestimation of rainfall intensity and the discrepancies in the categorical metrics, owing to them being unrecognized by satellite due to warm cloud top temperatures. IMERG estimates are moderate over Jammu and Kashmir (JK) (FAR = 0.40, ACC = 0.1, CSI = 0.53, POFD = 0.64), while a large uncertainty in the performance of IMERG exists over Ladakh (LD) due to the paucity of IMD rain gauges (FAR = 0.62, ACC = 0.49, CSI = 0.34, POFD = 0.65)."

However, our understanding of where environmental risks accumulate across the United States and how determinants of multi-hazard risk vary within the country remains incomplete. This study offers a more comprehensive understanding of the national scope and underlying drivers of compounding environmental risks from five hazards (water shortage, air pollution, wildfire, flooding, and impaired water quality) in socially vulnerable communities in the contiguous United States. By pairing census tract-level Social Vulnerability Index data from the Centers for Disease Control with hazard exposure data, we find that over 11 percent of the population—37 million people—is at high risk from multiple hazards. We find that multi-hazard risk disproportionately accumulates in the most vulnerable communities and therefore constitutes an environmental injustice. Nationally, socioeconomically vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income households and those lacking health insurance) are inequitably exposed to multiple severe hazards. However, the specific combinations of demographic and environmental drivers of risk accumulation vary across regions. While the widespread nature of environmental risk accumulation indicates that reducing multi-hazard risk will likely require comprehensive rather than piecemeal approaches, results also highlight the need for context-specific interventions."

Our findings demonstrated protracted recovery of vegetation greenness after compound drought and hot extreme (CDHE) event compared to general drought in 68% of global vegetated area. Deciduous broadleaved forest exhibited the most remarkable difference between recovery time post CDHE (13.8 ± 5.6 months) and post general drought (9.3 ± 4.7 months). We also revealed that post-event moisture condition and long-term precipitation were the chief impact factors of drought recovery time."

IASI retrievals underestimate CO, with stronger bias in the middle to upper troposphere for SOFRID and in the lower troposphere for FORLI. 
 IASI-A, IASI-B and IASI-C (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) are nadir-looking thermal-infrared sensors which have monitored the atmospheric composition since 2008. Atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) is retrieved from IASI radiances with two algorithms: the SOftware for a Fast Retrieval of IASI Data (SOFRID) and Fast Optimal Retrievals on Layers for IASI (FORLI). Airborne in situ observations from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) European research infrastructure have been used to validate IASI CO retrievals. The validation study of IASI CO data performed in 2011 with IAGOS data was limited to two airports (Frankfurt and Windhoek) and 2 years because of the limited sampling at the other IAGOS sites. The extension of the IAGOS infrastructure during the last decade has enabled validation with enough temporal sampling at 33 airports worldwide over the whole IASI-A period (2008–2019).The retrievals provide between 1.5 and 3 independent pieces of information about the CO vertical profile, and we have chosen to validate the surface–600 hPa and 600–200 hPa partial columns in addition to the total column. The ability of the retrievals to capture the CO variabilities is slightly different for the two retrieval algorithms. The correlation coefficients for the time series are generally larger for SOFRID, especially for the total and lower-tropospheric columns, meaning a better representation of the phase of the variability, while the amplitudes of the variations of FORLI are in better agreement with IAGOS in the middle to upper troposphere.On average, SOFRID and FORLI retrievals underestimate the IAGOS total column of CO (TCC) by 8 ± 16 % and 6 ± 14 %, respectively. This global TCC agreement between the algorithms hides significant vertical and geographical differences. In the lower troposphere (surface–600 hPa), the bias is larger for FORLI (−11 ± 27 %) than for SOFRID (−4 ± 24 %). In the middle to upper troposphere, the situation is reversed, with biases of −6 ± 15 % for FORLI and −11 ± 13 % for SOFRID. The largest differences between the retrievals are detected south of 13.5° S (latitude of Bangkok), where SOFRID underestimation is systematically larger for the TCC and the mid- to upper-tropospheric column. North of 40° N (latitude of Philadelphia), FORLI biases are significantly larger than SOFRID ones for the TCC and the lower-tropospheric columns. Our validation results provide users with an overview of the quality of IASI CO retrievals and developers with insights into improving the retrievals in the future."

Two alternative NZ scenarios, the balanced net zero (BNZP) and widespread innovation (WI) pathways, from the UK Climate Change Committee’s Sixth Carbon Budget, were examined using a chemical transport model (CTM). Under the UK existing policy, Business as Usual (BAU), reductions in NO2 and PM were predicted by 2030 due to new vehicle technologies but plateau by 2040. The BNZP and WI scenarios show further reductions particularly by 2040, driven by accelerated electric vehicle (EV) uptake and low-carbon heating in buildings, with the building contribution to PM reduction being 2–3 times greater than road transport. The results demonstrate that the NZ transition to EVs (cars and vans) reduces both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions, as well as reducing traffic volumes. O3 trends are complex with a small overall increase by 2030 and a decrease by 2040. Although uncertain, 2050 predictions of BNZP showed important additional air pollution benefits.

The NO2/NOx ratios are crucial for accurate NO2 modeling and are closely linked to public health concerns. In 2020, we used a mobile platform to follow test trucks (plume-chasing) that were installed with a portable emission measuring system (PEMS) on two restricted driving tracts. Six hundred eighteen exhaust plumes were collected through the PEMS-chasing measurements from seven trucks. The NOx emission factors (EFs), and the NO2/NOx ratios, were calculated at distinct stages (i.e., tailpipe and on-road). A significant reduction in NOx EFs (>64%) was observed with normal operating after-treatment devices, except for trucks equipped with diesel particulate filter (DPF). Disparities in tailpipe NO2/NOx ratios were also found, attributed to the after-treatment technologies. The NO2/NOx ratios measured from plume-chasing were significantly higher (3–4 times, p < 0.001) than the tailpipe measurements, providing field evidence of substantial NO2 formation in exhaust plumes. We developed a quantitative relationship between NO2/NOx ratios from tailpipe and plume-chasing measurements and demonstrated a robust correlation (R2 > 0.90). Since the NO2 formation in the exhaust plume is not explicitly accounted for in NO2 modeling, the quantitative relationship (O3–NO2/NOx) could improve the estimation of NO2 exposure when local emission inventory (tailpipe emissions) is available."

Although surface observations track the global and sub-hemispheric emission trends well, their sparse spatial coverage limits our ability to assess regional trends. Dense satellite observations complement surface observations, offering a valuable means to validate emission trends, especially in regions where emissions changes are substantial but debated. The uncertainty surrounding the rate of increase in fugitive coal mine emissions in China and emissions from unconventional oil and natural gas (ONG) exploration in the United States underscores the need for rigorous validation. Here, we examine the time evolution of total column dry-air mole fractions of CH4 (XCH4) during 2010–2020 by comparing observations from the GOSAT satellite with simulations from an atmospheric chemistry-transport model (ACTM). This study analyzes emissions and XCH4 trends in global totals and regions of India, China, the USA, and the global tropics. Our results suggest that GAINSv4 emission inventory overestimates the emission increase rate for the unconventional ONG sector of USA by about 3 times, while EDGARv6 inventory overestimates coal mine emissions in China. Emission increases in China and India agree with those estimated by GAINSv4. Analysis of spatially integrated XCH4 statistics (mean, 1-σ standard deviation) reveals a slight systematic underestimation of total emissions in China and bias (in both directions) in different parts of USA.

Maji;Yongtao Hu;Susan M. O’Neill;Armistead G. Russell;M. Talat Odman,The Trade-offs between Wildfires and Prescribed Fires: A Case Study for 2016 Gatlinburg Wildfires,"Prescribed burning is an effective land management tool that provides a range of benefits, including ecosystem restoration and wildfire risk reduction. However, prescribed fires, just like wildfires, introduce smoke that degrades air quality. Furthermore, while prescribed fires help manage wildfire risk, they do not eliminate the possibility of wildfires. It is therefore important to also evaluate fire and smoke impacts from wildfires that may occur after a prescribed burn. In this study, we developed a framework for understanding the air quality and health related trade-offs between wildfires and prescribed fires by simulating a set of counterfactual scenarios including wildfires, prescribed fires, and postprescribed burn wildfires. We applied this framework to the case of the Gatlinburg wildfire and found that emissions from prescribed burns and subsequent wildfire were slightly lower than those from the wildfire itself. This reduction resulted in lower daily average concentrations and exposures of PM2.5, O3, and NO2. Even considering the possibility of a postprescribed burn wildfire, prescribed fires reduced population-weighted daily average PM2.5, daily maximum 8-h average O3, and 1-h maximum NO2 concentrations. In Sevier County, Tennessee where the wildfire occurred, these reductions reached 5.28 μg/m3, 0.18 ppb, and 1.68 ppb, respectively. The prescribed fires also reduced the person-days smoke exposures from the wildfire. Our results suggest that although prescribed fires cannot eliminate the air quality impacts of wildfires, they can greatly reduce smoke exposure in downwind areas distant from the burn sites."

 Vegetation cover regulates the exchanges of energy, water and carbon between land and atmosphere. Remotely-sensed fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), a land-surface greenness measure, depends on carbon allocation to foliage while also controlling photon flux for photosynthesis. Here we use an equation with just two globally fitted parameters to describe annual maximum fAPAR as the smaller of a water-limited value transpiring a constant fraction of annual precipitation, and an energy-limited value maximizing annual plant growth. This minimalist description reproduces global greenness patterns and temporal trends in remote-sensing data, comparable to the best-performing dynamic global vegetation models. Widely observed greening is attributed principally to the influence of rising carbon dioxide on the light- and water-use efficiencies of photosynthesis; limited browning regions are attributed to drying. This research provides one key component of ecosystem function as a step towards more robust foundations for new-generation land ecosystem models.

 This research constructed an air quality ensemble forecasting model consisting of fifteen members using the China Meteorological Administration regional ensemble forecasting system (CMA_REPS) and Comprehensive Air Quality Model Extensions (CAMx) models to investigate the influence of atmospheric field uncertainty on air quality simulations. Focusing on the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022, this study examines the effects of both ground-level and vertical meteorological conditions on PM2.5 concentration distributions. The simulation accuracy of the model was validated, and its performance was analyzed. Results revealed that the ensemble mean simulations exhibit high correlation coefficients with observations for temperature (0.95), wind speed (0.80), relative humidity (0.83), and pressure (0.99). Both the control forecast and the ensemble mean for PM2.5 concentration aligned well with observations, with the ensemble mean demonstrating a strong correlation between the root mean square error and ensemble spread. In terms of reducing the false alarm rate (FAR) and improving the Bias Score (BS), the ensemble mean outperformed the control forecast. The control forecast for PM2.5 concentration was found to be more accurate at and around pollutant concentration inflection points, which may be attributed to simulation deviations in temperature and pressure that introduce uncertainty in atmospheric stability simulations. The correlation between PM2.5 and various meteorological elements varied during different periods. The vertical distribution of meteorological factors also significantly affected simulation outcomes, particularly uncertainties in simulating wind speed and inversion temperature processes, which further contributed to the uncertainty in pollutant simulations."

 Urban areas in Bangladesh have seen alarming levels of particulate matter for an extended period, posing serious threats to public health and economic stability. Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or smaller, known as PM2.5, can be inhaled by humans and cause serious respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. This study revealed spatial and temporal patterns, seasonal and regional variations, hot spots, and cold spots of PM2.5 in Bangladesh. In addition, the relationship between PM2.5 and meteorological variables was investigated. The results indicate a positive spatial autocorrelation in PM2.5 concentrations, with recent hot spots primarily clustered in the Dhaka, and western parts of the Chittagong divisions. In contrast, cold spots are observed in the Sylhet, Rangpur, and eastern parts of the Chittagong divisions. Seasonal variations revealed notably high PM2.5 concentrations during the winter season. Furthermore, annual average PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends for most divisions in Bangladesh, particularly elevated concentrations in Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna, and Chittagong. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of PM2.5 spatial distributions, clusters, and temporal patterns contributing to understanding the variation and distribution of PM2.5 concentrations across Bangladesh.

 Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a crucial variable in monitoring air quality and the study of climate change. Although considerable researches have been conducted on the cross-validation between ground-based and satellite measurements, the spatiotemporal representativeness of each measurement method during such validation process requires further investigation. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal representativeness of AOD measurements from ground-based AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) and satellites, including Terra/Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Himawari-8 AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager). Results from six typical Asian sites are considered. The annual and seasonal assessment metrics between AERONET and satellites (Terra/Aqua MODIS and Himawari-8 AHI) AOD, including R (correlation coefficient), RMB (relative mean bias), RMSE (root mean square error), and %within EE (percentage of matchups falling within the expected error envelope), show slight variations with changing spatial ranges, and the influence of the seasonal variation on the spatial representativeness has similar conclusions as well. From 10 × 10 km2 to 100 × 100 km2 (interval: 10 × 10 km2), the R, RMB, and RMSE are 0.89–0.87, 1.07–0.87, and 0.20–0.22 for Terra MODIS AOD; 0.91–0.85, 1.04–0.91, and 0.17–0.23 for Aqua MODIS AOD; 0.87–0.78, 0.77–0.83, and 0.20–0.26 for AHI AOD and the MODIS measurements have a higher %within EE than AHI AOD. These suggest that, although MODIS only measures AOD during the satellite overpass, not the temporal variations, their results show a reasonable correlation with the daily average AOD given by AERONET measurements. The diurnal fluctuations of AOD are detectable in both AERONET and AHI measurements, with AHI showing larger diurnal fluctuations (over 40 %) and annual deviations from the daily average within ±10 %. This study offers insights into the spatial representative range of AERONET measurements and the temporal/daily representative capability of satellite measurements."

 The paper investigates to what extent the assimilation of in-situ data over Gippsland, Victoria, Australia reduces uncertainties in methane emission sources on the regional scale. This was examined via a four-dimensional variational data assimilation system using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) transport-dispersion model. To evaluate the posterior error statistics of optimized monthly-mean methane emissions in Gippsland, we carried out a range of observing system simulation experiments. We ran the assimilations based on four selected months in 2019, employing a horizontal grid resolution of 2 km. The observation data are obtained based on three continuous observation instruments in the Gippsland region. As expected, the largest uncertainty reductions occur near observing sites. Also, our findings indicate that using a high-resolution model and in-situ observations provides detailed information on point sources but offers limited insight into area sources. The overall uncertainty for regional fluxes remains largely unchanged. Therefore, in-situ data is crucial for understanding point sources due to its detailed and localized nature. Finally, uncertainty reduction is much larger when the full concentration dataset is used rather than just the daytime data. This suggests the importance of model improvement to allow use of nighttime data, at least under conditions where the transport model can be expected to simulate atmospheric mixing well."

While cropland expansion is often used to counter adverse climate effects despite ecological trade-offs, the benefits for diets and nutrition remain unclear. This study quantitatively examines relationships between climate anomalies, forest loss from cropland expansion, and dietary outcomes in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. Combining high-resolution data on forest cover and climate variables within random forest and panel regression models, we find that 25 to 31% of annual forest loss is linked to climate variability. Using georeferenced household survey data, we then find that changes in forest cover have a significant positive association with changes in child diet diversity—a key proxy of nutritional adequacy—while cropland expansion does not, suggesting that such forest conversions may be an ineffective climate adaptation strategy for improving nutrition. Our findings highlight the potential of nutrition-sensitive climate adaptation to enhance yields, promote nutritious cropping choices, and protect remaining forests."

Venus currently does not operate with plate tectonics, and its thick atmosphere has led to extreme greenhouse conditions. It is unknown if this state was set primordially or if Venus was once more Earth-like. Here, we explore Venus as an example of a planet that recently transitioned between tectonic regimes. Our results show that transitions naturally lead to substantial resurfacing and melt-generated outgassing from lithosphere-breaking events and overturns, with 3 to 10 bars of atmosphere generated per overturn over ~60–million year timescales and ~10 to 100 bars outgassed over billion-year time frames.

Today, little is known about the mechanisms of foliar Hg accumulation and how climate factors and tree physiology interact to impact it. Here, we examined meteorological factors, foliar physiological traits, and Hg accumulation rates from leaf emergence to senescence in a tropical rainforest, tropical savanna, and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. Also, robust models for foliar Hg accumulation were parametrized. Generally, foliar Hg accumulation rate in subtropical evergreen forest was highest (16.4 ± 12.3 ng m–2 day–1), followed by the tropical rainforest (14.2 ± 9.8 ng m–2 day–1), and lowest in the tropical savanna (4.7 ± 4.9 ng m–2 day–1). Atmospheric relative humidity, stomatal conductance, and leaf photosynthesis are key drivers of spatial-temporal variations in foliar Hg accumulation. The canopy-structure-induced specific leaf physiological traits drive temporal variations in foliar Hg accumulation, and climate-controlled leaf physiological traits account for spatial variations among three forests. Finally, our robust models enable precise simulation of foliar Hg accumulation rates at both tree species and ecosystem scales facilitating particularly regional and global Hg transport and chemical models to quantify the vegetation’s role as a sink for atmospheric Hg0 uptake."

This study explores the impact of chemical mechanism choice on the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model performance for PM2.5 and implications for attainment demonstration in inversion-prone areas in the western United States. Total and speciated PM2.5 observations were used to evaluate wintertime CMAQ simulations using four chemical mechanisms. The study evaluated intermechanism differences in total and secondary PM2.5 and the impact of meteorology at sites with observed multiday temperature inversions. Model performance for total PM2.5 was similar across chemical mechanisms, but intermechanism differences for total and secondary PM2.5 were exacerbated during inversion periods, suggesting that modeled chemistry contributes to the model bias. Results suggest that nitrate, ammonium, and organic carbon are secondary species for which model results do not agree or perform to standard evaluation metrics in scientific literature. These findings show a need for mechanistic investigations of the causes of these differences."

To date, wildfire smoke research, risk communication, and public health action has focused on short-term (or daily) smoke exposures. However, the patterns of wildfire smoke exposure are transitioning to include longer duration and repeated exposures occurring within and across years. Epidemiologic and experimental studies represent important lines of evidence that have informed risk communication and public health actions for short-term smoke exposures; however, they have yet to provide the science needed to refine public health approaches to include other dynamic exposure durations such as repeated, episodic, or cumulative. This commentary provides an overview of methodological approaches used and recent findings from epidemiologic and experimental studies that examined longer duration, repeated smoke exposures. Based on the current science, we recommend that future epidemiologic and experimental studies of wildfire smoke examine multiple exposure metrics to capture the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposures. Such studies would improve the science produced to best support the needs of the public as we strive to further protect public health in a world projected to have more smoke."

We employ a susceptibility‐based cloud seeding strategy, previously developed under the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) to counteract the warming of CO2 doubling, in which we target the regions of the ocean most easily brightened, to determine what area extent will be required to induce 1°C cooling under SSP2‐4.5. The results indicate that cloud seeding over 5% of the ocean area is capable of achieving this goal in CESM2. Under this seeding scheme, cloud seeding is mainly deployed over lower latitudes which leads to a La Niña‐like pattern of response which is a major unintended consequence.

 Climate change poses direct and indirect threats to public health, including exacerbating air pollution. However, the influence of rising temperature on air quality remains highly uncertain in the United States, particularly under rapid reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Here, we examined the sensitivity of surface-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) to summer temperature anomalies in the contiguous US as well as their decadal changes using high-resolution datasets generated by machine learning. Our findings demonstrate that in the eastern US, stringent emission control strategies have significantly reduced the positive responses of PM2.5 and O3 to summer temperature, thereby lowering the population exposure associated with warming-induced air quality deterioration. In contrast, PM2.5 in the western US became more sensitive to temperature, highlighting the urgent need to manage and mitigate the impact of worsening wildfires.

 Tropical cyclone (TC) precipitation has led to escalating urban flooding and transportation disruptions in recent years. The volatility of the TC rain rate (RR) over short periods complicates accurate forecasting. Here, we use satellite-based observational rainfall datasets from 1998 to 2019 to calculate changes in TC 24-h RR and quantify the temporal stability of TC precipitation. We demonstrate a significant global increase in the annual temporal stability of TC RR across the total rainfall area, inner-core, and rainband areas. Specifically, the probabilities of rapid RR increase and decrease events in the TC total rainfall area decreased at rates of –1.74 ± 0.57% per decade and –2.23 ± 0.55% per decade, respectively. Based on the reanalysis dataset, we propose that the synergistic effects of increased atmospheric stability and total column water vapor—both resulting from anthropogenic warming at low latitudes—are potentially associated with this trend."

 Mexico City, a densely populated urban area, experiences multiple episodes of elevated air pollution almost every year. To mitigate the impact of these pollution episodes on the population, it is important to improve forecast systems that allow government authorities to take preventive actions, reducing the exposure of vulnerable groups. This study introduces a pilot operational ozone forecasting system based on machine learning. The proposed system is trained using historical data from a long-standing governmental air quality and atmospheric monitoring network, and with meteorological reanalysis data from a regional implementation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for Mexico. Additional input features are incorporated, including cyclical time encoding for the day of the week, time of day, and day of the year, to improve system accuracy. Once trained, the system utilizes real-time data from multiple atmospheric stations and regional meteorological forecasts to predict ozone levels for the following 24 h. This study evaluates the impact of data augmentation and the advantages of integrating meteorological forecast information into the model. The model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.81 ppb and an index of agreement of 0.91 across all stations. For the top 10 stations, the MAE falls below 8.7 ppb, and the index of agreement exceeds 0.93. The system’s performance is comparable to similar systems in other large metropolitan areas and represents an improvement over the existing systems in Mexico City.

This study has explored the changing relationship between EHHE in eastern China and tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Results show that the monopolar mode of EHHE is significantly associated with spring SST anomalies in Northwest Pacific (NWP) before the mid‐1990s, which can impact humid‐heat conditions in eastern China through an atmospheric meridional overturning circulation extending from NWP to eastern China. Then, the associated eastward shift of convection center after the mid‐1990s weakens connection between NWP SST anomalies and the monopolar mode. Further analysis reveals that the weakened Kelvin waves, induced by persistent SST anomalies from spring in tropical Indian Ocean after the mid‐1990s, cause the westward‐shifted anomalous convection in western Pacific, and then reinforce formation of the dipolar mode via exciting zonal wave trains.

Clouds respond to surface warming in ways that alter the atmosphere's ability to radiatively cool and hence form precipitation. Here we examine the links between cloud responses to warming, atmospheric radiative fluxes, and hydrological sensitivity in AMIP6 simulations. The clearest impacts come from high clouds, which reduce atmospheric radiative cooling as they rise in altitude in response to surface warming. Using cloud locking, we demonstrate that high cloud radiative changes weaken Earth's hydrological sensitivity to surface warming.

These communities are composed of lichens, bryophytes, cyanobacteria, fungi, liverworts, and other microorganisms. Creating stabilizing matrices, these microorganisms interact with soil surface minerals thereby enhancing soil quality by redistributing nutrients and reducing erosion by containment of soil particles. Climatic stressors and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the cover, abundance, and functions of these communities leading to an increase of aeolian dust, invasive plant establishment, reduction of water retention in the environment, and overall poor soil condition. Drylands are the most degraded terrestrial ecosystems on the globe and support a disproportionately large human population. Restoration of biocrust communities in semi‐arid and arid ecosystems benefits ecosystem health while decreasing dust emissions. Dust abatement can improve human health directly but also indirectly by reducing pathogenic microbe load circulating in the ambient air. We hypothesize that biocrusts not only reduce pathogen load in the air column but also inhibit the proliferation of certain pathogenic microbes in the soil. We provide a review of mechanisms by which healthy biocrusts in dryland systems may reduce soil‐borne pathogens that impact human health. Ecologically sustainable mitigation strategies of biocrust restoration will not only improve soil conditions but could also reduce human exposure to soil‐borne pathogens."

 Timely and accurate crop mapping is essential for predicting crop production, estimating water use, and informing market forecasts. However, operational crop maps are typically accessible more than four months subsequent to harvest, rather than in real-time or near real-time (NRT). Recently, in-season crop mapping has emerged by leveraging rich satellite data sources at various scales in the United States (US) Corn Belt – a prominent food-producing agricultural region dominated by corn and soybeans. However, challenges persist due to inadequate clear-sky satellite observations and the absence of field-scale in-season crop phenometrics. Recognizing that SWIR (shortwave infrared reflectance) is able to reflect the asynchronous temporal variations in plant canopy water contents and that combining phenological shift and growth magnitude can enhance the classification of crop types, this study developed two canopy Greenness and Water (GW) content indices that are GW-I, which is a ratio of the kernel NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to SWIR to distinguish phenological shift of different crops, and GW-II, which is a product of kernel NDVI and SWIR to separate growth magnitude of different crops. To reconstruct gap-free field-scale GW-I and GW-II time series, historical and timely available multi-scale satellite observations, including Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), are dynamically fused every week. The potential future GW-I and GW-II values are further predicted using a recently developed algorithm of Spatiotemporal Shape Matching Model (SSMM) and combined with the timely available time series for retrieving NRT phenometrics (greenup onset, mid-date of greenup phase, and maturity onset) every week during the crop greenup phase. Multiple Gaussian mixture models are used to independently estimate the weekly probability of corn and soybean types using three NRT crop phenometrics and the latest (≤3 days' latency) GW-II. Finally, the corn and soybean probabilities (estimated from GW-I phenometrics and GW-II crop growth magnitude together) are integrated to produce NRT corn and soybean mapping every week during the early growing season. The accuracy of NRT corn and soybean mapping is evaluated using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The result shows that our method can map corn and soybean in diverse croplands across the US Corn Belt with an overall accuracy of ∼90 % at a relatively early date (late July), although the local heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes potentially impacts the accuracy during the early stages. These findings underscore the feasibility of applying the developed method to produce near real-time corn and soybean mapping not only across the US Corn Belt but also in other countries and diverse agricultural regions."

 Mid-latitude stratus clouds with large spatial extent are important cooling engines in a warming world, while other types of clouds may accelerate warming. However, our understanding of cloud feedback in a changing climate remains incomplete in both space and time. A key factor contributing to this knowledge gap is the lack of long-term observations with spatio-temporally continuous information over large areas. Satellite data from the geostationary orbit could help in this regard, but they were never originally intended for climatological studies and, as a result, provide inconsistent data between individual satellites of different satellite generations. However, for investigations on a time scale of 30 years and more, a homogeneous dataset of gross cloud occurrence is essential to assess changes in cloud cover over the last decades. In addition, such a dataset is the basis for further analyzing long-term changes in other cloud types such as fog and low stratus (FLS). The generation of temporally homogeneous cloud information over Europe requires a dataset that is consistent in space and time. The current study develops a new cloud detection scheme based on harmonized radiances obtained by cross-calibrating Meteosat First (MFG) MVIRI (Meteosat Visible Infra-Red Imager) and Second Generation (MSG) SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager) data. The harmonized data set consists of two MFG bands (thermal infrared IR and water vapour WV), which guarantee long-term (1991–2020) availability over the full diurnal cycle (24 h). The new cloud classification scheme is based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and uses the two MFG channels as primary predictors or features. While cloud detection using only two MFG channels is a challenging task, additional features such as temporal trends in brightness temperature (BT), its spatial heterogeneity, clear sky reference BTs, topographic variables, and solar and satellite angles are also considered in the XGBoost model. The EUMETSAT CM SAF SEVIRI cloud mask based on MSG SEVIRI is used in part as the binary target variable to train the XGBoost model (cloudy/clear-sky) and as a benchmark to test the performance of the newly developed cloud detection scheme. Test results show very good agreement with the benchmark CM SAF SEVIRI cloud mask, with an average Heidke Skill Score (HSS) of 0.83 for day-time and 0.8 for night-time cloud occurrence. Further testing shows that the new cloud mask clearly outperforms the existing EUMETSAT Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) dataset based on MSG visible and IR 10.8 μm channels. In particular, the FLS detection in our cloud mask was found to be superior to the OCA during night and boreal winter. Based on the trend analysis of the generated time series of cloud frequencies, we found a general decrease in cloudiness over the last 30 years in many parts of Europe."

 Soil moisture drought poses a destructive effect on vegetation growth and water resource. Modeling event-based drought processes could serve as a pathway for better understanding how different types of soil moisture drought responds to larger-scale teleconnections in the monsoon and loess critical zone of China. Based on the daily soil moisture dataset named SMCI1.0 at top 1 m, we found that the Loess Plateau witnessed an aggravated summer soil moisture drought, with summer standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) decreasing by 1.5 % year−1 from 2000 to 2020. According to the durations and spatial coverage of events, we classified 12 summer soil moisture drought events occurring on the Loess Plateau into short-duration (6–14 days) and long-duration (≥15 days) types, and further discussed their different large-scale teleconnections. Interestingly, we found the short-duration (long-duration) summer soil moisture drought was influenced by wave train (blocking) circulation anomalies. The short-duration summer soil moisture drought broke out with an eastward “− + − +” wave train over Eurasia, which was mainly attributed to a tripolar sea surface temperature (SST) mode over the North Atlantic and weakened South Asian high (SAH) with westward shift. Such a structure resulted in water vapor deficit of Loess Plateau, and thus favored shorter summer soil moisture drought on the Loess Plateau. For the long-duration summer soil moisture drought, consistently warm tropical Atlantic and North Sea-Baltic Sea favored the “+ − +” wave train, weaking the southward movement of cold air and maintaining prolonged water vapor deficit accompanied by downward prevails, which consequently provided a favorable condition for more long-lasting and enhanced summer soil moisture deficit. Insights into the large-scale teleconnections related to the different types of soil moisture drought event not only can provide drought early warning information, but also offer a scientific guidance for revegetation projects on the Loess Plateau or other Eurasian drylands."

We use synthetic atmospheric observations of CO2 and radiocarbon (14CO2) to trace emissions to their sources, while separating the natural and fossil CO2. Our tool accurately estimates fossil CO2 emissions in densely monitored regions like western/central Europe. This approach aids in developing strategies for reducing CO2 emissions. 
 Independent estimation and verification of fossil CO2 emissions on a regional and national scale are crucial for evaluating the fossil CO2 emissions and reductions reported by countries as part of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Top-down methods, such as the assimilation of in situ and satellite observations of different tracers (e.g., CO2, CO, Δ14CO2, XCO2), have been increasingly used for this purpose. In this paper, we use the Lund University Modular Inversion Algorithm (LUMIA) to estimate fossil CO2 emissions and natural fluxes by simultaneously inverting in situ synthetic observations of CO2 and Δ14CO2 over Europe. We evaluate the inversion system by conducting a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). We find that in regions with a dense sampling network, such as western/central Europe, adding Δ14CO2 observations in an experiment where the prior fossil CO2 and biosphere fluxes are set to zero allows LUMIA to recover the time series of both categories. This reduces the prior-to-truth root mean square error (RMSE) from 1.26 to 0.12 TgC d−1 in fossil CO2 and from 0.97 to 0.17 TgC d−1 in biosphere fluxes, reflecting the true total CO2 budget by 91 %. In a second set of experiments using realistic prior fluxes, we find that in addition to retrieving the time series of the optimized fluxes, we are able to recover the true regional fossil CO2 budget in western/central Europe by 95 % and in Germany by 97 %. In all experiments, regions with low sampling coverage, such as southern Europe and the British Isles, show poorly resolved posterior fossil CO2 emissions. Although the posterior biosphere fluxes in these regions follow the seasonal patterns of the true fluxes, a significant bias remains, making it impossible to close the total CO2 budget. We find that the prior uncertainty of fossil CO2 emissions does not significantly impact the posterior estimates, showing similar results in regions with good sampling coverage like western/central Europe and northern Europe. Finally, having a good prior estimate of the terrestrial isotopic disequilibrium is important to avoid introducing additional noise into the posterior fossil CO2 fluxes."

Our instrument was launched in 2018 and 2021 from Norway. The heaviest particles were detected around 80 km, while medium particles could be found even above 100 km. Our measurements show that different particles are formed and not just one predominating compound. The most likely compounds that form meteor smoke particles in our measurements are made up of oxides of iron, magnesium and silicon. 
 We present mass spectroscopic in situ data from rocket flights of two improved ion mass spectrometers in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region. The instruments were optimized to detect large ions with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, mass) of up to m/z 2000 and 20 000 respectively, for analysis of meteor smoke particles. The flights were performed in the framework of the polar mesospheric winter echo (PMWE) campaigns, initiated and coordinated by the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), to investigate polar mesospheric winter radar echoes in Andøya (Norway) in 2018 and 2021. Both flights were successful and allowed the mass number and chemical composition of charged meteor smoke particles to be investigated. We found a complex and diverse composition of positively and negatively charged molecules and particles within our mass range in a region that is notoriously difficult to get mass spectroscopic data from. While at altitudes below 85 km we observed negatively charged particles of up to several thousands of atomic mass units, above this altitude we found possible building blocks of these large particles that form right after their ablation from the parent meteorite material. In the first flight we detected no positively charged particles above m/z 100 and a difficult-to-interpret signal for negatively charged particles beyond our mass range of m/z 2000. In the second flight, however, we detected positively charged particles between around m/z 180 and 350 and a number of different negatively charged particles up to m/z 5500. Due to the very large mass range of m/z 20 000 used in the second flight and the subsequent lower mass resolution, unambiguous mass identification is not possible.

 This study attempts to quantify the radiative impact over Réunion Island (21° S, 55° E) in the southern tropical Indian Ocean of the aerosols and water vapor (WV) injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of the Hunga underwater volcano in the South Pacific on 15 January 2022 . Ground-based lidar and satellite passive instruments are used to parameterize a state-of-the-art radiative transfer (RT) model for the first 13 months after the volcano eruption. The descending rate of the aerosol volcanic plume is −8 m d−1. At this rate, aerosols are expected to be present in the stratosphere until the first half of 2025. The overall aerosol and water vapor impact on the Earth's radiation budget for the whole period is negative (cooling, −0.82 ± 0.35 W m−2) and dominated by the aerosol impact (∼ 95 %; the remaining ∼ 5 % is due to the water vapor). At the Earth's surface, aerosols are the main drivers and produce a negative (cooling, −1.04 ± 0.36 W m−2) radiative impact. Water vapor has hardly any radiative effect at the surface. Between the short-term (months 2 to 4 after the eruption, February–April 2022) and mid-term (months 5 to 14 after the eruption, May 2022–February 2023) periods, the aerosol and water vapor radiative effect at the surface and top of atmosphere (TOA) reduces by 22 % and 25 %, respectively. During the mid-term period, heating / cooling (H / C) rate profiles show a clear vertical difference locally in the stratosphere between the aerosol warming impact (18 to 26 km) and the water vapor cooling (22 to 30 km). The resulting aerosol and water vapor heating / cooling rate profile follows an S-shaped curve with peaks slightly larger for the moist layer (−0.09 K d−1) than for the sulfate layer (+0.06 K d−1)."

Chan,"Enhanced sulfate formation in mixed biomass burning and sea-salt interactions mediated by photosensitization: effects of chloride, nitrogen-containing compounds, and atmospheric aging","This study provides laboratory evidence that the photosensitizers in biomass burning extracts can enhance sulfate formation in NaCl particles, primarily by triggering the formation of secondary oxidants under light and air conditions, with a lower contribution of direct photosensitization via triplets. 
 Discrepancies persist between modeled simulations and measured sulfate concentrations in the marine boundary layer, especially when the marine air is influenced by biomass burning plumes. However, there has been a notable dearth of research conducted on the interactions between sea-salt aerosol and biomass burning plumes, impeding a comprehensive understanding of sulfate formation. This work studied sulfate formation by mixing real biomass burning (BB) extracts and NaCl, mimicking internal mixtures of BB and sea-salt particles. BB–NaCl particles had a significantly higher sulfate formation rate than incense burning (IS)–NaCl particles. For fresh particles, the sulfate formation rate followed the trend of corn straw (CS)–NaCl > rice straw (RS)–NaCl > wheat straw (WS)–NaCl > IS–NaCl. The filter sample aging was achieved by exposure to OH• generated from UV irradiation. After aging, RS–NaCl particles exhibited the highest enhancement in sulfate formation rates among all the BB–NaCl particles due to interactions between RS and NaCl. Bulk aqueous experiments spiked with NaCl using mixtures of model photosensitizers (PSs) and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs), pyrazine (CHN), and 4-nitrocatechol (CHON) revealed positive effects of chloride in the PS–CHON system and negative effects in the PS–CHN system in sulfate formation. Our work suggests that BB reaching or near coastal areas can affect sulfate formation via photosensitizer-mediated reactions, potentially exacerbating air pollution."

Fleming;Karina Adcock;Emmal Safi;Tim Arnold,Direct high-precision radon quantification for interpreting high-frequency greenhouse gas measurements,"We present a protocol to improve confidence in atmospheric radon measurements, enabling site comparisons and integration with greenhouse gas data. As a natural tracer, radon provides an independent check of transport model performance. This standardized method enhances radon’s use as a metric for model evaluation. Beyond UK observatories, it can support broader networks like ICOS and WMO/GAW, advancing global atmospheric research. 
 We present a protocol to improve confidence in reported radon activity concentrations, facilitating direct site-to-site comparisons and integration with co-located greenhouse gas (GHG) measurements within a network of three independently managed observatories in the UK. Translating spot measurements of atmospheric GHG amount fractions into regional flux estimates (“top-down” analysis) is usually performed with atmospheric transport models (ATMs), which calculate the sensitivity of regional emissions to changes in observed GHGs at a finite number of locations. However, the uncertainty of regional emissions is closely linked to ATM uncertainties. Radon, emitted naturally from the land surface, can be used as a tracer of atmospheric transport and mixing to independently evaluate the performance of such models. To accomplish this, the radon measurements need to have a comparable precision to the GHGs at the modelled temporal resolution. Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) dual-flow-loop two-filter radon detectors provide output every 30 min. The measurement accuracy at this temporal resolution depends on the characterization and removal of instrumental background, the calibration procedure, and response time correction. Consequently, unless these steps are standardized, measurement precision may differ between sites. Here we describe standardized approaches regarding (1) instrument maintenance, (2) quality control of the raw data stream, (3) determination and removal of the instrumental background, (4) calibration methods, and (5) response time correction (by deconvolution). Furthermore, we assign uncertainties for each reported 30 min radon estimate (assuming these steps have been followed) and validate the final result through comparison of diurnal and sub-diurnal radon characteristics with co-located GHG measurements. While derived for a network of UK observatories, the proposed standardized protocol could be equally applied to two-filter dual-flow-loop radon observations across larger networks, such as the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) or the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) baseline network."

The study aimed to identify disparities in the widely used OP dithiothreitol assay and assess the consistency of OP among labs using the same protocol. The results showed that half of the labs achieved acceptable results. However, variability was also found, highlighting the need for standardisation in OP procedures. 
 This paper presents the findings from a collaborative interlaboratory comparison exercise designed to assess oxidative potential (OP) measurements conducted by 20 laboratories worldwide. This study represents an innovative effort as the first exercise specifically aimed at harmonising this type of OP assay, setting a new benchmark in the field.Over the last decade, there has been a noticeable increase in OP studies, with numerous research groups investigating the effects of exposure to air pollution particles through the evaluation of OP levels. However, the absence of standardised methods for OP measurements has resulted in variability in results across different groups, rendering meaningful comparisons challenging. To address this issue, this study engages in an international effort to compare OP measurements using a simplified method (with a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay).Here, we quantify the OP in liquid samples to focus on the protocol measurement itself, while future international OP interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs) should aim to assess the whole chain process, including the sample extraction. We analyse the similarities and discrepancies observed in the results, identifying the critical parameters (such as the instrument used, the use of a simplified protocol, the delivery and analysis time) that could influence OP measurements and  provide recommendations for future studies and interlaboratory comparisons even if other crucial aspects, such as sampling PM methods, sample storage, extraction methods and conditions, and the evaluation of other OP assays, still need to be standardised. This collaborative approach enhances the robustness of the OP DTT assay and paves the way for future studies to build on a unified framework. This pioneering work concludes that interlaboratory comparisons provide essential insights into the OP metric and are crucial to move toward the harmonisation of OP measurements."

 In this work, we present the results of an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in which we investigate the emergence of a surface reflectance-dependent bias in retrieved column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4). Our focus is on single-band type retrievals in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) at 2.3 µm. This particular bias manifests as artificial gradients in XCH4 fields that relate to surface features on the ground and can, for example, cause erroneous estimates of methane source emission rates."

Yet, the mechanisms driving biomass gas evolution and DBC formation are poorly understood. Using thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy, we correlated the temperature-dependent primary noncondensable gas release sequence (H2O → CO2 → HCN, NH3 → CH4 → CO) with specific defunctionalization stages in the order: dehydration, decarboxylation, denitrogenation, demethylation, and decarbonylation. Our results revealed that proteins in feedstock mainly contributed to gas releases, and low-volatile pyrolytic products contributed to DBC. Combining mass difference analysis with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we showed that 44–60% of DBC molecular compositions were correlated with primary gas-releasing reactions. Dehydration (−H2O), with lower reaction energy barrier, contributed to DBC formation most at 350 and 450 °C, whereas decarboxylation (−CO2) and deamidization (−HCNO) prevailed in contributing to DBC formation at 550 °C. The aromaticity changes of DBC products formed via gas emissions were deduced. Compared to their precursors, dehydration increased DBC aromaticity, while deamidization reduced the aromaticity of DBC products. These insights on pyrolytic byproducts help predict and tune DBC properties via changing gas formed during biochar production, minimizing their negative environmental impacts."

 An unexpected record-breaking cold event struck eastern China in December 2023, causing widespread transportation shutdowns, power supply shortages, and agricultural crop damage. The manner in which such an extraordinary cold event was formed under global warming is unclear, as is the way in which anthropogenic climate change may affect the present and future frequency and intensity of similar cold events. Here, we show that the large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with the warm Arctic was the main event driver, explaining 83 ± 2% of the intensity of the 2023 cold event, whereas the thermodynamic effect of climate change suppressed the event intensity by −6 ± 3% in ERA5 and −22 ± 2% in HadGEM3-A-N216. An attribution analysis based on coupled model simulations shows that, due to anthropogenic climate change, the frequency and intensity of 2023-like events decrease by 92.5 ± 2.5% and 1.9 ± 0.2 °C, respectively, under the 2023 climate state. The thermodynamic effect of anthropogenic climate change outweighs its dynamic effect. Future projections indicate that the frequency and intensity of these 2023-like events will further decrease by 95 ± 3% and 2.05 ± 0.25 °C by the end of this century under an intermediate-emissions scenario compared with estimates made under the present climate. In contrast, 2023-like events will be similar to present events when the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement is achieved. These findings highlight the dampening effect of anthropogenic climate change on cold events, but adaptation measures for future risks of 2023-like cold events will be needed by the end of the century if carbon neutrality is achieved."

 Anthropogenic aerosols could weaken the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). This study investigated the regional effects of varying aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the EASM through qualitative and quantitative analyses for three subregions in eastern China. After assessing 38 CMIP6 models, four models (ACCESS-CM2, CanESM5, MIROC6, and MRI-ESM2-0) were selected for detailed analysis. Results showed that the weakening of EASM was predominantly attributed to anthropogenic aerosols. Increased AOD reduced land-sea temperature and pressure differences, weakening the EASM as indicated by the EASMI. Higher aerosol levels decreased surface shortwave radiation, land surface temperature, and evaporation, weakening the land-sea thermal contrast. Enhanced aerosol-induced cooling increased atmospheric stability and downward flow, suppressing upper air water vapor flux and precipitation. These findings underscore the critical role of anthropogenic aerosols in altering regional climate patterns and the importance of emission control to mitigate their effects on the EASM."

 Reduction in aerosol cooling unmasks greenhouse gas warming, exacerbating the rate of future warming. The strict sulfur regulation on shipping fuel implemented in 2020 (IMO2020) presents an opportunity to assess the potential impacts of such emission regulations and the detectability of deliberate aerosol perturbations for climate intervention. Here we employ machine learning to capture cloud natural variability and estimate a radiative forcing of +0.074 ±0.005 W m−2 related to IMO2020 associated with changes in shortwave cloud radiative effect over three low-cloud regions where shipping routes prevail. We find low detectability of the cloud radiative effect of this event, attributed to strong natural variability in cloud albedo and cloud cover. Regionally, detectability is higher for the southeastern Atlantic stratocumulus deck. These results raise concerns that future reductions in aerosol emissions will accelerate warming and that proposed deliberate aerosol perturbations such as marine cloud brightening will need to be substantial in order to overcome the low detectability.

 Organic aerosols (OA) are a main component of PM2.5 (20–90%), which contains thousands of compounds. Thus, the formation processes and sources of OA remain poorly understood. In this study, the seasonal and diurnal variabilities of submicron PM chemical composition (both inorganic and organic aerosols) and OA sources were characterized by aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) and an aethalometer at a rural background site in the Czech Republic (National Atmospheric Observatory Košetice – NAOK) from January to October 2019. The effects of meteorological conditions and local, regional, and long-range atmospheric transport influences in Central Europe were also studied. The overall average submicron PM concentration was 9.26 ± 5.88 μg m−3. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, we identified four OA factors for summer and five for all other seasons. Three factors were associated with primary sources of OA (POA): hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass-burning OA (BBOA), and OA from coal burning (CCOA, absent in summer), the CCOA factor enabling a better description of the residential heating effect on the background station in Central Europe. Two remaining factors represented oxygenated OA (OOA) sources: less oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and more oxidized OOA (MO-OOA).Higher pollution episodes of submicron PM and all OA sources were predominantly associated with continental air masses. The effect of dispersion conditions, as assessed by the ventilation index (VI) and not yet been studied at a rural background site, proved to be a critical factor. The extension of the number of primary factors to include CCOA in PMF analysis, together with the reflection of the influence of seasonality, air mass origin and changes in meteorology, especially dispersion conditions, has elucidated the origin and fate of OA in the atmosphere at this type of European background stations."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121049,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了吲哚氧化形成的含氮杂环芳烃二次有机气溶胶（SOA）在大气中的氧化还原电位和细胞毒性。研究发现，吲哚-SOA具有高氧化潜能和抗氧化能力，并对肺上皮细胞具有显著的细胞毒性。夜间臭氧和NO3自由基的氧化作用会产生具有更高氧化还原电位和细胞毒性的吲哚-SOA。该研究还发现，吲哚-SOA与环境PM2.5混合会产生协同的氧化作用。通过在上海城市PM2.5中鉴定吲哚-SOA的分子标记物，表明吲哚及其衍生物对中国特大城市的健康风险。虽然论文主要关注地面观测和实验室分析，但其结果与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为理解SOA的形成、转化和毒性对于改进空气质量监测模型和卫星观测数据的解释至关重要。例如，可以利用卫星遥感数据反演PM2.5浓度，结合该论文的研究结果，可以更好地评估PM2.5对人体健康的风险。,"['Air quality monitoring', 'Secondary organic aerosol (SOA)', 'Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic compounds (NHACs)', 'Oxidative potential', 'Cytotoxicity', 'PM2.5', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Ground-based observation']",Chunlin Li;Dongmei Cai;Michal Pardo;Hongwei Pang;Zheng Fang;Jianmin Chen;Ke Hao;Yinon Rudich,Redox potential and cytotoxicity of N-heterocyclic aromatic SOA from indole oxidation in the atmosphere,"•Tracers of Indole-SOA were identified in urban PM2.5pollution and enhanced its oxidative potential (OP). •The evolving OP, antioxidant capacity, and cytotoxicity of Indole-SOA were characterized. •Nighttime O3and NO3.• aging of Indole-SOA result in higher toxicity compared to photochemical aging. •Aromatic carbonyl and reduced-nitrogen compounds in Indole-SOA determine its OP and cytotoxicity. 
 Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic compounds (NHACs) significantly contribute to urban air pollution but remain understudied. This study investigates the formation and transformation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from prototypical NHACs, indole, under various day- and night-time atmospheric processes. We examined the relationship between the evolving redox potential and cytotoxicity of indole-derived SOA (Indole-SOA) and its chemical alternations. Results show that Indole-SOA exhibits high oxidative potential (OPDTT of 88–268 pmol min−1 μg−1) and antioxidant capacity (AOC of 0.41–0.83 nmol trolox μg−1), exceeding most biogenic and anthropogenic organic aerosols. Indole-SOA induces significant cytotoxicity in lung epithelial cells, characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CYP1A1-driven detoxification pathways. The strongly correlated OPDTT and cytotoxicity of Indole-SOA are influenced by atmospheric agings and are closely related to particulate-phase products of aromatic carbonyl and reduced-nitrogen compounds. Nighttime chemistry involving O3 and NO3• produces Indole-SOA with lower yields but higher redox potential and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Indole-SOA mixing with ambient PM2.5 shows a positive redox interaction, with the synergistic effect on OPDTT determined by Indole-SOA type and proportion. Molecular markers of Indole-SOA can be identified in Shanghai urban PM2.5, indicating potential health risks from indole and its derivatives in Chinese megacities."

Yet, how the timings of snow seasons have already shifted in mountain environments can be counterintuitive. Here, we update our 2018 analyses of snow seasonality in Kyrgyzstan (KG) using more data and improved methods. Using two decades of MODIS snow-cover data, we investigated trends in four snow seasonality metrics: first date of snow (FDoS); last date of snow (LDoS); duration of the snow season (DoSS); and snow-covered days (SCDs). Our novel but conservative nonparametric approach analyzed trends within elevation ranges at two administrative levels: oblast and rayon. To attenuate the risk of false-positive trends, we reported as ‘notable’ only those significant (p < 0.05) nonparametric trends that were also (i) strongly asymmetric (at least twice as many significant pixels in one direction) within an elevational range of the oblast or rayon and (ii) covering at least 5% of the elevation range in oblast or rayon and more than 10 pixels. We used both simple and advanced snow-cover metrics, with the latter exploiting the within-composite chronobyte detail available in the MOD10A2.061 product. We found notable trends to earlier FDoS below 3000 m in western KG and more SCD between 1500–3500 m in western KG. We also found the expected notable trends towards earlier LDoS at both oblast and rayon levels. In northwestern KG, DoSS was notably longer <3000 m, but notably shorter at 3500–4000 m. In our 2018 analyses, we found at the national level 160% more area trending to earlier FDoS than to earlier LDoS. Our comprehensive updated trend analysis was designed to be more conservative. It revealed more area (106%–130%) trending to earlier FDoS than earlier LDoS, reinforcing the counterintuitive finding of longer snow seasons starting earlier at lower elevations."

This study investigates spruce forest productivity using in-situ field observations (DendroNetwork) and satellite remote sensing (RS) data in the Czech Republic during the past two decades. Tree growth index and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer net primary productivity were used to assess productivity at the national scale along an elevation gradient. The analyses of spatiotemporal variation in carbon dynamics indicate a decreasing trend in productivity in 51% and 80% (2800 km2 and 4200 km2) of the spruce stands from the RS and in-situ data, respectively. The increasing trend is particularly evident in montane regions, where satellite data identified an elevation threshold around 900 m a.s.l. while in-situ data 700 m a.s.l. In these energy-limited montane areas, NS may benefit from increased temperatures and may remain relatively safe from drought stress. The decreasing trends detected by both approaches indicate deteriorating conditions for NS in lower elevations. This study suggests that combining in-situ and RS data provides an efficient and robust way to estimate forest productivity at the national scale. The anticipated response of spruce forests associated with declines in productivity and growth in areas with low to moderate elevation points to the adverse effects of climate change by shifting the ecological optimum to higher elevations. We conclude that detailed mapping of forest response to changing environmental conditions is critical to support sustainable forest management and decision-making, ultimately reflecting the need to adopt adequate strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and related natural and anthropogenic disturbances."

This study, using Nepal as a case study, investigated the spatial and temporal impacts of hydro-climatic factors on leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP), as well as the coupling degree of GPP-LAI expressed as the correlation coefficient (R2) of these trends from 2003 to 2020. The results indicated both GPP and LAI increased significantly more during the dry season than the rainy season in Nepal, but the coupling degree of GPP-LAI in Nepal showed distinct seasonal and elevational differences. Relative to low coupling degree in high and low elevation regions, a higher yet gradually decreasing coupling degree was demonstrated in the mid high regions of central Nepal. By analyzing the effects of elevational profiles, this study revealed that temperature and solar radiation exhibited significant negative correlations with GPP in the southern and central forests at mid elevation, while suggesting a positive correlation in the high mountain alpine forests, which mitigated the limiting effects of precipitation constraints on GPP during the dry season. And the decreased temperature and precipitation had negative impacts on treeline deviation, which led to spatial variations in treeline deviation and coupling degree on either side of the 83°E in the Nepalese Himalayan alpine forests. Additionally, trends of shrubland in GPP and LAI growth reflected adaptations to a warmer and wetter climate. The study about spatio-temporal variation in response to warm-wetting climate, affected by seasons and elevations, offers a scientific basis for the adaptation and conservation of alpine vegetation in Nepal."

Severe drought events and human activities, particularly water and land management, have led to emerging dust sources in the last few decades. This study combines spatio-temporal maps of land susceptibility to dust storm incidence with agricultural land use change data to examine the link between farming patterns and dust storm generation in the Tigris and Euphrates Basin from 2000 to 2021. Farmland and bare ground trends depend heavily on water availability, affecting land susceptibility to dust storms. We observed a direct connection between cropping regimes and high land susceptibility to becoming a dust source. Our analysis found no significant correlation between low to intermediate dust storm source (DSS) susceptibility and bare ground trends. However, we found a positive correlation between highly susceptible land and areas where bare ground showed an increasing trend, including the lands that were abandoned for more than 50% of the study period. Among the farming patterns, i.e. single and double cropping, single cropping is more prone to DSS occurrence, underscoring the importance of year-round vegetation cover and effective water management. The disturbed lands, particularly those abandoned post-cropping, show higher susceptibility to DSS incidence. Between 2008 and 2012, dust sources and land susceptibility increased substantially, alongside a significant rise in bare ground, possibly due to severe drought. We highlight cases where changes in farming patterns and land abandonment contribute to the increased or decreased susceptibility of land to being a DSS, as well as consistent susceptibility in the cases where there is no land use change. Given the broad geographical scope of the study, this research underscores the need for further investigation, combining field measurements with remote sensing to obtain a more detailed picture of the link between farming patterns, land abandonment, and dust storms."

The AI-NAOS scheme considers black carbon as fractal aggregates and soil dust as super-spheroids, encapsulated with hygroscopic aerosols. Real-case simulations emphasize the necessity of accurately representing nonspherical and inhomogeneous aerosols in chemical weather models. 
 The Artificial-Intelligence-based Nonspherical Aerosol Optical Scheme (AI-NAOS) is a newly developed aerosol optical module that improves the representation of aerosol optical properties for radiative transfer simulations in atmospheric models. It incorporates the nonsphericity and inhomogeneity (NSIH) of internally mixed aerosol particles through a deep learning method. Specifically, the AI-NAOS considers black carbon (BC) to be fractal aggregates and models soil dust (SD) as super-spheroids, encapsulated partially or completely with hygroscopic aerosols such as sulfate, nitrate, and aerosol water. To obtain AI-NAOS, a database of the optical properties for the models was constructed using the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (IITM), and deep neural networks (DNN) were trained based on this database. In this study, the AI-NAOS was integrated into the mesoscale version 5.1 of Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System with Chinese Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment (GRAPES_Meso5.1/CUACE). Real-case simulations were conducted during a winter with high pollution, comparing BC aerosols evaluated using three schemes with spherical aerosol models (external-mixing, core-shell, and volume-mixing schemes) and the AI-NAOS scheme. The results showed that the NSIH effect led to a moderate estimation of absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) and obvious changes in aerosol radiative effects, shortwave heating rates, temperature profiles, and boundary layer height. The AAOD values based on three spherical schemes were 70.4 %, 125.3 %, and 129.3 % over the Sichuan Basin, benchmarked to AI-NAOS results. Compared to the external-mixing scheme, the direct radiative effect (DRE) induced by the NSIH effect reached +1.6 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and −2.9 W m−2 at the surface. The NSIH effect could enhance the shortwave heating rate, reaching 23 %. Thus, the warming effect at 700 hPa and the cooling effect on the ground were strengthened by 21 % and 13 %, reaching +0.04 and −0.10 K, which led to a change in the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) by −11 m. In addition, the precipitation was inhibited by the NSIH effect, causing a 15 % further decrease. Therefore, the NSIH effects demonstrated their non-negligible impacts and highlighted the importance of incorporating them into chemical weather models."

Thus, existing data sets are transferred into synthetic observations and can be used for satellite calibration–validation studies. 
 The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched in May 2024 carries a novel 94 GHz cloud profiling radar (CPR) with Doppler capability. This work describes the open-source instrument simulator Orbital-Radar, which transforms high-resolution radar data from field observations or forward simulations of numerical models to CPR primary measurements and uncertainties. The transformation accounts for sampling geometry and surface effects. We demonstrate Orbital-Radar's ability to provide realistic CPR views of typical cloud and precipitation scenes. The presented case studies show small-scale convection, marine stratus clouds, and Arctic mixed-phase cloud cases. These results provide valuable insights into the capabilities and challenges of the EarthCARE CPR mission and its advantages over the CloudSat CPR. Finally, Orbital-Radar allows for evaluating kilometre-scale numerical weather prediction models with EarthCARE CPR observations. So, Orbital-Radar can generate calibration and validation (Cal/Val) data sets already pre-launch. Nevertheless, an evaluation of synthetic CPR output data to accurate EarthCARE CPR data is missing."

Notable trend with the variation of azimuth was also found in horizontal speeds at 200 and 500 km altitudes and differences between them.

However, there is still controversy regarding the 15N fractionation effects during NO3− formation, leading to uncertain source apportionment. To address this, this study introduces dual oxygen isotopes (∆17O and δ18O) to constrain the 15N fractionation (∆15N‐∆17O/∆15N‐δ18O) of NO3− formation and compare the impact of δ15N‐NOx (∆17O) and δ15N‐NOx (δ18O) on NOx/NO3− source apportionment. Results found significant differences in ∆15N‐∆17O (−3.7 ∼ +16.1‰) and ∆15N‐δ18O (+8.5 ∼ +16.2‰) in haze, reflecting the ∆15N from three pathways (NO2 + OH, NO3 + HC, N2O5 hydrolysis) and two pathways (NO2 + OH and N2O5 hydrolysis), respectively. The 15N fractionation value differences obtained by dual oxygen isotopes increases with the increase of NO3 + HC contribution (0.02–0.65). Additionally, different results of NOx/NO3− sources apportionment were obtained by δ15N‐NOx(∆ $\mathit{{\increment}}$17O) and δ15N‐NOx(δ18O) in NO3 + HC‐induced haze. For example, δ15N‐NOx(∆ $\mathit{{\increment}}$17O) identified coal combustion (46 ± 8%) and biomass burning (32 ± 3%) as major NOx/NO3− sources in Zibo haze. Conversely, δ15N‐NOx(δ18O) revealed mobile sources (55 ± 8%) and biomass burning (22 ± 5%) as main contributors.

 El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability has conspicuous impacts on ecosystems and severe weather. Here, we probe the effects of anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases on El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability during the historical period using a broad set of climate models. Increased aerosols significantly amplify El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability primarily through weakening the mean advection feedback and strengthening the zonal advection and thermocline feedbacks, as linked to a weaker annual cycle of sea surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific. They prevent extreme El Niño events, reduce interannual sea surface temperature skewness in the tropical Pacific, influence the likelihood of El Niño/Southern Oscillation events in April and June and allow for more El Niño transitions to Central Pacific events. While rising greenhouse gases significantly reduce El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability via a stronger sea surface temperature annual cycle and attenuated thermocline feedback. They promote extreme El Niño events, increase SST skewness, and enlarge the likelihood of El Niño/Southern Oscillation peaking in November while inhibiting Central Pacific El Niño/Southern Oscillation events. Anthropogenic aerosols increase El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability, preventing extreme events, while rising greenhouse gases reduce variability, promoting extreme events and altering peak timing and location, according to analysis of a broad set of climate models."

 Wildfire management and response requires frequent and accurate burned area mapping. How to map daily burned areas with satisfactory accuracy remains challenging due to missed detections caused by accumulating active fire points as well as the low temporal resolution of sensors onboard satellites like Sentinel-2/Landsat-8/9 and monthly burned area product generated from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. ConvNet-based and Transformer-based deep-learning models are widely applied to mid-spatial-resolution satellite images. But these models perform poorly on low-spatial-resolution images. Also, cloud interference is one major issue when continuously monitoring the burned area. To improve detection accuracy and reduce cloud inference by combining temporal and spatial information, we propose an autoregressive spatial–temporal model AR-SwinUNETR to segment daily burned areas from VIIRS time-series. AR-SwinUNETR processes the image time-series as a 3D tensor but considers the temporal connections between images in the time-series by applying an autoregressive mask in Swin-Transformer Block. The model is trained with 2017-2020 wildfire events in the US and validated on 2021 US wildfire events. The quantitative results indicate AR-SwinUNETR can achieve a higher F1-Score than baseline deep learning models. The quantitative results of testset which consists of eight 2023 long-duration wildfires in Canada show a better F1 Score (0.757) and IoU Score (0.607) than baseline accumulated VIIRS Active Fire Hotspots (0.715) and IoU Score (0.557) compared with labels generated from Sentinel-2 images. In conclusion, the proposed AR-SwinUNETR with VIIRS image time-series can efficiently detect daily burned area providing better accuracy than direct burned area mapping with VIIRS active fire hotspots. Also, burned area mapping using VIIRS time-series and AR-SwinUNETR keeps a high temporal resolution (daily) compared to other burned area mapping products. The qualitative results also show improvements in detecting burned areas with cloudy images."

 Ship emissions may have significant influences on regional climates with growing trade around the world. Therefore, an updated regional climate model with comprehensive cloud microphysics schemes is employed to investigate the effects of shipping sulfate and primary carbonaceous aerosols on the East Asian summer climate. Investigations indicate that ship emissions have substantial influences on air quality, the radiative energy budget and regional climate change in East Asia in summer. They would directly result in an increment in aerosol surface concentration by at least 10% around the coasts and optical depth by 0.03 over East Asia, which considerably increases the cloud droplet numbers along ship lanes. Subsequently, a very negative instantaneous radiative forcing (>1.5 W/m2) at the surface is exerted, and then the dipoles of anti-cyclone and convergence anomalies might occur from the Bay of Bengal to northeast Asia due to shipping aerosols. These thermal-dynamic responses could further affect cloud formation, hence inducing heterogeneous and nonlocal responses of radiation, air temperature and precipitation. Both cloud optical depth and fraction are likely increased in southwestern to northern China but decreased in parts of southern China and northeastern Asia through shipping aerosols interacting with radiation and clouds. As a result, surface cooling and wetting (warming and drying) are found in the region with positive (negative) cloud change. The absorption of shipping BC to solar radiation could yield a substantial warming tendency, which might have significant contributions to the climate responses in central to northern China."

 This study reveals that the intensity of cold-season (October–March) extreme low-temperature events (ELTs) during 1982–2022 strengthened after the year 2000 over northern Asia, along with a decrease in their frequency. Two significant interdecadal changes in cold-season atmospheric circulations after the year 2000 were found to be associated with these changes. Firstly, there has been an increased occurrence of extremely strong blocking highs over the North Atlantic, promoting anomalous meridional circulation. Secondly, the upper-level jet stream has weakened, reducing the polar vortex and strengthening the cold polar air that erupts southward. Statistical analysis and model experiments suggest that the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation after the year 2000 may have contributed to the strengthened ELTs by causing deep warming over the North Atlantic. The direct thermodynamic effects of deep warming intensify the blocking high over the North Atlantic. Simultaneously, an anomalous easterly wind appears in the upper troposphere due to thermal wind theory, and the weakened jet stream results in a stronger meridional flow, leading to an extremely strong blocking high."

Marsh;Alexandru Rap,Impact of host climate model on contrail cirrus effective radiative forcing estimates,"Contrail cirrus is the largest, but also most uncertain, contribution of aviation to global warming. We evaluate, for the first time, the impact of the host climate model on contrail cirrus properties. Substantial differences exist between contrail cirrus formation, persistence, and radiative effects in the host climate models. Reliable contrail cirrus simulations require advanced representation of cloud optical properties and microphysics, which should be better constrained by observations. 
 Estimates of aviation effective radiative forcing (ERF) indicate that contrail cirrus is currently its largest contributor, although with a substantial associated uncertainty of ∼ 70 %. Here, we implement the contrail parameterisation developed for the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) in the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM), allowing us to compare, for the first time, the impact of key features of the host climate model on contrail cirrus ERF. We find that differences in background humidity between the models result in the UM-simulated contrail fractions being 2 to 3 times larger than in CAM. Additionally, the models show contrasting responses in overall global cloud fraction, with contrails increasing the total cloud fraction in the UM and decreasing it in CAM. Differences in the complexity of the cloud microphysics schemes lead to significant differences in simulated changes to cloud ice water content due to aviation. After compensating for the unrealistically low contrail optical depth in the UM, we estimate the 2018 contrail cirrus ERF to be 40.8 mW m−2 in the UM, compared to 60.1 mW m−2 in CAM. These values highlight the substantial uncertainty in contrail cirrus ERF due to differences in microphysics and radiation schemes between the two models. We also find a factor-of-8 uncertainty in contrail cirrus ERF due to existing uncertainty in contrail cirrus optical depth. Future research should focus on better representing microphysical and radiative contrail characteristics in climate models and on improved observational constraints."

Here, a satellite-based dataset of FLCs, reanalysis data and machine learning are used to systematically analyze FLC persistence under different aerosol loadings. Aerosol plumes are shown to modify local thermodynamics, which increase FLC persistence. But fully disentangling aerosol effects from meteorological ones remains a challenge. 
 In the Namib Desert, fog is the only regular water input and, thus, is a crucial water source for its fauna and flora. Each year, between June and October, absorbing biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) overlie the stratocumulus clouds in the adjacent Southeast Atlantic. In some synoptic settings, this layer of BBAs reaches Namibia and its desert, where it interacts with coastal fog and low clouds (FLCs). In this study, a novel 15-year data set of geostationary satellite observations of FLC dissipation time in the Namib Desert is used, along with reanalysis data, to better understand the potential semi-direct effects of BBAs on FLC dissipation in the Namib Desert, i.e., through adjustments of atmospheric stability and thermodynamics via the interaction of aerosols with radiation. This is done by investigating both the time of day when FLCs dissolve and the synoptic-scale meteorology depending on BBA loading. It is found that FLC dissipation time is significantly later on high-BBA-loading days. BBAs are transported to the Namib along moist free-tropospheric air by a large-scale anticyclonic recirculation pattern. At the surface, the associated longwave heating strengthens a continental heat low, which modifies the circulation and boundary layer moisture along the coastline, complicating the attribution of BBA effects. During high-BBA days, the vertical profiles of the temporal development of air temperatures highlight contrasting daytime and nighttime processes modifying the local inversion. These processes are thought to be driven by greenhouse warming as a result of the moisture in the BBA plumes and BBA absorption (only during the daytime). A statistical learning framework is used to quantify meteorological and BBA influences on FLC dissipation time. The statistical model is able to reproduce the observed differences in FLC dissipation time between high- and low-BBA days and attributes these differences mainly to differences in circulation, boundary layer moisture and near-surface air temperature along the coastline. However, the model is prone to underfitting and is not able to reproduce the majority of the FLC dissipation variability. While the model does not suggest that BBA patterns are important for FLC dissipation, the findings show how the moist BBA plumes modify local thermodynamics, to which FLC dissipation is shown to be sensitive. The findings highlight the challenges of disentangling meteorological and aerosol effects on cloud development using observations and invite detailed modeling analyses of the underlying processes, for example, with large-eddy simulations."

We assess and compare the performance of five different methods using simulations of 1 year of satellite images, taken from the upcoming Copernicus CO2 Monitoring Mission, covering 15 power plants and the city of Berlin, Germany. 
 The largest anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) come from local sources, such as cities and power plants. The upcoming Copernicus CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) mission will provide satellite images of the CO2 and NO2 plumes associated with these sources at a resolution of 2 km × 2 km and with a swath of 250 km. These images could be exploited using atmospheric-plume inversion methods to estimate local CO2 emissions at the time of the satellite overpass and their corresponding uncertainties. To support the development of the operational processing of satellite imagery of the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) and tropospheric-column NO2, this study evaluates data-driven inversion methods, i.e., computationally light inversion methods that directly process information from satellite images, local winds, and meteorological data, without resorting to computationally expensive dynamical atmospheric transport models. We designed an objective benchmarking exercise to analyze and compare the performance of five different data-driven inversion methods: two implementations with different complexities for the cross-sectional flux approach (CSF and LCSF), as well as one implementation each for the integrated mass enhancement (IME), divergence (Div), and Gaussian plume (GP) model inversion approaches. This exercise is based on pseudo-data experiments with simulations of synthetic true emissions, meteorological and concentration fields, and CO2M observations across a domain of 750 km × 650 km, centered on eastern Germany, over 1 year. The performance of the methods is quantified in terms of the accuracy of single-image emission estimates (from individual images) or annual-average emission estimates (from the full series of images), as well as in terms of the number of instant estimates for the city of Berlin and 15 power plants within this domain. Several ensembles of estimations are conducted using different scenarios for the available synthetic datasets. These ensembles are used to analyze the sensitivity of performance to (1) data loss due to cloud cover, (2) uncertainty in the wind, or (3) the added value of simultaneous NO2 images. The GP and LCSF methods generate the most accurate estimates from individual images. The deviations between the emission estimates and the true emissions from these two methods have similar interquartile ranges (IQRs), ranging from ∼ 20 % to ∼ 60 % depending on the scenario. When taking cloud cover into account, these methods produce 274 and 318 instant estimates, respectively, from the ∼ 500 daily images, which cover significant portions of the plumes from the sources. Filtering the results based on the associated uncertainty estimates can improve the statistics of the IME and CSF methods but does so at the cost of a large decrease in the number of estimates. Due to a reliable estimation of uncertainty and, thus, a suitable selection of estimates, the CSF method achieves similar, if not better, accuracy statistics for instant estimates compared to the GP and LCSF methods after filtering. In general, the performance of retrieving single-image estimates improves when, in addition to XCO2 data, collocated NO2 data are used to characterize the structure of plumes. With respect to the estimates of annual emissions, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the most realistic benchmarking scenario are 20 % (GP), 27 % (CSF), 31 % (LCSF), 55 % (IME), and 79 % (Div). This study suggests that the Gaussian plume and/or cross-sectional approaches are currently the most efficient tools for providing estimates of CO2 emissions from satellite images, and their relatively light computational cost will enable the analysis of the massive amount of data to be provided by future satellite XCO2 imagery missions."

The European Copernicus CO2 monitoring satellite mission CO2M will provide measurements of their atmospheric concentrations, but the accuracy requirements are demanding and conventional retrieval methods computationally expensive. We present a new retrieval algorithm based on artificial neural networks that has the potential to meet the stringent requirements of the CO2M mission with minimal computational effort. 
 Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases and the main drivers of climate change. Monitoring their concentrations from space helps detect and quantify anthropogenic emissions, supporting the mitigation efforts urgently needed to meet the primary objective of the Paris Agreement, adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015, to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. In addition, satellite observations can be used to quantify natural sources and sinks, improving our understanding of the carbon cycle. Advancing these goals is one key motivation for the European Copernicus CO2 monitoring mission CO2M. The necessary accuracy and precision requirements for the measured quantities XCO2 and XCH4 (the column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4) are demanding. According to the CO2M mission requirements, the spatial and temporal variability of the systematic errors (or spatio-temporal systematic errors) of XCO2 and XCH4 must not exceed 0.5 ppm and 5 ppb, respectively. The stochastic errors due to instrument noise must not exceed 0.7 ppm for XCO2 and 10 ppb for XCH4. Conventional so-called full-physics algorithms for retrieving XCO2 and/or XCH4 from satellite-based measurements of reflected solar radiation are typically computationally intensive and still usually require empirical bias corrections based on supervised machine learning methods. Here we present the retrieval algorithm Neural networks for Remote sensing of Greenhouse gases from CO2M (NRG-CO2M), which derives XCO2 and XCH4 from CO2M radiance measurements with minimal computational effort using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In addition, NRG-CO2M also provides estimates of both the noise-driven uncertainties and the averaging kernels of XCO2 and XCH4 for each sounding. Since CO2M will not be launched until 2026, our study exploits simulated measurements over land surfaces from a comprehensive observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) that includes realistic meteorology, aerosols,  surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and CO2 and CH4 concentrations. We created a novel hybrid learning approach that combines advantages of simulation-based and measurement-based training data to ensure coverage of a wide range of XCO2 and XCH4 values, making the training data representative of future concentrations as well. The algorithm's postprocessing is designed to achieve a high data yield of about 80 % of all cloud-free soundings. The spatio-temporal systematic errors of XCO2 and XCH4 are 0.44 ppm and 2.45 ppb, respectively. The average single sounding precision is 0.41 ppm for XCO2 and 2.74 ppb for XCH4. Therefore, the presented retrieval method has the potential to meet the demanding CO2M mission requirements for XCO2 and XCH4. While the presented results are a solid proof of concept, the actual achievable quality can only be determined once NRG-CO2M is trained on real data, where it is confronted, e.g., with unknown instrument effects and systematic errors in the training truth."

The CPC FARM is compared to traditionally used particle mobility sizers during a new particle formation campaign to study rapidly changing sub-3 nm particles in Pittsburgh, PA. 
 New particle formation (NPF) is the atmospheric process whereby gas molecules react and nucleate to form detectable particles. NPF has a strong impact on Earth's radiative balance as it produces roughly half of global cloud condensation nuclei. However, the time resolution and sensitivity of current instrumentation are inadequate in measuring the size distribution of sub-3 nm particles, the particles critical for understanding NPF. Here we present the Condensation Particle Counters For Atmospheric Rapid Measurements (CPC FARM), a method to measure the concentrations of freshly nucleated particles. The CPC FARM consists of five CPCs operating in parallel, each configured to operate at different detectable particle sizes between 1–3 nm. This study explores two methods to calculate the size distribution from the differential measurements across the CPC channels.

10.5194/amt-2024-170,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions,这篇论文研究了动态箱实验中单萜和倍半萜类挥发性有机物（VOCs）的吸附和反应损失。研究发现，这些损失具有显著的物种特异性，并且受浓度、温度和臭氧的影响。为了准确测量这些化合物的排放，研究人员使用了氘代同位素作为内标物来追踪损失。结果表明，氘代α-蒎烯和氘代β-石竹烯可以有效地追踪一些关键单萜和倍半萜的损失，但对于更广泛的化合物，可能需要更多种类的氘代内标物。该研究强调了在使用动态箱测量挥发性有机物排放时，准确校正吸附和反应损失的重要性，这对于空气质量监测和大气成分分析至关重要。  这项工作对改进大气VOCs的测量方法，特别是利用动态箱进行的原位测量具有重要意义，有助于提高空气质量监测的准确性。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)', 'Monoterpenes', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Dynamic chamber experiments', 'Deuterated surrogates', 'Loss correction']",Jianqiang Zeng;Yanli Zhang;Haofan Ran;Weihua Pang;Hao Guo;Zhaobin Mu;Wei Song;Xinming Wang,Calibrating adsorptive and reactive losses of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in dynamic chambers using deuterated surrogates,"This study revealed the existence of significant species-specific adsorptive and reactive losses of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in dynamic chambers. The deuterated α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2 were proved as effective surrogates in tracing these losses for some key monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The findings highlight the importance of selecting internal surrogates that closely match the adsorptive and reactive behaviors of target compounds for precise loss correction. 
 Accurately measuring the emissions of monoterpenes (MTs) and sesquiterpenes (SQTs) using dynamic chambers requires careful consideration of their adsorptive and reactive losses, which are often overlooked and difficult to assess in situ. This study evaluated the effectiveness of deuterated surrogates, α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, in tracing these losses in a dynamic chamber system. Using standard gas mixtures of 10 MTs and 10 SQTs, we characterized adsorptive losses across varying concentrations, temperatures, and humidity levels, as well as reactive losses with ozone. Results indicated that adsorptive losses were significantly influenced by concentration and temperature, with species-specific variations particularly under low concentrations and low temperatures, while relative humidity had negligible impact. Reactive losses with ozone exhibited substantial species-specific variability. Key MTs (α-pinene, β-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, and 1,8-cineole) and SQTs (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene) demonstrated consistent adsorptive and reactive behavior with their respective deuterated surrogates α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, suggesting that these surrogates are effective for correcting losses in in-situ emission measurements using dynamic chambers. However, due to varied adsorptive and reactive losses, additional deuterated MTs and SQTs are recommended, particularly selected according to their O3 reactivities, to cover a broader range of MTs and SQTs for loss correction. A strong correlation between adsorptive capacity and ozone reactivity was observed, underscoring the need to carefully address losses of highly reactive MTs and SQTs during emission measurements. This study also emphasizes that ozone-free circulating air should be used for accurately measuring emissions of highly reactive SQTs, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, especially when loss correction methods are unavailable."

However, the complex nature of the chemicals to which humans are exposed through inhalation has obscured the identification of the key compounds responsible for diseases. Here, we develop a network topology-based framework to identify key toxic compounds in the airborne chemical exposome. Using cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as a model disease, we found that toxic network modules of various compounds are closely linked to the modules of CVDs. The proximity of compound target modules to disease modules can indicate the extent of toxicity induced by the compounds. By integrating mass spectrometry-based external exposure concentrations and machine learning-predicted internal exposure concentrations, we established a comprehensive linkage connecting exposure to disease-related risk for the identification of toxic compounds. These findings were subsequently validated using exposure and disease data on the regional scale. This work provides an effective strategy for identifying key compounds within environmental exposomes and establishes a new paradigm for understanding the pathogenicity of air pollution."

From an idealized ENSO simulation with the WACCM4 model using a stratospheric origin ozone tracer, we investigate the effect of SSWs on the STT of ozone under different ENSO phases. We find a significant increase in lower tropospheric ozone from the SSW onset up to 3 months later over the Arctic, North America, and Europe, regardless of the ENSO phase.

Its pattern resembled the 1997 EXpIOD, contrasting with other coastally‐concentrated EXpIODs. Here we show that the distinctive air‐sea responses of equatorial EXpIODs stem from the energetic central IO zonal winds fueled by concurrent strong El Niños, which were absent in other cases. The exceptionally strong easterly anomaly generates prominent nonlinear vertical advection cooling the central IO, with nonlinear zonal advection and the Ekman feedback playing supportive roles. Current coupled models can capture this Pacific shaping effect, despite with divergent strengths. Under strong El Niño's inter‐basin forcing, the westward extension of cooling has profound implications for regional hydrology and coral ecology, and warrants closer attention in future predictions."

 The amount of methane released to the atmosphere from the Nord Stream subsea pipeline leaks remains uncertain, as reflected in a wide range of estimates1–18. A lack of information regarding the temporal variation in atmospheric emissions has made it challenging to reconcile pipeline volumetric (bottom-up) estimates1–8 with measurement-based (top-down) estimates8–18. Here we simulate pipeline rupture emission rates and integrate these with methane dissolution and sea-surface outgassing estimates9,10 to model the evolution of atmospheric emissions from the leaks. We verify our modelled atmospheric emissions by comparing them with top-down point-in-time emission-rate estimates and cumulative emission estimates derived from airborne11, satellite8,12–14 and tall tower data. We obtain consistency between our modelled atmospheric emissions and top-down estimates and find that 465 ± 20 thousand metric tons of methane were emitted to the atmosphere. Although, to our knowledge, this represents the largest recorded amount of methane released from a single transient event, it is equivalent to 0.1% of anthropogenic methane emissions for 2022. The impact of the leaks on the global atmospheric methane budget brings into focus the numerous other anthropogenic methane sources that require mitigation globally. Our analysis demonstrates that diverse, complementary measurement approaches are needed to quantify methane emissions in support of the Global Methane Pledge19. Modelling of the evolution of atmospheric methane emissions from the 2022 Nord Stream subsea pipeline leaks shows that the event emitted the largest recorded amount of methane from a single transient event."

 Clouds greatly influence the Earth’s energy balance1,2. Observationally constraining cloud radiative feedback, a notably uncertain climate feedback mechanism3–5, is crucial for improving predictions of climate change5–7 but, so far, remains an elusive objective, and the feedback may be different over the ocean versus over land8–10. Here we show a local negative surface longwave cloud feedback over land at the southern Great Plains site, constrained by direct long-term observation of spectrally resolved downwelling longwave radiance11. This negative cloud feedback at the southern Great Plains site causes a −1.77 ± 1.15 W m−2 per decade change in downwelling longwave radiation and suggests that cloud changes may partially modulate the warming effect of increased greenhouse gas concentrations and atmospheric temperatures over land. Specifically, our results are derived from an optimal spectral fingerprinting method12–15 designed to separate surface longwave cloud feedback from other surface forcings and feedbacks, by making use of their unique spectral signatures13–18 in the long-term record of spectrally resolved radiances. Furthermore, we show that the results are not site specific: negative surface longwave cloud feedbacks, primarily induced by decreasing low cloud cover in warming climates, are commonly observed over land in reanalysis and satellite datasets. Our findings establish a pivotal observational benchmark of radiative forcing and feedback needed for validating climate model performance over land.

 Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H2 in a CO2-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H2 was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H2 outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H2 fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥105 years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO2 via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate. Photochemical modelling suggests that H2 outgassing from crustal hydration could have supported transient warming episodes on early Mars in a CO2-rich atmosphere with abrupt transitions to cold climate states in a CO-rich atmosphere."

 Climate change is considered to affect wildfire spread both by increasing fuel dryness and by altering vegetation mass and structure. However, the direct effect of global warming on wildfires is hard to quantify due to the multiple non-climatic factors involved in their ignition and spread. By combining wildfire observations with the latest generation of climate models, here we show that more than half of the large wildfires (area>500 ha) occurring in the Iberian Peninsula between 2001 and 2021 present a significant increase in the rate of spread with respect to what it would have been in the pre-industrial period, attributable to global warming. The average acceleration of the rate of spread due to increased fuel dryness is between 2.0% and 8.3%, whereas the influence of enhanced vegetation growth since the pre-industrial period could potentially be even higher than the direct impact of temperature increase in fuel conditions."

 Air pollution impacts on human health are of serious concern in northern India, and over the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) in particular. The Kharif crop residue burning (CRB) is often blamed for degradation of Delhi-NCR’s seasonal air quality. However, the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remained stable in Delhi, while the fire detection counts (FDCs) from satellites over Punjab and Haryana declined by 50% or more during 2015–2023. We measured PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO) and related parameters over Delhi-NCR, Haryana and Punjab from a network of 30 low-cost sensors (CUPI-Gs) in a selected period (September–November) of 2022 and 2023. Measured PM2.5 showed lower concentration in 2023 compared to 2022 at Punjab and Haryana sites, in compliance with FDC reductions. Using the CUPI-G measurements, airmass trajectories, particle dispersion and chemical-transport model simulations, we show that the CRB emissions over Punjab contributed only a meagre ~14% to the overall PM2.5 over Delhi-NCR during October-November 2022. This indicates that there exists only a very weak coupling between PM2.5 mass over Delhi-NCR and the CRB over Punjab, highlighting the effectiveness of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in controlling air pollution in the region."

However, quantifying color changes is quite challenging. This research develops a quantitative approach for evaluating the influence of atmospheric aerosol pollution on the appearance of the sky. We first calculated the influence of atmospheric aerosols on the sky’s diffuse radiation, which is the source of sky color. Then, we mapped the diffuse radiation onto a perceptually uniform color space to quantify alterations in sky color. The results reveal that the relationship between aerosol concentration and sky color change follows a logarithmic-like distribution: the higher the concentration, the weaker the change in sky color per unit increase in aerosol concentration. Consequently, during the early phases of air pollution control implementation, there may be minimal observable changes in the color of the sky. However, as these measures are further enforced, a discernible bluing effect on the sky will become evident. Based on the quantification of the change of sky color, a blue-sky index (BSI) was established. We find that concurrent with improvements in air quality resulting from emission reduction measures, the BSI has significantly decreased in recent years in China. This trend indicates an increase in the frequency of blue-sky occurrences."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada2b1,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文利用TROPOMI卫星观测到的甲烷大气数据，估算了美国东南部四个大型垃圾填埋场2019-2023年的甲烷排放量。结果显示，卫星观测到的排放量是垃圾填埋场向美国温室气体报告计划（GHGRP）报告值的6倍，并且在研究期间呈上升趋势，而GHGRP报告的数据则显示下降。论文发现，垃圾填埋场普遍采用“回收优先”模型估算排放量，导致排放量被低估。与之相比，“产生优先”模型的结果与卫星观测结果更一致，都显示排放量增加。论文进一步分析了所有报告垃圾填埋场的GHGRP数据，认为美国温室气体清单中报告的垃圾填埋场排放量下降19%是由于填埋场更倾向于使用“回收优先”模型，而不是实际排放量下降。总的来说，这项研究利用卫星遥感技术监测垃圾填埋场的甲烷排放，揭示了现有报告机制的不足，并强调了更准确的排放估算方法的重要性。,"['methane', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite observations', 'TROPOMI', 'air quality monitoring', 'landfill emissions', 'emission monitoring']",Nicholas Balasus;Daniel J Jacob;Gabriel Maxemin;Carrie Jenks;Hannah Nesser;Joannes D Maasakkers;Daniel H Cusworth;Tia R Scarpelli;Daniel J Varon;Xiaolin Wang,Satellite monitoring of annual US landfill methane emissions and trends,"We use satellite observations of atmospheric methane from the TROPOMI instrument to estimate total annual methane emissions for 2019–2023 from four large Southeast US landfills with gas collection and control systems. The emissions are on average 6× higher than the values reported by the landfills to the US Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) which are used by the US Environmental Protection Agency for its national Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI). We find increasing emissions over the 2019–2023 period whereas the GHGRP reports a decrease. The GHGRP requires gas-collecting landfills to estimate their annual emissions either with a recovery-first model (estimating emissions as a function of methane recovered) or a generation-first model (estimating emissions from a first-order decay applied to waste-in-place). All four landfills choose to use the recovery-first model, which yields emissions that are one-quarter of those from the generation-first model and decreasing over 2019–2023, in contrast with the TROPOMI observations. Our TROPOMI estimates for two of the landfills agree with the generation-first model, with increasing emissions over 2019–2023 due to increasing waste-in-place or decreasing methane recovery, and are still higher than the generation-first model for the other two landfills. Further examination of the GHGRP emissions from all reporting landfills in the US shows that the 19% decrease in landfill emissions reported by the GHGI over 2005–2022 reflects an increasing preference for the recovery-first model by the reporting landfills, rather than an actual emission decrease. The generation-first model would imply an increase in landfill emissions over 2013–2022, and this is more consistent with atmospheric observations."

Knepp,OMPS-LP aerosol extinction coefficients and their applicability in GloSSAC,"The Global Space-based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology (GloSSAC) is essential for understanding and modeling the climatic impacts of stratospheric aerosols, comprising data from various space-based measurements. Here, we examine the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) against other data sets, particularly the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III/ISS, to discern differences and explore the applicability of OMPS data within the GloSSAC framework. 
 The Global Space-based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology (GloSSAC) is essential for understanding and modeling the climatic impacts of stratospheric aerosols. It relies primarily on data from the Stratospheric Aerosol Gas Experiment (SAGE) satellite series, supplemented by the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System (OSIRIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). GloSSAC currently provides stratospheric aerosol extinction coefficients and aerosol optical depths at 525 and 1020 nm. With CALIPSO decommissioned and OSIRIS nearing the end of its operational life, SAGE III/ISS (International Space Station) will soon become the sole data source for GloSSAC, but it will only be available as long as the ISS is operational, until around 2030. Therefore, incorporating other measurements, such as those from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP), is critical. OMPS-LP has provided continuous aerosol extinction coefficient measurements since 2012 with a retrieval algorithm developed by NASA, i.e., OMPS(NASA). However, OMPS(NASA) has been shown to overestimate aerosol extinction coefficients, particularly after the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption, compared to the tomographic retrieval of OMPS developed by the University of Saskatchewan (OMPS(SASK)) and SAGE III/ISS. Our analysis shows that OMPS(NASA) indeed exhibits a consistently high bias (>50 %) following large volcanic eruptions and pyrocumulonimbus plumes from intense wildfires, while OMPS(SASK) shows reasonable agreement with SAGE III/ISS between 40° S and 40° N. This overestimation by OMPS(NASA) leads to an overestimation of the aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) and the associated model-simulated global surface temperature response by a factor of about 2."

A promising option is radio occultation (RO) satellite data, which enable the derivation of winds based on wind approximations. We test how well RO winds describe the ERA5 winds. We separate the total wind difference into the approximation bias and the systematic difference between the two datasets. The results show the utility of RO winds for climate monitoring and analyses. 
 Global long-term stable 3D wind fields provide valuable information for climate-oriented analyses of the dynamics of the atmosphere. Their monitoring remains a challenging task given the shortcomings of available observations. One promising option for progress is the use of radio occultation (RO) satellite data, which enable deriving dynamics based on thermodynamic data. In this study we focus on three main goals, explored through the fifth version of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA5) and RO datasets, using monthly-mean January and July data over 2007–2020. Our focus is on a 2.5° × 2.5° spatial synoptic scale over the free troposphere to the mid-stratosphere (i.e. 800–10 hPa). First, by comparing ERA5-derived geostrophic and gradient wind speeds to the original ERA5 ones, we examine the regions of validity of the studied approximations at a given synoptic-scale resolution. Second, to assess the possible added value of the RO-derived climatic winds in terms of their long-term stability, we test their consistency with the corresponding ERA5-derived winds. Third, by comparing the RO climatic winds to the original ERA5 winds, we evaluate the potential benefit of RO as an additional dataset for wind analyses and climate monitoring. With this three-step analysis, we decompose the total wind speed bias into the contributions from the approximation and the systematic difference between the RO and ERA5 datasets. We find that the geostrophic approximation is a valid method to estimate winds in the free troposphere, while the gradient wind approximation works better in the lower stratosphere. Both approximations generally work well over the mentioned altitudes, within an accuracy of 2 m s−1 for the latitudes 5–82.5°. Exceptions are found in winter in the monsoonal area and above larger mountain ranges in the free troposphere, as well as above the northern polar regions in the mid-stratosphere. RO- and ERA5-derived geostrophic winds mostly showed good agreement (within 2 m s−1). However, temporal change in the systematic difference higher than 0.5 m s−1 per decade was found. This points to a possible impact of changes in the source of the assimilated data in ERA5. The overall high accuracy of the monthly-mean wind fields, backed by the long-term stability and fine vertical resolution of the underlying RO data, highlights the added value and potential benefit of RO-derived climatic winds for climate monitoring and analyses."

Conventionally, this is performed using a known aerosol source, which has reliability issues. In this paper, we present a technique for OPS calibration which involves placing objects in the instrument that generate a known response. This fibre calibration method was more reliable than a conventional calibration. 
 Calibrations of optical particle spectrometers (OPSs) are non-trivial and conventionally involve aerosolisation techniques, which are challenging for larger particles. In this paper, we present a new technique for OPS calibration that involves mounting a static fibre within the instrument sample area, measuring the scattering cross section (SCS), and then comparing the SCS with a calculated value. In addition, we present a case for the use of generalised Lorenz–Mie theory (GLMT) simulations to account for deviations in both minor- and major-axis beam intensity, which has a significant effect on particles that are large compared with the beam waist, in addition to reducing the need for a “top-hat” spatial intensity profile. The described technique is OPS independent and could be applied to a field calibration tool that could be used to verify the calibration of instruments before they are deployed. In addition to this, the proposed calibration technique would be suited for applications involving the mass production of low-cost OPSs."

Ice crystals were grown in the Manchester Ice Cloud Chamber, collected, and subsequently imaged using various techniques, including a scanning optical profilometer, which enabled the identification of roughness features as small as 0.8 µm. This approach provides critical insights into roughness characteristics that are significant for improving radiative transfer models and forecasts."
10.5194/essd-2024-553,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,这篇论文研究的是利用卫星遥感数据和深度学习技术生成全球长时间序列土壤湿度产品。它使用了40年的AVHRR卫星数据（包括地表反照率和地表温度），结合其他多源数据集，通过训练多种深度学习模型（LSTM，Bi-LSTM，AtLSTM和Transformer），最终生成一个空间分辨率为5公里，时间跨度为1982年到2021年的全球每日土壤湿度数据集。该研究的重点在于利用深度学习技术提高土壤湿度估算的精度和时空完整性，并验证了该产品的可靠性。虽然研究本身并非直接针对大气成分分析，但它利用了卫星遥感技术获取的地表信息（地表温度和反照率），这些信息与大气环境密切相关，并且该土壤湿度产品可用于气候变化研究、干旱监测等与大气环境相关的应用。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有密切联系。,"['Land surface temperature', 'Albedo', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Soil moisture', 'AVHRR', 'Drought monitoring', 'Climate change research', 'Deep learning']",Yufang Zhang;Shunlin Liang;Han Ma;Tao He;Feng Tian;Guodong Zhang;Jianglei Xu,A seamless global daily 5 km soil moisture product from 1982 to 2021 using AVHRR satellite data and an attention-based deep learning model,"Soil moisture (SM) plays a vital role in climate, agriculture, and hydrology, yet reliable long-term seamless global datasets remain scarce. To fill this gap, we developed a four-decade seamless global daily 5 km SM product using multi-source datasets and deep learning techniques. This product has long-term coverage, spatial and temporal integrity, and high accuracy, making it a valuable tool for applications like SM trend analysis, drought monitoring, and assessing vegetation responses. 
 Soil moisture (SM) data records longer than 30 years are critical for climate change research and various applications. However, only a few such long-term global SM datasets exist, and they often suffer from large biases, low spatial resolution, or spatiotemporal incompleteness. Here, we generated a consistent and seamless global SM product from 1982 to 2021 using deep learning (DL) by integrating four decades of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) albedo and land surface temperature products with multi-source datasets. Considering the temporal autocorrelation of SM, we explored two types of DL models that are adept at processing sequential data, including three long short-term memory (LSTM)-based models, i.e., the basic LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and Attention-based LSTM (AtLSTM), as well as a Transformer model. We also compared the performance of the DL models with the tree-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, known for its high efficiency and accuracy. Our results show that all four DL models outperformed the benchmark XGBoost model, particularly at high SM levels (> 0.4 m3 m-3). The AtLSTM model achieved the highest accuracy on the test set, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.987 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.011 m3 m-3. These results suggest that utilizing temporal information as well as adding an attention module can effectively enhance the estimation accuracy of SM. Subsequent analysis of attention weights revealed that the AtLSTM model could automatically learn the necessary temporal information from adjacent positions in the sequence, which is critical for accurate SM estimation. The best-performing AtLSTM model was then adopted to produce a four-decade seamless global SM dataset at 5 km spatial resolution, denoted as the GLASS-AVHRR SM product. Validation of the GLASS-AVHRR SM product using 45 independent International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) stations prior to 2000 yielded a median correlation coefficient (R) of 0.73 and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) of 0.041 m3 m-3. When validated against SM datasets from three post-2000 field-scale COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) networks, the median R values ranged from 0.63 to 0.79, and the median ubRMSE values ranged from 0.044 to 0.065 m3 m-3. Further validation across 22 upscaled 9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) core validation sites indicated that it could well capture the temporal variations in measured SM and remained unaffected by the large wet biases present in the input European reanalysis (ERA5-Land) SM product. Moreover, characterized by complete spatial coverage and low biases, this four-decade, 5 km GLASS-AVHRR SM product exhibited high spatial and temporal consistency with the 1 km GLASS-MODIS SM product, and contained much richer spatial details than both the long-term ERA5-Land SM product (0.1°) and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative combined SM product (0.25°). The annual average GLASS-AVHRR SM dataset from 1982 to 2021 is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14198201 (Zhang et al., 2024), and the complete product can be freely downloaded from https://glass.hku.hk/casual/GLASS_AVHRR_SM/."

Proper comparison requires generating, storing, and handling a large amount of data. This work describes the first step in the development of a new set of software tools, the VISION toolkit, which can enable the easy and efficient integration of observational and model data required for model evaluation. 
 This work presents the first step in the development of the VISION toolkit, a set of Python tools that allows easy, efficient, and more meaningful comparison between global atmospheric models and observational data. Whilst observational data and modelling capabilities are expanding in parallel, there are still barriers preventing these two data sources from being used in synergy. This arises from differences in spatial and temporal sampling between models and observational platforms: observational data from a research aircraft, for example, are sampled on specified flight trajectories at very high temporal resolution. Proper comparison with model data requires generating, storing, and handling a large number of highly temporally resolved model files, resulting in a process which is data-, labour-, and time-intensive. In this paper we focus on comparison between model data and in situ observations (from aircraft, ships, buoys, sondes, etc.). A standalone code, In-Situ Observations Simulator, or ISO_simulator for short, is described here: this software reads modelled variables and observational data files and outputs model data interpolated in space and time to match observations. These model data are then written to NetCDF files that can be efficiently archived due to their small sizes and directly compared to observations. This method achieves a large reduction in the size of model data being produced for comparison with flight and other in situ data. By interpolating global gridded hourly files onto observation locations, we reduce data output for a typical climate resolution run, from ∼3 Gb per model variable per month to ∼15 Mb per model variable per month (a 200-times reduction in data volume). The VISION toolkit is relatively fast to run and can be automated to process large volumes of data at once, allowing efficient data analysis over a large number of years. Although this code was initially tested within the Unified Model (UM) framework, which is shared by the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), it was written as a flexible tool and it can be extended to work with other models."

These effects need to be addressed to better capture and comprehend the evolution of BB-SOA in the atmosphere. Cresol (C7H8O) is used as a BB proxy to investigate these effects. It is emitted directly from BB and has been identified as a significant SOA precursor from residential wood-burning emissions. The gas- and particle-phase signal intensities are investigated using online mass spectrometers. An increase in the SOA mass yield of 7% is observed when the RH rises from 0.5–20 to 70–87%. At elevated RH, a significant increase in the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds is observed due to particle-phase processes. This is linked to a net decrease in the SOA viscosity, enabling these compounds to be formed to a greater extent at elevated RH in the presence of nitrogen oxides. These results  highlight the importance of the particle water content for the molecular formation and aging of BB-SOA compounds."

Particle-bound HgP formation in the atmosphere stems mainly from the adsorption of reactive gaseous HgII on aerosol particles, particularly sea salt aerosol. However, the observed comparable abundance of HgP over HgII in the marine atmosphere has not been reproduced by traditional statistics-based schemes, which were constructed by continental observations. This study incorporated an improved mechanistic scheme in an atmospheric chemical transport model to simulate SSA-bound HgP cycling processes in the marine atmosphere. Results show that a widely used statistics-based scheme could reproduce atmospheric HgP concentrations over continents but failed to reproduce the concentrations over the ocean. The HgP concentrations particularly relative abundance of HgP over HgII in the marine atmosphere could be successfully reproduced by the process-based scheme. Accordingly, a new global atmospheric Hg cycling budget was constructed, manifesting mainly in the atmospheric burden of 4 Mg, dry deposition of 160 Mg yr–1, and wet deposition of 1410 Mg yr–1 for SSA-bound HgP. The new insight on the global atmospheric Hg budget sheds light on the re-examination of Hg deposition risks in the ocean owing to a transition from previously recognized gaseous HgII deposition to unrecognized particulate HgP deposition over the ocean."

While the cooling effect of parks has been explored in individual satellite‐based studies, a global, multi‐year investigation has been lacking. This study provides a comprehensive global assessment of the daytime surface park cool island (SPCI) climatology, using land surface temperatures from 2,083 systematically selected parks worldwide (2013–2022). Through detailed park selection and data stratification, the key drivers influencing the observed SPCI intensity are isolated. The analysis reveals that cooling is strongly linked to park type, with well‐treed parks being, on average, 3.4°C, cooler than the surrounding urban area during summer. It is further investigated how SPCI is influenced by seasonal variations, droughts, and urban morphology across diverse background climates. These findings, along with the developed global SPCI data set, offer critical insights for designing climate‐resilient green spaces."

This study investigated the impact of snow cover anomaly over the Russian Far East during spring (March–April) on the succeeding early summer (May–June) precipitation variability in NEC as well as the underlying physical mechanisms during the years 1961–2020 based on diagnostic analyses and model simulation. The results showed that, on the interannual timescale, the decreased (increased) spring snow cover over the Russian Far East is conducive to the increased (decreased) NEC early summer precipitation. Further analyses indicated that the negative anomaly of spring snow cover can persist into early summer, which then enhances the diabatic heating and thereby warms the overlying atmosphere via the snow‐albedo effect. The warming atmosphere favors the intensified Okhotsk High and an associated prominent anticyclonic circulation over northeast Asia. The anomalous southeast winds on the southwest flank of the anticyclone could bring abundant water vapor to the NEC, induce moisture convergence and ascending motion, and eventually contribute to the above‐than‐normal precipitation. These physical processes operate in the opposite manner in the case of the positive anomaly of spring snow cover. Our findings are beneficial to further improve the understanding and prediction ability of the summer precipitation variability over NEC."

The atmospheric oxidation process for nitrate formation has been deemed a key factor in pollution; however, the changes of sources and oxidation pathways during a particular haze episode require further investigation. Here, daily dual isotopes (δ15N and δ18O) were used to quantify the sources and oxidation pathways of nitrate formation in Qingdao, a port city in Northern China, from September 2017 to February 2018. This study also includes a detailed introduction to two haze episodes. δ15N and δ18O results show that both fractions of nocturnal oxidation for nitrate formation and NOx from coal combustion were lower in warmer season and higher in colder season. The fractions increased with increasing PM2.5 under low PM2.5 concentration while the fractions were not significantly changed under higher PM2.5 concentration, dominated by nocturnal oxidation (70.6% ± 9.7%) and coal combustion (66.1% ± 18.2%), respectively. The haze episode 1 was attributed to smoke transported over long distances, which provided a large amount of aerosol particles to absorb more locally formed gaseous HNO3 or N2O5. In this episode, meteorological and air quality factors, nitrate sources, and formation mechanism did not obviously change. Haze episode 2 was caused by unfavorable meteorological factors that enhanced local nitrate accumulation. As pollution worsened, the oxidation pathway shifted from OH oxidation to N2O5 hydrolysis, and the primary source changed from coal combustion to more vehicle exhaust."

Hooda;Antti‐Pekka Hyvärinen,In Situ Characterization of Dust Storms and Their Snow‐Darkening Effect Over Himalayas,"In this study, we used satellite observations to identify 10 typical dust‐loading events over the Indian Himalayas. Next, the aerosol microphysical and optical properties during these identified dust storms are characterized using cotemporal in situ measurements over Mukteshwar, a representative site in Indian Himalayas. Relative to the background values, the mass of coarse particles (size range between 2.5 and 10 μm) and the extinction coefficient were found to be enhanced by 400% (from 24 ± 15 to 98 ± 40 μg/m3) and 175% (from 89 ± 57 Mm−1 to 156 ± 79 Mm−1), respectively, during these premonsoonal dust‐loading events. Moreover, based on the air mass trajectory, these dust storms can be categorized into two categories: (a) mineral dust events (MDEs), which involve long‐range transported dust plumes traversing through the lower troposphere to reach the Himalayas and (b) polluted dust events (PDEs), which involve short‐range transported dust plumes originating from the arid western regions of the Indian subcontinent and traveling within the heavily polluted boundary layer of the Gangetic plains before reaching the Himalayas. Interestingly, compared to the background, the SSA and AAE decrease during PDEs but increase during MDEs. More importantly, we observe a twofold increase in black carbon concentrations and the aerosol absorption coefficient (relative to the background values) during the PDEs with negligible changes during MDEs. Consequently, the aerosol‐induced snow albedo reduction (SAR) also doubles during MDEs and PDEs relative to background conditions. Thus, our findings provide robust observational evidence of substantial dust‐induced snow and glacier melting over the Himalayas."

This study discusses the pathway that explains the rapid connection from high altitude mesospheric ozone to surface regional climate. 
 Solar driven energetic particle precipitation (EPP) is an important factor in polar atmospheric ozone balance and has been linked to ground-level regional climate variability. However, the linking mechanism has remained ambiguous. The observed and simulated ground-level changes start well before the processes from the main candidate, the so-called EPP-indirect effect, would start. Here we show that initial reduction of polar mesospheric ozone and the resulting change in atmospheric heating rapidly couples to dynamics, transferring the signal downwards, shifting the tropospheric jet polewards. This pathway is not constrained to the polar vortex. Rather, a subtropical route initiated by a changing wind shear plays a key role. Our results show that the signal propagates downwards in timescales consistent with observed tropospheric level climatic changes linked to EPP. This pathway, from mesospheric ozone to regional climate, is independent of the EPP-indirect effect, and solves the long-standing mechanism problem for EPP effects on climate. Energetically charged particles affect polar ozone levels and have been linked to surface climate variability.

 Although air pollution has been reported to be related to cardiopulmonary diseases, the evidence available for the effects on multimorbidity progression across different stages was unclear. Based on 273,388 residents from the UK biobank, we carried out the multistate model to explore the relations of long-term exposure to air pollution with hazard ratios (HRs) of transitions among respiratory diseases, ischemic heart disease (IHD)and death, and mediation analyses to assess the role of intermediate diseases played in such associations. During a median follow-up of 10.8 years, 11,774 participants had first respiratory diseases, of which 1,268 (10.77%) developed IHD, and 15,002 had first IHD, of which 1,336 (8.91%) developed respiratory diseases. PM2.5, NO2, and NOX were consistently and significantly associated with the risk of transitions from baseline to respiratory diseases and IHD, from respiratory diseases to IHD and death, from IHD to respiratory diseases and death, particularly among overweight and obese adults.

Furthermore, intermediated diseases were partially involved in the association of air pollution with subsequent diseases and death. Accordingly, our findings provided evidence of positive and dose-responsive associations of air pollution and risk of multiple transitions among cardiopulmonary diseases, and death, particularly for IHD subsequently developed respiratory diseases, which suggesting more attention ought to pay for a far-profound influence of air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases."

Satellite-based methods are commonly used for phenology estimation but still struggle to capture interannual variations of phenological events. The importance of climate variation in crop phenology has been well acknowledged, but the potential of incorporating climate data to improve phenology estimation remains unclear. Here, we developed a hybrid model by incorporating the growth-specific climate predictors and satellite-derived phenology using random forest approach. Results showed that our hybrid model successfully reduced errors by over 60% compared to traditional satellite-based methods. The inclusion of climate data provided additional contributions beyond what was offered by satellite data, resulting in a 13% average improvement in R2. Among climate predictors, temperature-related indicators contributed the most to accuracy enhancement. Additionally, CSIF outperformed LAI in the hybrid model in terms of absolute error, due to its finer temporal resolution. Our hybrid model highlights the importance of considering the diverse climatic information to further improve crop phenology estimation, rather than relying solely on satellite data. We expect our proposed model can offer new insights into improving crop phenology estimation and understanding the effects of climate variations on crop phenology."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada6df,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了气候变暖对全球陆地大气水汽变化的影响。利用欧洲中期天气预报中心再分析资料集（ERA5），研究者分析了1982年至2020年期间大气水汽变化对气温上升的响应。结果显示，全球约四分之三的陆地地区，大气水汽和气温同时上升，这种正响应主要受蒸散发增加和低海拔地区的影响；而约五分之一的陆地地区，大气水汽随气温上升而下降，主要集中在南美洲东南部和北美洲西南部，这与土壤干旱化有关。研究还发现，这种正负响应的季节性差异，以及土壤干旱化对这种响应的影响。该研究使用了遥感技术获取的大范围数据，对理解气候变化背景下大气水汽变化的空间分布和机制具有重要意义。,"['atmospheric water vapor', 'temperature', 'evapotranspiration', 'soil desiccation', 'satellite remote sensing', 'climate warming', 'global land surface temperature']",Ruonan Wang;Xingwang Fan;Yongwei Liu;Xiaosong Zhao;Rong Wang;Yuanbo Liu,Divergent impacts of soil desiccation on atmospheric water vapor–temperature responses regulated by evapotranspiration,"Climate warming induces temporally varying atmospheric water vapor (WV), yet the spatial distribution of opposing trends across global land remains elusive. Here, we use the monthly European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 dataset to discern the responses of WV changes to the rising air temperature from 1982 to 2020. Simultaneous increases in both the WV and air temperature are observed over approximately three-quarters of global land, with a median of 0.21 mm·K–1, particularly evident in the tropics. Strong positive responses are primarily influenced by increasing trends in evapotranspiration (ET) and low-elevation areas. About one-fifth of global land shows a decline in WV with a median of −0.62 mm·K–1, predominantly in southeastern South America and southwestern North America. Negative responses are also driven by ET trends, where strong ET enhances these effects that are less pronounced in high-altitude regions. The prevalence of a positive response is highest during September–October–November (81%), while a negative response was observed most in December–January–February (35%). The spatial distribution of negative responses generally aligns with soil desiccation patterns; soil desiccation exacerbates negative responses in humid regions due to evaporative cooling but mitigates them in arid regions due to intensified warming. This study enhances our comprehension regarding the divergent responses of atmospheric WV toward global warming."

Fuller,Tropical upper-tropospheric trends in ozone and carbon monoxide (2005–2020): observational and model results,"We compare observed changes in ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the tropical upper troposphere (10–15 km altitude) for 2005–2020 to predictions from model simulations that track the evolution of natural and industrial emissions transported to this region. An increasing trend in measured upper-tropospheric O3 is well matched by model trends. We find that changes in modeled industrial CO surface emissions lead to better model agreement with observed slight decreases in upper-tropospheric CO. 
 We analyze tropical ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) distributions in the upper troposphere (UT) for 2005–2020 using Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations and simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and two variants of the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-chem), with each variant using different anthropogenic CO emissions. Trends and variability diagnostics are obtained from multiple linear regression. The MLS zonal mean O3 UT trend for 20° S–20° N is +0.39 ± 0.28 % yr−1; the WACCM and CAM-chem simulations yield similar trends, although the WACCM result is somewhat smaller. Our analyses of gridded MLS data yield positive O3 trends (up to 1.4 % yr−1) over Indonesia and east of that region, as well as over Africa and the Atlantic. These positive mapped O3 trends are generally captured by the simulations but in a more muted way. We find broad similarities (and some differences) between mapped MLS UT O3 trends and corresponding mapped trends of tropospheric column ozone. The MLS zonal mean CO UT trend for 20° S–20° N is −0.25 ± 0.30 % yr−1, while the corresponding CAM-chem trend is 0.0 ± 0.14 % yr−1 when anthropogenic emissions are taken from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) version 2. The CAM-chem simulation driven by CAMS-GLOB-ANTv5 emissions yields a tropical mean CO UT trend of 0.22 ± 0.19 % yr−1, in contrast to the slightly negative MLS CO trend. Previously published analyses of total column CO data have shown negative trends.Our tropical composition trend results contribute to continuing international assessments of tropospheric evolution."
10.5194/acp-25-639-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了CO2日变化周期对全球和区域反演估算碳通量的影响。研究发现，忽略CO2的日变化会导致对地表-大气CO2通量进行系统性偏差，尤其是在使用白天选择的CO2测量数据进行大气反演时。这种偏差会影响区域和大陆尺度的年度碳通量估算结果，虽然对全球总通量的影响可以忽略不计，但在区域尺度上，例如欧洲，偏差可达年度后验通量的48%。研究使用了CarboScope大气反演系统和FLUXCOM-X数据进行分析，结果表明，忽略CO2日变化会导致对热带地区CO2源和温带地区CO2汇的估计值产生高估。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到利用大气中的CO2浓度数据（可以由卫星或地面观测站获取）反演地表碳通量，这属于大气成分分析和碳循环研究的范畴。,"['CO2', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Flux Estimation', 'Atmospheric Inversion', 'Carbon Cycle', 'Regional-scale inversions', 'Global-scale inversions', 'Satellite observation (implied)']",Saqr Munassar;Christian Rödenbeck;Michał Gałkowski;Frank-Thomas Koch;Kai U. Totsche;Santiago Botía;Christoph Gerbig,To what extent does the CO2 diurnal cycle impact flux estimates derived from global and regional inversions?,"CO2 mole fractions simulated over a global set of stations showed an overestimation of CO2 if the diurnal cycle is missing in biogenic fluxes. This leads to biases in the estimated fluxes derived from the regional-scale inversions. Interannual variability of estimated biogenic fluxes is also affected by the exclusion of the CO2 diurnal cycle. The findings point to the importance of including the diurnal variations of CO2 in the biogenic fluxes used as priors in global and regional inversions. 
 Ignoring the diurnal cycle in surface-to-atmosphere CO2 fluxes leads to a systematic bias in CO2 mole fraction simulations sampled at daytime because the daily mean flux systematically misses the CO2 uptake during the daytime hours. In an atmospheric inversion using daytime-selected CO2 measurements at most continental sites and not resolving diurnal cycles in the flux, this leads to systematic biases in the estimates of the annual sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2. This study focuses on quantifying the impact of this diurnal cycle effect on the annual carbon fluxes estimated with the CarboScope (CS) atmospheric inversion at regional, continental, and global scales for the period of time 2010–2020. Our analysis is based on biogenic fluxes of hourly net ecosystem exchange (NEE) obtained from the data-driven FLUXCOM-X estimates, together with global and regional atmospheric transport models. Differences between CO2 mixing ratios simulated with daily averaged and hourly NEE from FLUXCOM-X range between around −2.5 and 7 ppm averaged annually throughout a site network across the world. These differences lead to systematic biases in CO2 flux estimates from the atmospheric inversions. Although the impact on the global total flux is negligible (around 2 % of the overall land flux of −1.79 Pg C yr−1), we find significant biases in the annual flux budgets at continental and regional scales. For Europe, the annual mean difference in the fluxes arising indirectly from the diurnal cycle of CO2 through the boundary condition amounts to around 48 % of the annual posterior fluxes (0.31 Pg C yr−1) estimated with CarboScope-Regional (CSR). Furthermore, the differences in NEE estimates calculated with CS increase the magnitude of the flux budgets for some regions such as North American temperate forests and northern Africa by a factor of about 1.5. To the extent that FLUXCOM-X diurnal cycles are realistic at all latitudes and for the station set including many continental stations as used in our inversions here, we conclude that ignoring the diurnal variations in the land CO2 flux leads to overestimation of both CO2 sources in the tropical lands and CO2 sinks in the temperate zones."

High summer BB rBC peaks may reduce the ice sheet albedo, but BB rBC showed no increase until the early 2000s. These results are vital for validating aerosol and climate models. 
 The roles and impacts of refractory black carbon (rBC), an important aerosol species affecting Earth's radiation budget, are not well understood owing to a lack of accurate long-term observations. To study the temporal changes in rBC since the pre-industrial period, we analyzed rBC in an ice core drilled in northwestern Greenland. Using an improved technique for rBC measurement and a continuous flow analysis (CFA) system, we obtained accurate and high-temporal-resolution records of rBC particle size and mass/number concentrations for the past 350 years. Number and mass concentrations, which both started to increase in the 1870s associated with the inflow of anthropogenically derived rBC, reached their maxima in the 1910s–1920s and then subsequently decreased. Backward-trajectory analyses suggest that North America was likely the dominant source region of the anthropogenic rBC in the ice core. The increase in anthropogenic rBC shifted the annual concentration peaks of rBC from summer to winter–early spring. After rBC concentrations diminished to pre-industrial levels, the annual peak concentration of rBC returned to the summer. We found that anthropogenic rBC particles were larger than biomass burning rBC particles. By separating the rBC in winter and summer, we reconstructed the temporal variations in rBC that originated from biomass burning, including the period with large anthropogenic input. The rBC that originated from biomass burning showed no trend in increase until the early 2000s. Finally, possible albedo reductions due to rBC are discussed. Our new data provide key information for validating aerosol and climate models, thereby supporting improved projections of future climate and environment."

We still have a limited understanding of the complex functioning of the instrument; therefore, we applied machine learning to provide insights from CIMS analyses. We were able to predict both detection and signal intensity with a fair error, and we found out the most important structural fragments for negative ionization schemes (NH and OH) and positive ones (nitrogen-containing groups). 
 Chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) is widely used in atmospheric chemistry studies. However, due to the complex interactions between reagent ions and target compounds, chemical understanding remains limited and compound identification difficult. In this study, we apply machine learning to a reference dataset of pesticides in two standard solutions to build a model that can provide insights from CIMS analyses in atmospheric science. The CIMS measurements were performed with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a thermal desorption multi-scheme chemical ionization inlet unit (TD-MION-MS) with both negative and positive ionization modes utilizing Br−, O2-, H3O+ and (CH3)2COH+ (AceH+) as reagent ions. We then trained two machine learning methods on these data: (1) random forest (RF) for classifying if a pesticide can be detected with CIMS and (2) kernel ridge regression (KRR) for predicting the expected CIMS signals. We compared their performance on five different representations of the molecular structure: the topological fingerprint (TopFP), the molecular access system keys (MACCS), a custom descriptor based on standard molecular properties (RDKitPROP), the Coulomb matrix (CM) and the many-body tensor representation (MBTR). The results indicate that MACCS outperforms the other descriptors. Our best classification model reaches a prediction accuracy of 0.85 ± 0.02 and a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.91 ± 0.01. Our best regression model reaches an accuracy of 0.44 ± 0.03 logarithmic units of the signal intensity. Subsequent feature importance analysis of the classifiers reveals that the most important sub-structures are NH and OH for the negative ionization schemes and nitrogen-containing groups for the positive ionization schemes."

 The tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) values measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) were used to study the NO2 variability and estimate urban NOx emissions for 261 major cities worldwide. The used algorithm isolated three components in tropospheric NO2 data – background NO2, NO2 from urban sources, and NO2 from industrial point sources – and then each of these components was analyzed separately. The method is based on fitting satellite data by a statistical model with empirical plume dispersion functions driven by a meteorological reanalysis. Unlike other similar studies that studied plumes from emission point sources, this study included the background component as a function of the elevation in the analysis and separated urban emissions from emissions from industrial point sources. Population density and surface elevation data as well as coordinates of industrial sources were used in the analysis. The largest per capita emissions were found in the Middle East,  and the smallest were in India and southern Africa. The largest background component was observed over China and parts of Europe, while the smallest was over South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Differences between workday and weekend emissions were also studied. Urban emissions on Sundays (or Fridays for some countries) are typically 20 %–50 % less than workday emissions for all regions except China. The background component typically does not show any significant differences between workdays and weekends,  suggesting that background NO2 has a substantially longer lifetime compared to that in the urban and industrial plumes."

Containing all types of halogens, coal fired power plants (CFPPs) are among the major anthropogenic sources of atmospheric halogens. However, comprehensive estimates of halogen emissions from CFPPs in China remain limited, despite significant advancements in scale and pollution control. This study developed a detailed emissions inventory for all halogens from CFPPs using multisource data and the mass balance method, analyzing their spatiotemporal variations, driving forces, and future trends under climate goals. Results showed fluctuating halogen emissions from 2018 to 2022, with F, Cl, Br, and I reaching 6,875.7 t, 24,872.4 t, 1,127.9 t, and 476.7 t in 2022, respectively. Emissions were predominately concentrated in key coal resource areas and high-energy-consuming regions. Increased coal consumption was the primary driver of emissions growth, while improvements in pollution control and power generation technology contributed to reductions. Under air pollution control and climate goals, halogen emissions are expected to peak before 2030 and decline rapidly thereafter, with near-elimination by 2050. Combining strict air pollutants and carbon control technologies would offer the greatest reduction potential."

However, direct observations linking river mobility and water discharge variability are scarce. Here, we pair multi‐annual measurements of daily water discharge and river mobility, estimated from Landsat, for 48 rivers worldwide. We show that, across climates and planforms, river mobility is correlated with water discharge variability over daily, intra‐annual, and inter‐annual timescales. For similar mean discharge, higher discharge variability is associated with up to an order‐of‐magnitude faster floodplain reworking. A random forest regression model indicates that discharge variability is the primary predictor of river mobility, when compared to mean water discharge, sediment concentration, and channel‐bed slope. Our results suggest that enhanced hydro‐climatic extremes could accelerate future river mobility, and that past changes to discharge variability may explain the fabric of fluvial strata."

These highlands include the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolian Plateau, Iranian and Anatolian Plateaus, South African Plateau, mountain regions in western North America, and Andes Mountains. In terms of both proportion and average energy, high‐energy WWLLN strokes show a stronger correlation with highlands than high‐energy LIS events. Considering the different observation modes of WWLLN and LIS, this may suggest a stronger connection between highlands and high‐energy lightning strokes occurring beneath and in the lower parts of thunderstorms."

From an energy‐balance perspective, the current Arctic climate is in radiative‐advective equilibrium (RAE) regime, in which radiative cooling is balanced by advective heat flux convergence. Exploiting a suite of climate model simulations with varying carbon dioxide (CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$) concentrations, we link the northern high‐latitude regime variation and transition to AA. The dominance of RAE regime in northern high‐latitudes under CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ reduction relates to stronger AA, whereas the RAE regime transition to non‐RAE regime under CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increase corresponds to a weaker AA. Examinations on the spatial and seasonal structures reveal that lapse‐rate and sea‐ice processes are crucial mechanisms. Our findings suggest that if CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration continues to rise, the Arctic could transition into a non‐RAE regime accompanied with a weaker AA."

Both heatwaves and rainstorms can be exacerbated by the presence of cities, but the response of their compounding to urbanization remains unclear especially at the hourly scale. Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal responses of hourly HW_HR to a typical urban agglomeration, the Pearl River Delta, using observations and scenario‐based numerical simulations. Compared to rural areas, the observations show that HW_HR in urban areas has a higher probability of occurrence and mean intensity, and its diurnal cycle of frequency is narrower, peaking in the afternoon. The temporal and spatial response of HW_HR intensity to urbanization effects is the most significant, with the urbanization‐induced increase in HW_HR being five times that in non‐heatwave preconditioned‐heavy rainfall (noHW_HR). Our simulations support the observations and suggest that urbanization‐induced changes are intense and spatially heterogeneous in HW_HR but relatively weak and spatially continuous in noHW_HR. The simulations also suggest that heatwave preconditioning not only amplifies urbanization‐induced changes in key variables that alter atmospheric conditions but also provides a pre‐storm unstable environment for the urban‐induced warm‐dry surface to trigger and enhance convection. The sub‐daily pre‐storm environment suggests that the preconditioning‐induced thermodynamic changes gradually decrease, whereas the dynamic changes gradually increase as the event approaches. Our study highlights the importance of understanding urbanization effects on preconditioned events, providing new insights into the role of preconditions in the urban water cycle."

The factors associated with organic nitrate, as identified through two receptor methods, exhibited consistent daily patterns in spring, summer, and autumn, although source contributions varied. The NOx+ ratio method reported higher organic nitrate levels than the PMF and ME2 methods, likely due to the fixed RON/RAN parameter. Seasonal RON/RAN parameters were optimized based on precursor emissions in Shanghai, achieving values of 3.13 in spring, 2.25 in summer, and 1.88 in autumn. This optimization reduced discrepancies in organic nitrate using the NOx+ ratio to 3.2–7.4%.

 Permafrost is a considerable carbon reservoir harboring up to 1700 petagrams of carbon accumulated over millennia, which can be mobilized as permafrost thaws under global warming. Recent studies have highlighted that a fraction of this carbon can be transformed to atmospheric volatile organic compounds, which can affect the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. In this study, active layer soils from the seasonally unfrozen layer above the permafrost were collected from two distinct locations of the Greenlandic permafrost and incubated to explore their roles in the soil-atmosphere exchange of volatile organic compounds. Results show that these soils can actively function as sinks of these compounds, despite their different physiochemical properties. Upper active layer possessed relatively higher uptake capacities; factors including soil moisture, organic matter, and microbial biomass carbon were identified as the main factors correlating with the uptake rates. Additionally, uptake coefficients for several compounds were calculated for their potential use in future model development. Correlation analysis and the varying coefficients indicate that the sink was likely biotic. The development of a deeper active layer under climate change may enhance the sink capacity and reduce the net emissions of volatile organic compounds from permafrost thaw.

 While Saharan dust’s influence on sea surface temperature variability in the tropical North Atlantic is well-documented, its effects on the equatorial region remain underexplored. This relationship is particularly important due to the strong influence of equatorial Atlantic variability on both local and remote climates. Here, we use observational and reanalysis data to investigate Saharan dust’s role in boreal winter, a period when dust transport is typically near the equator. A unique footprint of Saharan dust forcing is revealed, as well as a complex, non-monotonic response. Specifically, in contrast to the expected cooling due to shortwave blocking by Saharan dust, lower tropospheric warming, and stabilization lead to a strong sea surface warming off the coast of northwestern Africa and to the development of an off-equatorial warm front. The front drives cross-equatorial winds that induce a northward shift of the Atlantic rain belt, equatorial cooling, and equatorial wave activity leading to delayed equatorial warming. Winter Saharan dust is therefore an important contributor to equatorial Atlantic variability, with cross-regional implications. Saharan dust plume anomalies trigger thermodynamic and ocean-dynamic feedbacks that influence equatorial Atlantic sea surface temperature variability, suggest analyses of observations and reanalysis data."

 Understanding the uncertainties associated with methane emission estimates is crucial for prioritizing leak repair interventions, enforcing environmental regulations, and modeling climate change. This paper presents a model-based Bayesian approach for describing the uncertainties associated with methane emissions estimates derived from vehicle-based concentration measurements, combined with the Gaussian plume dispersion model (GPM) and anemometry data. The approach begins by deriving a probability density function (pdf) that defines the likelihood of measuring a given release rate conditional on the true release rate. The width of the likelihood pdf is dominated by the GPM model error, which is explored using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The likelihood pdf is combined with a prior pdf that encodes what is known about the emission before the measurement to yield the posterior pdf, which comprehensively defines what is known about the release rate based on measurements and prior information. The technique is assessed by comparing releases inferred from single plume transects with ground truth emission rates, and it is found that the 90% creditability interval contains the true release rate approximately 90% of the time. The Bayesian approach can also be used to optimize measurement paths and/or consider the limitations of these technologies with respect to atmospheric conditions."

These models utilize the Fast Lightweight Automated Machine Learning (FLAML) framework, using variables of LUE models, to investigate the potential of estimating site-scale GPP. 
 Accurately estimating Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle. Satellite-based Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models are commonly employed for simulating GPP. However, the variables and algorithms related to environmental limiting factors differ significantly across various LUE models. In this work, we developed a series of FLAML-LUE models tailored for different ecosystems. These models utilize the Fast Lightweight Automated Machine Learning (FLAML) framework, using variables of LUE models, to investigate the potential of estimating site-scale GPP. Incorporating meteorological data, eddy covariance measurements, and remote sensing indices, we employed FLAML-LUE models to assess the impact of various variable combinations on GPP across different temporal scales, including daily, 8-day, 16-day, and monthly intervals. Cross-validation analyses indicated that the effectiveness of FLAML-LUE models for forest ecosystems varied significantly across different sites, with R² values ranging from 0.56 to 0.94. For grassland ecosystems, R² values ranged from 0.62 to 0.87, and for cropland ecosystems, R² values ranged from 0.78 to 0.88. Extending the time scale of input data could significantly enhance the accuracy of model simulations. Specifically, the average R2 increased from 0.82 to 0.92 for forest ecosystems, 0.79 to 0.83 for grassland ecosystems, and 0.84 to 0.87 for farmland ecosystems. Additionally, the importance ranking method indicated that vegetation index and temperature were the most important variables for GPP estimation in forest, grassland, and farmland ecosystems, while the importance of the moisture index was relatively low. This study offers an approach to estimate GPP fluxes and evaluate the impact of variables on GPP estimation. It has the potential to be applied in predicting GPP for different vegetation types at a regional scale."

Selective catalytic oxidation (SCO) is a promising technology for ammonia abatement, but current catalysts often struggle with insufficient activity and poor nitrogen selectivity, leading to the formation of secondary pollutants. In this study, we developed a bifunctional Ru/Cu-CHA zeolite catalyst for ammonia oxidation, incorporating both SCO sites (Ru) and selective catalytic reduction sites (SCR, Cu). Various characterizations, including HAADF-STEM, XAFS, and H2-TPR, revealed that Cu2+ cations are dispersed within the CHA zeolite, while RuOx clusters and nanoparticles are present both inside and on the surface of the zeolite. Operando DRIFTS-MS, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations confirmed that NH3 adsorbed on Cu2+ Lewis acid sites efficiently reduced RuO2 with a lower energy barrier, significantly enhancing the low-temperature activity of the Ru/Cu-CHA catalyst. Additionally, Cu2+ cations further facilitated the elimination of byproducts (NOx) via the tandem SCR reaction, thus greatly improving the nitrogen selectivity.

Our results uncovered the importance of BB emissions on haze formation in urban areas in the SCB and provided new insights into pollutant mitigation strategies in the region."

However, the favorable weather patterns for transport toward inland China and how they interact with BB aerosols are not fully understood. In this study, we identified three predominant synoptic weather processes associated with evident BB plume transport toward southern China over the past 20 years. The first two—the low pressure over the continent and the cold frontal passage—account for more than 76% of all the events. In low‐pressure events accompanied by surface warming, a cyclonic system hovers over southern China, with southerly winds favoring the northward movement of BB plumes throughout the lower troposphere. The second type is caused by a frontal passage lasting only 1–2 days, which lifts BB plumes to above 700 hPa and transports them downstream. To further explore aerosol feedback on different weather patterns, we conducted WRF‐Chem simulations and found an average of 2°C cooling near the surface, along with 1.5°C warming in the lower troposphere over the southern coast of East Asia. Consequently, the more stable atmosphere suppresses the low‐pressure system but enhances the cold frontal system. Meanwhile, anomalous circulations from aerosol radiative effects align with those during the frontal passage, boosting plume transport with a 45% (20%) rise in CO (BC) along the transport belt toward inland southern China. This work highlights the importance of considering the interactions between wildfire pollutants and different weather processes."

Previous studies have suggested that solar radiation modification (SRM) can significantly slow the degradation of permafrost, potentially restoring its extent and soil carbon stocks to levels comparable to those under equivalent global warming caused by greenhouse gas increases alone. However, this study identifies that the efficacy of SRM in mitigating permafrost degradation is contingent upon the warming trajectory and the timing of SRM intervention. Employing SRM to keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5°C can substantially reduce permafrost degradation; however, simulations suggest that by 2300, approximately half of the permafrost area reduction and one‐third of the carbon losses expected under the high‐emissions SSP5‐8.5 scenario would still take place. By employing SRM to achieve a return to 1.5°C warming stabilization levels after a temperature overshoot, it is possible to effectively restore the permafrost area. However, the lost permafrost carbon cannot be regained. Additionally, the soil carbon within permafrost regions displays contrasting trends between the phases of overshoot and subsequent stabilization. Our simulations show that achieving the 1.5°C warming target after a 4°C temperature overshoot could necessitate up to 7% increase in SRM application due to permafrost carbon release. Moreover, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations indicate that the key parameter influencing the uncertainty of soil carbon losses in permafrost regions under 1.5°C warming and overshoot scenarios is distinct from that under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario."

 Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate. Fast-onset flash droughts have become more frequent between 2001 and 2018, and faster development of drought is associated with larger impacts on gross primary productivity, suggests an analysis of observation-based data."

 Accurate information on cloud amount vertical structure is crucial for weather monitoring and understanding climate systems. Active sensors from satellites can provide three-dimensional (3D) cloud structure but with limited geographical coverage, passive sensors from satellites have expanded observation coverage but with limited capability on profiling the clouds. Combing active and passive observations from satellites, together with atmospheric reanalysis data, this study proposes a machine learning approach (CLANN, CLoud Amount Neural Network) to construct three-dimensional (3D) cloud amounts at passive observational coverage. Independent validation is conducted for cloud amount estimates derived from combined data of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard Fengyun-4 A and ERA5 using CALIPSO/CALIOP product as reference. The results indicate notable correlations (Pearson's r = 0.73). The cloud-amount-weighted height showed a high consistency in terms of height positioning between CLANN estimations and CALIOP data, with an RMSE of 1.88 km and a Pearson's r of 0.92. Key features such as water vapor band brightness temperature and upper-layer temperature significantly enhanced model accuracy, as revealed by permutation importance analysis. Sensitivity tests highlighted the critical role of the 1.375 μm band in cirrus altitude detection, justifying the model's reliance on daytime observations. Additionally, the 3D statistical results from CLANN in 2019 reveal the seasonal variation details of cloud distribution, further demonstrating its application value in climate analysis."

 A considerable number of previous studies have limitations in evaluating the population-representative relationship between ozone and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk and revealing high-risk populations due to the limited data availability that could not cover unmonitored areas. To estimate the population-representative association between warm-season (Apr–Sep) ozone and CVD mortality and examine high-risk populations, this study conducted a nationwide case-crossover study in South Korea from 2015 to 2019. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were also performed for each cause of death and demographic characteristics to find high-risk populations. As an exposure, daily modeled warm-season ozone estimated by a machine learning-based ensemble model was used (R2 > 0.92). In the total population, warm-season ozone was associated with an increased risk of total CVD death (OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.002–1.018), and mortality due to ischemic heart disease showed the highest OR (1.019, 1.003–1.035). The warm-season ozone-related CVD death risk was the highest in younger age groups (0–59 y) across all causes of CVD deaths, except for cerebrovascular disease death. The higher accessibility to hospital beds per 1000 was associated with a lower ozone risk of CVD mortality. The estimated excess CVD mortality fractions and years of life lost from mortality (YLL) attributable to warm-season ozone were 5.10% and 119,353.37 years. Our findings suggest that younger populations should be recognized as novel high-risk populations related to warm-season ozone and CVD mortality, and this study also provides potential benefits for constructing stricter ozone mitigation action plans."

Martin;Sarath Guttikunda,Near‐Automated Estimate of City Nitrogen Oxides Emissions Applied to South and Southeast Asia,"Cities in South and Southeast Asia are developing rapidly without routine, up‐to‐date knowledge of air pollutant precursor emissions. This data deficit can potentially be addressed for nitrogen oxides (NOx) by deriving city NOx emissions from satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sampled under windy conditions. NO2 plumes of isolated cities are aligned along a consistent wind‐rotated direction and a best‐fit Gaussian is applied to estimate emissions. This approach currently relies on non‐standardized choice of upwind, downwind, and across‐wind distances from the city center, resulting in fits that often fail or yield non‐physical parameters. Here, we propose an automated approach that defines many combinations of distances yielding 54 distinct sampling boxes that we test with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 observations over 19 isolated cities in South and Southeast Asia. Our approach is efficient, uses open‐source software, is adaptable to many cities, standardizes and eliminates sensitivity to sampling box choice, increases success of deriving emissions from 40% to 60% with one sampling box to 100% (all 19 cities) with 54, and yields emissions consistent with the current manual approach. We estimate that the annual emissions range from 15 ± 5 mol s−1 for Bangalore (India) to 125 ± 41 mol s−1 for Dhaka (Bangladesh). With enhanced success of deriving top‐down emissions, we find support from comparison to past studies and inventory estimates that top‐down emissions may be biased, as the method does not adequately account for spatial and seasonal variability in NOx photochemistry. Further methodological development is needed for enhanced accuracy and use to derive sub‐annual emissions."

Aerosols, as important pollutants and short‐lived climate forcing agents, have significant but currently unclear climate impacts in East Asia as their concentrations decrease until mid‐century. Here, we employ a well‐developed regional climate model RegCM4 combined with future pollutant emission inventories, which are more representative of China to investigate changes in the concentrations and climate effects of major anthropogenic aerosols in East Asia under six different emission reduction scenarios (1.5°C goals, Neutral‐goals, 2°C ‐goals, NDC‐goals, Current‐goals, and Baseline). By the 2060s, aerosol surface concentrations under these scenarios are projected to decrease by 89%, 87%, 84%, 73%, 65%, and 21%, respectively, compared with those in 2010–2020. Aerosol climate effect changes are associated with its loadings but not in a linear manner. The average effective radiative forcing at the surface in East Asia induced by aerosol‐radiation‐cloud interactions will diminish by 24% ± 13% by the 2030s and 35% ± 13% by the 2060s. These alternations caused by aerosol reductions lead to increases in near‐surface temperatures and precipitations. Specifically, aerosol‐induced temperature and precipitation responses in East Asia are estimated to change by −78% to −20% and −69% to 77%, respectively, under goals with different emission scenarios in the 2060s compared to 2010–2020. Therefore, the significant climate effects resulting from substantial reductions in anthropogenic aerosols need to be fully considered in the pathway toward carbon neutrality."

 Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have amplified the seasonality of global water availability over the past 100 years, a trend expected to continue, according to analysis of meteorology reanalysis data and climate simulations."

 Radiocarbon (14C) is an optimal tracer of methane emissions, as 14C measurements enable distinguishing between fossil methane and biogenic methane (CH4). However, 14C measurements in atmospheric methane are still rare, mainly because of the technical challenge of collecting enough carbon for 14C analysis from ambient air samples. In this study, we address this challenge by advancing the system in Zazzeri et al.

However, the kinetics, mechanisms, and key influencing factors of such reactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we synthesized a series of monoterpene-derived α-acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (AAHPs), an important class of organic peroxides formed from Criegee intermediates during the ozonolysis of alkenes, and investigated their Fenton-like reactions with iron ions in the aqueous phase. We found that the AAHPs are essentially chemically inert to Fe3+ but highly reactive toward Fe2+. The aqueous-phase reaction rate constant between AAHPs and Fe2+ (kIIAAHP+Fe(II)) was determined to range between 11.0 ± 0.8 and 150.0 ± 3.3 M–1 s–1, depending positively on the solution pH (1–3), water content (50%–90%), and temperature (8–25 °C). Meanwhile, the kIIAAHP+Fe(II) value is linearly correlated to the O/C ratio of AAHPs, which allows for the estimation of the Fenton-like reactivity of AAHPs based on their oxygenation level. In addition, the decomposition of AAHPs via Fenton-like reactions with Fe2+ predominantly yields alkoxy (RO) radicals with the production yield of OH radicals smaller than 16%. Similar to synthesized AAHPs, several abundant peroxides including the pinonic acid-derived AAHP exhibit high Fenton-like reactivity toward Fe2+ but low reactivity toward Fe3+ in dissolved α-pinene secondary organic aerosol. A quantitative analysis based on the measured kinetics suggests that Fenton-like reactions are important and even dominant drivers behind the transformation of AAHPs in the atmosphere, which would significantly affect atmospheric multiphase chemistry and aerosol health impacts."

 Simulating accurately the South Asian summer monsoon is crucial for food security of several South Asian countries yet challenging for global climate models (GCMs). The GCMs suffer from some systematic biases including dry bias in mean monsoon rainfall over the India subcontinent and excessive equatorial light rain between which the relationship was rarely discussed. Numerical experiments are conducted for one month during active monsoon with global quasi-uniform resolution of 60 km (U60 km) and 3 km (U3 km) separately. Evaluation with observations shows that U3 km reduces the dry bias over northern India and excessive light rain over the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) that are both prominent in U60 km. Excessive light rain in U60 km contributes critically to stronger rainfall and latent heating over the EIO. A Hadley-type anomalous circulation is thus induced, whose subsidence branch suppresses updrafts and reduces moisture transport into northern India, contributing to the dry bias. The findings highlight the importance of constraining excessive light rain for regional climate projection in GCMs."

 Temporary ice roads built by the process of snow compaction, watering, and icing during cold winters are lifelines for land access in remote Arctic. In the context of the Arctic amplified warming, the vulnerability of potential ice roads under the influence of complex climate system remains unclear. Here, we construct a potential ice road assessment model that allows quantization of the climatic suitability of potential ice roads in the Arctic. Using satellite remote sensing and meteorological data, we find changes in surface air temperature and snow cover reduced the climatic suitability of potential ice roads during 1979–2017. Spatially, potential ice roads in North America face more immediate threats due to decreased snow depth compared to Eurasia. Before the end of the 21st century, we project a further decline in the climatic suitability of potential ice roads, primarily due to increasing surface air temperatures and decreasing permafrost stability. Taking precious metal/diamond exploration as an example, we conclude that mining activities associated with ice roads will face access difficulties by 2050–2100 due to the decreased potential ice roads. These results give new insights into the challenges and opportunities of Arctic overland travel. Changes in surface air temperature and snow cover between 1979-2017, particularly in North America, are reducing the climatic suitability of potential ice roads, and their contribution to land accessibility is expected to decrease by the end of the 21st century, according to model results for assessing the climatic suitability of potential Arctic ice roads using satellite remote sensing and meteorological data."
10.5194/acp-25-555-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了利用卫星观测数据对欧洲钢铁厂一氧化碳排放量的估算。研究者使用了TROPOMI卫星数据，结合WRF气象模式和反演方法，对21家钢铁厂的CO排放量进行了估算，并与欧洲污染物排放和转移登记册(E-PRTR)报告的排放量进行了比较。结果显示，卫星估算结果与报告值总体吻合较好，但也存在一些差异。研究发现，对于一些排放量较低或位于沿海地区的工厂，卫星观测的约束性较弱。此外，研究还利用横截面通量法对主要排放源进行了验证，并对部分排放量波动较大的工厂进行了2020年的数据分析。这项研究表明，卫星遥感技术可以有效地用于验证和改进工业排放清单，提高空气质量监测的精度。,"['carbon monoxide', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'TROPOMI', 'emission inventory', 'inverse modeling', 'European iron and steel plants']",Gijs Leguijt;Joannes D.

Segers;Tobias Borsdorff;Ivar R. van der Velde;Ilse Aben,Comparing space-based to reported carbon monoxide emission estimates for Europe's iron and steel plants,"The production of steel coincides with large emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants including carbon monoxide. European facilities are required to report their emissions, which are estimated using a variety of methods. We evaluate these estimates using carbon monoxide concentrations measured via satellite. We find generally good agreement between our values and those reported but also identify some uncertainties, showing that satellites can provide insights into these emissions. 
 We use satellite observations of carbon monoxide (CO) to estimate CO emissions from European integrated iron and steel plants, the continent's highest-emitting CO point sources. We perform analytical inversions to estimate emissions from 21 individual plants using observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for 2019. As prior emissions, we use values reported by the facilities to the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). These reported emissions vary in estimation methodology, including both measurements and calculations. With the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we perform an ensemble of simulations with different transport settings to best replicate the observed emission plumes for each day and site. Comparing the inversion-based emission estimates to the E-PRTR reports, nine of the plants agree within uncertainties. For the remaining plants, we generally find lower emission rates than reported. Our posterior emission estimates are well constrained by the satellite observations (90 % of the plants have averaging kernel sensitivities above 0.7) except for a few low-emitting or coastal sites. We find agreement between our inversion results and emissions we estimate using the cross-sectional flux (CSF) method for the seven most strongly emitting plants, building further confidence in the inversion estimates. Finally, for four plants with large year-to-year variability in reported emission rates or large differences between the reported emission rate and our posterior estimate, we extend our analysis to 2020. We find no evidence in either the observed carbon monoxide concentrations or our inversion results for strong changes in emission rates. This demonstrates how satellites can be used to identify potential uncertainties in reported emissions."

Maasakkers,Satellite quantification of methane emissions from South American countries: a high-resolution inversion of TROPOMI and GOSAT observations,"We quantify 2021 methane emissions in South America at up to 25 km × 25 km resolution using satellite methane observations. We find a 55 % upward adjustment to anthropogenic emission inventories, including those reported to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under the Paris Agreement. Our estimates match inventories for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are much higher for other countries. Livestock emissions (65 % of anthropogenic emissions) show the largest discrepancies. 
 We use 2021 TROPOMI and GOSAT satellite observations of atmospheric methane in an analytical inversion to quantify national methane emissions from South America at up to 25 km × 25 km resolution. From the inversion, we derive optimal posterior estimates of methane emissions, adjusting a combination of national anthropogenic emission inventories reported by individual countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNFCCC-based Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEIv2), and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv7) as prior estimates. We also evaluate two alternative wetland emission inventories (WetCHARTs and LPJ-wsl) as prior estimates. Our best posterior estimates for wetland emissions are consistent with previous inventories for the Amazon but lower for the Pantanal and higher for the Paraná. Our best posterior estimate of South American anthropogenic emissions is 48 (41–56) Tg a−1, where numbers in parentheses are the range from our inversion ensemble. This is 55 % higher than our prior estimate and is dominated by livestock (65 % of anthropogenic total). We find that TROPOMI and GOSAT observations can effectively optimize and separate national emissions by sector for 10 of the 13 countries and territories in the region, 7 of which account for 93 % of continental anthropogenic emissions: Brazil (19 (16–23) Tg a−1), Argentina (9.2 (7.9–11) Tg a−1), Venezuela (7.0 (5.5–9.9) Tg a−1), Colombia (5.0 (4.4–6.7) Tg a−1), Peru (2.4 (1.6–3.9) Tg a−1), Bolivia (0.96 (0.66–1.2) Tg a−1), and Paraguay (0.93 (0.88–1.0) Tg a−1). Our estimates align with the prior estimates for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are significantly higher for other countries. Emissions in all countries are dominated by livestock (mainly enteric fermentation) except for oil–gas in Venezuela and landfills in Peru. Methane intensities from the oil–gas industry are high in Venezuela (33 %), Colombia (6.5 %), and Argentina (5.9 %). The livestock sector shows the largest difference between our top-down estimate and the UNFCCC prior estimates, and even countries using complex bottom-up methods report UNFCCC emissions significantly lower than our posterior estimate. These discrepancies could stem from underestimations in IPCC-recommended bottom-up calculations or uncertainties in the inversion from aggregation error and the prior spatial distribution of emissions."
10.5194/acp-25-727-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了南极中山站气溶胶光学厚度(AOD)的季节性、月性和昼夜变化，以及与气象参数（温度、风速、湿度）之间的关系。使用了CE318-T光度计的观测数据，分析了AOD和Ångström指数(AE)的变化，并结合后向轨迹分析探讨了气溶胶的来源。研究发现，冬季和春季AOD较高，主要由粗模态粒子贡献；夏季和秋季AOD较高，主要由细模态粒子增长引起。AOD与温度呈正相关，与风速和湿度呈负相关。海洋来源的粗粒子是高AOD值的主要贡献者，而低AOD值天数的气溶胶主要来自南极高原。本研究通过地面观测数据，提高了对南极沿海地区气溶胶光学特性和季节变化的认识，特别是补充了极夜期间AOD数据的缺乏，为气候模型研究提供了有价值的参考。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究使用了地面光度计进行AOD观测，这属于大气成分分析和空气质量监测的范畴。,"['Aerosol Optical Depth', 'AOD', 'Ångström Exponent', 'AE', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Ground-based Photometer', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Aerosol Size Distribution', 'Meteorological Parameters', 'Backward Trajectory Analysis', 'Antarctica']",Lijing Chen;Lei Zhang;Yong She;Zhaoliang Zeng;Yu Zheng;Biao Tian;Wenqian Zhang;Zhaohui Liu;Huizheng Che;Minghu Ding,Measurement report: Analysis of aerosol optical depth variation at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at Zhongshan Station varies seasonally, with lower values in summer and higher values in winter. Winter and spring AOD increases due to reduced fine-mode particles, while summer and autumn increases are linked to particle growth. Diurnal AOD variation correlates positively with temperature but negatively with wind speed and humidity. Backward trajectories show that aerosols on high-AOD (low-AOD) days primarily originate from the ocean (interior Antarctica). 
 Our understanding of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Antarctica remains limited due to the scarcity of ground observation stations and limited daylight days. Utilizing data from the CE318-T photometer spanning January 2020 to April 2023 at Zhongshan Station, we analyzed the seasonal, monthly, and diurnal variations in AOD and the Ångström exponent (AE). AOD median values increased from spring (0.033) to winter (0.115), while AE peaked during summer (1.010) and autumn (1.034), declining in winter (0.381), indicating a transition in dominant aerosol particle size from fine to coarse mode between summer and winter. Monthly mean AOD variation closely paralleled the proportion of AE < 1, suggesting fluctuations in coarse-mode particle proportions drive AOD variation. The high AOD values during winter and spring were associated with an increased contribution of coarse-mode particles, while high AOD values during summer and autumn were associated with the growth of fine-mode particles. We observed a peak in AOD (∼ 0.06) at 14:00 local time (LT) at Zhongshan Station, possibly associated with a slight decrease in boundary layer height (BLH). Additionally, higher (lower) wind speeds corresponded to lower (higher) AOD values, indicating the diffusion (accumulation) effect. The temperature and AOD showed an insignificant positive correlation (R = 0.22, p = 0.40), and relative humidity exhibited a significant negative correlation with AOD (R = −0.59, p = 0.02). Backward trajectory analysis revealed that coarse particles from the ocean predominantly contributed to high AOD daily mean values, while fine particles on low-AOD days originated mainly from the air mass over the Antarctic Plateau.This study enhances the understanding of the optical properties and seasonal behaviors of aerosols in the coastal Antarctic. Specifically, AOD measurements during the polar night address the lack of validation data for winter AOD simulations. Additionally, we revealed that lower wind speeds, higher temperatures, and lower relative humidity contribute to increased AOD at Zhongshan Station, and air masses from the ocean significantly impact local AOD levels. These findings help us infer AOD variation patterns in the coastal Antarctic based on meteorological changes, providing valuable insights for climate modeling in the context of global climate change."

Nowak;Johannes Schneider;André Welti,Exploring the processes controlling secondary inorganic aerosol: evaluating the global GEOS-Chem simulation using a suite of aircraft campaigns,"This study finds that one component of secondary inorganic aerosols, nitrate, is greatly overestimated by a global atmospheric chemistry model compared to observations from 11 flight campaigns. None of the loss and production pathways explored can explain the nitrate bias alone. The model’s inability to capture the variability in the observations remains and requires future investigation to avoid biases in policy-related studies (i.e., air quality, health, climate impacts of these aerosols). 
 Secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium, SNA) are major contributors to fine particulate matter. Predicting concentrations of these species is complicated by the cascade of processes that control their abundance, including emissions, chemistry, thermodynamic partitioning, and removal. In this study, we use 11 flight campaigns to evaluate the GEOS-Chem model performance for SNA. Across all the campaigns, the model performance is best for sulfate (R2 = 0.51; normalized mean bias (NMB) = 0.11) and worst for nitrate (R2=0.22; NMB = 1.76), indicating substantive model deficiencies in the nitrate simulation. Thermodynamic partitioning reproduces the total particulate nitrate well (R2=0.79; NMB = 0.09), but actual partitioning (i.e., ε(NO3-)= NO3- / TNO3) is challenging to assess given the limited sets of full gas- and particle-phase observations needed for ISORROPIA II. In particular, ammonia observations are not often included in aircraft campaigns, and more routine measurements would help constrain sources of SNA model bias. Model performance is sensitive to changes in emissions and dry and wet deposition, with modest improvements associated with the inclusion of different chemical loss and production pathways (i.e., acid uptake on dust, N2O5 uptake, and NO3- photolysis). However, these sensitivity tests show only modest reduction in the nitrate bias, with no improvement to the model skill (i.e., R2), implying that more work is needed to improve the description of loss and production of nitrate and SNA as a whole."

These results highlight the profound impact of geostationary satellite observations in advancing air quality forecasting models, thereby contributing to future models for health exposure to air pollution. 
 Air quality forecasting plays a critical role in mitigating air pollution. However, current physics-based air pollution predictions encounter challenges in accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution due to limitations in the understanding of atmospheric physical mechanisms, observational constraints, and computational capacity. The world's first geostationary satellite UV–Vis spectrometer, i.e., the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), offers hourly measurements of atmospheric trace gas pollutants at high spatial resolution over East Asia. In this study, we successfully incorporate geostationary satellite observations into a neural network model (GeoNet) to forecast full-coverage surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over eastern China at 4 h intervals for the next 24 h. GeoNet leverages spatiotemporal series of satellite NO2 observations to capture the intricate relationships among air quality, meteorology, and emissions in both temporal and spatial domains. Evaluation against ground-based measurements demonstrates that GeoNet accurately predicts diurnal variations and spatial distribution details of next-day NO2 pollution, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.68 and a root mean square of error of 12.31 µg m−3, significantly surpassing traditional air quality model forecasts. The model's interpretability reveals that geostationary satellite observations notably improve NO2 forecast capability more than other input features, especially over polluted regions. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of geostationary satellite observations in artificial-intelligence-based air quality forecasting, with implications for early warning of air pollution events and human health exposure."

Carmichael;Sang Seo Park;Jhoon Kim,"Aerosol layer height (ALH) retrievals from oxygen absorption bands: intercomparison and validation among different satellite platforms, GEMS, EPIC, and TROPOMI","We compare passive aerosol layer height (ALH) retrievals from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) with lidar. GEMS shows a lower correlation (R = 0.64) than EPIC and TROPOMI (R > 0.7) but with minimal bias (0.1 km vs. overestimated by ~0.8 km). GEMS performance is improved for an ultraviolet aerosol index ≥ 3. EPIC and GEMS ALH diurnal variation differs slightly. 
 The vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial for assessing surface air quality and its impact on the climate. Although aerosol vertical structures can be complex, assuming a certain shape for the aerosol vertical profile allows for the retrieval of a single parameter – aerosol layer height (ALH) – from passive remote sensing measurements. In this study, we evaluate ALH products retrieved using oxygen absorption measurements from multiple satellite platforms: the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) focusing on Asia, the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) in deep space, and the polar-orbiting TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We use the extinction-weighted aerosol optical centroid height (AOCH) derived from aerosol extinction profiles of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) as the ground truth. The differences due to the inconsistent definitions of ALH in various retrieval algorithms are investigated and eliminated before comparison. We select multiple dust and smoke cases under ideal observational conditions, referred to as “golden days”, for the evaluation. Given the significant role of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in ALH retrieval, we first evaluate the AOD from these retrievals against the ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Results show that the GEMS AOD at 440 nm has better agreement with the AERONET AOD of the ∼ 0.9 correlation coefficient (R) than that at 680 nm, both of which underestimate with a negative bias. In contrast, EPIC and TROPOMI tend to overestimate AOD by 0.33 and 0.23 for dust cases, while the bias for smoke plumes is small. Evaluation of ALH against CALIOP demonstrates that the EPIC/TROPOMI ALH has good consistency (R > 0.7) with CALIOP but is overestimated by approximately 0.8 km. The GEMS ALH displays minimal bias (0.1 km) but a slightly lower correlation (R = 0.64). Intercomparisons between three passive retrievals indicate that GEMS retrievals have a limited consistency with EPIC and TROPOMI of 0.3–0.4 R, while GEMS underestimates with ALHs of ∼ 0.3 and ∼ 0.6 km compared with TROPOMI and EPIC, respectively. The correlations improve under conditions of higher absorbing aerosols (UVAI ≥ 3), as the signal in the oxygen absorption band (O2–O2 used by GEMS) is enhanced. Although the ALH diurnal cycle from EPIC and GEMS shows some differences, they both demonstrate ALH descent in the afternoon, which might be related to the boundary layer process. Case studies show that the EPIC ALH indicates a morning ascent to around 4.5 km, while the GEMS ALH remains stable before descending to below 3 km in the afternoon."

Based on previous work measuring the attenuation of an electromagnetic signal from a broadcast television satellite, we make this approach more accurate so it can be easily deployed and used operationally in areas where rainfall measurements are critical for applications like flood monitoring. In this article, the method is validated in France and applied in Côte d'Ivoire. 
 Earth–satellite microwave links such as TV-SAT can help for rainfall monitoring and could be a complement or an alternative to ground-based weather radars, rain gauges or Earth observation satellites. Rain-induced attenuation which is harmful for telecommunication is exploited here as an opportunistic way to estimate rain rate along the link path. This technique provides rain measurements at a fine temporal resolution (a few tens of seconds) and with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres, which is a good compromise for human activities such as civil security (watershed monitoring, flash flood), agriculture or transport. The advantages of this technique include the low cost of the equipment used, as well as the cost of on-site maintenance. However, the measured attenuation does not directly provide rain intensity,  requiring the estimation of additional parameters. These include the contribution of natural radiation from the atmosphere. In this paper, we detail a theoretical framework allowing us to estimate rainfall from the measurements of a low-cost sensor operating simultaneously over two parts of the Ku frequency band. This framework is assessed in a densely instrumented area in the south of France, where very good results are obtained when compared to rain gauge measurements, in terms of both overall rain accumulation and rainfall rate distribution. Then we apply this dual-channel method in Côte d'Ivoire, in the metropolitan area of Abidjan, where such an approach is very promising. It is shown that this technique when compared to rain gauge measurements gives far better results than a naive single-channel approach neglecting the natural radiation of atmosphere but that significant errors remain in rainfall assessment, leading to a persistent underestimation of rain accumulation. Finally we discuss various effects that could lead to this remaining underestimation, opening the door for further studies."

The merged datasets exhibit significantly improved accuracy compared to the original satellite data. These results can provide more reliable estimates of aerosol scattering and absorption properties, essential for improving climate modeling and assessing aerosol climate effects. 
 Accurate global aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) data is critical for assessing aerosol radiative effects and identifying aerosol composition. However, current satellite-based SSA retrievals are both limited and highly uncertain, whereas the more accurate ground-based observations lack global coverage. In this study, we employ an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data synergy technique to construct two monthly mean SSA datasets over land by synergizing OMI and POLDER with AERONET observations respectively, namely Merged-OMI and Merged-POLDER dataset. The background ensemble is constructed with 231/106 members using all monthly mean OMI/POLDER SSA available to represent the variability of SSA field. Then AERONET measurements are assimilated into each satellite dataset using the EnKF approach. The merged datasets show substantial improvements against the original products, with the correlation coefficient increased by up to 100 %, and the mean absolute bias (MAB) and root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by more than 30 % compared with AERONET results. Cross validation using independent AERONET observations shows an average increase of 70 % in correlation, 15 % reduction in RMSE and 14 % reduction in MAB for Merged-OMI dataset, and similar although weaker improvement for Merged-POLDER mainly due to the smaller sample size.  This study confirms the effectiveness of the EnKF technique in extending the information obtained from ground stations to larger regions. The two merged datasets generated in this study can offer more accurate SSA estimates for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and improving climate modeling, serving as an important resource for advancing global aerosol research."

In this study, we combine multiple state-of-the-art observation-based datasets, including over ninety thousand geo-referenced soil profiles, the latest root observations distributed globally, and large amounts of satellite-derived environmental variables, to generate global maps of apparent τ in topsoil (0–0.3 m) and subsoil (0.3–1 m) layers with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec (~1 km at the Equator). We show that subsoil τ (385203485 years [mean with a variation range from 2.5th to 97.5th percentile]) is over eight times longer than topsoil τ (1511137 years). The cross-validation shows that the fitted machine learning models effectively captured the variabilities in τ, with R2 values of 0.87 and 0.70 for topsoil and subsoil τ mapping, respectively. The prediction uncertainties of the τ maps were quantified for better user applications. The environmental controls on top- and subsoil τ were investigated at global, biome, and local scales. Our analyses illustrate that how temperature, water availability, physio-chemical properties and depth exert jointly impacts on τ. The data-driven approaches allow us to identify their interactions, thereby enriching our comprehension of mechanisms driving nonlinear τ–environment relationships from global to local scales. The distributions of dominating factors of τ at local scales were mapped for identifying context-dependent controls on τ across different regions. We further reveal that the current Earth system models may underestimate τ by comparing model-derived maps with our observation-derived τ maps. The resulting maps with new insights demonstrated in this study facilitate the future modelling efforts of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks and supporting effective carbon management.

 Evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) are critical fluxes contributing to the energy, water, and carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and the land surface. Land surface models such as the Community Land Model v5 (CLM5) quantify these fluxes, estimate the state of carbon budgets and water resources, and contribute to a better understanding of climate change's impact on ecosystems. Past studies have shown the ability of CLM5 to model ET and GPP magnitudes well but emphasized systematic underestimations and lower variability than in the observations.Here, we evaluated CLM5's predictions of water and energy fluxes using observations from eddy covariance stations from the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), remote sensing, and reanalysis data sets. We assess simulated ET and GPP from the grid scale (CLM5grid) and the plant functional type (PFT) scale (CLM5PFT). CLM5PFT exhibited a low systematic error in simulating the ET at the ICOS sites (average bias of −4.68 %), indicating that PFT-specific ET closely matches the observations' magnitude. GPP was underestimated by CLM5PFT, especially in deciduous forests (bias of −43.76 %). The results showed an underestimation of the spatiotemporal variability in the simulated ET and GPP distribution moments across PFTs for both CLM setups compared to reanalysis data and remote-sensing products. These findings provide essential insights for improving land surface models, highlighting the need to enhance the CLM5's ability to capture the spatiotemporal variability in ET and GPP simulations across PFTs."

This study used 19 months of Doppler Lidar data from Qingdao, China, to examine IEC associated with gusts. We found IECs occurred 15% of the time at 50 m height. When near‐surface wind speeds exceeded 11 m·s−1, IEC frequency and intensity increased, indicating that strong winds are a critical driver of IEC. This study suggests that the reduction in the drag coefficient under high wind conditions may generate IEC and gusts, consequently influencing energy transfer throughout the boundary layer and lower troposphere. Analysis using the four‐quadrant model revealed IECs are linked to changes in momentum from ejections and inward interactions, even in weak background fields. The study supports that IECs are more prevalent and highlights their role in the lower atmosphere, contributing to an improved understanding of land‐atmosphere coupling."

However, the potential asymmetry in vegetation greenness between west‐ and east‐facing slopes remains underexplored. Analyzing the normalized difference vegetation index derived from Landsat reflectances in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) grassland, we identified that west‐facing slopes were greener than east‐facing slopes in the western TP, while the opposite appeared in the eastern TP. We also detected a stronger greening trend on west‐ than east‐ facing slopes over the entire TP grassland from 1991 to 2020. These disparities result from distinct microclimates on the two contrasting slopes: west‐facing slopes tend to be wetter and colder than east‐facing slopes under similar background climate. Our findings underscore the crucial role of slope orientation in shaping vegetation greenness and its response to climate change."

Although studies have examined how AEWs and the environment affect TC genesis, their relative importance is less understood. Here, we examine whether AEW strength or sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are the primary drivers of TC genesis. Regional model simulations were performed to address how increased AEW strength and SSTs affect the frequency of AEWs that develop into TCs in a year with below‐average TCs with AEW origins and SSTs. We found that environmental favorability plays a larger role than AEW strength in driving the frequency of TCs with AEW origins. Strengthening the AEWs did not affect the frequency of AEWs that develop into TCs due to low environmental favorability. Warmer SSTs led to increased environmental favorability and a statistically significant increase in TCs with AEW origins."

Revell,Constraining the Uncertainty Associated With Sea Salt Aerosol Parameterizations in Global Models Using Nudged UKESM1‐AMIP Simulations,"Sea salt is the largest source of natural aerosol in the atmosphere by mass. Formed when ocean waves break and bubbles burst, sea salt aerosols (SSA) influence Earth's climate via direct and indirect processes. Models participating in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison project (CMIP6) demonstrate a negative effective radiative forcing (ERF) when SSA emissions are doubled. However, the magnitude of the ERF ranges widely from −0.35 ± $\pm $ 0.04 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ to −2.28 ± $\pm $ 0.07 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$, with the largest difference over the Southern Ocean. Differences in the response to doubled SSA emissions arise from model uncertainty (e.g., individual model physics, aerosol size distribution) and parameterization uncertainty (e.g., how SSA is produced in the model). Here, we perform single‐model experiments with UKESM1‐AMIP incorporating all of the SSA parameterizations used by the current generation of CMIP6 Earth system models (ESMs). Using a fixed SSA size distribution, our experiments show that the parameterization uncertainty causes large inter‐model diversity in SSA emissions in the models, particularly over the tropics and the Southern Ocean. The choice of parameterization influences the ambient aerosol size distribution, cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplet number concentrations, and therefore direct and indirect radiative forcing. We recommend that modeling groups evaluate their SSA parameterizations and update them where necessary in preparation for future model intercomparison activities."

To enhance the comparison we use a lidar instrument simulator to derive cloud statistics from the reanalyses which account for instrumental factors. The cloud occurrence in the three reanalyses is slightly overestimated above 3 km, but displays a larger underestimation below 3 km relative to observations. Unlike previous studies, we see no relationship between relative humidity and cloud occurrence biases, suggesting that the cloud biases do not result from the representation of moisture. We also show that the seasonal variation of cloud occurrence and cloud fraction, defined as the vertically integrated cloud occurrence, are small in both the observations and the reanalyses. We also examine the quality of the cloud representation for a set of weather states derived from ERA5 surface winds. The variability associated with grouping cloud occurrence based on weather state is much larger than the seasonal variation, highlighting weather state is a strong control of cloud occurrence. All the reanalyses continue to display underestimates below 3 km and overestimates above 3 km for each weather state. But the variability in ERA5 statistics matches the changes in the observations better than the other reanalyses. We also use a machine learning scheme to estimate the quantity of supercooled liquid water cloud from the ceilometer observations. Ceilometer low‐level supercooled liquid water cloud occurrences are considerably larger than values derived from the reanalyses, further highlighting the poor representation of low‐level clouds in the reanalyses."

 The Arctic–Boreal Zone is rapidly warming, impacting its large soil carbon stocks. Here we use a new compilation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes, geospatial datasets and random forest models to show that although the Arctic–Boreal Zone was overall an increasing terrestrial CO2 sink from 2001 to 2020 (mean ± standard deviation in net ecosystem exchange, −548 ± 140 Tg C yr−1; trend, −14 Tg C yr−1; P < 0.001), more than 30% of the region was a net CO2 source. Tundra regions may have already started to function on average as CO2 sources, demonstrating a shift in carbon dynamics. When fire emissions are factored in, the increasing Arctic–Boreal Zone sink is no longer statistically significant (budget, −319 ± 140 Tg C yr−1; trend, −9 Tg C yr−1), and the permafrost region becomes CO2 neutral (budget, −24 ± 123 Tg C yr−1; trend, −3 Tg C yr−1), underscoring the importance of fire in this region.

 Winter Arctic sea ice is a crucial climate indicator, declining at an accelerated rate compared to the past and playing a significant role in Arctic amplification over recent decades. The sea-ice concentration (SIC) in the Greenland–Barents Sea (GBS) shows considerable interannual variability, yet the link between this variability and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains uncertain. Here, we identify a reversed relationship between the autumn Central Pacific (CP)-type ENSO and the winter GBS SIC around the mid-1980s. Observational and model experiments demonstrate that, before the mid-1980s, CP ENSO triggered a double wave pattern propagating toward the Arctic, generating a positive geopotential height anomaly in the Arctic. Such an anomaly, along with a northerly anomaly, favored cold-air advection and intrusion into the GBS, resulting in an increased SIC. After the mid-1980s, however, CP ENSO only induced a single wave train towards the Arctic, favoring a positive geopotential height anomaly over Iceland. As a result, the southerly anomaly transported abundant moisture into the GBS and consequently reduced the SIC. The variation in wave patterns can largely be attributed to the sea surface temperature anomaly in the tropical Atlantic induced by CP ENSO. Our findings highlight the unstable connection between tropical and polar regions, which provides a basis for better understanding the mechanisms of Arctic sea-ice changes."

 Aerosols, derived from natural processes and human activities, present various risks to the environment and human health. In this regard, the role of recent pollutant environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) should not be overlooked. However, the oxidative toxicity and mass transfer processes of EPFRs in liquid-phase environments remain completely understood. In this study, the dispersion characteristics of EPFRs and their contributions to the oxidation potential (OP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sea spray and size-resolved PM were investigated and compared. The results showed that the sea spray contained fast-decaying C-centred EPFRs with a half-life of 0.32 years. The concentration ranged from 0.3 × 1013 spins/m3 to 7.5 × 1013 spins/m3. It increased as the samples approached the coast. Moreover, the size-resolved PM contained slow-decaying O-centred EPFRs with a half-life of 0.51 years. The concentration ranged from 4.57 × 1013 spins/m3 to 11.46 × 1013 spins/m3, which was higher than that of most sea spray samples. The interaction between sea spray and water mainly generated hydroxyl free radicals (54 ± 3%), whereas the size-resolved PM mainly generated organic free radicals (64 ± 5%). Correlation analysis revealed that EPFRs may be involved in ROS generation. In addition, the mass transfer of EPFRs between the PM and sea spray may have been controlled by both gas and liquid films. The concentration of EPFRs at the phase interface was calculated to be 4.92 × 1013 spins/m3. In summary, EPFRs positively contribute to OP and ROS production."

 Air pollution is one of the most harmful consequences of industrialization because of its strong influence on both human health quality and climate in general. Often there appears a need to identify one single strong source of air pollution appearing as a result of an accident. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for a single pollution source localization. The proposed algorithm uses the source–receptor matrix concept and assumption about the linearity of pollution transport that allows us to use the pollution spread simulations backward in time. In particular realization, we make use of the weather regional forecast model WRF for airflow simulation and of Lagrangian particle dispersion simulation software FLEXPART-WRF for pollution advection simulation both forward and backward in time. As a result, our algorithm produces the semi-empirical heatmap of possible pollution source locations with marked point of the biggest probability and estimative emission intensity at this point as a function of time. The algorithm is tested on several semi-synthetic and practical cases and compared with other solutions in this field. The mean distance between the predicted and the real sources is around 7 km for the Moscow dataset with 1096 experiments and 45 km region size and around 3 km for the Regional dataset with 803 experiments and 30 km region size. We also conduct an experiment on European Tracer Experiment-1 and get a strong performance on it: distance between the real and the predicted sources is around 6 km, which is comparable or superior to other approaches."

Vicente;Olga L. Mayol-Bracero,Measurement report: A comparative analysis of an intensive incursion of fluorescing African dust particles over Puerto Rico and another over Spain,"Measurements of fluorescing aerosol particle properties have been made during two major African dust events, one over the island of Puerto Rico and the other over the city of León, Spain. The measurements were made with two wideband integrated bioaerosol spectrometers. A significant change in the background aerosol properties, at both locations, is observed when the dust is in the respective regions. 
 Measurements during episodes of African dust, made with two wideband integrated bioaerosol spectrometers (WIBSs), one on the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico and the other in the city of León, Spain, show unmistakable, bioaerosol-like fluorescing aerosol particles (FAPs) that can be associated with these dust episodes. The Puerto Rico event occurred during a major incursion of African dust during June 2020. The León event occurred in the late winter and spring of 2022, when widespread, elevated layers of dust inundated the Iberian Peninsula. Satellite and back-trajectory analyses confirm that dust from northern Africa was the source of the particles during both events. The WIBSs measure the size of individual particles in the range from 0.5 to 30 µm, derive a shape factor, and classify seven types of fluorescence from the FAPs. In general, it is not possible to directly determine the specific biological identity from fluorescence signatures; however, measurements of these types of bioaerosols in laboratory studies allow us to compare ambient fluorescence patterns with whole microbial cells measured under controlled conditions. Here we introduce some new metrics that offer a more quantitative approach for comparing FAP characteristics derived from particles measured under different environmental conditions. The analysis highlights the similarities and differences at the two locations and reveals differences that can be attributed to the age and history of the dust plumes, e.g., the amount of time that the air masses were in the mixed layer and the frequency of precipitation along the air mass trajectory."

Chen,The role of OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals in estimating global terrestrial net ecosystem exchanges,"The role of OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals in estimating global terrestrial carbon fluxes is unclear. We investigate this by assimilating OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals alone and in combination with OCO-2 XCO2. The assimilation of OCO-3 XCO2 alone underestimates global land sinks, mainly at high latitudes, due to the lack of observations beyond 52° S and 52° N, large variations in the number of data, and varying observation times, while the joint assimilation of OCO-2 and OCO-3 XCO2 has the best performance. 
 Satellite-based column-averaged dry-air CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) retrievals are frequently used to improve the estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem exchanges (NEEs). The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) satellite, launched in May 2019, was designed to address important questions about the distribution of carbon fluxes on Earth, but its role in estimating global terrestrial NEE remains unclear. Here, using the Global Carbon Assimilation System, version 2, we investigate the impact of OCO-3 XCO2 on the estimation of global NEE by assimilating the OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals alone and in combination with the OCO-2 XCO2 retrievals. The results show that when only the OCO-3 XCO2 is assimilated (Exp_OCO3), the estimated global land sink is significantly lower than that from the OCO-2 experiment (Exp_OCO2). The estimate from the joint assimilation of OCO-3 and OCO-2 (Exp_OCO3&2) is comparable on a global scale to that of Exp_OCO2. However, there are significant regional differences. Compared to the observed global annual CO2 growth rate, Exp_OCO3 has the largest bias and Exp_OCO3&2 shows the best performance. Furthermore, validation with independent CO2 observations shows that the biases of Exp_OCO3 are significantly larger than those of Exp_OCO2 and Exp_OCO3&2 at middle and high latitudes. The reasons for the poor performance of assimilating OCO-3 XCO2 alone include the lack of observations beyond 52° S and 52° N, the large fluctuations in the number of data, and the varied observation time. Our study indicates that assimilating OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals alone leads to an underestimation of land sinks at high latitudes and that a joint assimilation of OCO-2 XCO2 and the OCO-3 XCO2 retrievals observed in the afternoon is required for a better estimation of global terrestrial NEE."

Lind,Does total column ozone change during a solar eclipse?,"Several publications have reported that total column ozone (TCO) may oscillate during solar eclipses, whereas other researchers have not seen evidence of such fluctuations. Here, we try to resolve these contradictions by measuring variations in TCO during three solar eclipses. In all instances, the variability in TCO was within natural variability. We conclude that solar eclipses do not lead to measurable variations in TCO, drawing into question reports of much larger changes found in the past. 
 Several publications have reported that total column ozone (TCO) may oscillate with an amplitude of up to 10 DU (Dobson units) during a solar eclipse, whereas other researchers have not seen evidence that an eclipse leads to variations in TCO beyond the typical natural variability. Here, we try to resolve these contradictions by measuring short-term variations (of seconds to minutes) in TCO using “global” (Sun and sky) and direct-Sun observations in the ultraviolet (UV) range with filter radiometers (GUVis-3511 and Microtops II®). Measurements were performed during three solar eclipses: the “Great American Eclipse” of 2024, which was observed in Mazatlán, Mexico, on 8 April 2024; a partial solar eclipse that took place in the United States on 14 October 2023 and was observed at Fort Collins, Colorado (40.57° N, 105.10° W); and a total solar eclipse that occurred in Antarctica on 4 December 2021 and was observed at Union Glacier (79.76° S, 82.84° W). The upper limits of the amplitude of oscillations in TCO observed at Mazatlán, Fort Collins, and Antarctica were 0.4 %, 0.3 %, and 0.03 %, respectively. The variability at all sites was within that observed during times not affected by an eclipse. The slightly larger variability at Mazatlán is due to cirrus clouds occurring throughout the day of the eclipse and the difficulty of separating changes in the ozone layer from cloud effects. These results support the conclusion that a solar eclipse does not lead to variations in TCO of more than ± 1.2 DU and that these variations are likely much lower, drawing into question reports of much larger oscillations. In addition to calculating TCO, we also present changes in the spectral irradiance and aerosol optical depth during eclipses and compare radiation levels observed during totality. The new results augment our understanding of the effect of a solar eclipse on the Earth's upper atmosphere."

 This article provides a detailed analysis of the Crocus-ERA5 snow product covering the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 2022. It assesses the product’s performance in terms of snow depth and extent compared to in situ observations and satellite data.

The findings show a good match with observations, though biases remain, particularly in boreal forest areas and some Arctic regions, where the model tends to overestimate spring melt. The production of this snow dataset is motivated by its use by the continental cryosphere community, and in particular by the collaboration between the French National Center for Meteorological Research (CNRM) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), which has been involved in Arctic snow cover monitoring as part of the ""Terrestrial Snow"" section of the Arctic Report Card since 2017.

We use TROPOMI NO2 columns in a land use regression (LUR) model to improve surface NO2 concentration estimates over the United States.

Our analysis reveals a statistically significant surface impact of SSWs is observed in February and March, particularly when the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is in the easterly phase.

Notably, the maturation of El Niño prolonged warming in North America through excitation of the Pacific‐North American teleconnection. During the most recent 15 years, GMST has entered an accelerated warming period, primarily driven by rapid SST warming trends in the tropical Indian Ocean, tropical Atlantic, subtropical North Pacific, and North Atlantic.

This study investigates the influence of TC‐associated processes on the MJO development based on the analysis of a case observed during the Dynamics of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation field campaign. During the suppressed phase before the December 2011 MJO initiation, two TCs were active in the southern Tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). A dry air band within 10°S‐Eq is sustained by TC‐induced horizontal advection and descent, inhibiting large‐scale convection in the southern equatorial IO. Consequently, convection is triggered and develops only in the northern TIO around Eq‐10°N. The MJO initiates as convection develops south of the equator after the TCs dissipate."

We show that, in the mean, the sub‐Saharan Africa post‐fire surface albedo anomaly can be parameterized using an exponential recovery function, recovering from a decrease of 0.019±0.001 $0.019\pm 0.001$ immediately after a fire with a time constant of 34.0±0.4 $34.0\pm 0.4$ days. Although the magnitude of albedo changes shows large spatial and temporal variations and a strong land cover type (LCT) dependency, exponential recovery is observed in the majority of LCTs. We show that fires cause long‐term surface brightening, with an Africa‐wide albedo increase of (9.5±0.2)×10−4 $(9.5\pm 0.2)\times 1{0}^{-4}$ 10 months after a fire, but we find this is driven almost exclusively by slow vegetation recovery in the Kalahari region, confirming previous findings. Using downward surface shortwave flux (DSSF) estimates, we calculate the fire‐induced surface radiative forcing (RF), peaking at 5±2 $5\pm 2$ Wm−2 in the burn areas, albeit with a significantly smaller effect when averaged temporally and spatially. We find that the long‐term RF in months 5–10 after a burn averaged over the continent is negative because of the brightening observed. Despite a well‐documented reduction in burning in Africa in the recent decades, our temporal analysis does not indicate a decrease in the overall fire‐induced RF likely due to large interannual variability in albedo anomaly and DSSF data. However, we observe a decline in the short‐term RF in southern hemisphere Africa, driven by both a reduction in fires and changes in LCT distributions."

This, in turn, leads to increased SIC in the Amundsen Sea and decreased SIC in the eastern Bellingshausen Sea and the northern Weddell Sea via anomalous wind‐driven forcing and air advection. We further reveal the dynamical processes that establish the atmospheric bridge between the SIO and polar regions. On the one hand, anomalous Rossby wave sources appear over the SIO, attributed to anomalous divergent flows induced by convective and diabatic heating anomalies. On the other hand, the equivalent barotropic response of atmospheric circulation is reinforced by the feedback of storm activities, dominated by eddy vorticity forcing. In a warming climate, climate models project SST warming in the SIO, accompanied by an increasing meridional SST gradient, suggesting that the strengthened impact of the SIO on Antarctic sea ice is likely to continue."
10.1029/2024JD042193,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究的是雷暴中产生的高能粒子，特别是伽马射线暴（TGFs）。它使用蒙特卡洛模拟来检验雷暴电场是否可以通过相对论反馈机制独自产生TGFs，而不需要闪电的参与。研究发现，快速的雷暴充电会产生强烈的伽马射线辉光，并伴随伽马射线速率的振荡，这些振荡会发展成强烈的脉冲序列，与CGRO/BATSE和ALOFT卫星观测到的多脉冲TGFs非常相似。文中提到的ALOFT和CGRO/BATSE都是大气环境遥感技术中使用的卫星或传感器，它们可以观测到地球大气层中的伽马射线辐射。因此，这项研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是利用卫星观测分析大气成分和高能粒子现象密切相关。,"['gamma rays', 'atmospheric electricity', 'thunderstorms', 'satellite observations', 'CGRO/BATSE', 'ALOFT', 'bremsstrahlung', 'runaway electrons', 'high-energy particles']",Joseph R. Dwyer,Energetic Particles Produced by Thunderstorm Electric Fields,"In this work, detailed Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test whether terrestrial gamma‐ray flashes (TGFs) may be produced by thunderstorm electrification alone, without the presence of lightning, by the relativistic feedback mechanism. TGFs are powerful bursts of gamma rays produced by thunderstorms, often in association with lightning. They are produced by bremsstrahlung interactions of relativistic runaway electrons with air, typically requiring >1017 energetic electrons to account for the gamma‐ray emissions. These energetic electrons may be produced in the high‐field regions near lightning leaders, or they may be produced by the self‐sustained production of runaway electrons by relativistic feedback involving backward propagating runaway positrons and backscattered x‐rays. It has been challenging to tell which mechanism is correct when lightning is present, since both may occur in the fields generated by the propagating leaders. Prior to 2023, the gamma‐ray emissions from thunderstorms were broadly classified as either long‐lasting gamma‐ray glows or TGFs. However, recent aircraft observations by ALOFT are upending this distinction, showing that gamma‐ray glows are highly dynamic and often morph into intense pulses that resemble TGFs observed from space. It is shown here that rapid thunderstorm charging produces strong gamma‐ray glows with oscillating gamma‐ray rates. These oscillations develop into intense pulse trains that closely resemble the multi‐pulsed TGFs observed by CGRO/BATSE and ALOFT. Furthermore, the ionization produced by the high‐energy particles partially discharges the electric field in some regions while strongly amplifying it in other regions, potentially leading to the initiation of narrow bipolar events and/or lightning."

 Various techniques have been developed to monitor water vapor because of its important role in weather forecasting and climate change studies. However, high-resolution, spatially continuous water vapor data remain scarce due to the sparsity of ground stations, coarse observational resolution, unavailability of remote sensing data during cloudy conditions, and systematic biases among different techniques. In this study we developed the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) aided algorithms to retrieve Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) from near-infrared (NIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and microwave (MW) observations from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II) and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) onboard the Fengyun-3D satellite. We also proposed an improved iterative tropospheric decomposition algorithm to fuse the multiband PWV data, yielding the NIR + TIR PWV (0.01°), the MW PWV (0.25°), and the fused PWV (0.001°) for Australia. Validation against the GNSS PWV shows that the NIR + TIR PWV has a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.45 mm and a bias of 0.07 mm, implying a 34 % improvement over the operational NIR products in terms of RMSE. The MW PWV shows RMSE and bias of 1.86 mm and 0.05 mm. The fused PWV integrates the advantages of different datasets, further enhancing the accuracy by 15 % for the NIR + TIR PWV and 21 % for the MW PWV. This study made the first attempt to retrieve PWV from three-band observations and delivers high-quality PWV products, which fills the data gap for high-resolution, spatially continuous PWV information."

 The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations greatly determine the vertical microphysical evolution and rain initiation of warm convective clouds. We investigated the vertical profile of aerosol particles large enough (diameter > 60 nm) to act as CCN in marine air masses over the Great Barrier Reef. Such data were collected during an aircraft research campaign in February 2024. The results show a strong relationship between the microphysical processes measured in the cloud and the aerosol properties measured at the same altitude. The number concentration of aerosol particles decreases significantly above cloud bases due to CCN activation into cloud droplets. For heights above the in-cloud rain initiation level, the aerosol concentrations decrease further due to the scavenging of particles by drizzle and raindrops. The Hoppel minimum in particle size distributions is observed up to the altitude at which the coagulation process intensifies. Furthermore, a tail of larger aerosol particles was measured above the altitudes of rain initiation. These results suggest that the vertical profile of aerosols measured in marine air masses is dominated by cloud processing.Plain text summaryUnderstanding the role of aerosol-cloud interactions is crucial information in accurately predicting the effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Characterizing the properties of aerosol particles found over the Reef is essential in determining their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The evaporation of cloud droplets and raindrops represents an additional source that may influence the concentrations and sizes of aerosol. Here, we show that warm clouds dominate the vertical profiles of aerosol particles in the lower troposphere over the GBR. Our research shows that marine clouds work like a sink of aerosol particles found over the Reef. The cloud microphysical processes (activation of CCN into cloud droplets and the collision and coalescence processes) decrease the concentration of aerosol particles at the same altitude in the lower troposphere. Cloud processing develops the “Hoppel minima” or Hoppel minimum of the marine boundary layer aerosol size distributions as clouds evaporate. The Hoppel minimum is not observed in the particle size distributions above altitudes of intense coagulation processes. Above this level, the ultrafine particles dominate the aerosol concentrations."

 The evaluation of gridded precipitation datasets is crucial for enhancing precipitation accuracy and supporting its applications. This study comprehensively evaluated the performances of six widely used long-term precipitation datasets in capturing extreme precipitation and streamflow over China using two hydrological models. These datasets include one satellite-reanalysis-gauge dataset (MSWEP V2), two gauged-based datasets (GPCC and CPC), and three reanalysis datasets (NECP-2, MERRA-2, and ERA5). The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 1982–2020. Compared with the rain gauge observations, GPCC provides the best performance in extreme precipitation estimation, followed by MSWEPV2, CPC, and MERRA-2. All precipitation datasets tend to underestimate annual maximum 1-day precipitation (Rx1) and annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5), while they overestimate the extremely wet days (R95p) in dry northwestern China and underestimate it in wet southeastern China. Integrating gauge data into gridded precipitation datasets enhances the accuracy of extreme precipitation measurements. For streamflow simulation, GPCC shows the best performances across most catchments regarding hydrological calibration score (Kling–Gupta efficiency, KGE), except in arid northwestern China, where MSWEP V2 performed best. The ability of precipitation datasets to capture extreme streamflow is associated with considerable uncertainties, depending on the hydrological model used, and no single dataset consistently outperforms others. Besides, the influence of hydrological model selection in streamflow simulations is more significant in dry and high-latitude mountainous regions than in wet and low-latitude regions. This study provides significant insights into the reliability of the latest precipitation datasets and their applications in hydrological modeling, which is expected to serve as a reference for utilizing these datasets."

This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 and O3 in the BTH region from 2019 to 2022. We employed Geodetector, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to investigate the impacts of meteorological conditions and precursor emissions on PM2.5 and O3 from multiple perspectives: spatiotemporal differentiation, nonlinear responses, and causal relationships. This comprehensive exploration has enhanced our understanding of the interactions between these factors and revealed some intriguing phenomena.Environmental implicationPM2.5 and ozone are major atmospheric pollutants that pose significant threats to human health and the ecological environment, primarily influenced by precursor emissions and meteorological conditions. Clarifying the impact of these factors on PM2.5 and ozone is crucial for providing scientific insights into air pollution control. However, most current studies have not comprehensively explored these relationships, lacking multidimensional perspectives. Therefore, we propose a multi-perspective analytical approach that thoroughly examines these relationships from three key perspectives: spatiotemporal variability, nonlinear responses, and causal relationships. This approach offers a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between these factors."

 Like many small oceanic islands, the Galapagos archipelago, renowned for its unique geographic location and exceptional endemic biodiversity, faces significant challenges under climate change. In particular, the atmospheric water supply for the ecosystem and the local population is under threat, with clouds and rain playing an important role in ensuring freshwater availability under climate change. Better planning of adaptation measures would require climate data on clouds as a prerequisite for precipitation and rainfall at high spatio-temporal resolution, which are not available in this area. Operational products such as satellite derived cloud and precipitation products or reanalysis data are widely used to compensate for the lack of local data availability but are often poorly suited for regional applications. In the current study, we aim to generate high quality area-wide cloud information to distinguish ecoclimatic cloud zones that may require different adaptation measures to climate change. To address this issue, we have developed a new physical rule-based cloud mask retrieval specifically tailored for the Galapagos Archipelago, based on data from the third generation GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) geostationary satellite. The new Galapagos Rainfall Retrieval (GRR) cloudmask was tested against independent observational data and compared to both the operational GOES-16 ACM (ABI Clear sky Mask) and the MODIS cloudmask benchmark cloud mask. Our test results confirm that the GRR-cloudmask (Probability of Detection POD = 0.94, Critical Success Index CSI = 0.92–0.93) clearly outperforms the operational ACM-cloudmask (POD = 0.56–0.68, CSI = 0.55–0.67). Area-wide tests against the MODIS cloud mask showed a CSI of 0.72 and a POD of 0.74 for the ACM, which is superior to the GOES-16 ACM-cloudmask. We produced cloud frequency maps for all months and day slots and analysed cloud frequency using ancillary meteorological data. In general, the cool season (Jun-Dec) / night shows much higher cloud frequencies than the warm season (Jan-May) / daytime. However, regional cloud patterns differ along a west-to-east and south-to-north gradient, depending on complex interactions of forcing parameters such as exposure to the main circulation, sea surface temperature zones, altitude and land cover. A k-mean cluster analysis resulted in nine ecoclimatic cloud zones over land, which are much more differentiated than the widely used four-zone classification. The results will help to develop more site-specific climate change adaptation planning for the iconic Galapagos National Park."

 In 2022, the Yangtze River Basin in China experienced an unprecedented extreme drought, induced by high temperatures and precipitation deficits. Accurate monitoring of such extreme drought events is vitally significant for disaster mitigation under global warming. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two satellite-based precipitation products: the latest Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Final Run (IMERG-F) v07B and gauge-adjusted Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP-G) v8, using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to monitor the record-breaking drought. The evaluation was implemented based on the China Hydro-Meteorology precipitation (CHM_PRE) dataset with high-density stations. Results showed that the both satellite products presented satisfactory accuracy for the precipitation anomalies and monthly precipitation estimates. IMERG-F generally performed better than GSMaP-G, especially in the upstream region. Although the satellite-based SPEIs were constantly consistent with the CHM_PRE observations (correlation coefficient surpassing 0.9) in the midstream and downstream regions as the timescale increased, they exhibited greater spatial heterogeneity and temporal differentiation at longer timescales. IMERG-F demonstrated strong performance in detecting historical drought events, whereas it displayed worse reliability for the except 1-month drought estimates, as reflected by lower correlation and higher error metrics. During the 2022 extreme drought, IMERG-F-based SPEI had more reliable performance in identifying the stricken area and severity of meteorological drought. Conversely, GSMaP-G was more effective in characterizing the variability of summer agricultural drought and hydrological drought. These findings can provide valuable insights for the use of satellite remote sensing products in monitoring extreme drought events, offering potential to reduce drought risks and improve disaster management strategies."

The MCM model is effective in the study of PAN photochemical formation and performed better during the clean period than the haze period. Machine learning analysis identified ammonia, nitrate, and fine particulate matter as the top three factors contributing to simulation bias. 
 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), a key indicator of photochemical pollution, is generated similarly to ozone (O3), through reactions involving specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides. Notably, PAN has been observed at unexpectedly high concentrations (maximum: 3.04 ppb) during the summertime. The average daily values of PAN show a strong correlation with black carbon (BC) (R = 0.77) and O3 (R = 0.77), suggesting a close connection between summertime haze and photochemical pollution. We addressed the puzzle of summertime PAN formation and its association with aerosol pollution under high-O3 conditions in Xiamen, a coastal city in southeastern China, by analyzing continuous high-temporal-resolution data utilizing box modeling in conjunction with the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) model. The MCM model, with an index of agreement (IOA) value of 0.75, effectively investigates PAN formation, performing better during the clean period (R2: 0.68; slope K: 0.91) than the haze one (R2: 0.47; slope K: 0.75). Using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we identified NH3, NO3-, and PM2.5 as the primary factors for simulation bias. Moreover, the net production rate of PAN becomes negative with PAN constrained, suggesting an unknown compensatory mechanism. Both relative incremental reactivity (RIR) and empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA) analyses indicate that PAN formation is VOC-controlled. Controlling emissions of VOCs, particularly alkenes, C5H8, and aromatics, would mitigate PAN pollution. PAN promotes OH and HO2 while inhibiting the formation of O3, RO2, NO, and NO2. This study deepens our comprehension of PAN photochemistry while also offering scientific insights for guiding future PAN pollution control strategies."

We categorize organic compounds into weak, intermediate, and strong surfactants, and we outline for which composition surface tension lowering is important. The results suggest that surface tension lowering allows sea spray aerosol particles in the Aitken mode to be a source of CCN in marine updraughts. 
 In marine environments, sea spray aerosol (SSA) particles have been found to contain surface-active substances (surfactants) originating from the sea surface microlayer. These surfactants can lower the surface tension of the SSA particles, facilitating their activation to cloud droplets. This effect is not considered in classical Köhler theory, which assumes droplets to be homogeneous with a surface tension of pure water. In this study the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of SSA particles calculated with classical Köhler theory is compared to a more complex calculation that considers bulk–surface partitioning, surface tension lowering, and liquid–liquid phase separation. The model approach presented here combines the multi-component Eberhart model for surface tension with the monolayer model and an activity model (Aerosol Inorganic–Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients, AIOMFAC). This combination allows for calculating Köhler curves of surfactant-containing particles with a large number of compounds for the first time. In a sensitivity study we show that organic compounds can be categorized into weak, intermediate, and strong surfactants for CCN activation based on their separation factor in water S1i and their pure component surface tension σi. For a quaternary model system of SSA particles, it is shown that high content of hydrophobic organic material (i.e. strong surfactants) in Aitken mode particles does not necessarily prevent good CCN activation but rather facilitates effective activation via surface tension lowering. Since common climate models use parameterizations that are based on classical Köhler theory, these results suggest that the CCN activity of small SSA particles might be underestimated in climate models."

The addition of geomagnetic forcing led to significant ozone losses in the polar upper stratosphere of both hemispheres due to the catalytic cycles involving NOy. In addition to the particle precipitation effect, accounting for solar UV variability in the ICON-ART model leads to the changes in ozone in the tropical stratosphere. 
 We extended the Linearized ozone scheme –LINOZ in the ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) –ART (the extension for Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) model system to include NOy formed by auroral and medium-energy electrons in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and the corresponding ozone loss, as well as changes in the rate of ozone formation due to the variability of the solar radiation in the ultraviolet wavelength range. This extension allows us to realistically represent variable solar and geomagnetic forcing in the middle atmosphere using a very simple ozone scheme. The LINOZ scheme is computationally very cheap compared to a full middle atmosphere chemistry scheme, yet provides realistic ozone fields consistent with the stratospheric circulation and temperatures, and can thus be used in climate models instead of prescribed ozone climatologies. To include the reactive nitrogen (NOy) produced by auroral and radiation belt electron precipitation in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere during polar winter, the so-called energetic particle precipitation indirect effect an upper boundary condition for NOy has been implemented into the simplified parameterization scheme of the N2O/NOy reactions. This parameterization, which uses the geomagnetic Ap index, is also recommended for chemistry-climate models in the CMIP6 experiments. With this extension, the model simulates realistic „tongues“ of NOy propagating downward in polar witner from the model top in the upper mesosphere into the mid-stratosphere with an amplitude that is modulated by geomagnetic activity. We then expanded the simplified ozone description used in the model by applying LINOZ version 3. The additional ozone tendency from NOy is included by applying the corresponding terms of the version 3 of LINOZ. This NOy, coupled as an additional term in the linearized ozone chemistry, led to significant ozone losses in the polar upper stratosphere in both hemispheres which is qualitatively in good agreement with ozone observations and model simulations with EPP-NOy and full stratospheric chemistry. In a subsequent step, the tabulated coefficients forming the basis of the LINOZ scheme were provided separately for solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. These coefficients were then interpolated to ICON- ART using the F10.7 index as a proxy for daily solar spectra (UV) variability to account for solar UV forcing. This solar UV forcing in the model led to changes in ozone in the tropical and mid-latitude stratosphere consistent with observed solar signals in stratospheric ozone."

Engineered by coordination chemistry, SiO2-CeO2 composite oxides with a short-range ordered Ce–O–Si structure were elaborately constructed on a TiO2 support. A dynamic coordination environment of active sites is demonstrated from a Ce–O–Si local structure to a low-coordinated Ce-SO42– species in the presence of SO2. The low-coordinated Ce-SO42– species as new active sites maintain a high NO removal efficiency by preserving the good adsorption and activation capacity of NO and NH3 reactants. This work proposes a new notion to improve the SO2 resistance of catalysts by regulating the coordination environment of sulfated active sites, which is of significance for SO2-tolerant environmental catalysis in practical applications."

Here, we find that the probability density function for western North Pacific TC lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) has an amplified bimodal distribution in recent years. This change implies a trend toward more extreme TCs and fewer moderate TCs. Changes in the TC LMI distribution are associated with alterations in the occurrence of rapidly intensifying TCs. Changes in TC tracks, due to alterations in the steering flow linked to a weakening Hadley cell, cause more TCs to move northwestward into a more favorable environment for intensification with large ocean heat content. Consequently, more rapidly intensifying TCs reach higher intensities, significantly contributing to the observed amplified bimodal distribution. These findings provide new insights into changes in TC intensity and highlight the increasing threat to coastal areas from more intense TCs in a warming climate."

 Ozone is the primary air pollutant in eastern China during the warm season. Clarifying the differences in the spatio–temporal evolution of the ozone formation sensitivity between ozone polluted days and clean air days is key for the precise formulation of ozone prevention policies. By combining ground–and satellite–based remote sensing with ground station observations, we identified large spatio–temporal differences in the ozone formation sensitivity in eastern Chinese cities under different ozone pollution levels. Diurnally, the NO2 concentration was higher in the morning and lower at noon on the ozone exceedance days. The HCHO concentration was higher throughout the day, and the transition limited regime or NOx–limited regime contributed more to the ozone formation sensitivity on the ozone exceedance days. Vertically, the ratio of HCHO to NO2 (FNR) was higher on ozone exceedance days, and the contributions of NOx–limited regime at 0–2 km and the transition limited regime at 0–1 km on ozone exceedance days increased considerably. Spatially, HCHO in the North China Plain and middle–lower Yangtze River Plain was significantly increased on ozone exceedance days, while the NO2 concentration in the southeast hills was increased on ozone exceedance days. The difference in FNR values between northern and southern cities in eastern China on O3 exceedance days narrowed, and the ozone formation sensitivity in eastern China tended to be under a transition limited regime. The shifts in the ozone formation sensitivity under different ozone pollution levels implies that controlling only one of the precursors cannot achieve the best O3 prevention effect, and the most appropriate ratio of O3 precursor emission reductions should be designed according to ozone formation sensitivity in the different regions."

 Arctic sea-ice extent has reduced by over 40% during late summer since 1979, and the day-to-day changes in sea ice extent have shifted to more negative values. Drivers of Arctic weather that cause large short-term changes are rarely predicted more than a week in advance. Here we investigate variability in changes in sea ice extent for periods of less than 18 days and their association to Arctic cyclones and tropopause polar vortices. We find that these very rapid sea ice loss events are substantial year-round and have increased over the last 30 years in June-August due to thinning sea ice that is more susceptible to forcings from ocean waves and low-level atmospheric wind. These events occur in regions of enhanced near-surface level pressure gradients between synoptic-scale high and low pressure systems over regions of relatively thin sea ice, and are preceded by tropopause polar vortices.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter of the surface-atmosphere system, driving the water and heat exchange between the surface and the atmosphere. However, existing LST retrieval methods are highly sensitive to input errors. This study proposed a robust framework for retrieving LST, termed SW-NN, which integrates the physics-based Split-Window (SW) algorithm with a data-driven Neural Network (NN). The framework comprises of two main components: (1) a NN model that estimates SW coefficients as functions of key parameters such as brightness temperature (BT), water vapor content (WVC), land surface emissivity (LSE), and viewing zenith angle (VZA); and (2) a SW model that applies these coefficients to compute LST based on physical principles. By embedding the SW algorithm into the NN's loss function, this integrated design ensures that physical relationships guide the training process. The training data for the framework were generated by simulating satellite BT under a broad range of atmospheric and surface conditions using a radiative transfer model. To address the challenge of input errors, the proposed framework incorporates Gaussian noise into the training data to simulate realistic uncertainties in BT, WVC, and LSE. Specifically, noise with standard deviations of 0.05 K, 10 % of the WVC value, and 0.01 was added to BT, WVC, and LSE, respectively. Simulation analysis on an independent test set demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves a theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.60 K under the noise strategy, outperforming standalone NN and SW models. Sensitivity analysis, conducted using the same noise strategy applied during training, indicates that input errors affect LST retrieval by approximately 0.20 K, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and robustness. The proposed framework was also applied to MODIS data to retrieve LST, which was directly validated against global measurements from fifteen sites. Additionally, the proposed framework was compared with the NN method, the generalized split-window (GSW) method (MOD11 LST), and the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) method (MOD21 LST). The results showed that the proposed framework achieved an RMSE of 1.99 K, outperforming the NN method (RMSE = 2.08 K) and the GSW method (RMSE = 2.52 K), and performing comparably to the TES method (RMSE = 2.03 K). Further analysis in arid areas, where LSE accuracy is relatively lower, showed that the proposed framework improved the RMSE to 1.94 K compared to MOD11 LST, which had an RMSE of 3.02 K, utilizing the same LSE inputs. The proposed framework leverages the SW model's mechanism and the NN model's nonlinear fitting capability. It also demonstrates high robustness against input error, particularly LSE error. In summary, the proposed framework achieves robust and accurate LST retrieval, offering interpretability and a significant improvement over existing methods designed for sensors with two thermal infrared channels, especially in challenging environmental conditions.

 We have developed and tested a simplified but versatile numerical model of nanoparticles’ aggregation using Langevin dynamics. The model is particularly capable of simulating aggregation in an evaporating (or condensing) microdroplet. It runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU), which makes it sufficiently fast for real-time conceptualization tasks. We have verified the results of modeling against the findings from two types of experiments we conducted in electrodynamic traps. Firstly, our model helped us to elucidate the phenomenon of scattering ‘revival’, often observed during the evaporation of composite microdroplets. Further on, we were able to mimic our experiments, in which the microdroplets were dried up to form nanoparticle (NP) aggregates, and then soft-landed. Thus we could compare model predictions with SEM imaging. The model was tested for up to 2.5×105 nanoparticles of several coexisting types. Several types of interactions can be accounted for: inter-particle: Lennard-Jones and Coulomb; external: dispersion medium viscosity, centrifugal force, gravity, surface tension, and interface movement. Brownian motion of nanoparticles can be freely controlled. The core program is accompanied by scripts extracting statistical NP aggregates properties in post-processing — fractal dimension and radial distribution functions. The codes are made available in public repositories. Several diverse evolution scenarios are presented."

 This study simulates the BC concentrations in India using the WRF-Chem model with four emissions inventories: Expt-I (Constrained emissions), Expt-II (SMOG-India), Expt-III (EDGAR-HTAP V3), and Expt-IV (Mix), emphasizing on two domains, the whole Indian region (D01) and the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) (D02). The simulated BC over D01 was 2–3 times higher using Expt-I compared to Expt-II and Expt-III, despite the similar spatial-seasonal variations. BC simulations from Expt-I show good agreement with observed data, particularly at megacities like Delhi and Kolkata with high anthropogenic emissions. However, Expt-III underestimates BC concentrations at certain stations, suggesting the need for improvement in emission-inventory strength and proper distribution of emissions. The diurnal BC pattern from Expt-I matches well with measured BC, with higher concentrations during late evening and night hours in the IGP and large cities. High-altitude stations present a BC peak during late afternoon hours due to the transport of pollutants from the IGP within a deeper mixing layer. BC simulations show better agreement during the daytime than nighttime, indicating the effect of nighttime emission strength that needs better representation, while the model underestimations maximize in winter, associated with the highest BC concentrations. Source apportionment analysis revealed the highest contribution from the domestic sector to total BC emissions (58 %) during winter, underscoring the reliance on biofuel combustion for household cooking and heating. The energy and industrial sector contributed significantly to the annual BC levels over the IGP, ranging from 22 % in winter to 28 % in monsoon. The increased contribution from the open burning sector during post-monsoon indicates the effect of crop residue burning in NW IGP. By quantifying BC concentration and identifying its dominant sources utilizing the robust emission inventory, this work provides actionable insights for policymakers and a scientific basis for strategies to mitigate BC pollution and its associated environmental and health impacts."

 This study investigates the influence of local circulations, specifically stagnation and recirculation, on high ozone concentration events in Seoul during the summer (May–August) from 2016 to 2021. Local circulations were classified into Stagnation, Recirculation, and Ventilation types using the recirculation factor (RF), calculated as the ratio of net displacement distance (L) to actual displacement distance (S) based on wind observation data. Stagnation was the most frequently observed type, characterized by the highest daily maximum ozone concentrations and meteorological conditions unfavorable for dispersion, such as weak winds. During stagnation periods, limited air flow resulted in the accumulation of ozone within the urban area, with horizontal transport (HTRANS process) identified as a significant contributor to increased ozone concentrations near the surface. Additionally, nighttime ozone concentrations decreased due to active NO titration, accompanied by an increase in NO₂. In contrast, recirculation periods were marked by the presence of elevated ozone concentrations (∼0.07 ppm) at altitudes above 500 m during the early morning. This residual ozone, transported offshore by nighttime land breezes, was brought back inland by daytime sea breezes and subsequently transported downward to the surface through vertical transport (VTRANS process), contributing significantly to surface ozone levels. The differences in ozone formation mechanisms between stagnation and recirculation highlight the role of limited dispersion in stagnation and the combined effects of sea breeze and vertical transport in recirculation. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding local circulation patterns, particularly the interaction between land and sea breezes, in predicting and managing high ozone events during the summer. The study underscores the need for long-term climatological research on local circulations and their impact on urban air quality to inform effective air quality management strategies."

 Nitrate aerosol (NO3−) has increasingly contributed to particular matter pollution in many regions worldwide, yet the relative contributions of key sources and oxidation pathways to NO3− remain poorly understood in South China. In this study, we present a year-long observation of the signatures for oxygen isotope anomaly (Δ17O) and stable nitrogen isotopic composition (δ15N) in NO3− collected at different heights (ground, 118 m, 488 m) from Canton Tower in South China covering the period from October 18, 2018 to August 10, 2019. Δ17O-δ15N-derived measurements showed that the main contributors to the oxidation pathways and source of NO3− in Guangzhou during the sampling campaign were NO2 + OH (58.1 %) and coal combustion (34.3 %), respectively. Interestingly, there was an obvious vertical change for both the source and oxidation pathways of NO3− under different NO3− pollution levels. During periods of slight pollution, there was no significant difference in the oxidation pathways among the three heights, despite the ground-level NO3− concentration being much higher than at the other two altitudes. In contrast, during severe NO3− pollution episodes, the contribution of nocturnal chemistry (NO3 + HC/N2O5 + Cl− and N2O5 + H2O) to NO3− formation reached up to 60.4 % at 118 m and 57.1 % at 488 m, which is 1.4 to 1.5 times higher than the contribution observed at ground level. Taken together, our year-long measurements for the signatures of Δ17O and δ15N in NO3− highlight the important role of nocturnal chemistry and coal combustion in driving NO3− pollution in the largest city of South China."

Tai;Lina Luo;Biao Luo,Opinion: Understanding the impacts of agriculture and food systems on atmospheric chemistry is instrumental to achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals,"We discuss our current understanding of and knowledge gaps in how agriculture and food systems affect air quality and how agricultural emissions can be mitigated. We argue that scientists need to address these gaps, especially as the importance of fossil fuel emissions is fading. This will help guide food-system transformation in economically viable, socially inclusive, and environmentally responsible ways and is essential to help society achieve sustainable development. 
 Agriculture and food systems play important roles in shaping atmospheric chemistry and air quality, most dominantly via the release of reactive nitrogen (Nr) compounds but also via agricultural burning, energy use, and cropland and pastureland expansion. In this opinion article, we first succinctly review our current understanding of agricultural and food-system emissions of Nr and other atmospherically relevant compounds; their fates and impacts on air quality, human health, and terrestrial ecosystems; and how such emissions can be potentially mitigated through better cropland management, livestock management, and whole-food-system transformation. In doing so, we highlight important knowledge gaps that warrant more extensive research and argue that we scientists need to provide a more detailed, process-based understanding of the impacts of agriculture and food systems on atmospheric chemistry, including both chemical composition and processes, especially as the importance of emissions from other fossil-fuel-intensive sectors is fading in the face of regulatory measures worldwide. Such knowledge is necessary to guide food-system transformation in technologically feasible, economically viable, socially inclusive, and environmentally responsible ways and is essential to help society achieve multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially to ensure food security for people, protect human and ecosystem health, improve farmers' livelihoods, and ultimately help communities achieve socioeconomic and environmental sustainability."
10.5194/amt-18-371-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文关注的是欧洲地区氧合挥发性有机化合物（OVOCs）的精准测量和数据可比性问题。由于OVOCs在大气中的含量低且缺乏稳定的可溯源校准标准，其监测一直具有挑战性。文章的核心在于建立一套可溯源到国际单位制（SI）的OVOCs校准标准，以提高测量精度和数据一致性。研究人员开发了两种类型的可溯源工作标准，并使用热脱附-气相色谱-火焰离子化检测器（TD-GC-FID）和质子转移反应-飞行时间-质谱仪（PTR-ToF-MS）进行了评估。虽然文章主要集中在实验室校准和标准物质的制备，但其最终目标是改进OVOCs的现场监测，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是地面空气质量监测密切相关。更精确的OVOCs测量数据将有助于更准确地评估对流层臭氧负荷和趋势，从而改进大气成分分析和空气质量模型。,"['Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs)', 'Tropospheric ozone', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Calibration standards', 'Gas chromatography', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Traceability', 'International System of Units (SI)']",Maitane Iturrate-Garcia;Thérèse Salameh;Paul Schlauri;Annarita Baldan;Martin K.

However, the monitoring of many OVOCs remains challenging because of their low atmospheric abundance and lack of stable and traceable calibration standards. This paper describes the calibration standards developed for OVOCs at a low amount of substance fractions (<100 nmol mol-1) to transfer traceability of the International System of Units to the field. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a large impact on the oxidising capacity of the troposphere and are major precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary atmospheric aerosols. Accurate measurements and data comparability of VOCs among monitoring networks are essential to assessing the trends of these secondary air pollutants. Metrological traceability of the measurements to the International System of Units (SI traceability) contributes to both measurement consistency and data comparability. Accurate, stable and SI-traceable reference gas mixtures (RGMs) and working standards are needed to achieve SI traceability through an unbroken chain of calibrations of the analytical instruments used to monitor VOCs. However, for many oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), such RGMs and working standards are not available at an atmospheric amount of substance fraction levels (< 10 nmol mol−1). Here, we present the protocols developed to transfer SI traceability to the field by producing two types of SI-traceable working standards for selected OVOCs. These working standards, based on RGMs diluted dynamically with dry nitrogen and on certified spiked whole-air samples, were then assessed using a thermal desorber–gas chromatograph–flame ionisation detector (TD–GC–FID) and proton transfer reaction–time of flight–mass spectrometer (PTR–ToF–MS) as analytical methods. For that purpose, we calibrated five analytical instruments using in-house calibration standards and treated the new SI-traceable working standards as samples. Due to analytical limitations, the assessment was only possible for acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). Relative differences between assigned and measured values were used to assess the working standards based on the dilution of RGMs. The relative differences were within the measurement uncertainty for acetone, MEK, methanol and acetaldehyde at an amount of substance fractions around 10 nmol mol−1. For the working standards based on certified spiked whole-air samples in pressurised cylinders, results showed a good agreement among the laboratories (i.e. differences within the measurement expanded uncertainty (U) ranging between 0.5 and 3.3 nmol mol−1) and with the certified amount of substance fraction for acetaldehyde (15.7 nmol mol−1 ± 3.6 (U) nmol mol−1), acetone (17 nmol mol−1 ± 1.5 (U) nmol mol−1) and MEK (12.3 nmol mol−1 ± 2.3 (U) nmol mol−1). Despite the promising results for the working standards based on the dilution of RGMs and on certified spiked whole-air samples filled into pressurised cylinders, the assessment must be considered with care due to the large measurement uncertainty, particularly for methanol. Active collaboration among the metrological, meteorological and atmospheric chemistry monitoring communities is needed to tackle the challenges of OVOC monitoring, such as the lack of stable and SI-traceable calibration standards (i.e. RGMs and working standards). Besides this collaboration, other research applications, such as modelling and remote sensing, may benefit from the transfer of SI traceability to monitoring stations."

 Ozone profile measurements at high temporal and vertical resolution are needed to better understand physical and chemical processes driving tropospheric ozone variability and to validate the tropospheric ozone measurements from spaceborne missions such as TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution). As part of the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) efforts allocated to provide such measurements and leveraging on the experience of more than 20 years of ozone lidar measurements at Table Mountain Facility, the JPL lidar group developed the SMOL (Small Mobile Ozone Lidar), an affordable differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system covering all altitudes from 200 to 10 km above ground level (a.g.l.). The transmitter is based on a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser, which is further converted into a 289/299 nm wavelength pair using Raman shifting cells, and the receiver consists of three ozone DIAL pairs, including one that is 266/289 nm and two that are 289/299 nm. Two units were deployed in the Los Angeles basin area during the Synergistic TEMPO Air Quality Science (STAQS) and Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) campaigns in summer 2023. The comparison with airborne in situ and lidar measurements shows very good agreement, with systematic differences below 10 % throughout most of the measurement range. An additional comparison with nearby surface ozone measuring instruments indicates unbiased measurements by the SMOL lidars down to 200 m a.g.l. Further comparison with the Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) model suggests that such lidars are a critical tool to perform model validation and can potentially be used for assimilation to air quality forecasts."

Few studies have examined the ClNO2 chemistry from the perspective of the planetary boundary layer. Here, we conducted a vertically resolved investigation of ClNO2 at six heights (ranging from 5 to 335 m) on a 356 m tower in the Pearl River Delta, China, during winter 2021. Nocturnal ClNO2 is notably lower at the surface than the upper layers, with the nocturnal median concentration at 220 m (51 parts per trillion by volume, pptv) being approximately three times higher than that recorded in the surface layer (16 pptv). Observation-constrained box model simulations show that the NO gradients primarily account for the vertical disparities. Compared to the hydroxyl radical (OH) production via the nitrous acid and ozone photolysis, ClNO2 photolysis contributes to radical formation by 3.8% (1.8%) at 220 m (5 m) in the morning (07:00–08:00), indicates the enhanced significance of ClNO2 chemistry aloft compared with the ground, and may cause the underestimation of ClNO2 photolysis impacts if solely relying on surface measurements. We highlight that more field studies are needed to elucidate ClNO2 chemistry across the boundary layer."

In this work, a highly active and stable Pt1/CeO2 single-site catalyst with only 0.1 wt % Pt loading, achieving a satisfied complete conversion of CO at 150 °C, can be obtained through fabricating asymmetric Pt1O4-oxygen vacancies (Ov) dual-active sites induced by well-dispersed NbOx clusters. Specifically, the formation of new Ce–O–Nb interactions weakened the strength of the original Pt–O–Ce bond, thus transferring the originally near-perfect square-planar Pt1O4 into the distorted square-planar one, along with forming abundant Ov around the Pt site. Hence, the promoted CO activation on the asymmetric Pt1O4 structure and the facilitated dissociation of the O2 on the neighboring Ov site synergistically improved the CO catalytic oxidation performance. The fabrication of such asymmetric Pt1O4–Ov double-active sites was also active for the oxidation of other typical hydrocarbons pollutants such as C7H8 and C3H6 from exhaust gases, shedding light on engineering high-efficiency Pt-based oxidation catalysts for low-temperature environmental catalysis."

This approach allows us to identify the causality and dominant adjustment timescales governing the correlation between LWP and Nd.

Diagnostic analysis reveals that the westward winds in the Southern (summer) Hemisphere were anomalously strong (maximum of ∼90 m/s) during December 2023, which significantly shortened the e‐folding time of QTDW‐W3, and additionally generated the QTDW‐W3 critical layers at the tropical summer stratopause from December 7.

However, MPs have not been considered as contributors to INP concentrations. Here, we quantify road traffic‐related MP number concentrations, and estimate their contribution to total INP concentrations using the atmospheric transport model FLEXPART. We find that under a high emission scenario ice‐active MPs can account from about 0.1% to more than 40% of the total INP number in immersion freezing conditions in the tropics, whereas for cirrus conditions, their contribution can be up to about 7% over the tropical Pacific and up to about 20% over East Antarctica. Thus, in regions where other effective INPs are rare, ice‐active MP concentrations may be sufficient to trigger heterogeneous nucleation of ice crystals in mixed‐phase clouds or cirrus. This suggests that MP may affect cloud formation and highlights the need to reduce uncertainty in MP emissions and their fate in the atmosphere as plastic use continues to grow."

The ice core chronology is based on variability in nitrate and calcium ions, which reveal an apparently seasonal periodicity (with winter maxima) throughout the core's length. Two annual boundaries are consistent with the tritium peak representing nuclear tests conducted in 1963 CE and with the spike in sulfate ions due to the eruption of Krakatau in 1883 CE. The ice core spans 145 years from 1875 to 2019 CE. Dating uncertainties due to the layer counting methodology were estimated as ±1 $\pm 1$ year for 1963–2019 CE and ±2 $\pm 2$ years for 1875–1963 CE. Comparison with earlier ice cores drilled on the northern side of the Himalayas revealed that the ion components exhibit inverse correlations with two key climatic indices: the North Atlantic Oscillation and Southern Oscillation Index. Composite analysis of reanalysis climate data suggests that these inverse relationships reflect springtime pressure patterns, which show regional differences between the northern and southern sides of the Himalayan range."

10.1038/s41561-024-01632-w,True,Nature Geoscience,这篇论文研究了意大利坎皮佛莱格瑞火山口近年来轻同位素硫排放量的增加。研究者利用多年代际的地面气体观测数据，结合水热气体平衡和岩浆脱气数值模拟，推断这种变化可能是由于深部岩浆减压脱气以及水热矿物中硫的再迁移造成的。研究认为，增加的轻同位素硫排放可能是火山口重新苏醒的指标。论文指出，尽管火山喷发行为和构造环境多样，但硫排放量的增加可能是全球范围内火山口不安定加剧过程中的普遍现象。因此，对硫行为的观测和模型可以为全球范围内重新苏醒的火山口和具有水热活动火山的不安定性解释和灾害评估提供信息。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注的是火山气体排放物（特别是二氧化硫）的大气成分分析，这些排放物可以用卫星遥感和地面空气质量监测技术进行观测。,"['sulfur dioxide', 'volcanic gas emissions', 'satellite remote sensing', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'ground-based measurements']",S.

 Calderas are depressions formed by some of the largest volcanic eruptions. Their long-lived inter-eruptive periods are occasionally interrupted by phases of unrest, in which escalating seismicity, ground deformation and gas emissions raise concerns of potential volcano reawakening. However, interpretation of such physico-chemical signals is complicated by few examples of monitored unrest that culminated into eruption and by our fragmentary understanding of the drivers and timescales of caldera reactivation. Here we show that multi-decadal gas observations at the restless Campi Flegrei caldera in Italy record an unprecedented increase in isotopically light sulfur release from fumaroles since 2018. We then use hydrothermal gas equilibria and numerical simulations of magmatic degassing to propose that such a change in sulfur emissions results from decompression-driven degassing of mafic magma at ≥6 km depth, along with some extent of sulfur remobilization from hydrothermal minerals. Examination of a global dataset indicates that, despite the diversity in eruptive behaviour and tectonic setting, increasing sulfur output may be a common process during unrest escalation at calderas generally. Hence, our observations and models of sulfur behaviour may inform interpretations of unrest and hazard assessment at reawakening calderas and hydrothermal active volcanoes worldwide. The recent increase in isotopically light sulfur emissions from Campi Flegrei (Italy) is probably the result of degassing magma at ≥6 km depth and could be an indicator of caldera reawakening generally, according to observations and simulations."

 Land surface temperature (LST) acquired from polar orbiters serves as a critical dataset for investigating daily clear-sky climatology of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs). However, these orbiters only capture instantaneous LSTs at specific overpass times within a diurnal cycle, thus limiting the analysis of temporally sensitive SUHI metrics such as daily mean, maximum, and minimum SUHI intensity (SUHII). Consequently, the representativeness of daily clear-sky SUHI climatology derived from these instantaneous LSTs remains unclear, especially across global cities. Here we employ Aqua & Terra MODIS LST data alongside a well-established diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model to assess such representativeness of daily clear-sky SUHI climatology, primarily based on the SUHII biases estimated from DTC-derived diurnally continuous and satellite-based temporally discrete LSTs across global cities. This approach discloses the fidelity of satellite-derived instantaneous LSTs to in representing daily clear-sky SUHI climatology. We further dissect the drivers of SUHII biases using the LightGBM model and SHAP algorithm. Our results reveal substantial underestimation of daily mean and maximum SUHIIs alongside overestimation of minimum SUHII when compared to the estimates directly based on instantaneous LSTs. The annual global mean SUHII biases for daily mean, maximum, and minimum conditions are 0.21 ± 0.13 K, 0.51 ± 0.18 K, and − 0.43 ± 0.17 K, respectively. We observe substantial seasonal and geographic variability in SUHII biases, with greater SUHII biases during winter, in snow climates, and across Europe and Oceania when compared to other seasons, climates, and continents. Notably, background climate is the principal contributor (34 %) to variation in SUHII bias, followed by surface properties (28 %), urban metrics (20 %), and human activity (18 %). Our findings emphasize the importance and show the feasibility of correcting SUHII biases in daily clear-sky SUHI climatology derived from instantaneous LSTs from polar orbiters across global cities."

 Satellite burned area, active fire and fire radiative power (FRP), are key to quantifying fire activity and are one of 54 essential climate variables (ECV) and it is important to validate these data to ensure their consistency. This study investigates some of the factors that influence FRP retrieval and uses Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) data to do so. Analysis of the influence of a fire’s location within a SEVIRI pixel on FRP was carried out using fire simulations which indicate that FRP varies by up to 14 % at nadir for a single sensor and by up to 55 % when intercomparing simulated FRP from different SEVIRI sensors. Intercomparison between actual MET-11 and MET-08 FRP data on a per-pixel basis reveals a high degree of scatter (81.9 MW), strong correlation (R = 0.72), low bias (∼1 MW) and an average percentage difference of 15.7 %. Variability is reduced when aggregated to fire ‘clusters’ which improves the correlation (R = 0.96) and reduces the average percentage difference (4.2 %). Validation of MET-08 and MET-11 FRP retrievals using FRP from helicopter mounted longwave infrared (LWIR) and midwave infrared (MWIR) thermal cameras is carried out over five prescribed burns. The results reveal good agreement between the SEVIRI and thermal camera FRP although the SEVIRI FRP is typically overestimated compared to that from the LWIR camera. This study illustrates some of the challenges validating satellite FRP which should be accounted for when defining uncertainty thresholds for product requirements and in developing FRP validation protocols."

 Surface air temperature (SAT) is an essential climate variable (ECV). Models based on remote sensing data allow us to study SAT, without the need for a large network of meteorological stations. Therefore, it allows monitoring the climate in remote and extensive areas. Niclos et al. (2014) proposed parametric equations for the SAT retrieval over the Spanish Mediterranean basins. In this study, we evaluated those equations, but in a larger area and period of study. In addition, we proposed several linear regression models and nonlinear models based on decision tree methods, non-parametric methods and neuronal networks. These models relate SAT to land surface temperature, vegetation indexes and albedo from MODIS data. Moreover, meteorological reanalysis data, from ERA5-Land database, and geographical parameters were used. The accuracy of each model was evaluated against data from meteorological stations operated by AEMET in the Spanish Mediterranean basins, during the period 2021–2022. The equations of Niclos et al. (2014) obtained a robust root mean square error (RRMSE) of 3.1 K at daytime and 1.9 K at nighttime. For the linear regression models, the RRMSE decreased to 2.3 K (1.5 K) at daytime (nighttime). Finally, the nonlinear methods, in particular XGBoost model, showed an RRMSE of 1.5 K for daytime and 1.0 K at nighttime. Therefore, the comparison between methods showed that nonlinear models, in particular those based on decision tree methods, offered the best results in SAT retrieval in our study."

However, accurate measurement remains challenging, particularly in countries such as India where ground monitors are scarce despite high expected exposure and health burdens. This lack of precise measurements impedes understanding of changes in pollution exposure over time and across populations. Here, we develop open-source daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) datasets at a 10-kilometer resolution for India from 2005 to 2023 using a two-stage machine learning model validated on held-out monitor data. Analyzing long-term air quality trends, we find that PM2.5concentrations increased across most of the country until around 2016 and then declined partly due to favorable meteorology in southern India. Recent reductions in PM2.5were substantially larger in wealthier areas, highlighting the urgency of air quality control policies addressing all socioeconomic communities. To advance equitable air quality monitoring, we propose additional monitor locations in India and examine the adaptability of our method to other countries with scarce monitoring data."

We identified a total of 398 molecules, primarily polar and low-volatile compounds. Since the 1950s, the atmospheric aerosol composition has changed, with the appearance of organic molecules, including nitrogen-containing compounds, deriving from enhanced atmospheric reactions with anthropogenic NOx, or direct emissions. In addition, there was a significant increase in the oxygen-to-carbon ratio (+3%) and the average carbon oxidation state (+18%) of the detected molecules compared to the pre-industrial period, suggesting an increased oxidative capacity of the atmosphere."

However, the relationship between variability in fire emissions and alpine glacier melting on the Third Pole (TP) remains poorly understood. This study provides evidence that carbon emissions from windward vegetation fires play a crucial role in comprehending glacier melting on the TP, particularly during the months of intense vegetation fires from March to May for monsoon-dominated glaciers and from June to October for westerlies-dominated glaciers. Furthermore, robust positive correlations (with p < 0.05) have been observed since 1997 across the TP between variations in glacier melting and fire carbon emissions during both annual periods and those intense fire months. In addition to climate warming, intensified fire carbon emissions could potentially accelerate the melting and mass loss of TP glaciers, especially during those traditionally nonmelting months. An urgent reassessment of the impact of fire carbon emissions on changes in TP glaciers is necessary, given that meltwater during traditionally nonmelting months can reshape freshwater resource supply patterns, and the projected increased wildfire risk in high mountainous regions in a rapidly warming climate."

Several field studies in China have revealed elevated levels of daytime molecular chlorine (Cl2), which, upon photolysis, release substantial amounts of Cl· but are poorly represented in current chemical transport models. Here, we implemented a parametrization for the formation of daytime Cl2 through the photodissociation of particulate nitrate in acidic environments into a regional model and assessed its impact on coastal air quality during autumn in South China. The model could reproduce over 70% of the high Cl2 level measured at a coastal site, revealing a discernible presence of Cl2 and released Cl· in coastal and adjacent areas. Abundant Cl2 alters the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, consequently increasing O3 (6–12%) and PM2.5 (10–16%) concentrations in high-NOx areas and reducing O3 (3%) concentration in low-NOx areas. Accounting for chlorine chemistry shifts the O3 – precursor relationships from VOC limited to mixed or NOx -limited regimes, enhancing the benefits of NOx emission reduction in mitigating O3 pollution. Our findings suggest that tightening emission control for two acidic pollutants, NOx and SO2, would alleviate reactive Cl· production and its adverse impact on air quality."

These semigasifier cookstoves showed higher ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions but lower bulk PM2.5 emissions. Operation of pellet-fueled cookstoves at higher firepower resulted in higher PM2.5 and UFP emission factors and higher EC-to-total-carbon ratios; operation at lower firepower resulted in higher gaseous pollutant emission factors.

Herein, based on comprehensive field measurements at a hilltop on Corsica Island, we find an inverse diel variation of HONO with higher concentrations during daytime. Night-time HONO budget analysis indicates significant HONO formation during air mass transport along the hillside. In the daytime, although photosensitized NO2 uptake on the ground and NO + OH make considerable contributions (26% and 5%, respectively), a large part of HONO formation (67%, 320 pptv h–1) still cannot be explained with state-of-the-art parametrization. Nevertheless, photosensitized heterogeneous NO2 reactions are likely to account for the missing source, due to underestimation of the source by typical parametrizations at low NO2 levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant role of HONO formation as a OH primary source at this island site, with a OH production rate exceeding one-fourth of that of O3 photolysis. Our findings underscore a potential role of heterogeneous surface reactions in the oxidizing capacity of the island environments."

Hence, there is a need to represent these widely varying kinetic processes in large-scale atmospheric models to allow for accurate predictions of the abundance, properties, and impacts of SOA. In this work, we integrated a kinetic, process-level model (simpleSOM-MOSAIC) into a weather-chemistry model (WRF-Chem) to simulate the oxidation chemistry and microphysics of atmospheric SOA. simpleSOM-MOSAIC simulates multigenerational gas-phase chemistry, autoxidation reactions, aqueous chemistry, heterogeneous oxidation, oligomerization, and phase-state-influenced gas/particle partitioning of SOA. As a case study, the integrated WRF-Chem-simpleSOM-MOSAIC (WC-SSM) model was used to simulate the photochemical evolution downwind of a large city (Manaus, Brazil) in the Amazon and, in turn, study the anthropogenic and biogenic interactions in an otherwise pristine environment. Consistent with previous work, we found that OA was enhanced by up to a factor of 4 in the urban plume due to elevated hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations, relative to the background, and that this OA was dominated by SOA from biogenic precursors (80%).

The storm‐time ΔT were determined by performing daily zonal running mean on the temperature profiles in the ascending and descending nodes separately. The storm‐time ΔT had peak values of ≥25 K and extended downward to ∼100 km globally. Above 105 km, the global mean ΔT had values of ≥20 K in the early morning and of ≥15 K in the late afternoon during storm‐time. At high latitudes, the storm‐time ΔT was larger in the late afternoon than in the early morning. This is opposite to that at middle and low latitudes. Adiabatic warming/cooling caused by the heating‐induced circulation changes outside of the auroral oval is likely responsible for the local time and latitude dependence of the storm‐time ΔT."

The special thermodynamic structure above the lens of MWEs, which would favor the TC‐induced entrainment more efficiently, facilitates the elevation of substantial subsurface cold water. It also leads to increased mixed‐layer salinity and deepening of the mixed‐layer.

This study aims to identify and compare characteristics and mechanisms of intraseasonal precipitation in these two regions using daily observational data. Our results indicate their notable differences in atmospheric circulations and dynamical processes, despite similarities in moisture sources. A wave train associated with the intraseasonal precipitation in the western North Pacific characterized by anomalous cyclones and anticyclones from West Siberia into the North Pacific is observed, accompanied by anomalous wave activity. By diagnosing local finite‐amplitude wave activity (LWA) budget, we demonstrate that the baroclinic eddy generation initiates the upstream growth of wave activity, whereas its downstream development is primarily attributed to the zonal advection of wave train. The upstream wave train induces barotropic and baroclinic instabilities in Kuroshio‐Oyashio extension (KOE). In contrast, the anomalous atmospheric circulations related to intraseasonal precipitation in the eastern North Pacific feature a tripolar structure, with downstream propagation of wave activity from the eastern North Pacific to the North American continent. Diabatic heating, along with local eddy generation, contributes to the upstream growth of wave activity. Residual term, possibly linked to the wave activity dissipation associated with wave breaking, extends the wave activity downstream. Thermal and baroclinic instabilities, associated with the diabatic heating and local eddy generation, create favorable conditions for the precipitation.

The activity of boreal‐winter MJO realization is quantified by the number of MJO active days during the tracking of the real‐time multivariate MJO index. In active years of MJO realization (MJO‐A), multiple MJOs are initiated in the Indian Ocean (IO) and they propagate into the western Pacific (WP), but not so in inactive years (MJO‐IA). This contrast is explained by whether vertical moisture advection over the WP is disrupted or not. It is related to differences in boreal‐winter mean convection and circulations: MJO‐A (MJO‐IA) years are characterized by enhanced and suppressed (suppressed and enhanced) convection over the WP/IO and Maritime Continent (MC), respectively. This modulation results from combined effects of the El Niño‐Southern oscillation (ENSO) and quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO). During moderate‐to‐strong El Niño, MJO is realized actively irrespective of QBO, if no additional convective suppression over the eastern IO and/or MC due to other forcing such as a positive Indian Ocean Dipole mode. During other ENSO phases, stronger QBO‐easterly phases favor MJO realization irrespective of ENSO. This QBO–MJO connection except for El Niño conditions is due to zonally heterogeneous QBO impacts that the seasonal mean static stability change near the tropopause over the WP alters the mean convective activity there. This zonal heterogeneity and ENSO phase‐dependency of QBO impacts is interpreted with a focus on vertical propagation of Kelvin wave structure over the MC, affected by both QBO winds and background Walker circulations."

 Mongolia in northeastern Asia encounters severe atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution during winter. Although many researchers have investigated PM haze in Mongolia using filter sample analyses to understand its formation mechanisms and sources, the formation and growth of atmospheric PM in Mongolia are currently unknown because of the deficiency of real-time measurements of particle size distributions. In this study, the number size distributions of atmospheric particles (PNSDs) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, were measured over a year using real-time aerosol instruments to better understand the formation and growth of atmospheric PM at different timescales using meteorological data. The diurnal variations in PNSDs in different seasons had similar patterns, but different particle number concentrations (PNCs). A weak new particle formation (NPF) in the daytime was observed only in summer under the cleanest air quality of the year. In winter, the PNSD exhibited 4–11 times higher PNC than that in the other seasons. The highest PNCs in winter were strongly correlated with the primary particles produced by combustion such as that in heating and power generation. In addition, the PNCs at nighttime were generally higher than those during the daytime, with larger modal sizes throughout the year. In terms of particle size ranges, Aitken- and accumulation-mode particles (which are detrimental to human health) were dominant in the number and volume size distributions of particles, respectively. The diurnal variations in PNC displayed dual peaks in the morning and late evening. This matched the primary particle emissions from traffic and coal/biomass burning. The nitrate-to-sulfate ratios revealed that stationary sources mainly contributed to high PM concentrations throughout the year except in summer. The significant Pearson correlation coefficients between particles and gaseous pollutants also supported primary particle emissions through combustion in winter."

 Organic matter is often the largest contributor to PM2.5, but its emission sources and formation pathways are very diverse, making it challenging to identify the causes of high concentration episodes. In this study, four groups of organic compounds that contribute to PM2.5, including sugars, dicarboxylic acids (DA), fatty acids (FA), and pinonic acid (PNA) were measured in a medium-sized residential city in South Korea during three seasons, where high PM2.5 concentration episodes often occur. The average concentrations of PM2.5 and total quantified organic matter (∑17 qOM) was 21 ± 12 μg m−3 and 391 ± 183 ng m−3, respectively. The concentration of ∑sugars was higher during the colder seasons compared to the warm season (32 ± 18 ng m−3, 240 ± 109 ng m−3, and 231 ± 105 ng m−3 in the warm, transition, and cold seasons, respectively). In contrast, ∑DAs exhibited the opposite seasonal trend (234 ± 164 ng m−3, 114 ± 103 ng m−3, and 140 ± 103 ng m−3 in the warm, transition, and cold seasons, respectively). The contribution of ∑FA to qOM was relatively consistent (13.1% in warm season to 15.6% in colder seasons). PNA, a biogenic secondary organic aerosol tracer, had a significantly higher concentration during the warm season (16 ± 13 ng m−3 in warm season vs. 3 ± 3 ng m−3 in colder seasons). A strong correlation between ∑sugars and ∑FAs (r = 0.72) was observed only in the transition season, when crop residue burning was determined to be important. Unsaturated FAs were likely to be efficiently aged during the cold season since the ratio of C18:0 to C18:1, a tracer for the age of aerosol, increased. DAs were generally dominant in the warm season, but also significantly increased during most high PM2.5 concentration episodes (HCEs; 306 ± 199 ng m−3), which primarily occurred in the colder season. During HCEs appearing in colder season, the ratio of malonic acid (C3) to succinic acid (C4), a tracer for photochemical aging of air masses, also increased, suggesting that the secondary aerosol formation and aerosol aging significantly enhanced PM2.5 concentration."

 Wind-blown dust can affect the acidity of all particles, impacting a series of related chemical processes. In this work, we use a wind-blown dust emissions model along with the hybrid version of aerosol dynamics in the PMCAMx chemical transport model to quantify the effects of dust on size-resolved aerosol pH over the U.S during February and July 2017 as a function of altitude. The version of the model used can capture the most important range of pH values (less than 5), while particles that are more alkaline than this threshold are assumed to have pH equal to 5. Our simulations indicate that wind-blown dust can increase ground level PM1 pH up to 1 unit during wintertime and up to 3.5 units during summertime in the western U.S. For PM1−2.5, the corresponding increases are higher during wintertime (up to 1.5 units) and a little lower during summertime (up to 3 units) compared to PM1. For coarse particles (PM2.5−5 and PM5−10), the impact of wind-blown dust is predicted to be lower since in most areas the corresponding pH is already quite high due to the presence of dust from anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture, resuspension due to traffic). The impact of wind-blown dust on aerosol acidity decreases with altitude for PM1 mainly because of the reduction of aerosol water. On the other hand, for PM1−2.5, the predicted effect increases with altitude due to the lower pH at higher altitudes. PM1 and PM1−2.5 acidity can be affected significantly by wind-blown dust for both simulated periods impacting at the same time secondary aerosol formation, emissions control strategies, solubility of metals, and nitrogen deposition."

 Aerosols can affect the lightning activity through radiative and microphysical effects. This study attempts to reveal the distinct impact pathways of these two effects on lightning activity. Using data of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, aerosol optical depth (AOD), thermodynamic, and cloud-related variables during the summer (June, July, and August) of 2010–2018 in the Sichuan Basin, we investigate the changes in the diurnal variation of lightning activity characteristics between polluted (2010−2013) and clean (2015–2018) years. Polluted years exhibit more thunderstorms during the late afternoon and early evening hours than clean years, but show no significant differences in other time periods. During all time periods, thunderstorms in polluted years are more intense, with a higher CG lightning density. Aerosols exhibit more intense radiative effect during afternoon and early evening hours in polluted years, which reduces the surface temperature, thereby enhancing atmospheric stability and inhibiting the formation of convection. The cloud liquid water and cloud ice water content in polluted years are higher, suggesting stronger aerosol microphysical effects. These results indicate that the radiative effect of aerosols primarily influences lightning activity by altering the frequency of thunderstorms, whereas the microphysical effect of aerosols predominantly affects lightning activity by modulating the intensity of thunderstorms."

 The capability to assimilate Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is developed within the WRFDA system in this study using the three-dimensional variational (3DVar) algorithm, based on the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) aerosol scheme of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with online Chemistry (WRF-Chem).

The performances of data assimilation for both analyses and forecasts are evaluated against various datasets, including the surface PM2.5 and PM10 measurements, the Himawari-8 AOD and aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) profile data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). The DA experiments exhibit positive effects on the analyses and forecasts of surface PM2.5 and PM10, AOD, and aerosol vertical extinction coefficient to different degrees. Compared to the assimilation of ground-based observations, which is highly effective in improving surface aerosol forecasts, the Himawari-8 AOD assimilation exhibits a greater improvement on the AOD and AEC profile.

 Forest fire (mainly wood burning) and crop residue burning (mainly herb burning) are two ways to produce biomass burning smoke water-soluble organic matters (BBS-WSOMs), largely altering atmospheric light absorption. However, their molecular characteristics-dependent light absorption remains unknown. Hence, this study combined Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis with UV–Vis spectrum to deeply investigate the different molecules-dependent light absorption of wood- and herb-derived BBS-WSOMs from different burning temperatures. The results showed that at the tested burning temperatures (300 and 600 °C), biomass types showed a stronger influence on the light absorption at 200–550 nm than burning temperatures. Herb-derived BBS-WSOMs had a stronger light absorption than wood-derived BBS-WSOMs. This was because in herb-derived BBS-WSOMs, more conjugated diene structures or more CHO compounds of low molecular mass and high aromaticity were responsible for their light absorption at 200–300 nm, and more CHON compounds (mainly nitroaromatics compounds) were responsible for their light absorption at 365–550 nm. The CHO/CHOS compounds in wood-derived BBS-WSOMs and CHON compounds in herb-derived BBS-WSOMs were respectively responsible for their light absorption at 365–550 nm. Interestingly, O-containing groups played an increasingly important role in enhancing light absorption with the increasing wavelength at 220–275 nm, while highly aliphatic structure with low O content played an increasingly important role in enhancing light absorption with the increasing wavelength at 365–550 nm. This study is beneficial for deeply understanding the different molecules-dependent light absorption of BBS-WSOMs, having significant implications in atmospheric environment management and quality control."

 The Mediterranean Sea is a well-documented region of cyclogenesis where hundreds of cyclones of variable lifetime, intensity and structure form every year. Although they are smaller, weaker and shorter in duration compared to tropical or most of the extratropical cyclones, they are often associated with high impact weather phenomena, due to significant amount of precipitation, strong winds and storm surges, thus affecting the coastal areas in the Mediterranean basin. Recently, there has been a growing interest in Mediterranean cyclones which closely resemble actual tropical cyclones with spiraling rainbands around a calm, a mostly cloud-free “eye”, strong rotation winds around the center, and a warm core (WC). These cyclones are generally referred to as Tropical-Like Cyclones (TLCs) or MEDIterranean hurriCANES (medicanes). This study aims to analyse, through an observational, satellite-based approach, 23 medicanes occurred from 2000 to 2021 in order to carry out a comprehensive passive microwave (PMW)-based characterization of these cyclones. A novel methodology for detecting the “closed eye” feature has been designed and implemented. Moreover, a well-established methodology based on the 54–55 GHz temperature sounding channels is applied to all 23 cyclones to detect the WC and characterize its depth, intensity and symmetry. Finally, the high frequency channels (> 89 GHz) are exploited to retrieve cloud top height and ice water path, and to detect deep moist convection, offering insights on the role of diabatic heating in the WC development. This study applies, for the first time, both known and newly-developed PMW-based techniques and tools over an extensive medicanes' satellite-based data record in order to unveil the thermodynamic and microphysical processes which fuel the WC and to identify the cyclones which undergo a tropical-transition, (i.e., with a WC mainly driven by diabatic processes). In addition, this study evidences how PMW radiometry can contribute to address open questions on the processes that drive medicanes development and evolution, and offer useful insights into the potential classification of these complex systems."

They highlight the critical need for accurate tropospheric delay corrections across varying altitudes, especially as most existing models are limited to Earth's surface. Although analytical functions have been used to model vertical reductions in tropospheric delays, they struggle to capture the intricate vertical variations of atmospheric state. In response, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to reconstruct global three‐dimensional zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delays (ZWD) derived from numerical weather models (NWM). Our method reconstructs NWM‐derived ZHD and ZWD globally up to 14 km above the Earth's surface, with average precision levels of 0.4 and 0.8 mm, respectively. Compared to the analytical third‐order exponential model, the DNN approach demonstrates substantial improvement with global average root‐mean‐square reductions of 63% for ZHD and 36% for ZWD."

The similar molar ratios of elements before and after landfall confirm that the source of PM2.5 is associated with the local terrigenous sediment. The ratio of Na+/Cl− in the TC eyewall is approximately 5:1 indicating the existence of chlorine depletion. Meanwhile, the concentration of Cl− and molar ratios like Si/Fe inside the TC eyewall show a rapid increase, and reach a peak in the TC eye, indicating that marine particulate matter invades and presents a treasure‐bowl‐like stepwise aggregation.

Ravishankara,Constraining the Acetone Photolysis Quantum Yield: Current Insights and Atmospheric Chemistry Implications,"Acetone photolysis is a potentially important source of hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals (HOx) to the upper troposphere. The extent to which acetone photolysis is a significant source of HOx in the upper troposphere is unclear in part because of scarce measurements of the acetone photolysis quantum yield (Φacetone) in the actinic region (i.e., λ > 300 nm). Past measurements of the Φacetone have derived temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent parameterizations that lead to significantly different conclusions about the importance of acetone to HOx formation in the upper troposphere. Here, we focus on previously published data to derive the recommended Φacetone for atmospheric chemical modeling. Using Stern‐Volmer analyses, we determine temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent Φacetone using updated measurements of fundamental acetone photolysis parameters. We also use simulations of the Φacetone produced from recent photophysical modeling to derive temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent parameterizations of the Φacetone. In contrast to the current Φacetone parameterization used in atmospheric chemical modeling, our parameterization reflects a predicted nonzero Φacetone in the wavelength region above 320 nm. Despite the increased Φacetone values in the higher wavelength region of the acetone photolysis action spectrum, the modeled effect on HOx production is not significantly different from HOx produced using the current recommended Φacetone parameterization. Uncertainties in the acetone photolysis mechanism remain; thus, more direct temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent measurements of Φacetone are warranted."

We identified LAPs in 38 snow samples (water years 2013–2016) from the mountainous Upper Colorado River basin by comparing among laboratory‐measured spectral reflectance, chemical, physical, and magnetic properties. Dust sample reflectance, averaged over the wavelength range of 0.35–2.50 μm, varied by a factor of 1.9 (range, 0.2300–0.4444) and was suppressed mainly by three components: (a) carbonaceous matter measured as total organic carbon (1.6–22.5 wt. %) including inferred black carbon, natural organic matter, and carbon‐based synthetic, black road‐tire‐wear particles, (b) dark rock and mineral particles, indicated by amounts of magnetite (0.11–0.37 wt. %) as their proxy, and (c) ferric oxide minerals identified by reflectance spectroscopy and magnetic properties. Fundamental compositional differences were associated with different iron oxide groups defined by dominant hematite, goethite, or magnetite. These differences in iron oxide mineralogy are attributed to temporally varying source‐area contributions implying strong interannual changes in regional source behavior, dust‐storm frequency, and (or) transport tracks. Observations of dust‐storm activity in the western U.S. and particle‐size averages for all samples (median, 25 μm) indicated that regional dust from deserts dominated mineral‐dust masses.

Hegglin;Patrick Jöckel;Tianliang Zhao,Causes of growing middle-to-upper tropospheric ozone over the northwest Pacific region,"Our research explored changes in ozone levels in the northwest Pacific region over 30 years, revealing a significant increase in the middle-to-upper troposphere, especially during spring and summer. This rise is influenced by both stratospheric and tropospheric sources, which affect climate and air quality in East Asia. This work underscores the need for continued study to understand underlying mechanisms. 
 Long-term ozone (O3) changes in the middle-to-upper troposphere are critical to climate radiative forcing and tropospheric O3 pollution. Yet, these changes remain poorly quantified through observations in East Asia. Concerns also persist regarding the data quality of the ozonesondes available at the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) for this region. This study aims to address these gaps by analyzing O3 soundings at four sites along the northwestern Pacific coastal region over the past 3 decades and by assessing their consistency with an atmospheric chemistry–climate model simulation. Utilizing the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Hamburg (ECHAM)/Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) nudged simulations, it is demonstrated that trends between model and ozonesonde measurements are overall consistent, thereby gaining confidence in the model's ability to simulate O3 trends and confirming the utility of potentially imperfect observational data. A notable increase in O3 mixing ratio around 0.29–0.82 ppb a−1 extending from the middle troposphere to the upper troposphere is observed in both observations and model simulations between 1990 and 2020, primarily during spring and summer. The timing of these O3 tongues is delayed when moving from south to north along the measurement sites, transitioning from late spring to summer. Investigation into the drivers of these trends using tagged model tracers reveals that O3 of stratospheric origin (O3S) dominates the absolute O3 mixing ratios over the middle-to-upper troposphere in the subtropics, contributing to the observed O3 increases by up to 96 % (40 %) during winter (summer), whereas O3 of tropospheric origin (O3T) governs the absolute value throughout the tropical troposphere and contributes generally much more than 60 % to the positive O3 changes, especially during summer and autumn. During winter and spring, a decrease in O3S is partly counterbalanced by an increase in O3T in the tropical troposphere. This study highlights that the enhanced downward transport of stratospheric O3 into the troposphere in the subtropics and a surge of tropospheric O3 in the tropics are the two key factors driving the enhancement of O3 in the middle-to-upper troposphere along the northwest Pacific region."

 The anticipated increase in solar energy production in West Africa requires high-quality solar irradiance estimates, which are affected by meteorological conditions and in particular the presence of desert dust aerosols. This study examines the impact of incorporating desert dust into solar irradiance and surface temperature estimations. The research focuses on a case study of a dust event in March 2021, which is characteristic of the dry season in West Africa. Significant desert aerosol emissions at the Bodélé Depression are associated with a Harmattan flow that transports the plume westwards. Simulations of this dust event were conducted using the meteorological Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model alone, as well as coupling it with the CHIMERE chemistry transport model, using three different datasets for the dust aerosol initial and boundary conditions (CAMS, GOCART, and MERRA-2). Results show that considering desert dust reduces estimation errors in global horizontal irradiance (GHI) by about 75 %. The dust plume caused an average of 18 % reduction in surface solar irradiance during the event. Additionally, the simulations indicated a positive bias in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM10 surface concentrations. The choice of dataset for initial and boundary conditions minimally influenced GHI, surface temperature, and AOD estimates, whereas PM10 concentrations and aerosol size distribution were significantly affected.

Smith,Seasonal investigation of ultrafine-particle organic composition in an eastern Amazonian rainforest,"We present measurements of the organic composition of ultrafine particles collected from the eastern Amazon, an understudied region that is subjected to increasing human influence. We find that while isoprene chemistry is likely significant for ultrafine-particle growth throughout the year, compounds related to other sources, such as biological-spore emissions and biomass burning, exhibit striking seasonal differences, implying extensive variation in regional ultrafine-particle sources. 
 Reports on the composition of ultrafine particles (<100 nm in diameter) in the Amazon are scarce, due in part to the fact that new-particle formation has rarely been observed near ground level.  Ultrafine particles near the surface have nevertheless been observed, leaving open questions regarding the sources and chemistry of their formation and growth, particularly as these vary across seasons.  Here, we present measurements of the composition of ultrafine particles collected in the Tapajós National Forest (2.857° S, 54.959° W) during three different seasonal periods: 10–30 September 2016 (SEP), 18 November–23 December 2016 (DEC), and 22 May–21 June 2017 (JUN).  Size-selected (5–70 nm) particles were collected daily (for 22 h each day) using an offline sampler.  Samples collected during the three time periods were compiled and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry.  Our findings suggest a sustained influence of isoprene organosulfate chemistry on ultrafine particles from the different periods.  We present chemical evidence that indicates that biological-spore fragmentation impacted ultrafine-particle composition during the late wet season (JUN), while chemical markers for biomass burning and secondary chemistry peaked during the dry season (SEP and DEC).  Higher oxidation states and degrees of unsaturation were observed for organics in the dry season (SEP and DEC), suggesting greater extents of aerosol aging. Finally, applying a volatility parameterization to the observed compounds suggests that organic sulfur species are likely key drivers of new-particle growth in the region due to their low volatility compared to other species."

By examining trends in Seoul and Ulsan, we found that the particles in the air are getting smaller, which scatters light more effectively and reduces how far we can see. Our findings suggest that changes in particle properties adversely affected public perception of air quality improvement even though the PM2.5 mass concentration is continuously decreasing. 
 The atmospheric visibility in South Korea has not improved despite decreasing mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM)2.5. Since visibility is influenced by particle size and composition as well as meteorological factors, light detection and ranging (lidar) data provided by the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan and PM2.5 measurements retrieved from AirKorea are used to determine the trends in PM2.5 mass extinction efficiency (MEE) in Seoul and Ulsan, South Korea, from 2015 to 2020. Moreover, the monthly trends in the Ångström exponent and relative and absolute humidity are determined to identify the factors influencing PM2.5 MEE. The monthly average PM2.5 MEE exhibits an increasing trend in Seoul (+0.04 m2 g−1 per month) and Ulsan (+0.07 m2 g−1 per month). Relative humidity increases by +0.070 % and +0.095 % per month in Seoul and Ulsan, respectively, and absolute humidity increases by +0.029 and +0.010 g m−3 per month, respectively. However, the trends in these variables are not statistically significant. The Ångström exponent increases by +0.005 and +0.011 per month in Seoul and Ulsan, respectively, indicating that the MEE increases as the size of the particles becomes smaller each year. However, due to limitations when obtaining long-term composition data in this study, further research is needed to accurately determine the causes of the increase in PM2.5 MEE. Such an increase in PM2.5 MEE may have limited the improvements in visibility and adversely affected public perception of air quality improvement even though the PM2.5 mass concentration in South Korea is continuously decreasing."

A separation and quantification method combining the Gaussian plume model and the integrated mass enhancement method is proposed. A modern parameter estimation technique is introduced to separate the overlapping plumes from satellite observations. The proposed method is evaluated with synthesized observations and real satellite observations. 
 Quantifying facility-level methane emission rates using satellites with fine spatial resolution has recently gained significant attention. However, the prevailing quantification algorithms usually require the methane column plume from a solitary point source as input. Such approaches are challenged with overlapping plumes from multiple point sources. To address these challenges, we propose a separation approach based on a heuristic optimization and the multi-source Gaussian plume model to separate the overlapping plumes. Subsequently, the integrated mass enhancement (IME) model is applied to accurately quantify emission rates. To validate the proposed method, observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs) of various scenarios are performed. The result shows that plume overlapping exacerbates the quantifying error of the IME method when applied without such a separation approach, where the quantification mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) increased from 0.15 to 0.83, and it is affected by factors such as source intervals, wind direction, and interference emission rates. By contrast, the application of the proposed separation method together with the IME quantification approach mitigates this interference, reducing the quantification MAPE from 0.83 to 0.38. Moreover, the proposed method also outperforms the direct use of multi-source Gaussian plume fitting for the quantification, with a MAPE of 0.45. Our separation method separates overlapping plumes from multiple sources into distinct, single-source observations, enabling the IME algorithm – a high-precision quantification approach for fine-spatial-resolution plume images – to handle multi-source scenarios effectively. This method can help future spaceborne carbon inventory activities for spatially clustering carbon-emitting facilities."

The analysis reveals that the information content of the infrared hyperspectrometer exceeds that of the microwave hyperspectrometer and provides higher vertical resolution in ground-based zenith measurements. Leveraging the ground–airborne synergy between the two instruments yielded optimal sounding results. 
 Accurate observations of atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles are essential for weather forecasting and climate change detection. Hyperspectral radiance measurements afford a useful means to retrieve these thermodynamic variable fields by harnessing the rich information contained in the electromagnetic wave spectrum of the atmospheric radiation. In contrast to infrared radiometry, microwave radiometry can penetrate clouds, making it a valuable tool for all-sky thermodynamic retrievals. Recent advancements have led to the fabrication of a hyperspectral microwave radiometer: the High Spectral Resolution Airborne Microwave Sounder (HiSRAMS). This study utilizes HiSRAMS to retrieve atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles under clear-sky conditions; this is an initial assessment of one of the first hyperspectral microwave radiometers, comparing the results to those from an infrared hyperspectrometer, the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). HiSRAMS and AERI measurements under different viewing geometries have been acquired and compared for atmospheric retrieval. When both instruments are placed on the ground to acquire zenith-pointing measurements, the infrared hyperspectral measurements exhibit higher information content and greater vertical resolution for temperature and water vapor retrievals than the microwave hyperspectral measurements. A synergistic fusion of HiSRAMS and AERI measurements from the air and ground is tested. This “sandwich” sounding of the atmosphere takes advantage of the complementary information contents of the two instruments and is found to notably improve retrieval accuracy."

The method is crucial for investigating the occurrence of precipitation and significantly improves the Cloudnet target classification scheme for measurements over the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO). A first-ever analysis of the Cloudnet product including the new ""haze echo"" target over 2 years at the BCO is presented. 
 The highly sensitive Ka-band cloud radar at the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO) frequently reveals radar reflectivity signals below −50 dBZ within the convective sub-cloud layer. These so-called haze echoes are signals from hygroscopically grown sea salt aerosols. Within the Cloudnet target classification scheme, haze echoes are generally misclassified as precipitation (target class: “drizzle or rain”). We present a technique to discriminate between “drizzle or rain” and sea salt aerosols in Cloudnet that is applicable to marine Cloudnet sites. The method is based on deriving heuristic probability functions utilizing a combination of cloud radar reflectivity factor, radar mean Doppler velocity, and the ceilometer attenuated backscatter coefficient. The method is crucial for investigating the occurrence of precipitation and significantly improves the Cloudnet target classification scheme for measurements at the BCO. The results are validated against the amount of precipitation detected by the Virga-Sniffer tool. We analyze data for measurements at BCO covering 2 years (July 2021–July 2023). A first-ever statistical analysis of the Cloudnet target classification product including the new “haze echo” target over 2 years at the BCO is presented. In the atmospheric column above the BCO, “drizzle or rain” is  on average more frequent during the dry season compared to the wet season due to the higher occurrence of warm clouds contributing to the amount of precipitation. Haze echoes are identified about 4 times more often during the dry season compared to the wet season. The frequency of occurrence of “drizzle or rain” in Cloudnet caused by misclassified haze echoes is overestimated by up to 16 %. Supported by the Cloudnet statistics and the results obtained from the Virga-Sniffer tool, 48 % of detected warm clouds in the dry and wet season precipitate. The proportion of precipitation evaporating fully before reaching the ground (virga) is higher during the dry season."

This technology enables the acquisition of high-resolution vertical ozone profiles from 0.3 to 4 km, essential for understanding air quality and climate impacts. 
 This study presents the development and performance evaluation of an ozone differential absorption lidar system. The system could effectively obtain vertical profiles of lower-tropospheric ozone in an altitude range of 0.3 to 4 km with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The system emits three laser beams at wavelengths of 276, 287 and 299 nm by using the stimulated Raman effect of carbon dioxide (CO2). A 250 mm telescope and a grating spectrometer are used to collect and separate the backscattering signals at the three wavelengths. Considering the influences of aerosol interference and statistical error, a wavelength pair of 276–287 nm is used for the altitude below 600 m and a wavelength pair of 287–299 nm is used for the altitude above 600 m to invert ozone concentration. We also evaluated the errors caused by the uncertainty of the wavelength index. The developed ozone lidar was deployed in a field campaign that was conducted to measure the vertical profiles of ozone using a tethered balloon platform. The lidar observations agree very well with those of the tethered balloon platform."

In this study, we calibrated the Particle Size Magnifier version 2.0 (PSM 2.0), using both laboratory-generated and atmospheric particles. Some differences were observed in the calibration results, with direct calibration using atmospheric particles enhancing measurement accuracy. 
 The Particle Size Magnifier is widely used for measuring nano-sized particles. Here we calibrated the newly developed Particle Size Magnifier version 2.0 (PSM 2.0). We used 1–10 nm particles with different compositions, including metal particles, organic particles generated in the laboratory, and atmospheric particles collected in Helsinki and Hyytiälä. A noticeable difference among the calibration curves was observed. Atmospheric particles from Hyytiälä required higher diethylene glycol (DEG) supersaturation to be activated compared to metal particles (standard calibration particles) and other types of particles. This suggests that chemical composition differences introduce measurement uncertainties and highlights the importance of in situ calibration. The size resolution of PSM 2.0 was characterized using metal particles. The maximum size resolution was observed at 2–3 nm. PSM 2.0 was then operated in Hyytiälä for ambient particle measurements in parallel with a Half Mini differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS). During new particle formation (NPF) events, comparable total particle concentrations were observed between the Half Mini DMPS and PSM 2.0 based on Hyytiälä atmospheric particle calibration. Meanwhile, applying the calibration with metal particles to atmospheric measurements caused an overestimation of 3–10 nm particles. In terms of the particle size distributions, similar patterns were observed between the DMPS and PSM when using the calibration of Hyytiälä atmospheric particles. In summary, PSM 2.0 is a powerful instrument for measuring sub-10 nm particles and can achieve more precise particle size distribution measurements with proper calibration."

 The Amazon forest is fire sensitive, but, where fires were uncommon as a natural disturbance, deforestation and drought are accelerating fire occurrences, which threaten the integrity of the tropical forest, the carbon cycle and air quality. Fire emissions depend on fuel amount and type, moisture conditions and burning behaviour. Higher-resolution satellite data have helped more accurately map global burnt areas; however, the effects of fuels on the combustion process and on the composition of fire emissions remain uncertain in current fire emissions inventories. By using multiple Earth observation-based approaches, here we show that total fire emissions in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are dominated by smouldering combustion of woody debris. The representation of woody debris and surface litter presents a critical uncertainty in fire emissions inventories and global vegetation models.

 The 2023/24 El Niño, emerging after a rare triple-dip La Niña, garnered global attention due to its potential to evolve into an extreme event, given the largest accumulation of warm water in the equatorial western Pacific since 1980. Despite initial expectations, its growth rate unexpectedly decelerated in mid-2023, preventing it from reaching the anticipated intensity. Here, we show through observational analyses that unusual easterly anomalies over the tropical western-central Pacific, persisting after the end of the preceding La Niña, significantly contributed to this slowdown. A prominent east‒west sea surface temperature gradient in the region has been identified as the crucial factor associated with these unusual and persistent easterly anomalies. This temperature gradient is directly attributed to a negative North Pacific Meridional Mode and a deepened thermocline over the Philippine Sea. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the atypical transition from a prolonged multi-year La Niña to an El Niño."

 The crucial role of precipitation as a primary driver for terrestrial water cycle is well-established. However, quantifying the transformation of daily precipitation into terrestrial water storage remains a challenge.

 The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer can provide dependable ocean wind measurements for tropical cyclones (TCs), almost without being affected by rain. However, SMAP cannot resolve the eyes of TCs because of its coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, it is a challenge to independently identify the storm centers and the wind structures. In this study, we develop a reliable method for estimating TC metrics — center locations, intensities, and wind radii (R34, R50 and R64) — purely from SMAP, without any external data input. Due to SMAP's relatively coarse spatial resolution, a simple vortex model is used to estimate storm center locations from SMAP-measured ocean winds. To validate our methodology, a large dataset is extracted from SMAP measurements. Spanning 663 TC scenes, the dataset covers all storm intensity categories that have occurred in the northern Hemisphere during 2015–2022, and includes 93 cases where stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements are coincident, within 30 min. SMAP-estimated TC metrics are then comprehensively compared with best-track reports, and when available, SFMR and SAR observations. For collocated SFMR and SAR measurements, the average differences for storm center locations are approximately 36 and 51 km, respectively. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) between SMAP-estimated TC intensities and those obtained from SFMR and SAR are 6.18 and 7.51 m/s, respectively. For wind radii, the RMSEs are 42.93 km (R34), 35.96 km (R50) and 32.23 km (R64), respectively. In addition, the average difference between our model and best-track reported TC center locations is 49.2, 32.4 and 23.5 km for tropical storms, category 1–2 storms, and major storms, respectively. The RMSE between SMAP-estimated storm intensities and best track reports is 6.82 m/s. For wind radii, the RMSE values are 47.16 km(R34), 34.94 km (R50) and 21.25 km (R64), respectively."
