While the feed spacer, which creates feed channels and governs hydrodynamic properties, is essential in SWM modules, the role of its filament microstructures in membrane fouling remains poorly understood. Here, we delved deeply into how the filament's concave and torsion features influence local hydrodynamic behavior and thus membrane fouling. The findings reveal that the membrane fouling rate could be significantly correlated with both the low-velocity region fraction (r) and the average mass transfer coefficient (kave). Increasing torsional angle (θ) from 0 to 180° reduces r by 30%, enhances kave by 6.1%, and diminishes fouling rate by 13.2%, whereas a further increase of θ to 540° yields insignificant improvements. The enhanced antifouling performance with torsion characteristics comes from a reduced hydraulic stagnant zone and enlarged recirculation region with stronger turbulence. Nonetheless, concave features tend to generate stagnant zones with solute accumulation, resulting in severe membrane fouling, and this detrimental effect is exacerbated with increasing concave depth, even when combined with torsion characteristics. We propose a macro-to-micro path for optimizing feed spacer to combat membrane fouling and enhance the performance of SWM modules for environmental applications."

Previous studies have noted discontinuities in DP propagation with respect to radius, but lacked an explanation for this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that this discontinuity results from the superposition of an outward‐propagating mode driven by inertial‐gravity waves and quasi‐phase‐locked signals associated with the diurnal variations in the TC secondary circulation. DP occurrence exhibits strong latitude dependence. DPs occur more frequently within 0°–30°N latitude, likely driven by inertial‐gravity waves originating from the TC inner core at the tropopause. North of 30°N, DP propagation is primarily influenced by the TC outflow winds, with the DP propagation speed strongly correlated to outflow strength. Additionally, DPs share similarities in characteristics and mechanisms with the offshore propagation of coastal rainfall, both governed by inertial‐gravity waves in lower latitudes and by wind advection at higher latitudes."

However, due to the unclear origin of these precursors and the complexity of the environmental conditions, detecting such preparatory signals remains challenging. Here we present the spatio‐temporal evolution of surface strain measured using fiber‐optic sensing during triaxial experiments in wet and dry conditions. We identify a power‐law distribution of strain increments where the largest magnitude diverges toward failure. This suggests a critical phase transition with the emergence of failure precursors. However, criticality is only observed in dry conditions and disappears with pressurized pore fluids, where the largest strain increment accelerates exponentially, consistent with a first‐order transition. Our results highlight that progressive damage features criticality for failure prediction, but elevated fluid pressures may shift this behavior to abrupt rupture."

Precisely quantifying these effects requires accurately representing smoke injection height in climate and air quality models. However, existing parameterizations of smoke injection height often diverge from actual observations, commonly underestimating smoke injection height from extreme burnings. In this study, we improve a widely used smoke injection model by integrating two critical processes: aerosol radiative absorption and atmospheric convection. The new parameterization, optimized and validated by satellite measurements of smoke extinction profiles above active fires, achieves a 10% reduction in root mean square error and an over 95% reduction in mean bias compared to its predecessor. Such improvements are especially pronounced in tropical and shrubland‐dominated regions. This study underscores the critical role of aerosol self‐lofting and convective processes in vertical dispersion of wildfire smoke, toward better quantifying its climate and environmental effects."

Over the 120‐hr forecasting period, track errors were reduced by 20%–40%, with marked improvements beyond 48 hr. Further analysis indicates that the improvement in track prediction is related to improved storm inner‐core thermal structure and the large‐scale steering flow. Although no other satellite data were included in the assimilation, the Tianmu‐enhanced forecasts exhibited slightly higher accuracy than those from operational track prediction by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Global Forecast System. These findings demonstrate the growing role of commercial GNSS RO data in numerical weather prediction, potentially supplementing or reducing reliance on satellite brightness temperature assimilation."

We implemented a recently developed parameterization which relates the number flux of sea spray aerosols to nanophytoplankton cell abundances in the mesoscale model WRF‐Chem and evaluated the impact on the prediction of sea spray aerosols (SSA) number concentrations and cloud properties over the Southern Ocean. Compared to SSA concentrations simulated using the whitecap function available in the model, the use of a function derived from recent observations in the Southern Ocean leads to a decrease in predicted SSA number concentrations (by ∼46%–47% over the domain); this further translates into a decrease in the cloud droplet number concentrations and a decrease (respectively an increase) of the liquid cloud water path (CWP) and rain water path (RWP). A strong increase in SSA number concentrations is predicted when the influence of marine biota is taken into account (by 172%–343%), with a concurrent clear increase of the number of cloud droplets and a subsequent increase (decrease) of the CWP (RWP). Detailed comparison of model outputs and measurements further demonstrates that accounting for the role of marine biological activity is essential to predict more realistic SSA number concentrations and spatio‐temporal variability. Comparisons of modeled vertical profiles of CWP and RWP with remote sensing measurements are also ameliorated with the account of marine biology."

Gero,Strengthening Atmospheric Greenhouse Effect at the Arctic North Slope of Alaska Site Evidenced by Long‐Term Records of the Downwelling Longwave Radiance Spectrum,"Arctic amplification, the accelerated warming of the Arctic compared to lower latitude, remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the role of clouds. In this study, we analyze 26 years of downwelling longwave radiation (DLR) measurements from an Extended‐range Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (E‐AERI) at the US Department of Energy's North Slope of Alaska site. Our analysis reveals a pan‐spectral increase in DLR under all sky conditions, primarily driven by an enhanced greenhouse effect from thick/low clouds and greenhouse gases. We find that the observed DLR trends are primarily driven by radiance changes within individual sky conditions, rather than changes in cloud fraction, suggesting fundamental shifts in atmospheric emissivity and/or temperature. Comparative analysis between the Southern Great Plains (mid‐latitude) and North Slope of Alaska (high‐latitude) sites demonstrates that clouds impact the longwave surface energy balance differently between the two locations. In the Arctic, the pan‐spectral increase in DLR trend dampens out the radiative cooling of the warming surface, contributing significantly to Arctic amplification. Consistent positive trends are found in the far‐infrared, a spectral region sensitive to even small changes of the dry and cold Arctic's atmosphere and of significant interest in the current warming context. Additionally, we observe a relatively weaker DLR trend in the ozone absorption band under every sky condition, indicating a tropospheric ozone radiative forcing in the Arctic climate."

The BBC, a mesoscale system approximately 30‐km long, 30‐km wide, and 2‐km deep, formed from enhanced horizontal convective rolls along the Galveston Bay coast, progressing northwestward under a 6 m s−1 onshore flow anomaly and reaching 1.5 km depth with return flow aloft. The inland penetration speed was 2 m s−1, driven by an observed 6–9 K land‐water temperature contrast. The GBF, coupled to the BBC, intensified with additional southerly flow, penetrating further inland after the BBC collapsed. Passing over the TRACER field site, both fronts significantly impacted boundary layer thermodynamics, dynamics, and aerosol concentration. The BBC event exhibited four lifecycle stages—formation, development, maturation, and dissipation—driven by solar heating, wind field rotation, and interactions with convective eddies and the GBF.

During the night of 11–12 February 2022, the stratospheric polar vortex was slightly elongated toward Central Europe. The polar night jet's (PNJ) core was located nearly above the lidar. This unique meteorological situation allowed the measurement of horizontal wind and temperature in a stratospheric high‐wind speed regime. GW propagation in the strong vertical gradient of the horizontal winds associated with the PNJ was observed. In addition, the subsequent reduction in the number of upward and downward propagating GWs in the strong winds of the PNJ was demonstrated. A pair of upward and downward propagating GWs at the top and bottom edge of the PNJ's core could be the result of shear excitation in the PNJ. A statistical analysis of intrinsic GW parameters is provided for all resolved linear GWs. Approximately 35% of the resolved GWs propagate downward, and there is stronger filtering of the downward waves compared to the upward waves in the PNJ core. ECMWF‐IFS horizontal winds and temperatures had a lower variability than the lidar measurement and a poorer overall agreement above 50 km.

 The expression and location of proteins in tissues represent key determinants of health and disease. Although recent advances in multiplexed imaging have expanded the number of spatially accessible proteins1–3, the integration of biological layers (that is, cell structure, subcellular domains and signalling activity) remains challenging. This is due to limitations in the compositions of antibody panels and image resolution, which together restrict the scope of image analysis. Here we present pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex), a scalable, quality-controlled and interpretable framework. It combines highly multiplexed imaging at subcellular resolution with a software package to extract and interpret protein co-expression patterns (clusters) across biological layers. PathoPlex was optimized to map more than 140 commercial antibodies at 80 nm per pixel across 95 iterative imaging cycles and provides pragmatic solutions to enable the simultaneous processing of at least 40 archival biopsy specimens. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we identified epithelial JUN activity as a key switch in immune-mediated kidney disease, thereby demonstrating that clusters can capture relevant pathological features. PathoPlex was then used to analyse human diabetic kidney disease. The framework linked patient-level clusters to organ disfunction and identified disease traits with therapeutic potential (that is, calcium-mediated tubular stress). Finally, PathoPlex was used to reveal renal stress-related clusters in individuals with type 2 diabetes without histological kidney disease. Moreover, tissue-based readouts were generated to assess responses to inhibitors of the glucose cotransporter SGLT2. In summary, PathoPlex paves the way towards democratizing multiplexed imaging and establishing integrative image analysis tools in complex tissues to support the development of next-generation pathology atlases. Pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex) represents a framework for widespread access to multiplexed imaging and computational image analysis of clinical specimens at a relatively high throughput and subcellular resolution."

 Earth’s climate feedback quantifies the response of Earth’s energy budget to temperature changes and thus determines climate sensitivity. The climate feedback is largely controlled by water vapor which absorbs both longwave radiation emitted by Earth and shortwave radiation from the Sun. For the clear-sky shortwave water vapor feedback λSW, a gap remains between process understanding and estimates from comprehensive climate models. Therefore, we present a hierarchy of simple models for λSW. We show that λSW is proportional to the change with temperature in the square of atmospheric transmissivity that depends on the atmospheric concentration of water vapor and its ability to absorb shortwave radiation. The global mean λSW is well captured by a simple analytical model that approximates the strong spectral variations in water vapor absorption, whereas its temperature dependence results from spectral details in water vapor absorption.

 Mangroves play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity, supporting global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accurate estimation of their nitrogen and phosphorus content is essential for assessing the status of mangrove ecosystems. However, the spectral response characteristics of mangrove leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) remain unclear. These knowledge gaps hinder the development of robust predictive models across diverse environmental contexts. To overcome these issues, we collected 375 samples and 16,590 in situ full-spectrum hyperspectral data, and further proposed a novel Global-Fractional Order Sensitivity Analysis (G-FOSA) method. We analyzed for the first time the apparent and deep spectral characteristics of LNC and LPC for four typical mangrove species in China (Avicennia marina, Acanthus ilicifolius, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum) using G-FOSA method. This study revealed that the LNC diagnostic wavelengths concentrated in the range of 697 nm–704 nm, while the LPC diagnostic wavelengths were mostly distributed between 691 nm–834 nm and 1869 nm–2236 nm. We developed a mechanism-guided retrieval framework based on these diagnostic wavelengths, and achieved the quantitative inversion from field diagnostic wavelengths to optical satellite (SDGSAT-1 and Sentinel-2) bands. Our experiment results confirmed that SDGSAT-1, the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, performs better in estimating LNC and LPC (R2 = 0.63). Finally, we utilized the advantages of cross-scenario transfer learning technology to design a novel domain adaptive transfer learning (DTL) model, which realized the cross-scenario retrieval of mangrove LNC and LPC across three typical mangrove regions, reducing estimation error (RMSE) by 0.6 %–41.1 % compared to the traditional FTL model.

 Due to its ability to provide day-and-night profiling and high depth resolution, ocean lidar has become an important tool for marine remote sensing. However, a lidar system provides time-based measurements of backscattered photons, where the distance (or depth for vertical profiling) is a product of light speed in water and the time photons pass. When there are significant contributions of multiple scattering in the backscattered signals of ocean lidar, the perceived depth of these measured photons will be deeper than the real depth. Therefore, if the objective of a lidar system is to sense the vertical profile of particles, the present time-based depth profile will not match the real depth profile of particles in the water column. To address this discrepancy, we carried out semi-analytical Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of water properties (represented by scattering coefficient, b), focusing on Case-1 water, with platforms including spaceborne, airborne, shipborne, and underwater. In the simulation process, it is assumed that the water column is vertically homogeneous, and the influence of sea surface fluctuations is ignored. Based on the simulated data, relationships between the discrepancy and b, as well as the radius of the received footprint on the water surface (rs), are established. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the discrepancy is more sensitive to b than to rs. Further, the impact of the absorption coefficient, scattering phase function, rough sea surface, and vertically non-uniform inherent optical properties on this discrepancy is discussed. Our results not only highlight the significance of considering multiple scattering, particularly for airborne and spaceborne platforms, in sensing the vertical profiles of particles but also provide guidance for interpreting backscattered signals in ocean lidar applications."

 Mangroves, as cradles of biodiversity and blue carbon reservoirs, are facing survival challenges due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Precise and rapid mapping of mangrove forests has thus become highly relevant, which can provide essential information to support the conservation practices of such blue carbon resources. Existing machine learning algorithms for mangrove mapping are incapable of delivering precise cartographic solutions under dynamic tidal conditions because of poor transferability. This study developed a generalized approach for large-area mangrove mapping using a hybrid neural network integrated with a vision transformer to effectively capture representative features. To adapt mangrove mapping to the variety of tidal conditions, a vision transformer architecture was developed by encoding the fusion of three Sentinel-2 bands: Green, NIR, and SWIR. The ground truth dataset for the year 2021 was created from the composited Sentinel-2 images after interpreting Google Earth and drone images, which comprised 88,645 training samples (256 × 256 pixels per sample) and 24,969 test samples. We selected 30 coastal counties as test dataset in China to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed network and produced a 10 m mangrove map that reported a total mangrove area of 28,006.24 ha in China in 2021, yielding an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.91 %. Compared to existing data products, Global Mangrove Watch 3.0, ESA WorldCover V200 and HGMF, our method outperformed the second-best product HGMF in mixed tide regions, by a margin of 9.19 % in OA and by 9.36 % in mean F1 score. Despite fluctuations in tide levels captured by Sentinel-2 imagery, the proposed method consistently yielded robust mangrove mapping results, highlighting effective derivation of tidal information. In comparison with previous mapping methods, the superior efficacy of the proposed network is distinctly discernible in distinguishing and delineating mangrove ecosystems in mixed tide regions, presenting prospects for improved monitoring of mangroves at regional and global scales."
