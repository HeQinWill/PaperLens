Few studies have quantified the full fertilizing potential of human excreta across national contexts, or under a range of diverse food systems. This study provides the first systematic assessment of the potential contribution of N in human excreta to current cropland fertilization in a wide range of countries, covering 80% of the global population. Using food supply and demographic data, we estimate N in human excreta for each country and compare it to current cropland total N inputs, including synthetic fertilizers, manure, biological fixation, and atmospheric deposition. Assuming a 100% recovery rate of human excreta to estimate an upper-bound potential, under the current situation, we find that human excreta (37 MtN at the global scale) could provide 15%–30% of current cropland N inputs in most countries, 30%–50% in sub-Saharan Africa, and over 50% in major agricultural importers (e.g. Japan, Korea, Algeria). In contrast, large agricultural exporters with high external inputs, such as Argentina or the United States, show lower potential (5%–10%). For the whole world, the rate is 20%. For most countries, N excreted by humans is also of the same order of magnitude as (and often superior to) livestock manure currently applied to croplands. In addition to an analysis of the current situation, we assess how improved food system efficiency-via more vegetarian diets, reduced losses and increased manure recycling thanks to better coupling of husbandry and crop cultivation-could affect the potential contribution. Under deeply transformative agro-ecological scenarios, the global contribution of human excreta to N fertilization could exceed 30%. This work focuses on maximum potentials; future research should focus on realistic recovery rates ( 100%) and adjust our results accordingly."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0ce0,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是森林在气候减缓中的作用，特别是通过采伐木材产品（HWP）来实现碳储存。研究利用全球森林部门模型来评估不同社会经济情景和温室气体政策下，HWP中的碳汇潜力。此外，还探讨了生物能源与碳捕获和储存相结合对增强森林碳汇的影响。虽然该研究与碳循环有关，但它主要集中在陆地生态系统和生物质利用方面，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['carbon sequestration', 'harvested wood products', 'bioenergy', 'climate mitigation', 'carbon capture and storage', 'forest sector model']",Madisen R Fuller;Justin S Baker;Adam Daigneault;Jinggang Guo;Pekka Lauri;Alice Favero;Nicklas Forsell;Craig Johnston;Brent Sohngen,Global carbon storage in harvested wood products: a forest sector model inter-comparison,"Forests can contribute to climate mitigation through the use of harvested wood products (HWPs), which provide a significant long-term source of carbon sequestration, replacement of more emissions-intensive building materials, and the integration of forest biomass into bioenergy systems. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the interplay between HWP carbon flows, traditional forest product market developments, and climate policy developments incentivizing bioenergy and carbon sequestration in forestry at global scales. Information on the extent to which future policy and market developments can impact global carbon fluxes in wood product pools is needed for guiding policy design and quantifying longer-term tradeoffs between carbon stock preservation in forests and increased carbon sequestration in wood products. This study builds on projections from a forest model inter-comparison analysis of three global forest sector models to estimate the potential carbon pool in HWPs across various socioeconomic scenarios and levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) policy ambition. Further, we assess the extent to which the use of bioenergy, paired with carbon capture and storage, can enhance this forest carbon sink. In scenarios with higher levels of global timber production, even in scenarios with fossil-fueled economic growth, we see an increase in carbon stored in wood products used for housing materials, lumber, pulp, and paper products. However, climate policy stringency reduces the HWP sink, shifting C sequestration to forests and allocating harvests to bioenergy systems. The use of carbon capture and storage substantially increases the global HWP carbon sink. The results of this study highlight how economic and policy factors could impact the role of global forests in climate mitigation through carbon storage in long-lived wood products and bioenergy carbon capture and storage pools, providing new insight to policy-makers, forest managers, and forest product manufacturers on viable pathways to support the co-production of timber and carbon sinks."

As future droughts are expected to become more frequent and severe, accurately predicting the unprecedentedly low water storage levels and water shortages in advance is crucial. Herein, we developed a new approach to predict terrestrial water storage (TWS) during droughts, based on monthly changes in TWS (ΔTWS) and meteorological variables from 2003 to 2023. The model was trained during non-drought months and assessed during the four droughts when TWS values are well below the range of training data. The ΔTWS-based model excels in predicting drought-month TWS even only using precipitation and incoming solar radiation, with average correlation (R) over 0.9 and RMSE below 50 mm. The model also showed superior skills for predicting drought TWS months lead-time, with the 3-month prediction achieved high performance (R > 0.8, RMSE < 80 mm). We further examined TWS predictions during the large-scale 2023 drought and found that the predicted TWS showed high spatial agreement with observed TWS, with all 1-, 2-, and 3-month lead-times reaching average R values over 0.9. Then we evaluated water deficits in the driest months (September—December) in 2023. The model predicted the affected regions with reasonable accuracy, achieving an average of 72% even at 3-month lead-time. We also analyzed how uncertainty in meteorological inputs affects model performance, revealing higher input uncertainty reduced the model performance. This study presents a reliable approach for estimating and predicting low water storage during severe large-scale droughts, enabling early warnings of water deficits across the Amazon. This study could be generalized to other regions, supporting proactive water resource management, water security policies, ecosystem protection and climate adaptation strategies."

Despite extensive scientific study and significant attention given to these two phenomena due to their potential influence on Earth’s changing climate, a physical link between them has yet to be established. Here, by examining atmospheric circulation in response to shifts in major climate variability modes before and after these dramatic changes, we showed that a combination of large-scale circulation patterns drove both the decline in Antarctic sea ice and the increase in Ross Sea DSW salinity. After the mid-2010s, climate-driven atmospheric circulation generated anomalous northerly winds across much of the high-latitude Southern Ocean. However, the Ross Sea sector uniquely experienced strengthened southerly flow of cold continental air. Consequently, this process led to enhanced sea ice loss around Antarctica through warmer air advection from the north, yet simultaneously, expanded the Ross Sea polynyas, enhancing sea ice formation and contributing to increased Ross Sea DSW salinity. Our findings, therefore, establish a robust linkage between these two Southern Ocean transitions, highlighting their interdependence driven by large-scale climate modes."

With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events driven by climate change, understanding the cascading nature of drought and flood events has become crucial for effective disaster risk management. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how these drought-flood interactions work and translate to economic losses. This study addresses this gap by identifying CDFEs and flood-only events (FEs) across Central Europe and linking them to their flood impacts from the modelled Historical Analysis of Natural Hazards in Europe database. CDFEs are associated with significantly higher maximum daily mean streamflow (58.51 m3 s−1 vs 38.20 m3 s−1), deeper mean water depths (1.90 m vs 1.88 m), and greater economic losses (€33.09 million km−2 vs €29.75 million km−2) compared to FEs. These findings underscore the special features of CDFEs and the need to take them into account in flood risk management."

However, current assessments incorporate uncertainties related to data selection, yet the mechanisms through which subjective data selection propagate uncertainties in exposure models remain poorly understood. To address this gap, this study conducted a comparative assessment of flood exposure in China using five population datasets and five flood hazard datasets. Furthermore, it explored the absolute and relative impacts of data uncertainties on 100 year return period flood exposure and discussed the underlying causes. Results exhibit substantial variations in flood exposure when different data combinations are employed. Specifically, there is a significant difference of 333 million individuals within the exposure range, with the highest estimate being 2.82 times the lowest one. Overall, the exposure variation was primarily from differences in flood hazards rather than population patterns, but their relative importance differed spatially depending on factors of slope, altitude, and artificial surface coverage. Despite the differences, all 25 data combinations revealed a disproportional larger share of population in floodplains, which was 2.28–3.49 times the share of floodplains. These findings are significant for understanding the uncertainties of flood exposure and can shed lights on informed policies for risk management."

Brazil, as one of the world’s largest agricultural exporter and biodiversity hotspots, exemplifies these dynamics. Using a cointegration modeling approach, we analyze data from 2006–2023 to uncover long-run equilibria and short-run forecasting power between farmland prices, agribusiness stock prices, and commodity prices in Brazil. We found that farmland prices not only co-move with commodity and stock prices but also Granger-cause financial valuations of agribusiness firms, suggesting that land is increasingly treated as a forward-looking financial indicator rather than a productive asset. The financialization of land markets, as evidenced by these dynamics, can complicate Brazil’s efforts to achieve sustainability goals if proper governance is not in place. To avoid risks of shareholder capitalism—i.e. maximize profits for its investors as primary goal at the expense of ecological or social aspects—, companies might incorporate environmental metrics into how they manage investments and by regulatory frameworks can require financial disclosures that clearly show ecological risks. Aligning financial stewardship with sustainability is not only good practice but also vital for the long-term resilience of land systems."

Results from an atmospheric  222radon inversion in Europe,"The radioactive noble gas radon (222Rn) is a suitable natural tracer for atmospheric transport and mixing processes that can be used to validate and calibrate atmospheric transport models. However, this requires accurate estimates of the 222Rn flux from the soil into the atmosphere. In our study, we evaluate the reliability of process-based 222Rn flux maps for Europe using a 222Rn inversion. Our inversion results can give some indications on how to improve the process-based 222Rn flux maps. 
 The radioactive noble gas radon (222Rn) is a suitable tracer for atmospheric transport and mixing processes that can be used to evaluate and calibrate atmospheric transport models or to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the so-called radon tracer method (RTM). However, these applications require reliable estimates of the 222Rn fluxes from the soil. This study evaluates two process-based 222Rn flux maps in central Europe in 2021 using the flux results from a 1-year 222Rn inversion. The maps are based on different soil moisture reanalysis products (GLDAS-Noah and ERA5-Land), which are used to describe the diffusive 222Rn transport in the soil. The 222Rn inversion was conducted using the CarboScope-Regional inversion system and observational data from 17 atmospheric sites in central Europe in 2021. We observe that, in particular, the ERA5-Land-based 222Rn flux map underestimates the data-driven fluxes from the inversion. Our inversion yields ca. 20 % (GLDAS-Noah) to almost 100 % (ERA5-Land) larger 222Rn fluxes than the respective process-based prior fluxes within a domain covering Germany. Also, the temporal variability seems to be underestimated by the process-based flux maps. Using a flat (uniform) prior inversion, we found a significant anti-correlation of −0.6 (and −0.8) between the posterior 222Rn flux and the GLDAS-Noah (and ERA5-Land) soil moisture time series, indicating that soil moisture is an important driver for the temporal variability in the 222Rn fluxes. To investigate the robustness of our flux estimates, we run the inversion with three different transport models (STILT, FLEXPART, NAME). The respective annual mean flux results agree within ca. 10 %."

Knowing the location of the instrument and the crater, it is possible to compute the geometry (height and thickness) of a volcanic plume. Furthermore, thanks to a specific filter positioned in front of one of the TIR cameras, it is possible to compute the sulfur dioxide (SO2) content emitted by the volcano at a safe distance from the vent. 
 In the last few decades, volcanic monitoring using remote sensing systems has become an essential tool to investigate the effects of volcanic activity on environment, climate, human health, and aviation, as well as to give insights into volcanic processes. Compared to satellite measurements, ground-based instruments offer continuous spatial and temporal coverage capable of providing high-resolution and high-sensitivity data.This work presents a new simplified prototype of a thermal infrared (TIR) system (named “VIRSO2”). The instrument comprises three cameras, one working in the visible spectrum and two in the TIR (8–14 µm). In front of one of the two TIR cameras, an 8.7 µm filter is placed. The system is designed for the detection of volcanic emission, geometry estimation, determining the columnar content of SO2 and ash, and SO2 flux retrievals. The retrieval procedures developed are detailed starting from the geometric characterisation with wind direction correction, the calibration by considering the effects of filter multireflections and temperature, and the SO2 mass by exploiting MODTRAN radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. The SO2 flux is then computed by applying the traverse method, with the plume speed obtained from the wind speed at the crater altitude. As test cases, the measurements collected at Etna Volcano (Italy) on 1 April 2021 during a lava fountain episode and 30 August 2024 during a quiescent phase have been considered. The results show that the system can provide reliable information on plume detection, altitude, and SO2 flux.Its simplicity, its low cost, and the possibility of carrying out measurements at a safe distance from the vent during both the day and the night make this system ideal for real-time monitoring of volcanic emissions, thus helping to provide information on the state of activity of the volcano and therefore to mitigate the effect that these natural phenomena have on humans and the environment."

The study applied an optimal estimation method to determine how cloud droplet sizes change with height, using satellite data and coincident aircraft measurements for validation. It found that current space-borne spectrometers lack the accuracy to fully resolve this vertical structure, but upcoming instruments like CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Earth Observatory) Pathfinder will significantly enhance this capability. 
 With the coming launch of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Earth Observatory (CLARREO) Pathfinder (CPF) comes an opportunity to develop a new retrieval for warm, non-precipitating clouds from spectral reflectance measurements. With continuous coverage across the shortwave spectrum and a factor of 5 to 10 lower radiometric uncertainty than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), CPF facilitates the retrieval of a vertical profile of droplet size, providing insight into the internal structure of a cloud. Measurements from MODIS coincident with in situ observations provide the foundation for developing an optimal estimation technique. Solution constraints were required to ensure consistency with forward model assumptions. The limited unique information in the MODIS bands used in this analysis resulted in a non-unique solution, with many droplet profiles leading to convergence. Droplet size at cloud bottom is difficult to constrain because visible and shortwave infrared reflectances have an average penetration depth near cloud top. The region of convergence within the solution space decreased along the cloud bottom radius dimension by 1 µm when increasing the number of wavelengths used in the retrieval from 7 to 35 and by 3.75 µm when reducing the total uncertainty from 3 % to 1 %. The enhanced accuracy and, to a lesser degree, the enhanced spectral sampling provided by CPF measurements are essential to extracting vertically resolved droplet size information from moderately thick, warm clouds."

 The Mediterranean Sea is experiencing rapid environmental changes, underscoring the urgent need for high-quality, long-term datasets to quantify trends and assess impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Over the past few years, a lot of work has been done to improve and ensure data quality in the western Mediterranean Sea (WMED), but reliable dissolved oxygen (O2) data remain scarce. This is a critical gap as oxygen is a key indicator of marine ecosystem health and plays a central role in carbon and nutrient cycling. To address this gap, we compiled and rigorously quality-controlled a new regional-scale WMED dataset of O2 data from sensors mounted on conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) probes: CTD-O2WMED. This product includes over 1000 previously unpublished high-resolution vertical profiles of CTD-O2 measurements mostly collected within Italian cruises between 2004 and 2023. The quality control (QC) process involved sensor post-calibration against discrete Winkler measurements, primary screening, and a secondary check based on crossover analysis with reference datasets.  Combined, this ensures the consistency of the final corrected CTD-O2WMED across both space and time. CTD-O2WMED provides a robust observational foundation for assessing trends of dissolved oxygen variability, mainly associated with climate change, anomalies related to deoxygenation processes, and contributes to advancing our understanding of ventilation processes in the WMED.

Each contrail is segmented, tracked, and, where possible, attributed to individual flights. A baseline model based on panoptic segmentation is also provided to demonstrate instance-level detection. This dataset enables empirical analysis of contrail lifecycle and supports the validation and calibration of physical models. 
 Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture.

Small streams emerge alongside lakes when ice in the ground melts away, potentially accelerating thawing and biogeochemical activity in a positive feedback cycle. This study provides a comprehensive dataset on these little-studied streams, including thermally and hydrologically important variables essential for improving numerical models. 
 Permafrost thaw affects the global carbon cycle and can significantly alter landscape morphology and associated processes of mass and energy transfer. An understudied aspect of affected permafrost landscapes are ubiquitous rivers connecting thermokarst lakes. These ubiquitous features of Arctic landscapes exhibit particularly high variability in water and energy transfer, and thus provide an excellent field laboratory for analyzing how expected changes in meteorological forcing under climate change affect permafrost dynamics and carbon exchange within the land- and limnoscape. This paper presents a database from 2012 through 2022 for one such small stream connecting two thermokarst lakes. First, two main stream cross sections were instrumented with multiple thermistor chains to record temperature evolution from the surface to different soil depths. The cross sections covered different topography and vegetation cover. One was located near the upper, and one in between the two thermokarst lakes. The main focus was set on the cross section midway between the two lakes due to the absence of a thermal imprint from the lake. Air, water, and ground temperatures, as well as river water parameters, and soil properties of the surrounding environment were measured as time series or single tests during annual field campaigns. The data are organized in three main categories: atmosphere, water and ground, and are complemented by a GIS including a digital surface model and an ortho-mosaic photo of the entire river valley to facilitate the search for measurements of interest. The database comes with a complete set of scripts to process any of the data, which are provided in CSV or other easily accessible standard file formats. Ultimately, the data can be used to develop models and validate numerical codes for improving the representation of permafrost processes in land surface and climate models where climate change induces significant changes in heat and mass transfer. All data and processing scripts are available through an online repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14619854; Pohl et al. (2025))."

Kay;Penny Rowe,A novel model hierarchy isolates the limited effect of supercooled liquid cloud optics on infrared radiation,"We developed a novel methodology for assessing whether a new physics parameterization should be added to a climate model based on its effect across a hierarchy of model dynamical constraints. Our study used this model hierarchy to evaluate the effect of a new cloud radiation parameterization on longwave radiation and determined that the parameterization should be added to climate radiation models, but its effect is not large enough to be a priority. 
 Clouds exert strong influences on surface energy budgets and climate projections. Yet, cloud physics are complex and often incompletely represented in models. For example, supercooled liquid cloud optics parameterizations are rarely incorporated into the radiative transfer models used for climate projections. Prior work has shown that incorporating these optics in longwave radiation calculations increases Arctic downwelling longwave fluxes by as much as 1.7 W m−2. Here we examine whether implementing supercooled liquid water optics in climate models for longwave radiation impacts global radiative fluxes and climate. We use a novel methodology that uses a hierarchy of dynamical constraints on the sequence of atmospheric states. In the model experiments with stronger dynamical constraints, we find that the supercooled liquid water optics increase Arctic downwelling longwave by 2.17–3.24 W m−2. In contrast, these optics increased Arctic downwelling longwave radiation by 0.36–0.68 W m−2 with dynamically unconstrained model experiments. While the optics impact was greater within the dynamically constrained models than in dynamically unconstrained models, the dynamically constrained models are also more idealized than the unconstrained models. In summary, we found a signal from supercooled liquid water optics; the influence of these optics for longwave radiation is small compared to the modeled longwave radiation variability. More broadly, this work demonstrates a novel framework for assessing the climate importance of a physics change."

However, the overall patterns of thermal tides and their individual components' contribution to superrotation remain poorly understood. Using a 16‐year radio occultation data set observed by Venus Express and Akatsuki, we have, for the first time, revealed the thermal tide structure from the cloud base to mesopause (50–90 km) in the southern hemisphere. The tidal patterns are equatorially symmetric and validated by simulations with the Venus Planetary Climate Model, extending tidal insights beyond the northern hemisphere focus of previous studies. The simulation indicates that diurnal tide‐induced AM flux divergence is the primary driving force for equatorial cloud‐top superrotation, with its meridional and vertical AM flux divergence dominating in the region of ∼5 km above and below the cloud top, respectively."

However, a recent study uncovered omnipresent spurious pressure waves around simulated ShCu clouds by three compressible community LES models, suggesting a potentially common issue. These waves degrade the simulation of pressure‐related variables and lead to unclosed turbulence flux budgets. An analytic theory is proposed to explain pressure wave generation by latent heating. Specifically, the solution to the linearized pressure equation with a diabatic source contains a singularity condition when the time rate of heating equals the time interval of a sound wave propagating through a cloud. The former is tied to the model time step in most bulk microphysics schemes that adopt saturation adjustment to parameterize cloud water condensation. The theory suggests that wave stabilization requires more frequent microphysics updates than is currently done, and is supported by LES results."

Characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions from Early (∼282 Ma), Middle (∼268 Ma), and Late Permian (∼255 Ma) rocks pass fold, reversals, and conglomerate tests, confirming their primary origin. These results yield the first reliable Permian paleopoles for the ALB. The data indicate minor movement during the Early–Middle Permian, followed by rapid northward drift and ∼53.8° counterclockwise rotation in the Middle‐Late Permian. Comparison with surrounding blocks suggests the ALB was tectonically linked to North China but independent of Tarim.

The model reproduces the basic observed features of the event, including its recorded ground motions and its inferred slow rupture speed.

Despite differing magnitudes, both storms exhibited similar precipitation‐to‐TWS conversion patterns, implying consistent scaling of hydrological responses across intensities.

 Earth’s bulk composition has elemental and isotopic characteristics that cannot be fully reconciled with a mixture of known primitive meteorite compositions1–3. One potential explanation for this is that the proto-Earth accreted materials with isotopic signatures distinct from those accreted after the Moon-forming giant impact. Here we report high-precision mass-independent potassium isotopic measurements from thermal ionization mass spectrometry of terrestrial rocks from various ancient and modern sources in the crust and mantle that we argue are consistent with this explanation. Specifically, we found that some mafic Archaean rocks derived from the Hadean–Eoarchaean mantle (including samples from Isua, Nuvvuagittuq and the Kaapvaal Craton) and certain modern ocean island basalts (from La Réunion Island and Kama’ehuakanaloa volcano, Hawaii) exhibit an average 40K deficit of 65 parts per million compared to all other terrestrial samples analysed. The deficit distinguishes these samples from the bulk silicate Earth and any known meteorite group and cannot result from magmatic processes. Therefore, we propose this 40K deficit represents primitive proto-Earth mantle domains that largely escaped mantle mixing after the giant impact and exist in the present-day deep mantle, contributing to some modern hotspot volcanism.

 China’s cropland soil has faced acidification since the latter half of the twentieth century; however, the temporal and spatial variations of this are poorly known. Here we analyse cropland soil acidification using 7,024 regional surveys and a machine learning model to project spatiotemporal variations in cropland topsoil pH across China from 1985 to 2040. Our results reveal a turning point in China’s agricultural soil chemistry: consistent acidification from the 1980s ceased as a whole around 2013 (with a cumulative pH decline of ~0.25 units during 1985–2013), correlating strongly with changes in nitrogen fertilizer application patterns consequent to agricultural policy reforms. Regional heterogeneity was observed, with paddy fields exhibiting pH recovery post-2013 while values in dryland soils remained largely static since 2000. These findings underscore the critical role of agricultural policy and nitrogen fertilizer management in shaping soil health dynamics.

Here, the authors assess fragmentomics analysis methods and their application to commercial targeted sequencing panels. 
 Fragmentomics based analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has recently emerged as a method to infer epigenetic and transcriptional data. Many of these reports analyze whole genome sequencing (WGS) which is not readily available clinically. Targeted exon panels are used for clinical cfDNA variant calling. In this report, we conduct an investigation of multiple published fragmentomics methods for WGS, but on cancer exon panels. We find that strategies utilizing normalized depth metrics, as well as all exons present on the panel, generally allow for better prediction of cancer phenotypes across a range of tumor fractions, though other metrics work particularly well in specific applications. Additionally, genes from commercial clinical targeted sequencing panels could be similarly employed for cancer phenotyping with a minimal decrease in performance despite their smaller genomic coverage. These results suggest that fragmentomics-based analysis of cfDNA can utilize targeted sequencing panels and does not necessarily require additional WGS. cfDNA fragmentomics is a potential clinically applicable method for identifying cancer.

Here, Boulay et al. present a machine-learning classifier that uses protein language models to assign functions to bacteriophage proteins more accurately than existing approaches. 
 Bacteriophages, viruses infecting bacteria, are estimated to outnumber their cellular hosts by 10-fold, acting as key players in all microbial ecosystems. Under evolutionary pressure by their host, they evolve rapidly and encode a large diversity of protein sequences. Consequently, the majority of functions carried by phage proteins remain elusive. Current tools to comprehensively identify phage protein functions from their sequence either lack sensitivity (those relying on homology for instance) or specificity (assigning a single coarse grain function to a protein). Here, we introduce Empathi, a protein-embedding-based classifier that assigns functions in a hierarchical manner. New categories were specifically elaborated for phage protein functions and organized such that molecular-level functions are respected in each category, making them well suited for training machine learning classifiers based on protein embeddings. Empathi outperforms homology-based methods on a dataset of cultured phage genomes, tripling the number of annotated homologous groups. On the EnVhogDB database, the most recent and extensive database of metagenomically-sourced phage proteins, Empathi doubled the annotated fraction of protein families from 16% to 33%. Having a more global view of the repertoire of functions a phage possesses will assuredly help to understand them and their interactions with bacteria better.

 Developing monovalent anion-selective membranes (MAPMs) faces challenges, including the trade-off between flux and selectivity, membrane stability, and cost-effective fabrication. Overcoming these requires advanced material design and scalable techniques. Here, we introduce in situ interfacial polymerization (ISIP) to prepare MAPMs. Base membranes are synthesized via superacid polymerization and modified with anion channels and -NH2 groups. During ISIP, trimesoyl chloride reacts with surface -NH2 groups, forming a partially crosslinked structure with -COOH groups to regulate ion transport via electrostatic interactions. This results in low membrane resistance (4.7 Ω cm2) and selective transport of weakly hydrated ions (Cl−, Br−, NO3−), while strongly hydrated ions (SO42−, F−) face higher barriers. MAPMs demonstrate high performance, achieving a limiting current density (>90 mA cm−2), Cl− flux (1.98 mol m−2 h−1 at 5 mA cm−2), and selectivity (244 for Cl−/SO42−), confirming effective hydration dynamics control and balanced performance.

Inspired by nanopore sequencing technology, we developed a plasmonic device capable of operating in a flow-through configuration to detect individual molecules passing through plasmonic hotspots. This device is a permeable plasmonic film, through which single molecules are sequentially delivered via electrophoresis, while Raman spectra are recorded in real-time. A very effective light-matter coupling, combined with the ultrasmall size of plasmonic spots, enabled access to angstrom spatial and microsecond temporal scales compatible with polymer sequencing. We successfully slowed the translocation process and captured Raman spectra of the four nucleotides at a time resolution down to 20 μs under our experimental conditions. We achieved a discrimination accuracy of 89% at the single-molecule level.

 Maximizing steady-state turnover rates is a central goal in electrocatalysis research, but improving one reaction step often impedes others. Navigating these trade-offs requires methods that systematically reveal how a single parameter change affects all key steps of a reaction mechanism. Here, we use electrochemical mass spectrometry to determine the potential-dependent rates of each principal step in propane oxidation on Pt and directly relate them to the steady-state turnover rate. Our analysis reveals that low steady-state activity arises from a mismatch between the optimal potentials for adsorption, conversion, and *CO oxidation. By applying alternating potentials to individually optimize adsorption and oxidation, we overcome this limitation and achieve rates exceeding those under constant-potential operation.

 Forests with high ecological integrity are fundamental for biodiversity conservation and provide integral ecosystem services. These forests have natural or near-natural ecosystem structure, function, and composition. Anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, overexploitation of natural resources, and land use changes are leading to the degradation or loss of high-integrity forests. As a result, assessing forest integrity over large areas is increasingly important for a range of conservation initiatives. In this study, we used remote sensing-derived forest structural and functioning metrics alongside a high-quality reference state to calculate ecological dissimilarity as a proxy for ecological integrity. We examined stand-level integrity and focused on forest structural attributes such as canopy height, cover, complexity, and biomass, as well as the Dynamic Habitat Indices, which summarize annual energy availability relevant for biodiversity. We further refined our reference states by using coarsened exact matching to ensure our comparisons were drawn from suitable protected analogs. We applied these methods to Vancouver Island, Canada, where we assessed the distance, in structural and functional space, to matched high-integrity forests found in the island’s oldest and largest protected area. We also assessed how individual and cumulative anthropogenic pressure affect the ecological integrity of forests on the island. We found that mean forest structural dissimilarity increased from 0.79 to 1.61 under high levels of anthropogenic pressure (ANOVA; p < 0.001), while functional dissimilarity was not impacted by any anthropogenic pressure (ANOVA; p > 0.05). This indicates that anthropogenic pressures were observed to directly influence forest canopy characteristics, and less so energy availability. For individual pressures, we found that built environments, harvesting, and population density influenced structural dissimilarity (ANOVA; p < 0.05), while roads did not influence structural dissimilarity (ANOVA; p > 0.05). These methods for identifying high-integrity forests can be used to identify areas to be prioritized for protection or restoration, which in turn progresses towards the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework’s goal of 30 % of all ecosystems protected, while focusing on high-integrity ecosystems."

 Coastal wetland patterns in China have undergone dramatic changes in recent years due to the invasion and subsequent management of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). The ecological benefits of clearing S. alterniflora still lack sufficient exploration. SAR data can provide complete time series observations covering the full phenological cycle of salt marsh vegetation, thereby offering a valuable data source for accurate wetland monitoring. However, the similarity in backscatter values among salt marsh vegetation types poses a challenge for wetland classification. To address this issue, we propose a layer-wise classification framework based on local optimal spatiotemporal features fusion (LOSF_LC). We selected the Yellow River Delta wetland (YRD) and Jiuduansha wetland (JDS), which differ in geographical location and have been severely invaded by S. alterniflora, as the study areas. Using 443 Sentinel-1 images, we generated 10-m resolution wetland maps from 2017 to 2024. Classification experiments using LightGBM, XGBoost, and RF demonstrated that LOSF_LC improved OA by 1.64%–3.44% compared to RFE. Under the optimal scheme, the OA reached 96.07% and 96.30% for the YRD and JDS, respectively. In addition, long-term mapping results revealed that the removal of S. alterniflora has achieved significant restoration outcomes, with native salt marsh species regaining habitat and Phragmites australis becoming the dominant type. Nonetheless, the reduction in salt marsh vegetation and land areas highlights emerging risks for wetland ecosystems.

 Under the background of policy-driven emission reduction in China, the intensification of ozone pollution and its causes has attracted great attention over the past decade. Based on the synchronous observation of the Mie scattering lidar and microwave radiometers, combined with the TUV Radiation model, a quantitative evaluation of the synergistic effects of pollutant emissions and climate change on decadal-scale ozone pollution was performed, and the reasons for the intensification and spatial heterogeneity of ozone pollution were investigated in the southern Yangtze River Delta, Zhejiang province, from 2011 to 2020. The results showed that aerosol pollution was obviously improved after 2014, whereas ozone pollution displayed an overall upward trend and pronounced spatial heterogeneity, while an upward trend was exhibited in the most areas and a downward trend in some water areas such as the southeast coast. Compared with the period before 2014, the promoting of aerosol emission reduction including air temperature rising, the inhibiting of climate change as well as precursor reduction on ozone pollution in Hangzhou were 8.18 μg m−3, 0.98 μg m−3 and around 2.07 μg m−3 in the period after 2014, respectively, while the corresponding values were 0.49 μg m−3, 6.37 μg m−3 and around 3.68 μg m−3 in Zhoushan. The results indicated that aerosol emission reduction and climate change exhibited the promoting and inhibiting (“climate benefit”) effects, respectively. The differences between the impacts of aerosol emission reduction and the increase in water vapor content were the main causes of the intensification and spatial heterogeneity of ozone pollution. Although the changes in ozone precursor concentrations were conducive to reducing ozone pollution, the accurate relationship between them requires further study."

 Beijing is particularly prone to frequent wintertime haze episodes. In this study, we introduce the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) and SOSAA (the model to Simulate the concentration of Organic vapors, Sulfuric Acid, and Aerosols) modeling system for air quality analysis and applied the newly developed modeling system to a severe pollution episode during a case study in Beijing in November 2018. FLEXPART-SOSAA uses a Lagrangian approach following backward trajectories, and its novelty includes detailed chemical and aerosol mechanisms along each trajectory, incorporating aerosol size distribution in addition to simple mass concentrations. This is particularly valuable from a health perspective. In this study, we demonstrated FLEXPART-SOSAA's capabilities along 7-day backward trajectories to investigate the origins and processes of haze during the case study. Our findings indicate that approximately 75 % of the particles in Beijing originated from outside the city. During the haze episode, the back-trajectories passed through the high-emission region of southern Hebei province. Some of the particle mass was traced back to the Xinjiang region in far western China. After evaluating the results, we tested reduced-emission scenarios and sensitivity tests. We determined that comprehensive emission control across multiple emission sectors was more effective than addressing only one individual sector, and emission control at a regional or national level would be significantly more effective than implementing restriction only in the city of Beijing. Additionally, we found that postponing agricultural waste burning to a time when haze is not in the forecast could help mitigate pollution in the city."

 Global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of compound climate events, highlighting the need to understand their patterns and impacts. The physical characteristics of heatwaves (HWs) followed by extreme precipitation events (EPs) across 13 subregions of the Middle East (ME) are investigated on a 25-years period from 2000 to 2024. The frequency, duration, and intensity of HWs are quantified using maximum temperature of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis. The final product of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG-F) is used for analyzing EP following HWs, as it demonstrated the highest accuracy in a comparative evaluation of six satellite-based precipitation products against rainfall data from 120 weather stations. Iran, Türkiye, and Yemen exhibited the highest HW intensity, frequency, and duration, respectively. Although July showed the highest number of HWs, May and September demonstrated the highest success rates for a shift toward EP within a 36-h window, reaching 58.5 % and 57 %, respectively. The last day of HWs and the subsequent day accounted for the majority of EPs, contributing 21.3 % and 39.7 % of the total EP, respectively. An increasing trend in EP contributions following HWs has been observed since 2013, with a slope of 29 %. The contribution to the probability of EP following HWs was notably higher in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, about 8 and 11.6 times greater than climatology, respectively, underscoring their significance as potential water resources. EPs following HWs contributed 62.6 % of the total precipitation, compared to 38.4 % from climatological EPs, and had a 72.2 % occurrence probability versus 27.8 % in the climatology. EP intensity presented a positive trend across the ME, with statistically significant increases in Iran and Yemen, exposing the higher HW intensity and duration. The strong correlations between HW intensity and duration and subsequent EP (R2 = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively) are characterized by slopes of 0.36 °C and 2.4-day correspond to an increase in EP rate. Satellite precipitation data revealed high levels of convective and warm rain, liquid water content, and higher droplet size in EPs following HW relative to climatological EPs. Finally, the ME is subdivided into three regions (Türkiye, Iran, and Arabian Peninsula/Egypt) to enable region specific analysis of large-scale atmospheric conditions before, during, and after EPs. Notably, across all regions, a pronounced convergence of moisture flux from adjacent water bodies is observed 48 h prior to rainfall, supplying sufficient atmospheric moisture. During the EPs, low geopotential height systems, whether weak or strong, contributed to temperature reduction, facilitating atmospheric saturation and subsequent EP development particularly in Türkiye and Iran."

 The near-surface thermal stability (Ts-Ta), defined as the difference between land surface temperature (Ts) and air temperature (Ta), is a critical regulator of surface–atmosphere energy exchange. Conditions are thermally unstable when Ts-Ta ≥ 0, promoting turbulent mixing, and stable when Ts-Ta < 0, suppressing turbulence. Although Arctic amplification is expected to reduce albedo and enhance unstable conditions, analysis of high-quality hourly observations (2002–2024) from the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) reveals a counterintuitive large-scale shift toward more frequent stable conditions across southern and western Alaska, even as the North Slope experiences opposing trends. This net stabilization is driven primarily by a widespread decline in solar radiation, which has outweighed the warming effect of albedo reduction. Partial correlation analysis reveals that the influence of albedo is not direct but mediated through its coupling with other surface energy balance components, whereas solar radiation exerts a strong and direct driving role. Annually, Alaska's Ts-Ta averages −0.58 ± 2.40 °C, ranging from 1.13 ± 2.31 °C in summer to −2.04 ± 1.29 °C in winter. Unstable conditions occur 30.2 ± 26.9 % of the time on average—varying seasonally from 4.0 ± 9.5 % in winter to 61.6 ± 13.6 % in summer. Spatially, the frequency of unstable conditions declined significantly in southern regions (e.g., Northeast Gulf: −5.5 % per decade, p < 0.05), contrasting with an increase on the North Slope (+3.2 % per decade, p < 0.1), underscoring a stark divide between interior and coastal regions in response to Arctic warming. This enhanced stabilization can suppress vertical mixing and alter surface energy exchange, with profound implications for regional climate feedbacks. Our findings resolve the apparent paradox of stabilization under Arctic amplification and emphasize the necessity of accurately representing competing forcings and their complex interaction in climate models."

 Accurate assessment of drought propagation time (PT) and probability (PB) from meteorological to soil moisture drought is crucial for mitigating natural and socio-economic losses. However, inconsistencies among datasets and drought indices (DIs) hinder reliable early warning. Here, we evaluated multiple meteorological and soil moisture datasets against in-situ observations to establish a benchmark. Four DIs—SPI, SPEI, PA, and MI—were employed to estimate PT and PB using maximum correlation coefficient and Copula function. We further quantified uncertainties arising from datasets and DIs and proposed a framework for selecting optimal DIs under varying dataset scenarios. The results show that: (i) Benchmark-based PT ranges from 3.10 months (for SPEI) to 5.37 months (for MI) and PB increases with the regional humidity. (ii) ERA5-Land exhibits the highest spatial consistency, matching benchmark PT in 48.47 % (MI) to 61.62 % (SPEI) of pixels, with no significant monthly bias. In contrast, MERRA-2 yields prolonged PT in over 80 % of pixels and shows substantial overestimations (4–10 months) in humid regions. For PB, more than 80 % of pixels from ERA5-Land, GLDAS-2, and MERRA-2 show significant overestimations. (iii) On average, 67.63 % of pixels display greater PT uncertainty from dataset differences than from DI differences, and 68.77 % show higher PB uncertainty from datasets. Compared to the other indices, SPEI can minimize the assessment uncertainties in drought PT/PB across different dataset scenarios. These findings provide a quantitative basis for selecting DIs and datasets, supporting more reliable drought propagation assessment in China."

 To better understand the in-cloud enrichment of secondary inorganic ions, the chemical composition of individual particles during cloud events and cloud-free periods, as well as cloud water and PM2.5 samples, were measured from August to September 2023 at Mt. Damaojian (1128 m a.s.l.) in southeastern China. Our results demonstrated that cloud processes promoted the aqueous-phase formation of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate, but the degree of sulfate enrichment was lower than that observed for ammonium and nitrate. Furthermore, the average hourly relative peak area (RPA) of secondary inorganic ions revealed their selective enrichment in cloud droplets. The RPA of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate in cloud droplet residual (RES) particles were 5.11, 3.05, and 1.43 times greater than those in cloud interstitial (INT) particles during two consecutive long-lasting cloud events, respectively. Both ammonium and nitrate showed ubiquitous enrichment across all particle types, including K-rich, Black carbon (BC), Metal, and Sea salt (SS) particles, although with distinct degrees of enrichment. Ammonium exhibited the highest degree of enrichment in the SS particles, whereas nitrate showed the most pronounced enhancement in the BC particles. Notably, the RPA of nitrate in all four types of particles exhibited a significant positive correlation with the liquid water content (LWC), reinforcing the role of aqueous-phase processing. Unlike ubiquitous ammonium and nitrate, sulfate enrichment was restricted to K-rich and Metal particles. The different enrichments of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate underscore particle-specific influences on their in-cloud formation. These findings extend our current understanding of atmospheric chemistry in clouds."

 On July 18, 2023, an altitude-triggered lightning flash, consisting of thirteen leader/return stroke (LR) sequences, was successfully induced. X-ray emissions were detected during seven of these LRs. This study comprehensively analyzes the differences in optical radiation, VHF radiation, and interstroke intervals between LRs that were accompanied by detectable X-rays and those that were not, with the aim of exploring the underlying mechanism of X-ray production in lightning. For the first time, experimental observations confirm that leader branches may impede the emission of X-rays, likely due to a reduction in the potential difference at the leader tip. Additionally, a significant temporal synchronization and notable intensity correlation were observed between X-ray emissions and VHF radiation, both of which exhibit a strong positive correlation with the intensity of the electric field at the leader tip. In the studied lightning event, detectable X-ray emissions occurred only when the interstroke interval exceeded approximately 20 ms. More importantly, our results demonstrate that longer interstroke intervals promote the generation of higher-energy X-ray emissions. Both the total X-ray energy and the mean photon energy showed a positive correlation with the interstroke interval, with Spearman correlation coefficients of ρ = 0.685 and ρ = 0.595, respectively. This enhanced X-ray emission is attributed to the stronger electric field developed at the leader tip during longer interstroke intervals. Collectively, these findings provide strong support for the leader tip high-field runaway electron mechanism as the origin of lightning X-rays."
