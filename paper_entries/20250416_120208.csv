However, conserving peatlands in many tropical areas is challenging due to limited knowledge of their distribution. To address this, we surveyed soils and plant communities in Colombia’s eastern lowlands, where few peatlands have previously been described. We documented peat soils >40 cm thick at 51 of more than 100 surveyed wetlands. We use our data to update a regional peatland classification, which includes a new and possibly widespread peatland type, ‘the white-sand peatland,’ as well as two distinctive open-canopy sub-types. Analysis of peat bulk density and organic matter content from 39 intact peat cores indicates that the average per-area carbon densities of these sites (490–1230 Mg C ha−1, depending on type) is 4–10 times the typical carbon stock of a (non-peatland) Amazonian forest. We used remote sensing to upscale our observations, generating the first data-driven peatland map for the region. The total estimated carbon stock of these peatlands of 1.91 petagrams (Pg C) (2-sigma confidence interval, 0.60–4.22) approaches that of South America’s largest known peatland complex in the northern Peruvian Amazon, indicating that substantial peat carbon stores on the continent have yet to be documented. These observations indicate that tropical peatlands may be far more diverse in form and structure and broadly distributed than is widely understood, which could have important implications for tropical peatland conservation strategies."

We estimate the total number of abandoned and orphaned wells in Canada and the United States to be 3,485,480 of which 4% are orphaned and in need of government funding. When normalized by today’s oil production, the United States has twice the number of abandoned and orphaned wells compared to Canada. Across Canada and the United States, we find more than 15,000 gigawatt of wind capacity and 7 gigawatt of solar capacity at abandoned and orphaned well sites. More than 90% of abandoned and orphaned wells with available depth are better suited for shallow geothermal systems and heating applications, yet deep geothermal is possible at up to 10% of the wells. Repurposing oil and gas wells can help fulfill national energy transition goals and emission reduction targets, while providing an additional funding stream to manage their environmental risks."

However, little is known about the extent to which LC and drainage density interact to alter fire occurrence. Here, we assess the relationship between these variables in the peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia, spanning a five-year period of inter-annual climatic variability. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite imagery was used to map active fire hotspots. Drained peatlands experienced up to 13 times greater annual mean hotspot density (number of fire hotspots per km2) when compared to peatlands without canals. The greatest difference in fire hotspot density between drained and undrained peatlands occurred in forested peatlands (by a factor of 2.6–13.3), followed by shrublands (1.1–7.6), crop lands (1.4–5.0) and plantations (1.2–2.6), where largest differences were found in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral years. We found a curvilinear relationship between hotspot density and canal density, with the relationship depending on LC and ENSO status. At low to moderate drainage density, hotspot density increased with drainage density in all LC types in 2013–2017. Heavily drained plantations experienced a lower hotspot density than moderately drained plantations possibly due to factors such as management practices or impacts of previous fire history. The relationship with drainage density was strongest in 2013, an ENSO-neutral year, and weakest in the strong El Niño of 2015. Our findings support the critical need for fire management in drained tropical peat areas. Peat fire management planning and peatland restoration should be tailored to the differing responses of fire to climate variability, drainage density and LC types."

This systematic literature review examines the latest developments in Climate Risk Assessment (CRA), focusing on how climate risks are framed and assessed. It explores advancements, ongoing challenges, and emerging opportunities to guide future generations of CRAs. Key findings highlight a more nuanced risk framework that incorporates climate responses, modulating the three risk determinants (exposure, vulnerability, and hazards), as outlined in the latest IPCC assessment. The state-of-the-art concentrates on the temporal and spatial characteristics of hazards, while exposure and vulnerability are increasingly understood as dynamic concepts influenced by socioeconomic changes. Recent developments, such as multi-hazard approaches, risk tolerance integration, and the concept of Climatic Impact-Drivers (CID), provide new perspectives on assessing climate risks. However, managing complexity and uncertainty remain the main operational challenges, underscoring the need for improved CRA methodologies and models, as well as consistent, interoperable datasets. The paper discusses avenues to advance CRA, emphasizing the importance of bridging the gap between academic advancements and practical implementation. Conceptual recommendations include adopting a systemic approach to, for example, better account for the cascading and compounding risks, hazard thresholds, adaptation limits, and risk amplifiers, as well as using storylines to improve CRA communication. Technical recommendations include leveraging emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning methods and big data analytics to improve real-time risk prediction and modeling. To enhance the CRA practice, the study advocates for greater stakeholder involvement and inclusive governance to ensure that CRAs remain context-specific and relevant. These recommendations, together with strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge-sharing, are expected to pave the way for more effective climate risk management, adaptation, and resilience-building strategies."

The survey provides valuable information regarding landcover, land use, and environmental parameters across European Union countries on a three-year basis since 2006. Recently, the survey has been used to monitor grazing in semi-natural habitats such as livestock agroforestry. However, in recent years LUCAS has become more reliant on photo-interpretation in the second phase of the survey. We identified an underreporting (p < 0.001) of grazing in points surveyed using photo-interpretation and statistically corrected for this systematic bias. We analysed the extents of grazing under woody and wetland landcovers in the United Kingdom over time, comparing extents estimated from the raw LUCAS data, statistically corrected data, and data from only field surveyed points. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first estimation of the extent of grazing under wetland habitats in the United Kingdom, which we estimated to be approximately 72 000 hectares in 2018. This paper updated the extent of livestock agroforestry in the United Kingdom, estimating that over 300 000 hectares of woody landcovers were grazed in 2018, which would have been underestimated by almost 100 000 hectares if statistical corrections had not been applied. Use of the LUCAS dataset can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of environmental policies, but the impact of photo-interpretation on temporal trends needs to be accounted for."

While urban vegetation provides ecosystem services such as air quality improvement and heat reduction, it can also contribute to air pollution through the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and pollen can exacerbate respiratory health issues and allergies within communities. Chicago’s environmental and health disparities make it a critical case for examining the complex interactions between urban vegetation and air quality. This paper evaluates how plant species selection and participatory community co-design can address these challenges, focusing on Humboldt Park, Chicago, IL, and Evanston, IL, as case studies. Community-driven initiatives, such as those led by the Puerto Rican Agenda in Humboldt Park, are essential in mitigating negative impacts on air quality through informed species selection.

However, the response relationship between air quality and public attention is unclear. Utilizing data from the Baidu Index, air quality, and demographic data, we developed the per capita public attention to air quality (PAAQ) index. Employing seasonal time series analysis, spatial analysis, spatial lag models, we examined the spatiotemporal response and driving factors of air quality and PAAQ index in Shandong province, China from 2014 to 2021. Our study focused on keywords analysis and spatiotemporal dimensions to uncover regional disparities in public response and concerns regarding air pollution. The results indicate that: (1) Consistent improvements in air quality have led to a decline in public concern, particularly since 2020. Monthly variations in PAAQ, AQI, PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and NO2 exhibit a U-shaped pattern, with lower levels in summer and higher levels in winter, while O3 exhibits an inverse trend. (2) Air pollution in Shandong province demonstrates spatial clustering, with high pollution concentrations in the central, northwestern, and southern regions, whereas the Shandong Peninsula exhibits relatively better air quality. (3) Industrial cities in central and southern Shandong province experience high PAAQ levels due to severe winter pollution. PAAQ is more pronounced and forward-looking in developed areas, decreasing rapidly as air quality improves. (4) The proportion of the secondary industry, the urban population proportion, the number of Internet users per capita, and the AQI positively amplify PAAQ. The PAAQ index serves as a quantitative tool to gauge public feedback on air quality management, aiding governments in identifying key areas for intervention, optimizing spatiotemporal pollution control strategies, and promoting regional collaborative governance."

Biases in the IAGOS water vapour dataset are adjusted, based on the more accurate IAGOS-CARIBIC data. The resulting highly resolved H2O climatologies will contribute to a better understanding of the H2O variability in the UT/LS and its connection to various transport and mixing processes. 
 This study presents a new methodology to derive adjusted water vapour (H2O) climatologies for the extra-tropical upper troposphere  and lowermost stratosphere (UT/LMS) from regular measurements on board passenger aircraft between 1994 and 2022 within the IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System) research infrastructure. A synthesis of mean H2O is performed by sampling air mass bins of similar origin and thermodynamic conditions relative to the tropopause between a dataset from 60 000 flights employing the IAGOS-MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone by AIRBUS In-Service Aircraft) and IAGOS-CORE capacitive hygrometer (ICH) and a dataset of 500 flights using the more sophisticated IAGOS-CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) hygrometer. The analysis is, in combination with ECMWF ERA5 meteorological data, accomplished for the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere, where the datasets have the largest common coverage. We find very good agreement in the UT but a systematic positive humidity bias in the ICH measurements for the LMS. To account for this bias, mean H2O of the ICH is adjusted to the IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements based on a new mapping and adjustment approach. After applying this new method, the LMS H2O measurements are in good agreement between all investigated platforms. The extensive H2O dataset from the compact IAGOS sensor can now be used to produce highly resolved H2O climatologies for the climatically sensitive LMS region."

As seasons progress, local contributions within each region to its NOy budget decreased from 32 %–43 % to 23 %–30 %, while transboundary contributions increased from 16 %–33 % to 27 %–37 %, driven by a shift in synoptic settings that allowed pollutants to spread more broadly across the regions. 
 We investigated source contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions to reactive nitrogen species (NOy) loadings across East Asia during the 2022 winter–spring transition. Using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and its Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM), we conducted air quality simulations, leveraging top-down estimates of NOx emissions adjusted by the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns. After the Bayesian inversion, the inventoried NOx emissions increased by 50 % in South Korea and 33 % in China compared to the a priori estimates, which substantially reduced the model's prior underestimation of surface NO2 concentrations from −32.75 % to −13.01 % in South Korea and from −10.26 % to −3.04 % in China. We compared local and transboundary contributions of NOx emissions to NOy concentrations across East Asia. Local contributions showed a declining trend, from 32 %–43 % in January to 23 %–30 % by May, while transboundary contributions consistently increased from 16 %–33 % in January to 27 %–37 % by May. North China consistently contributed over 10 % to East Asia's NOy loadings. East China and South Central China were significant contributors to each other's NOy budget by 9 %–12 %. South Central China transboundary contributions consistently outweighed local contributions by 5 %, indicating vulnerability to pollution transport. South Korea, initially the least influential, contributed 1 %–4 % to transboundary NOy concentrations in January. This increased to 6 %–7 % by May, becoming comparable to other regions' contributions. These behaviors of NOy were driven by distinct synoptic settings, where strong wintertime northwesterly winds directed pollutants southeastward, while their weakening in spring led to more multidirectional transport patterns, allowing pollutants to spread more broadly across the regions."

Our result reveals that the global radiative forcing (RF) induced by LUC driving surface albedo change is −0.12 W m−2, 20 % lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and vegetation changes play a key role in RF evolution, which provides an important reference for the assessment of earth energy balance. 
 Land-use change (LUC) is ranked as the second anthropogenic source of climate change after fossil fuel burning and yields negative albedo-induced radiative forcing (ARF). This cooling effect has been assessed using low spatiotemporally resolved LUC datasets derived from historical statistical data with large uncertainties. Herein, we implement a satellite-remote-sensing-derived highly resolved LUC dataset into a compact earth system model and reassess the global and regional surface ARF by LUC from 1983–2010 relative to 1750. We find that the magnitude of the negative ARF obtained from the present study is lower than that estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by 20 %, implying a weaker cooling effect.  The result reveals that the global LUC-induced surface albedo change may not significantly slow down global warming as was previously anticipated.  Sub-Saharan Africa made the largest net contribution to the magnitude of the global ARF (39.2 %), due to substantial land-use conversions, typically the conversion from forest to other vegetation lands, which are accompanied by higher surface albedos. The most remarkable land cover changes occurred in East and Southeast Asia, which dominated the changes in the global ARF in recent decades. Based on major land cover types in these two regions, we infer that vegetation lands exert the most vital effect on global ARF variation."

The dataset avoids a sharp drop in zero-value frequency after 2019 as caused by the instrument upgrade but is also more continuous for various periods. This dataset is crucial for accurately assessing dimming and brightening and for supporting other applications. 
 Inhomogeneities in the sunshine duration (SSD) observational series, caused by non-climatic factors like China's widespread transition from manual to automatic SSD recorders in 2019 or station relocations, have hindered the accurate estimation of near-surface solar radiation. These issues significantly affect the analysis of global dimming and brightening, as well as related applications, such as solar energy planning and agriculture management. This study compiled raw SSD observational data from 1961 to 2022 from more than 2200 stations in China and clearly found that the improved precision from 0.1 h to 1 min following the instrument update in 2019 led to a sudden reduction in the frequency of zero SSD from 2019 onward, referred to as the day0-type discontinuity. For the first time, we systematically corrected this known day0-type discontinuity at 378 stations (17 %) in China, resulting in an SSD series with comparable frequencies of zero value before and after 2019. On this basis, we constructed a homogenization procedure to detect and adjust discontinuities in both the variance and mean of the daily SSD from 1961 to 2022. Results show that a total of 1363 (60 %) stations experienced breakpoints in SSD, of which ∼65 % were confirmed to be associated with station relocations and instrument replacements. Compared to the raw SSD, the homogenized SSD is more continuous to the naked eye for various periods and presents weakened dimming (p<0.05) across China from 1961 to 1990 but a non-significant positive trend with a reduction of 60 % in the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the homogenized SSD tends to better capture the dimming phenomenon. Northern regions continue dimming from 1991 to 2022, but southern regions of China brighten slightly. The implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control since 2013 has contributed to a reversal of SSD trends thereafter, which is better reflected in the homogenized SSD, with a trend shift from −0.02 to 0.07 h d−1 per decade from 2013 to 2022 in China, especially in heavily polluted regions. Besides this, the relationships of cloud cover fraction and aerosol optical depth with SSD are intensified in the homogenized dataset. These results highlight the importance of the homogenized SSD in accurately understanding the dimming and brightening phenomena.

Our dataset meticulously documents 38 attributes of DFBDs, and we have utilized Google Earth for validation. Additionally, we discussed the applicability of landslide dam stability and peak-discharge models to DFBDs. This dataset offers a rich foundation of data for future studies on DFBDs. 
 Debris flows, as a special kind of landslide, often block rivers to form barrier dams and trigger a series of disasters such as upstream aggradation and outburst floods. The understanding of debris flow barrier dams (DFBDs) is poor, mostly due to existing studies focusing on individual events and a lack of summarization of multiple DFBD events. The existing global or regional datasets of landslide barrier dams (LDs) contain only a few cases of DFBDs and ignore the differences between DFBDs and other landslide barrier dams (LDs), such as the dams of rock slides, debris avalanches, or earth slides. To fill this gap, we reviewed 2519 high-quality literature and media reports. Focusing on identified debris flow damming events, a rigorous data review and validation process was conducted using Google Earth. A systematic approach was employed to prioritize conflicting information from various data sources. Consequently, a global dataset was compiled, encompassing 555 historical DFBDs from 1800 to 2023.This pioneering global dataset includes 6 categories and 38 attributes, detailing DFBDs. It captures basic information (location, the date of formation, etc.), dam characteristics (height, length, volume, etc.), lake characteristics (area, capacity, length), debris flow characteristics (velocity, discharge, volume, etc.), failure characteristics (peak discharge, loss of life, etc.), and climate characteristics (precipitation and temperature). Our dataset elucidates that DFBDs exhibit key features of instability, complete blockage, and overtopping failure. The number of such dams has notably increased, especially in China. A total of 15 % of channels showed recurrent debris flows, resulting in DFBDs that make up 35 % of all DFBDs. Further analysis suggests that the Ls (AHV) model should be used for priority use, followed by the DBI model, in the stability assessment of DFBDs. Compared to other barrier dam datasets, our dataset is more targeted places greater emphasis on the review of raw data, and stresses the unification of terminology and concepts (i.e., blockage modes and stability), ensuring the consistency and accuracy of the data.

 In cooperation with multiple institutes, the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU) at Utrecht University has operated automated weather stations (AWS) at 19 locations on the Antarctic ice sheet from 1995 through 2022. Besides standard meteorological measurements (pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed & direction), these stations include measured shortwave and longwave radiation components and surface height, thereby allowing for the reliable in situ quantification of the surface energy balance (SEB) and surface mass balance (SMB) at (two-)hourly temporal resolution. This unique dataset can be used for climate model evaluation and development, for the validation of remote sensing products, for the quantification of long term climatological changes, for the interpretation of ice cores, and for process understanding in general.

The potential for DBPs to exacerbate cellular senescence, thereby linking exposure to health impacts, remains underexplored. In this study, MRC-5 cells were exposed to HAMs at concentrations of 2, 5, and 8 μg/L for 30 days to simulate long-term exposure to levels found in drinking water. All six tested HAMs significantly increased the cellular senescence degree and enriched the cellular senescence pathway at the proteomic-wide level. Specifically, HAMs upregulated microRNA-24 expression, which increased p16 mRNA levels and decreased p16 protein levels, thereby activating oncogene-induced senescence pathways. Additionally, HAMs were found to covalently bind to TNRC6A, activating the p53/p21 pathway. Principal component analysis highlighted the critical role of functional groups in activating senescence, and the interaction between HAMs and TNRC6A could extend to at least 27 other amide-containing DBPs. Prolonged exposure to HAMs at environmentally relevant levels notably exacerbates cellular senescence, shedding light on a commonly overlooked phenomenon. Given the widespread presence of DBPs in drinking water and their continuous exposure in humans, their role in cellular senescence represents an ongoing public health concern."

Estimating human exposure to phthalates via biomonitoring is challenging due to their complex metabolic pathways, resulting in a mass-balance gap between internal and external exposure. The relative contributions of the GIT and liver to phthalate metabolism remain underexplored. This study investigated the metabolism of three representative phthalate diesters─dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) in GIT. We first incubated these diesters in simulated stomach and small intestine fluids to identify the primary enzyme responsible for their hydrolysis. The kinetics were further investigated under varying pH conditions (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 or 7.5) to mimic the small intestine environment. Next, using a refined human physiologically based toxicokinetic model, we quantified the relative contributions of preabsorption intestinal versus postabsorption hepatic biotransformation to the body burden of phthalates. Our results suggested that DBP and DEHP were extensively metabolized (>90%) in the GIT by lipase, with comparatively lower hepatic involvement, while DEP underwent minimal preadsorption metabolism (13%) in the GIT, highlighting the influence of structure-dependent differences on metabolic rates. This study emphasized the importance of incorporating both intestinal and hepatic metabolism into toxicokinetic analyses. The findings demonstrate the GIT’s critical role in limiting phthalate bioavailability, underscoring the need to account for the intestinal first-pass effect in toxicokinetic models to enhance predictions of phthalate pharmacokinetics and health impacts."

Once IONSIV is loaded with radioactive species, it is considered waste and requires treatment by incorporation into a stable wasteform to prevent radionuclide release during disposal. This work presents a promising, novel candidate glass-ceramic wasteform based on pollucite for the immobilization of cesium-loaded IONSIV. The tailored glass-ceramic provides chemical and processing flexibility through the addition of small amounts of glass formers, with cesium partitioned predominantly to the more chemically durable ceramic phase. A high waste loading of ∼70–80 wt % was achieved, along with a consistent phase assemblage of pollucite, srilankite, rutile, and glass. The chemical durability of the candidate wasteform was assessed using the ASTM C1285 standard method, with the results indicating high chemical durability relative to other candidate materials for cesium immobilization. A single preferred pollucite glass-ceramic design with a 70 wt % waste loading was selected and validated using unloaded and Cs-loaded IONSIV. Importantly, the design ensures consistent phase formation irrespective of Cs-loading on IONSIV, demonstrating tolerance to accommodate compositional variations in the waste."

Herein, we report the pioneering use of ferritin─self-assembling protein nanocages with porous, hollow structures and supercharged inner surfaces─as a high-efficiency biosorbent for eco-friendly, selective metal recovery from mixtures. Ferritin nanocages adsorbed cobalt (Co2+), nickel (Ni2+), and lithium (Li+) primarily through electrostatic interactions, localizing the adsorbed metal cations within their cavities. Adsorption isotherms indicated significantly more effective adsorption of Co2+ and Ni2+ compared to Li+, enabling efficient Co2+/Ni2+ separation from Li+. Leveraging ferritin’s ability to concentrate adsorbed metal cations within cavities enabled selective recovery of Co2+ as nearly 95% pure solid carbonate salts from Co2+/Li+ mixtures through single-step precipitation under mild conditions, while Li+ remained in solution.

Top-down (TD) methods measure methane emissions from all sources across an entire site and often use BU estimates to attribute emissions specifically to natural gas, often through ethane-to-methane ratio analysis. However, traditional BU methods do not adequately account for variations in throughput and failure conditions, which can significantly impact gas composition and emission rates. The Mechanistic Air Emissions Simulator (MAES) is a computer model developed to estimate methane and other hydrocarbon emissions from oil and gas facilities. MAES employs two distinct modeling approaches: mechanistic models and traditional methods. MAES uses mechanistic models to estimate emissions based on fluid flow through equipment and equipment states, offering a detailed, process-oriented emissions representation. In contrast, the traditional methods utilized by MAES estimate emissions by applying activity data multiplied by emission factor distributions, offering a statistical approach grounded in empirical data. This study applies MAES to assess emission impacts on three vintages of production wellpads in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin: a wellpad with two stages of separation (“old” facility), one with three stages of separation (“current” facility), and a tankless wellpad (“future” facility). The study found that increased throughput led to higher methane emissions in older wellpads but not in tankless future facilities. Additionally, MAES also showed that failure conditions, like stuck dump valves, increased emission rates and affected the ethane-to-methane ratio, which could vary by 2.15 times depending on facility configuration. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating variability in facility operations into emissions estimates to improve accuracy and guide effective mitigation strategies."

In this study, we analyze the spatial distributions of ion cyclotron waves at Io using data from seven close flybys of Io—five by Galileo and two by Juno. We find that the amplitudes of ion cyclotron waves vary from several nT to ∼100 nT. The averaged wave amplitude reaches its peak at ∼2 RI downstream of Io and diminishes significantly with increasing distance from Io. While ion cyclotron waves are primarily observed downstream of Io, they also occur upstream but with much weaker amplitudes. Notably, these waves are absent within Io's Alfvén wings and plasma wake, likely due to the unique plasma environment in these regions. Our findings shed new light on the distribution properties of ion cyclotron waves at Io, which provide key inputs for exploring the interactions between Io and Jupiter."

In this study, we examine 2024s temperature extremes. The mean August temperature stands out as falling outside of the climatological distribution even after accounting for the warming trend. Our findings suggest that 2024s records are a result of an unprecedented combination of persistent atmospheric patterns and interaction with the warming seas.

Seeding TCs using aerosols can be a promising method to reduce cyclone intensity, supported by theoretical understanding of the microphysical effects of aerosols on TC clouds. The ideal time to intervene effectively in TCs is likely during their initial stage, before TC wind speeds reach their peak. However, studies exploring potential aerosol effects on TC formation remain scarce. This study investigates how a TC embryo responds to the addition of aerosols of varying sizes using the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a spectral‐bin microphysics model. We found that aerosols of different sizes and concentrations distinctively affect the pre‐TC vortex's microstructure and dynamics. Fine and ultrafine aerosols enhance the latent heat of condensation, freezing, deposition, and riming, initially intensifying the vortex. However, this results in enhancement of the cold pool, thereby reducing inflow and surface fluxes, subsequently weakening the vortex. Coarse aerosols produce the opposite effect to that of fine and ultrafine aerosols. Coarse aerosols lead to a slower initial acceleration owing to enhanced warm rain. However, the resulting weaker cold pool is insufficient to effectively reduce the strength of the vortex at the later stage. This study provides critical insights into how aerosols of varying sizes and concentrations modulate the energy cascade and impact the evolution of a TC embryo, laying the groundwork for further research on TC risk management through aerosol intervention."

The average global oceanic nitrogen deposition is 40.7 Tg N yr−1, with 78% deposited in the open ocean. Reduced nitrogen (NHx) and oxidized nitrogen (NOy) contribute equally predominantly through wet deposition (62%). Of the total nitrogen deposition to oceans, 39% originates from natural emissions, 33% from fuel combustion including shipping and aviation (11%), and 22% from agricultural activities. Transportation and agriculture are the major contributors in the Northern Hemispheric mid‐high latitude and Coastal biomes, whereas natural emissions are dominant in Trades and Southern Hemispheric biomes. Both wet and dry NOy deposition decreases in the Northern Hemisphere mid‐high latitudes but increases in tropical biomes, whereas NHx shows opposing changes in wet and dry deposition. Anthropogenic emissions drive over 60% of IAVs of oceanic nitrogen deposition except for the NHx deposition over tropical biomes. Changes in anthropogenic emissions from combustion sources not only influence NOy deposition through nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from fuel combustions but also lead to opposing trends in wet and dry NHx deposition due to nonlinear chemistry of secondary inorganic aerosol formations. These findings highlight the need for integrated management strategies targeting multiple pollutants, including NOx, ammonia (NH3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) along with international regulations on shipping and aviation to effectively control nitrogen deposition over the ocean."

Elemental carbon consists of char‐EC and soot‐EC, which differ in mass absorption efficiency (MAE). However, the MAEs of these forms remain underexplored primarily due to the limited methods available for measurement, limiting the accuracy of EC climate impact assessments and leading distortions of EC radiative effect in the temporal and spatial distribution. In this study, we derived MAEs for char‐EC and soot‐EC using combined modeling methods based on observational data, revealing key differences. Soot‐EC generally has higher MAEs than char‐EC, except from biomass burning. Meteorological factors, such as relative humidity, also influence the MAEs of char‐EC and soot‐EC differently. The differences in sources and aging process lead to changes in the mass concentration and MAE of char‐EC and soot‐EC over time. Ignoring these differences can lead to discrepancies in the radiative effect from −9.1% to 18.7%. This study underscores the importance of considering the char‐EC and soot‐EC in accurate EC radiative effect estimates, and implies that optimizing the management of different black carbon emission sources would mitigate global warming to varying extents due to the divergence of the char/soot emission ratio and their MAE."

Seasonal patterns at LLN and DSI reflect distinct influences from different regions. At LLN, daytime photosynthesis reduced CO2, whereas CH4 rose in the afternoon caused by the influences associated with upslope valley breezes. We also observed an enlarging diurnal amplitude of CH4 with a significant large growth rate of 9.2 ppb yr−1 in the afternoon, which was plausibly owing to the intensified upslope winds at LLN. Based on the measurements associated with backward trajectories during nighttime, Southeast Asian biomass burning enhanced 1.5 ppm (+0.4%) of CO2 and 15.4 ppb (+0.8%) of CH4 at LLN in spring.

Their influence evolves throughout the wet season, from October through April. Using a stepwise linear regression and examining individual months, we identify the key drivers for rainfall variability over northwest and northeast Australia. Our research shows that the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), followed by local sea surface temperatures (SSTs), are the key sources of rainfall variability in October and November. More specifically, the Arafura and Coral Sea SSTs contribute to rainfall variability over northwest Australia, while the Coral Sea SSTs strongly impact on northeast Australian rainfall during these months. The combined ENSO and local SST indices explain up to 50% of variance in observed NA spring monthly mean rainfall. However, the SST influence from both seas breaks down with the onset of the Australian summer monsoon in late December, and by January, SST indices explain zero variance in rainfall. Instead, December to March rainfall variability is associated with a wind‐evaporation feedback, which is particularly strong over northwest Australia. The evaporation index is the only predictor that we investigated that can explain any variance in northwest Australian rainfall in January. While the more purely monsoonal northwest of Australia is dominated by variability internal to the monsoon system, rainfall variability in the northeast retains some influence from remote climate drivers throughout the monsoon season. Further research is needed to clarify the processes and timescale involved in the wind‐evaporation feedback."

Here high‐resolution numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the multi‐layer urban canopy model (WRF/BEP, Building Effect Parameterization) are conducted to address this issue with the case of landfalling Typhoon Lekima (2019) over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration. Results show that the WRF/BEP reproduces the typhoon track and intensity reasonably well and the YRD urban agglomeration only slightly influences the typhoon track and intensity. The BEP significantly improves the overestimation and probability distribution of the 10 m wind speed attributed to the explicit representation of building surface drag effect. Urbanization enhances boundary layer vertical ascending and descending motions, aligning with cross‐sectional analyses along urban clusters. During the typhoon primarily influenced period, the attenuation rate of the daytime wind speed due to urbanization at the lowest level reaches 56.6%, which is about 15.5% larger than that during pre‐typhoon or post‐typhoon periods, leading to a more pronounced vertical gradient in near‐surface wind speeds. This is attributed to the almost vanished urban heat island (UHI) effect during the typhoon influenced period, which stabilizes the daytime boundary layer conditions. As a result, the vertical mixing is reduced and consequently the vertical downward transport of momentum to the surface is weakened. This study provides new insights into the importance of the urban land surface processes on regulating the wind structures under tropical cyclone backgrounds."

The impact on primary emissions, that is, NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$, has been vastly studied but its consequences on secondary pollutants, O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ and secondary organic aerosol, have been reported to a lesser degree and the understanding is more limited. One reason is the chronic imbalance in the attention dedicated to volatile organic compounds. In the present study, we report on the evolution of volatile organic compounds under lockdown conditions in Europe by analyzing the concentrations relayed to the Airbase service of the European Environmental Agency. Subsetting was performed to account for human activity and the influence of meteorology. Traffic or urban stations exhibited the most important reduction in benzene and, more substantially, toluene concentrations. Xylenes, trimethylbenzenes, and ethylbenzene also decreased under lockdown conditions, though less when the synoptic conditions were associated with slow flows. Acyclic alkenes evidenced no change or increased slightly, whereas n‐alkanes increased.

Existing studies acknowledge that several environmental, hydroclimatic, socioeconomic, policy, and institutional factors control urban growth, yet key information about its detailed spatial and temporal dynamics is still missing. The ability to reproduce observed patterns of urban expansion is essential for projecting reliable scenarios for the near future. Here we develop a spatially explicit probabilistic modeling framework to describe observed urban expansion dynamics at a regional scale. As a proof of concept, we test our methodology in North‐East China, as it experienced a rapid and sizable urbanization in the last 30 years. We infer the rate of urbanization from urban data and consider 128 different model combinations, aimed at exploring the role played by geomorphic and hydroclimatic drivers, together with the proximity to existing urban areas, in controlling spatial dynamics of urban expansion. Our results show that elevation, terrain slope, distance from rivers and from the sea are the most relevant factors in the considered study area. The fractal size distribution of urban clusters is satisfactorily reproduced by our model, which further confirms its validity. We discuss how our methodology could be a key contribution for analyzing and predicting the spatial dynamics of urban expansion in different regions of the globe.

However, the implementable potential of mCDR and mCS depends, apart from technology readiness, also on site‐specific conditions. In this work, we explore different options for mCDR and mCS, using the German context as a case study. We challenge each option to remove 10 Mt CO2 yr−1, accounting for 8%–22% of projected hard‐to‐abate and residual emissions of Germany in 2045. We focus on the environmental, resource, and infrastructure requirements of individual mCDR and mCS options at specific sites, within the German jurisdiction when possible. This serves as an entry point to discuss main uncertainty factors and research needs beyond technology readiness, and, where possible, cost estimates, expected environmental effects, and monitoring approaches. In total, we describe 10 mCDR and mCS options; four aim at enhancing the chemical carbon uptake of the ocean through alkalinity enhancement, four aim at enhancing blue carbon ecosystems' sink capacity, and two employ geological off‐shore storage. Our results indicate that five out of 10 options would potentially be implementable within German jurisdiction, and three of them could potentially meet the challenge. Our exercise serves as an example on how the creation of more tangible and site‐specific CDR options can provide a basis for the assessment of socio‐economic, ethical, political, and legal aspects for such implementations.

Similarly, VD visits were more likely to have Y codes for industrial area (OR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.98–3.63), farms (OR:7.66, 95% CI: 4.05–14.50), recreation areas (OR:2.25, 95% CI: 1.78–2.84), and streets (OR:1.54, 95% CI: 1.39–1.70), but were less likely to have Y codes for public places (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.94). Similar associations were observed for FEI and AKI ED visits. Locations associated with higher heat risks may be due to exposure outdoor temperature and activities, supporting the need to develop strategies and interventions that minimize heat exposure in these areas."

Here, the authors demonstrate that amorphous nanoparticles, introduced via additive manufacturing, enhance both the tensile strength and fatigue resistance of metallic materials. 
 Nanoparticles or precipitates are long used to block dislocations to strengthen metals. However, this strengthening mechanism unavoidably adds stress concentrations at the obstacles, instigating crack initiation that hampers ductility. Here, we demonstrate a strategy that replaces the traditional crystalline dispersions with dense amorphous nanoparticles, which is made possible via laser powder bed fusion. Porosity-free copper-based nanocomposites are demonstrated as a prototype, consisting of densely and uniformly distributed amorphous boron–carbide nanoparticles (~47 nm in average diameter, up to 12% volume fraction) via an in situ nanofragmentation and melt-quench process. The amorphous nanoparticles act as dislocation sinks, thereby alleviating local stress concentration. They also self-harden along with tensile deformation, promoting strain hardening and therefore homogeneous plastic flow. The as-built composite achieves a tensile strength of more than one gigapascal and a total elongation of approximately 10%, more than twice that of its crystalline dispersion counterpart. Defect accumulation is also suppressed upon cyclic deformation of the as-built bulk nanocomposites, delivering a fatigue strength limit (at > 107 cycles) of more than 70% of the tensile strength. Our results demonstrate an effective strategy for additive manufacturing of metallic materials with superior properties.

 Efficient upcycling of uranyl from uranyl–containing radioactive organic wastewater is of utmost importance for the sustainable development of nuclear energy. In this work, an indirect electrochemical method to upcycle uranyl from radioactive organic wastewater is proposed. A cost-efficient self-standing polyarylether-based covalent organic framework electrode (PAE-COF-AO@CC) not only acts as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but also provides chelating sites for uranyl ions and nucleation center for the following growth of studtite originating from the reaction between H2O2 and chelated uranyl. It’s clarified that the up-take studtite on PAE-COF-AO@CC electrode could transform to high-pure U3O8 after calcinating the permanently used PAE-COF-AO@CC electrode. The ultra-long lifespan of longer than 450 h and the excellent uranyl capacity of 9238.9 mg/g from the continuous accumulation of studtite make the self-standing PAE-COF-AO@CC electrode as promising materials for the uranyl resource upcycling from the complicated organic waste water matrix.

 Advanced geospatial analyses have underscored the effectiveness of Indigenous territories in avoiding deforestation, particularly across the tropics. However, the factors that shape such avoidance and their social-ecological contexts are still poorly understood. By using matching methods coupled with community-based and ethnographic approaches, we offer a contextual measure and understanding of deforestation avoidance of Indigenous territories in Southwestern Amazonia. Our counterfactual analysis of 19 Apurinã territories in Brazil over a 20-year period (2001–2021) in different municipalities showed that, even if Indigenous territories are by no means immune to forest loss, they have avoided significant levels of deforestation. Their effectiveness in mitigating deforestation is largely associated with distinct land-based governance, resilient leadership, as well as temporal perspectives and socio-bioeconomies inclusive to more-than-human beings.

 Climate change threatens the lifeways of Indigenous Peoples, impacting their rights to self-determination and sovereignty. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, Indigenous communities have experienced harvest declines of wild rice (Ojibwemowin: Manoomin; Dakodiapi: Psiŋ; Latin: Zizania palustris), a sacred aquatic plant central to their culture. Here we analyzed 1985–2020 wild rice density and harvest data in relation to key climate variables. Our results indicate that wild rice stem density in the fall is higher in years that have (1) lower early-summer water levels due to decreased precipitation, and (2) longer lake-ice duration due to colder winter temperatures. Overall, wild rice available for tribal harvest off-reservation has declined regionally by ~5–7% annually—declines that are likely to continue due to anthropogenic climate change, specifically increased early-summer precipitation and warmer winters. This decline has infringed on Indigenous lifeways by reducing off-reservation tribal harvest, a right guaranteed by treaties with the U.S. government.

 The terrestrial carbon cycle responds to human activity, ecosystem dynamics, and weather and climate variability including extreme events. Satellite remote sensing has transformed our ability to estimate ecosystem carbon dioxide uptake, the gross primary productivity (GPP), with increasing accuracy and spatial resolution. Many aspects of terrestrial carbon cycling happen quickly on sub-daily or daily scales. These dynamics may not be captured at the temporal scales of typical remote sensing products from polar orbiting satellites – often multiple days or longer. Imagers onboard geostationary satellites measure the Earth system at “hypertemporal” time scales of minutes or less and often have the spectral capabilities to estimate GPP and other surface-atmosphere fluxes using established approaches. Here, we use observations and data products from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellite – R Series (GOES-R) to create ALIVEGPP (Advanced Baseline Imager Live Imaging of Vegetated Ecosystems), a GPP product that provides open data on the native five-minute basis of GOES-R CONUS scenes with latency under one day. Our machine learning model, trained on GPP estimates from 111 eddy covariance flux towers with 276 site-years of data spanning tropical to boreal ecosystems, captures up to 70 % of the observed variability when 20 % of tower sites are withheld, with R2 values of 0.78 (0.82) when aggregating to daily (weekly) periods. We compared ALIVEGPP predictions against eight-day MODIS MOD17A2 GPP estimates and daily GPP estimates from the Breathing Earth System Simulator v2 (BESSv2) and demonstrate how ALIVEGPP simulates the impacts of phenological transitions, flash drought, and hurricanes. Advancements to geostationary satellite imagery, machine learning, and cloud computing make it possible to estimate carbon flux in near real-time and provide new ways to understand the ever-changing carbon cycle and the processes that define it."

 Remote sensing of hyperspectral vegetation reflectance and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is essential for evaluating crop functionality and photosynthetic performance. While primarily applied in monocultures, these tools show promise in diverse cropping systems, enhancing ecological intensification. Plant-plant interactions in such systems can influence key physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, making SIF a valuable tool for evaluating how crop diversity affects photosynthetic function and productivity. However, detecting SIF in diverse stands remains challenging due to uncertainties in light re-absorption and scattering. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid model inversion framework that combines canopy observations with physical modeling to derive leaf biochemical, canopy structural variables, and SIF spectra at leaf and photosystem levels. This approach employs a machine learning retrieval algorithm (MLRA), trained on synthetic spectra from radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations, to quantify re-absorption and scattering effects. Using the SpecFit retrieval algorithm, the temporal evolution of full-spectrum SIF at the canopy level can be derived. To downscale SIF to the photosystem level and retrieve its quantum yield, we corrected the canopy SIF spectrum for re-absorption and scattering effects calculated from TOC reflectance. Spectral measurements were gathered from field experiments conducted over three years, covering various growth stages of cereal and legume monocrops and their mixture. Our method accurately predicts important leaf biochemical and canopy structural variables, such as leaf area (LAI, R2 = 0.75) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, R2 = 0.91), and shows a general high retrieval performance for light absorption (fAPARChl, R2 = 0.99 for the internal model validation). We confirmed the reliability of our method in modeling re-absorption and scattering processes by comparing canopy SIF downscaled to the leaf level with independent leaf-level SIF measurements. While the results show a good prediction accuracy in terms of fluorescence magnitude at the leaf level, we did not find a strong agreement of corresponding leaf and canopy measurements at the single plot level."

Here, we introduce an innovative framework for retrieving global aerosol optical depth (AOD) which named the Aerosol domain-Adaptive Network (AAdaN). The framework utilizes a neural network to estimate mutual information, and aligns spatial covariate shift via a transfer loss term. Then, we assess the retrieval potential in unknown scenarios using independent land cover type, and the proposed model demonstrates satisfactory results. The cross-validation shows strong agreement with in-situ measurements, both in sample-based and site-based evaluations. Specifically, the site-based ten-fold cross-validation of our AOD retrievals indicate that all accuracy metrics are satisfactory, with a Pearson correlation of 0.766 and a Root-Mean-Square Error of 0.118, and that about 76.05 % of the retrievals meet the expected error criteria [±(0.05 + 20 %)]. Additionally, the proposed AAdaN achieves stable, high-accuracy aerosol retrievals across various surface and atmospheric conditions, and can generate spatially continuous AOD distributions. This study significantly improves spatial generalization and offers valuable insights for future model development."

 Ozone (O3) pollution is a pervasive air quality issue, with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly contributing to O3 formation. Utilizing continuous online monitoring data from a chemical park in Shenyang in 2019, we analyzed variations in VOCs, conventional pollutants, and meteorological conditions, preliminarily determining their apparent effects on O3. Results indicated an “M”-shaped monthly average ozone variation, with peaks in summer and troughs in winter, influenced by photochemical reactions and meteorological factors. The daily mean concentrations of alkanes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons in VOCs displayed clear periodicity, with peaks occurring at 5:00–7:00 and 19:00–20:00, and troughs at 14:00–15:00. The monthly mean concentrations exhibited seasonal trends, with higher levels in fall and winter, and lower levels in spring and summer, demonstrating a pattern opposite to that of O3. Using machine learning techniques, we modeled the relationship between key factors and O3 concentration. The results revealed that the optimized Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the highest correlation coefficient and demonstrated the best performance. Using the feature importance method, we identified the key factors most strongly associated with O3 concentration. The optimized model was then employed to examine the variation in O3 concentration across different temperature and humidity conditions. This study provides essential insights for developing effective pollution control strategies and guiding environmental management decisions."

 The Sichuan Basin (SCB), located in Southwest China, often has serious ozone (O3) pollution due to its special topography, complex meteorological conditions and emissions. The frequent occurrence of extreme high temperature has recently aggravated the biogenic O3 precursors emission and the O3 pollution in the SCB. To quantify the O3 pollution caused by high temperature, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used to study the formation mechanism and transport process of the O3 pollution event in the SCB in July 2022, after updating emission information with TROPOMI satellite data and MEGAN model initial data. The results show that during the pollution period, the SCB was affected by the alternating effects of the circulation changes caused by the eastward movement of the northern continental high pressure and the westward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high pressure. The continuous control of the high pressure formed extremely high temperature, which led to the accelerated generation of O3 in the SCB. The southeastern continental high pressure and the northwestern subtropical high pressure converged in the SCB, forming a “zigzag”-shaped circulation, which prevented O3 from being transported out of the SCB. The results of integrated process rate analysis (IPR) show that the negative contribution of horizontal advection accelerates the O3 output from the cities in the middle of the SCB to the surrounding cities, resulting in the rapid spread of pollution over the SCB, the O3 accumulation in the high altitude of the basin, and the positive contribution of chemical generation in the south of the SCB."

 Drought, a widely recognised and far-reaching natural hazard, has a profound impact on the global economy and the environment. This complex phenomenon, characterised by its severity, duration and spatial extent, is central to understanding its multifaceted impacts. Drought indices are an important tool for characterising and monitoring drought conditions. They provide a simplified way to understand the myriad climate factors that play a role. They also provide quantifiable measures for assessing the severity, duration and frequency of climate anomalies. In the Baltic Region, the relationships between meteorological (using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)) and hydrological drought (using the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI)) were analysed and the possibility of using the RDI instead of the SPI was investigated. For each index, accumulation periods of 6, 9 and 12 months were used, analysing data from the period 1961–2020. Our study attempts to investigate the relationships between the SPI, RDI and SDI indices using data from specific hydrometeorological stations across the Baltic Region, highlighting differences between four delineated sub-regions. For most accumulation periods in the northern sub-regions, SDI showed a better relationship to SPI than RDI. However, in the southwestern sub-region for late summer and early autumn and in the southeastern sub-region for long accumulation periods, RDI showed a better relationship with SDI. This pattern reveals the limitation of the RDI index in cold climate zones and its threshold could be defined as the northern boundary of the southern sub-regions. The study shows that the drought indices in the Baltic Region serve as valuable tools to characterise drought conditions and facilitate the assessment of the spatial and temporal characteristics and severity of drought."
