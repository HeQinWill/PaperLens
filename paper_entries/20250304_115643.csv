This current system is linked to the ocean’s vertical overturning circulation, and is thus pivotal to the uptake of heat and CO2 in the ocean. The strength of the ACC has varied substantially across warm and cold climates in Earth’s past, but the exact dynamical drivers of this change remain elusive. This is in part because ocean models have historically been unable to adequately resolve the small-scale processes that control current strength. Here, we assess a global ocean model simulation which resolves such processes to diagnose the impact of changing thermal, haline and wind conditions on the strength of the ACC. Our results show that, by 2050, the strength of the ACC declines by ∼20% for a high-emissions scenario. This decline is driven by meltwater from ice shelves around Antarctica, which is exported to lower latitudes via the Antarctic Intermediate Water. This process weakens the zonal density stratification historically supported by surface temperature gradients, resulting in a slowdown of sub-surface zonal currents. Such a decline in transport, if realised, would have major implications on the global ocean circulation."
10.1088/1748-9326/adb766,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了人为气溶胶对西北太平洋热带气旋强度的影响。研究发现，欧亚大陆不均匀的气溶胶强迫通过改变垂直风切变，从而影响了热带气旋的强度。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术，但气溶胶的监测和分析与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如通过卫星观测和大气成分分析来研究气溶胶的分布和性质。该研究结果对于理解和预测未来热带气旋的变化趋势具有重要意义，并强调了控制东亚气溶胶排放的重要性。,"['aerosol forcing', 'vertical wind shear', 'tropical cyclone intensity', 'atmospheric composition', 'aerosol emissions', 'climate modeling']",Xiaochao Yu;Yadong Lei;Zhili Wang;Dajun Zhao;Yingfang Li;Lin Liu;Bo Wu;Huizheng Che;Xiaoye Zhang,Inhomogeneous aerosol forcing increasing tropical cyclone intensity in western North Pacific by weakening vertical wind shear,"Faced with increasing tropical cyclone (TC) intensity in the western North Pacific (WNP) in recent decades, the simultaneous decrease in vertical wind shear (VWS) has been considered an important contributor. However, anthropogenic contribution to this decreased VWS remains uncertain. Here, we isolate the individual effects of greenhouse gases (GHS), aerosols, natural forcings, and internal climate variability on the decreased VWS over the WNP using multi-model ensemble simulations. We find that Eurasia’s inhomogeneous aerosol forcing triggers a southeastward-propagating wave train from central Europe and a meridional circulation teleconnection over southeastern Eurasia, inducing anomalous westerlies at 200 hPa in the WNP monsoon trough (MT) region. This dominates the weakening of VWS in the MT region, thereby promoting dynamic conditions favorable for increased TC intensity. Given that aerosol emissions in Europe show limited potential for further reduction, future aerosol emissions mitigation in East Asia is expected to intensify VWS over the WNP, thereby dampening the intensification of TC."

Bell,"Chemical characterization of organic vapors from wood, straw, cow dung, and coal burning","Our study analyzes real-time emissions of organic vapors from solid fuel combustion. Using the mass spectrometer, we tested various fuels, finding higher emission factors for organic vapors from wood burning. Intermediate-volatility organic compounds constituted a significant fraction of emissions in solid fuel combustion. Statistical tests identified unique potential markers. Our insights benefit air quality, climate, and health, aiding accurate emission assessments. 
 Solid fuel (SF) combustions, including coal and biomass, are important sources of pollutants in the particle and gas phase and therefore have significant implications for air quality, climate, and human health. In this study, we systematically examined gas-phase emissions, using the Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight (PTR-TOF) mass spectrometer, from a variety of solid fuels, including beech logs, spruce/pine logs, spruce/pine branches and needles, straw, cow dung, and coal. The average emission factors (EFs) for organic vapors ranged from 4.8 to 74.2 g kg−1, depending on the combustion phases and solid fuel types. Despite slight differences in modified combustion efficiency (MCE) for some experiments, increasing EFs for organic vapors were observed with lower MCE. The relative contribution of different classes showed large similarities between the combustion phases in beech logs stove burning, relative to the large change in EFs observed. The CxHyOz family is the most abundant group of the organic vapor emitted from all SF combustion. However, among these SF combustions, a greater contribution of nitrogen-containing species and CxHy families (related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) is observed in the organic vapors from cow dung burning and coal burning, respectively. Intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) constituted a significant fraction of emissions in solid fuel combustion, ranging from 12.6 % to 39.3 %. This was particularly notable in the combustion of spruce/pine branches and needles (39.3 %) and coal (31.1 %). Using the Mann–Whitney U test on the studied fuels, we identified specific potential new markers for these fuels based on the Vocus measurements. The product from pyrolysis of coniferyl-type lignin and the extract of cedar pine needle were identified as markers in the open burning of spruce/pine branches and needles (e.g., C10H14O2, C11H14O2, C10H10O2). The product (C9H12O) from the pyrolysis of beech lignin was identified as the potential new marker for beech log stove burning. Many series of nitrogen-containing homologues (e.g., C10H11–21NO, C12H11–21N, C11H11–23NO, and C15H15–31N) and nitrogen-containing species (e.g., acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, propanenitrile, methylpentanenitrile) were specifically identified in cow dung burning emissions. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 9–12 carbons were identified with significantly higher abundance from coal burning compared to emissions from other studied fuels. The composition of these organic vapors reflects the burned solid fuel types and can help constrain emissions of solid fuel burning in regional models."
10.5194/acp-25-2745-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注科罗拉多河上游流域山区气溶胶的时空变异性。通过SAIL-Net网络，研究人员在不同海拔高度和季节对气溶胶进行了测量，并分析了气溶胶浓度、成分（CCN和INP）以及它们与云相互作用的关系。虽然没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但该研究对于理解山区气溶胶的分布和影响，以及改进相关区域的空气质量模型具有重要意义。因此，可以认为该研究与大气环境遥感技术有间接关联，尤其是在气溶胶成分分析和空气质量监测方面。,"['Aerosols', 'Spatiotemporal variability', 'Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'Ice-nucleating particles (INP)', 'Aerosol-cloud interactions', 'Air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'Atmospheric composition analysis (aerosol specific)']",Leah D.

Levin;Ethan Emerson;Nick Good;Anna Hodshire;Gavin McMeeking;Kate Patterson;Bryan Rainwater;Tom Ramin;Ben Swanson,Measurement report: An investigation of the spatiotemporal variability in aerosols in the mountainous terrain of the upper Colorado River basin using SAIL-Net,"From fall 2021 to summer 2023, SAIL-Net, a network of six aerosol measurement nodes, was deployed in the East River watershed (Colorado, USA) to study aerosol variability across space and time in mountainous terrain. We found that aerosol variability is influenced by elevation differences, with the most representative site in the region changing seasonally, suggesting aerosol spatial variability also varies seasonally. This work offers a blueprint for future studies in other mountainous regions. 
 In the western US and similar topographic regions across the world, precipitation in the mountains is crucial to local and downstream freshwater supplies. Atmospheric aerosols can impact clouds and precipitation by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Previous studies suggest that there is increased aerosol variability in these regions due to their complex terrain, but none of these studies have quantified the extent of this variability. In the fall of 2021, Handix Scientific contributed to the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL), funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and situated in the East River watershed (ERW; Colorado, USA), by deploying SAIL-Net, a novel network of six aerosol measurement nodes spanning the horizontal and vertical domains of SAIL. The ERW is a topographically diverse region, meaning individual measurement sites can miss important observations of aerosol–cloud interactions. Each measurement node included a small particle counter (the Portable Optical Particle Spectrometer – POPS), a miniature CCN counter (CloudPuck), and a filter sampler (the Time-Resolved Aerosol Particle Sampler – TRAPS) for INP analysis. SAIL-Net studied the spatiotemporal variability in aerosols and the usefulness of dense measurement networks in complex terrain. After the project's completion in the summer of 2023, we analyzed the data to explore these topics. We found increased variability compared to a similar study over flat land. This variability was correlated with the elevation of the sites, and the extent of the variability changed seasonally. These data and analyses serve as a valuable resource for continued research into the role of aerosols in the hydrologic cycle and as the foundation for designing measurement networks in complex terrain."
10.5194/acp-25-2725-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注人为排放控制对美国夏季臭氧-温度敏感性的影响。论文利用GEOS-Chem模拟表明，人为氮氧化物排放的减少是臭氧-温度敏感性下降的主要驱动因素。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关。通过分析臭氧浓度与温度的关系，并结合排放数据进行模拟，可以评估空气质量的变化趋势，这与大气环境遥感技术的应用目标一致。GEOS-Chem模式也常用于遥感数据的验证和应用。,"['ozone', 'nitrogen oxide', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'GEOS-Chem simulations']",Shuai Li;Haolin Wang;Xiao Lu,Anthropogenic emission controls reduce summertime ozone–temperature sensitivity in the United States,"Summertime ozone–temperature sensitivity has decreased by 50 % from 3.0 ppbv per K in 1990 to 1.5 ppb per K in 2021 in the US. GEOS-Chem simulations show that anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emission reduction is the dominant driver of ozone–temperature sensitivity decline by influencing both temperature direct and temperature indirect processes. Reduced ozone–temperature sensitivity has decreased ozone enhancement from low to high temperatures by an average of 6.8 ppbv across the US. 
 Ozone–temperature sensitivity is widely used to infer the impact of future climate warming on ozone. However, trends in ozone–temperature sensitivity and possible drivers have remained unclear. Here, we show that the observed summertime surface ozone–temperature sensitivity, defined as the slope of the best-fit line of daily anomalies in ozone versus maximum temperature (mΔO3-ΔTmax), has decreased by 50 % during 1990–2021 in the continental United States (CONUS), with a mean decreasing rate of −0.57 ppbv K−1 per decade (p < 0.01) across 608 monitoring sites. We conduct high-resolution GEOS-Chem simulations in 1995–2017 to interpret the mΔO3-ΔTmax trends and underlying mechanisms in the CONUS. The simulations identify the dominant role of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission reduction in the observed mΔO3-ΔTmax decrease. We find that approximately 76 % of the simulated decline in mΔO3-ΔTmax can be attributed to the temperature indirect effects arising from the shared collinearity of other meteorological effects (such as humidity, ventilation, and transport) on ozone. The remaining portion (24 %) is mostly due to the temperature direct effects, in particular four explicit temperature-dependent processes, including biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, soil NOx emissions, dry deposition, and thermal decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). With reduced anthropogenic NOx emissions, the expected ozone enhancement from temperature-driven BVOC emissions, dry deposition, and PAN decomposition decreases, contributing to the decline in mΔO3-ΔTmax. However, soil NOx emissions increase mΔO3-ΔTmax with anthropogenic NOx emission reduction, indicating an increasing role of soil NOx emissions in shaping the ozone–temperature sensitivity. As indicated by the decreased mΔO3-ΔTmax, model simulations estimate that reduced anthropogenic NOx emissions from 1995 to 2017 have lowered ozone enhancement from low to high temperatures by 6.8 ppbv averaged over the CONUS, significantly reducing the risk of extreme-ozone-pollution events under high temperatures. Our study illustrates the dependency of ozone–temperature sensitivity on anthropogenic emission levels, which should be considered in future ozone mitigation in a warmer climate."

The results suggest that prolonged use of heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low ambient temperatures leads to reduced engine combustion efficiency, which in turn increases tailpipe emissions significantly. 
 The role of intermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs) in heavy-duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) exhaust remains a significant research gap in previous studies, with limited focus on cumulative mileage and ambient temperature effects. This study analyzed gaseous and particulate I/SVOCs from four in-use HDDVs using thermal desorption two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC × GC–MS). The total I/SVOC emission factors (EFs) ranged from 9 to 406 mg km−1, with 79 %–99 % in the gaseous phase. High-mileage vehicles (HMVs) emitted I/SVOCs at levels 8 times greater than low-mileage vehicles (LMVs), highlighting the influence of cumulative mileage. Emission deterioration occurred under both cold-start and hot-running conditions, though HMVs showed no extra sensitivity to cold starts. HMVs also exhibited increasing emissions with component volatility, alongside a higher proportion of oxygenated I/SVOCs (O-I/SVOCs) than LMVs (65 % vs. 42 %). Unique compounds such as phenol, alkenes, and cycloalkanes were detected exclusively in HMV emissions. Temperature effects were most pronounced at 0 °C, where only HMV emissions increased significantly, while LMV emissions remained relatively stable. A strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.93) between I/SVOC EFs and modified combustion efficiency (MCE) suggested that reduced combustion efficiency is a key driver of higher I/SVOC emissions. HMVs also showed 4 times greater secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) compared to LMVs. This increase was smaller than the 8-fold rise in EFs, likely due to the higher O-I/SVOC content in HMV emissions."

 Recent changes in climate and environment, influenced by both global and local factors, have had profound impacts on coastal ecosystem functioning and trajectories. By examining archived samples from ongoing ecological monitoring efforts, particularly focusing on bivalves like mussels and oysters, we gain a valuable long-term perspective on how ecosystems are responding at various scales.

This extensive dataset (https://doi.org/10.17882/100583, Liénart et al., 2024a) offers a comprehensive view spanning multiple decades and ecosystems, allowing us to track how coastal ecosystems and marine species record changing climate, physical-chemical environments, and organic matter cycles. Additionally, these data are crucial for establishing isotope baselines for studying food webs. Ultimately, this dataset provides valuable information for more effective ecosystem conservation and management strategies in our rapidly changing world."

We are proposing an update of our simulation protocol to make the models more applicable to key questions for climate variability and hazard in present-day and future projections and to build links with other communities to provide more robust climate information. 
 Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. Consequently, the role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system continues to be of great interest. Recent simulations suggest the possibility of significant changes in both large-scale aspects of the ocean and atmospheric circulations and in the regional responses to climate change, as well as improvements in representations of small-scale processes and extremes, when resolution is enhanced.The first phase of the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP1) was successful at producing a baseline multi-model assessment of global simulations with model grid spacings of 25–50 km in the atmosphere and 10–25 km in the ocean, a significant increase when compared to models with standard resolutions on the order of 1° that are typically used as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) experiments. In addition to over 250 peer-reviewed manuscripts using the published HighResMIP1 datasets, the results were widely cited in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and were the basis of a variety of derived datasets, including tracked cyclones (both tropical and extratropical), river discharge, storm surge, and impact studies. There were also suggestions from the few ocean eddy-rich coupled simulations that aspects of climate variability and change might be significantly influenced by improved process representation in such models.The compromises that HighResMIP1 made should now be revisited, given the recent major advances in modelling and computing resources. Aspects that will be reconsidered include experimental design and simulation length, complexity, and resolution. In addition, larger ensemble sizes and a wider range of future scenarios would enhance the applicability of HighResMIP.Therefore, we propose the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (HighResMIP2) to improve and extend the previous work, to address new science questions, and to further advance our understanding of the role of horizontal resolution (and hence process representation) in state-of-the-art climate simulations. With further increases in high-performance computing resources and modelling advances, along with the ability to take full advantage of these computational resources, an enhanced investigation of the drivers and consequences of variability and change in both large- and synoptic-scale weather and climate is now possible. With the arrival of global cloud-resolving models (currently run for relatively short timescales), there is also an opportunity to improve links between such models and more traditional CMIP models, with HighResMIP providing a bridge to link understanding between these domains. HighResMIP also aims to link to other CMIP projects and international efforts such as the World Climate Research Program lighthouse activities and various digital twin initiatives. It also has the potential to be used as training and validation data for the fast-evolving machine learning climate models."

The updated model, T&amp;C-CROP, enables applications such as analysing the hydrological and carbon storage impacts of land use transitions (e.g. conversions between crops, forests, and pastures) and optimizing irrigation and fertilization strategies in response to climate change. 
 Cropland cultivation is fundamental to food security and plays a crucial role in the global water, energy, and carbon cycles. However, our understanding of how climate change will impact cropland functions is still limited. This knowledge gap is partly due to the simplifications made in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which often overlook essential agricultural management practices such as irrigation and fertilizer application and simplify critical physiological crop processes.Here, we demonstrate how, with minor, parsimonious enhancements to the TBM T&C, it is possible to accurately represent a complex cropland system. Our modified model, T&C-CROP, incorporates realistic agricultural management practices, including complex crop rotations and irrigation and fertilization regimes, along with their effects on soil biogeochemical cycling. We successfully validate T&C-CROP across four distinct agricultural sites, encompassing diverse cropping systems such as multi-crop rotations, monoculture, and managed grassland.A comprehensive validation of T&C-CROP was conducted, encompassing water, energy, and carbon fluxes; leaf area index (LAI); and organ-specific yields. Our model effectively captured the heterogeneity in daily land surface energy balances across crop sites, achieving coefficients of determination of 0.77, 0.48, and 0.87 for observed versus simulated net radiation (Rn), sensible heat flux (H), and latent heat flux (LE), respectively. Seasonal, crop-specific gross primary production (GPP) was simulated with an average absolute bias of less than 10 %. Peak-season LAI was accurately represented, with an r2 of 0.67.

Field, defines the flux below which the filtration resistance remains constant over time. Notably, this concept, originally for cross-flow filtration, faces challenges in dead-end filtration (the dominant mode used in drinking water ultrafiltration (UF)). Herein, leveraged by regulated membrane biofilms, we proposed a novel biofilm-induced critical flux specific to dead-end filtration. Below this critical flux, the membrane biofilm could act like a cross-flow to maintain mass balances by the biodegradation of foulants, thereby preventing a continuous increase in filtration resistance. Additionally, we demonstrated an optimized strategy to improve the critical flux─backwashing without air scouring, which doubled the critical flux from 6 to 12 L·m–2·h–1. A life cycle analysis revealed that operating at the biofilm-induced critical flux can reduce energy consumption and minimize membrane cleaning, thereby effectively lowering the overall operating costs (52%) and carbon emissions (61%) compared to conventional UF. Sensitivity analysis also indicated that extending membrane life and reducing membrane costs were crucial for lowering overall operating costs, while minimizing fossil energy usage was decisive for reducing carbon emissions. Overall, our study demonstrates that operating at a biofilm-induced critical flux offers a low-maintenance, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable strategy for drinking water UF."

After incubation for 36 h, h-BN nanosheets are taken up by neutrophils, and their structure is highly disrupted, as observed via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and confocal Raman imaging. Among the three degradation pathways, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps from neutrophils is the dominant, with myeloperoxidase (MPO) playing an important role. Molecular dynamics simulations show that MPO spontaneously attach onto h-BN surface, and leverage the active sites of MPO to form favorable contacts with h-BN to initiate the degradation. Hypochlorite produced by MPO is responsible for h-BN degradation. With the assistance of hypochlorite, B–O and N–O bonds are formed on h-BN, along with B–N bond breakage and the release of ionic boron and nitrogen based on byproduct identification and first-principle calculations. Additionally, h-BN nanosheets are significantly degraded into small pieces, and the particle concentration of h-BN with a size of 0–100 nm increases by 58.7% after degradation. Following degradation, h-BN nanosheets induce significant hemolysis of red blood cells, and exhibit higher cytotoxicity against epithelial cells.

This process underpins the long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) following its injection and dissolution in the formation brine of subsurface rock formations, such as saline aquifers. Direct experimental evidence of free solutal convection in porous rocks is to-date still lacking, leaving large uncertainties on the realized rate of CO2 dissolution and its contribution toward storage. Using an analogue solute–solvent pair and 4D X-ray computed tomography, we report direct observations of this mixing process in rock core samples, including sandstones and carbonates. The imagery is used to characterize the mixing structures that arise upon solute dissolution and to quantify differences between the rock types. Thus, we compute the temporal evolution of spatial moments of the concentration distribution to derive practical properties, such as the effective transport velocity of the solute plumes.

Homoaggregation and heteroaggregation were evaluated as a function of CaCl2 (0–100 mM) and natural organic matter (NOM) (50 mg L–1) at a designated concentration of nanoplastics (200 μg L–1). Critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) of nanoplastics were determined in homoaggregation and heteroaggregation experiments with SiO2 and CaCl2. The attachment efficiency (α) was calculated by quantifying the number of nanoplastics in the presence of CaCl2, NOM, and SiO2 using single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) and pseudo-first-order kinetics. The calculated α was fed into the SimpleBox4Plastics model to predict the fate of nanoplastics across air, water, soil, and sediment compartments. Nanoplastics exhibited high stability against homoaggregation, while significant heteroaggregation with SiO2 occurred at CaCl2 concentrations above 100 mM. The influence of NOM was also evaluated, showing a reduction in heteroaggregation with SiO2 for both nanoplastic types. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the degradation half-life of the tested nanoplastics had a more significant impact on persistence than did α. The results emphasize the environmental stability of nanoplastics, particularly in freshwater and soil compartments, and the critical role of NOM and emission pathways in determining their fate."

However, the intricate identification process often results in the underutilization of many mass spectrometry features. Even when chemical structures are identified, their toxicological effects and health outcomes may remain unknown. To address these challenges, this study introduces MSFragTox, a novel approach that leverages the rich fragmentation spectra inherent in high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to directly predict toxicity. This method integrates MS/MS data with high-throughput screening (HTS) assays, focusing on seven endocrine disruption-related endpoints  from Tox21, and uses MS-derived fingerprints: substructure fragmentation probability vectors to construct toxicity predictions using machine learning algorithms. The best model demonstrated robust performance with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.845 on the test set, outperforming models based on traditional molecular fingerprints and descriptors. Additionally, a web client (http://ms.envwind.site:8500) is provided for users to screen toxicity based on chemical MS/MS data. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of commonalities and differences in substructures reveal the mechanisms underlying across toxicity endpoints. Using MSFragTox, we validated the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of substances corresponding to MS/MS from real samples, highlighting the feasibility of directly studying toxicity through MS/MS and its potential applications in risk prediction and early warning for environmental samples."

However, limited Alk-PAHs data have hindered their LRAT characterizations on a global scale. In this study, 49 Alk-PAHs were measured in the atmospheric samples collected across the Western Pacific to the Southern Ocean. The summed concentration of 39 frequently detected Alk-PAHs (Σ39Alk-PAHs) was 25.8 ± 25.3 ng m–3. The concentrations of Σ39Alk-PAHs significantly declined with the decrease in latitude (°N). Higher concentrations (55.8 ± 33.8 ng m–3) were linked to continental air mass compared to oceanic/Antarctica air mass (17.0 ± 13.6 ng m–3), highlighting continental emissions as the primary source of marine atmospheric Alk-PAHs. An unexpected increase in the G/P partitioning ratio (KP) was found in samples farther away from the continent, which cannot be explained by the influence of temperature on the partitioning process. Deposition analysis suggested that gaseous concentrations and the G/P partitioning largely influenced deposition patterns. Hypothetical scenario analysis indicated that increased KP under snowy conditions could enhance the total Alk-PAH deposition. These findings emphasize the need for accurate characterization of partitioning and deposition processes when studying the global fate of Alk-PAHs, particularly in remote and polar regions."

In order to investigate the pollution characteristics of CUPs in a large-scale multimedium environment, a comprehensive and comparative study was conducted on occurrence, spatial-seasonal distribution, and air–soil exchange of CUPs across 30° latitude in Eastern China. A total of 72 target CUPs were detected, and 43 CUPs had a detection frequency over 30% in both air and soil samples. Herbicides, fungicides, and organophosphorus insecticides predominantly exhibited volatilization from soil to air, while pyrethroids exhibited deposition from air to soil. In the high-latitude Northeastern China, the air–soil exchange net flux of CUPs was the lowest due to the lower temperature, especially in winter. Along with decreasing latitude and increasing temperature, the air–soil exchange flux increased, which was significantly influenced by cultivation practices and the usage frequency of CUPs. Therefore, the grasshopper effect driven by temperature difference caused further migration and deposition of CUPs toward higher latitude regions. Moreover, the emission fluxes of CUPs to soil exhibited significant variations closely linked to local climatic conditions and types of crops. In summary, this study obtained valuable baseline information for the pollution characteristics and air–soil exchange of CUPs on a large scale, which also provided a better understanding of the environmental fate of CUPs from the migration perspective."

Here we investigate the potential to improve prediction skill in the North Pacific by identifying predictable patterns of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in climate simulations, and then applying them to observations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is first trained to predict basin‐wide SSTs in the North Pacific on 1–5 year time‐scales in nine global climate models (GCMs), and a pattern of high skill is identified from the GCM data. This pattern of high skill learned from GCMs is then skillfully predicted by the CNN when given observations as inputs. The identified pattern is notably not the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and instead corresponds to basinwide warming and cooling focused in the North Pacific Gyre. We conclude that investigating the mechanisms that contribute to predictability (rather than variability) is an effective avenue for improving near‐term climate predictions."

As global warming and aridification are projected to increase dust emissions, understanding dust‐high cloud interactions becomes increasingly crucial. However, disentangling dust effects from meteorology influences on high clouds remains challenging. This study employs Principal Component Analysis to derive the first principal component (PC1), a comprehensive indicator that characterizes meteorological conditions dominating high cloud evolution. This allows us to classify atmospheric conditions as weak (characterized by weak updrafts, low humidity, and stable atmosphere), moderate, or favorable (strong updrafts, high humidity, and unstable atmosphere). By strictly constraining both meteorological conditions and ice water path, we establish a framework to isolate dust impacts on high cloud. Our results unveil nonlinear dust‐cloud interactions co‐modulated by meteorology and dust loadings, contrary to previously assumed uniformity. Under weak meteorological conditions, dust impacts vary with loadings: low dust loadings promote larger ice crystals and denser clouds, while high dust levels lead to smaller crystals and thinner clouds. However, under favorable meteorological conditions, dust effects become notably weaker and remain relatively consistent across levels. These findings help explain previously conflicting observations of dust impacts on high clouds and highlight why both meteorological conditions and dust levels must be considered when studying dust‐cloud interactions in a changing climate."

This study employs a systematic approach to examine feature co‐occurrences and their relationships to mean and extreme precipitation. Four features are identified using existing data sets for atmospheric rivers (ARs), mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), low‐pressure systems (LPSs), and fronts (FTs). Often, a single atmospheric phenomenon satisfies the criteria set by multiple feature identification algorithms, yielding an association between precipitation and multiple features. Over the extra‐tropics, the number of features attributed to a single event typically increases with precipitation intensity. Over two‐thirds of the precipitation is from co‐occurring features, with a considerable fraction related to AR‐FT co‐occurrences. Over the tropics, about one‐quarter of precipitation is associated with co‐occurring features, with LPS‐MCS co‐occurrences contributing substantially in monsoon regions. MCSs are the leading single‐feature contributors over tropical land and oceans. In the extra‐tropics, FTs, ARs, and their co‐occurrences account for over half of the total precipitation over oceans. AR‐FT‐MCS and FT‐MCS co‐occurrences contribute to extremes (precipitation exceeding the 95th percentile) over both oceans (over 30%) and land (over 20%). Any combination of features involving MCSs shows a larger contribution to high percentiles of precipitation intensity. A case analysis indicates that AR‐FT‐MCS co‐occurrences exhibit convective instability and deep vertical motion, suggesting that the feature trackers and reanalysis are capturing physics relevant to both convective and frontal systems. The results here emphasize the need for simultaneous identifications of multiple features when attributing precipitation to atmospheric phenomena."

Using ERA5 data from 1980 to 2023, we investigated the relationship between winter extratropical storm tracks, atmospheric circulation patterns, and sea ice area (SIA) in three key Arctic regions. We classified the winters into two categories: atmosphere‐driven winters (ADWs), when atmospheric circulation influences sea ice, and ice‐driven winters (IDWs), when sea ice influences atmospheric circulation. This classification was based on the sign of SIA and surface turbulent heat flux anomalies in the Barents‐Kara Sea (BKS), Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, and Labrador Sea (BDL), and Chukchi‐Bering Seas (CBS). Our findings show that in IDWs, reduced SIA has a minor effect on extratropical storm tracks. However, we observed significant midtropospheric cooling over northeastern Asia, aligning with the effects of reduced ice in the BKS during IDWs. This emphasizes the importance of considering the entire tropospheric temperature profile to capture the impact of sea ice loss. In contrast, during ADWs, the BKS and CBS regions experience amplified surface warming and SIA loss due to storm‐induced intrusion of warm and moist air, with sea ice loss in the BKS contributing to strengthening Ural blocking. Although cyclone‐induced heat and moisture intrusion is prevalent, we found no significant trend in track density or mean intensity of positive V extrema in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic, suggesting that changes in atmospheric circulation are unlikely to be the driver of recent sea ice loss in the BKS."

This study examines the future changes in MJO projected by 23 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models that produce a realistic MJO propagation in their historical runs. Results from the multi‐model mean show a ∼17% increase in MJO precipitation amplitude, a ∼11%–14% increase in MJO circulation amplitude, a ∼9% increase in propagation speed, a ∼2‐day decrease in MJO period, and a ∼5° eastward extension. Analysis of the lower tropospheric moisture budget suggests the dominant role of an increased meridional advection of mean moisture caused by the steepening of mean moisture gradient over the Indo‐Pacific warm pool in a warming climate in the majority of models. The enhanced zonal moisture advection plays a secondary or comparable role in some models. The stronger anticyclonic gyres to the east of the MJO convection center along with the enhanced moisture gradient favor an enhanced export of moisture away from the Equator and a local moistening at the flanks of the MJO convection center. This leads to a stronger positive moisture tendency to the east of MJO convection and hence an enhanced eastward MJO propagation with strengthened amplitude and faster speed. As the MJO changes in the future, its relationships with the precipitation and temperature extremes over the western United States (US) are found to change accordingly. The MJO impacts on precipitation tend to be stronger with the stronger MJO amplitude, whereas its impacts on temperature are generally weaker."

Data from three high‐frequency eddy‐covariance systems at a northwest‐facing slope, and at two ridgetops at the south and north valley sidewalls were used for the analysis, and combined with large‐eddy simulations at 90 m horizontal grid spacing. The observed data and simulations focused on a sunny summer day when turbulence was well‐developed, and cross‐ridge flows interacted with thermally driven circulations. The observed TKE time series compared reasonably well with simulations at the northwest‐facing slope and southern ridgetop. The model was then used to evaluate the vertical and horizontal TKE‐budget equation. Analysis of the TKE budget showed that horizontal shear production and advection of TKE driven by horizontal wind‐gradients in cross‐ridge flows, and the interaction of these flows with the up‐valley flow could be an important source of TKE production on the northwest‐facing slope station in the Fortress Valley. The variability observed in TKE budget components across different locations within this high mountain basin indicates the significance of both horizontal and vertical exchange processes in the mechanisms governing TKE production."

While several teleconnection pathways have been identified, accurately measuring these connections and determining the relative contributions of SSTs remains a challenge. We employed a novel causal inference approach to quantify the effects of SSTs on East Asian winter precipitation, focusing on its leading mode (denoted as Pr). Using the PCMCI method, we first derived a causal graph between the Pr and SSTs in the tropical eastern/western Pacific and Indian Ocean (denoted as EP, WP, and IO respectively). Based on the causal graph, we then applied a quantitative analysis using Wright's path method. The results indicated that WP‐SST had the most substantial impact on the Pr, with a 1 Standard Deviation (SD) increase leading to a 0.24 SD decrease in Pr at a 1‐month lag and 0.17 SD decrease at a 2‐month lag. The winter monsoon winds and subtropical jet stream are identified as critical mediators of this effect. Additionally, EP‐SST had a notable positive influence on the Pr, with a 1 SD warming leading to a 0.12 SD increase in Pr at a 2‐month lag, while IO‐SST exhibits a minor effect. It is essential to note that, traditional regression analysis indicates that EP‐SST explained the largest portion of the Pr variance among the three SSTs, but the causal analysis revealed that WP‐SST exerts a more significant role in driving Pr variations, aligning with numerical experiments."

We employ a one‐box model along with a Monte Carlo particle filter technique, explicitly exploring the impact of each isotopic constraints and uncertainties in prior CH4 source and sink parameters on posterior sectorial source fractions. We find our posterior anthropogenic FF emissions at the global scale are 30% lower than previous isotope‐based studies. Our analysis suggests previous δ13C‐CH4‐based studies are potentially biased because the current database‐derived estimate of the global mean biogenic δ13C‐CH4 source signature is too low and/or current sink‐weighted total carbon kinetic isotope effect is underestimated. We find modern atmospheric Δ14C‐CH4 data constrains lower global FF emissions after 1980s, which is contrary to the most recent finding that utilized atmospheric Δ14C‐CH4 data, but supported by an independent estimate of global nuclear 14CH4 emissions. Our multi‐isotopic constraints align with CH4‐only inversion results, while reducing their uncertainties with greater robustness against different prior emission scenarios. We find strong constraints not only on FF emissions but also other key sources and sinks, showing that long‐term multi‐isotopic observations are critical for refining the global CH4 budget and developing effective CH4 emission mitigation strategies."

However, understanding how annual floods may change and impact local vulnerabilities remains limited. Daily precipitation and temperature projections were obtained from five CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) General Circulation Models in the Inter‐Sectoral Model Inter‐Comparison Project (ISIMIP). These were input into a coupled hydrological‐hydraulic model of the Barotse Floodplain, Zambia to obtain data on flood pulse timing, duration, and magnitude. Future decades (2030s, 2050s, 2070s) under three Shared Socio‐Economic Pathways (SSPs 1–2.6, 3–7.0, 5–8.5) were compared with baseline data from the 1990s and 2000s to assess the impact of climate change. Climatic indices were also correlated with flood pulse characteristics to assess whether a driver of changes could be determined. Future floodwaves in the Barotse showed reduced durations and magnitudes, and altered timings of flood rise and recession compared to baseline periods. These differences were significant in the mid‐to far‐future. Large areas of the floodplain experience 1‐to‐2 month reductions in inundation duration, and some areas experienced no inundation in a hydrological year for the first time. The northern Barotse Floodplain, western escarpment, and Luena Valley exhibit the greatest sensitivity to future changes. The Barotse Floodplain will become increasingly arid under all climate scenarios, exacerbating existing challenges for transhumance communities dependent on floods, who face periodic food insecurity, malnutrition, and limited healthcare access. Intensified drought conditions under future climate change will undermine the resilience of local livelihoods, reflecting broader vulnerabilities faced by floodplain‐dependent communities globally."

Drought assessments determine the characteristics, severity, and impacts of a drought. Climate change adds conceptual and quantitative challenges to traditional drought assessments. This paper highlights the challenges of assessing drought in a climate made non‐stationary by human activities or natural variability. To address these challenges, we then identify 10 key research priorities for advancing drought science and improving assessments in a changing climate. The priorities focus on improving drought indicators to account for non‐stationarity, evaluating drought impacts and their trends, addressing regional differences in non‐stationarity, determining the physical drivers of drought and how they are changing, capturing precipitation variability, and understanding the drivers of aridification. Ultimately, improved drought assessments will inform better risk management, adaptation strategies, and planning, especially in areas where climate change significantly alters drought dynamics. This perspective offers a path toward more accurate and effective drought management in a non‐stationary climate system."

Arnold,How Flood Hazards in a Warming Climate Could Be Amplified by Changes in Spatiotemporal Patterns and Mechanisms of Water Available for Runoff,"Prior research on climate change impacts on flooding has primarily focused on changes in extreme rainfall magnitudes, often neglecting snow processes and spatiotemporal storm patterns, such as hyetograph shapes and areal reduction factors (ARFs). This study examines projected changes in extreme water available for runoff (W) events in two snow‐dominated basins in the western United States: the Yakima River Basin (YRB) in Washington State and the Walker River Basin (WRB) spanning the California‐Nevada border. We analyze changes in W magnitudes, mechanisms, hyetograph shapes, and ARFs, and study their compounded impacts on flood hazard. Our findings suggest increased extreme W magnitudes across a large portion of the basins, with steeper or flatter hyetographs, and higher ARF values under the future climate. These changes are driven by a shift from seasonal snowmelt to more rain‐on‐snow events at higher elevations and by increased rainfall at lower elevations. We then use a single event‐based rainfall‐runoff model to estimate flood hazard changes based on extreme W magnitudes, hyetograph shapes, ARFs, and their compounded impacts. Our analysis reveals that focusing solely on the magnitude of changes in extreme W can significantly underestimate future flood hazards and uncertainties. Ignoring future changes in spatiotemporal patterns can underestimate future flood hazards by 63% and underestimate the uncertainty in future flood events by 18% in the WRB. These results underscore the necessity of incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics into future flood hazard assessments to provide a more accurate evaluation of potential impacts."

Bridgham,Can Restoring Tidal Wetlands Reduce Estuarine Nuisance Flooding of Coasts Under Future Sea‐Level Rise?,"Wetland restoration is an increasingly popular nature‐based method for flood risk mitigation in coastal communities. In this study, we present a novel method using hydrodynamic modeling and harmonic analysis to quantify wetlands' ability to reduce future nuisance flooding. The method leverages a hydrodynamic model calibrated to present day data and was run for a range of future sea‐level rise (SLR) and wetland restoration scenarios to quantify changes to tidal harmonic amplitudes and phases. The harmonic constituents are used to generate water surface elevations over a time period of interest (e.g., one year) and compared to critical exceedance thresholds such as levee elevations. Then, changes to nuisance flooding are calculated by counting the number of hours critical thresholds are exceeded under different SLR and wetland restoration scenarios. We applied the method to Coos Bay, Oregon, USA as a test case. We found restoration reduces the number of hours nuisance flooding occurs in downtown Coos Bay from 15 hr (present day conditions) to 0 hr (fully restored condition) under median SLR (82 cm by 2100). Restoration had spatially variable impacts on reducing peak flood elevations with minimal impacts near the estuary mouth and greatest impact 32 km inland. The effectiveness of restoration was heavily dependent on future SLR. Restoration was maximally effective in 2050 under all SLR scenarios, less effective in 2100 under median SLR, and not effective under high SLR. Modeling results suggest increased tidal prism and accommodation space are driving restoration‐associated reductions in tidal amplitudes."

 As the body’s primary source of energy, the maintenance of blood glucose is indispensable for overall health and metabolic homeostasis. It is predominantly regulated by the glucagon receptor family which is highly conserved in vertebrates1–4. Compared to other vertebrates, avian blood glucose levels are relatively high5,6, yet its regulatory mechanisms have remained obscure for more than a century. We show that high hepatic expression of the avian glucagon receptor (GCGR) in association with constitutively active Gs signaling was dependent upon the interaction of different domains. In vivo experiments focusing on the regulation of constitutively active GCGR expression in hepatic cells led to correspondingly high blood glucose, rapid hepatic lipid utilization and high metabolic rates via downstream signaling pathway activation in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Furthermore, we identified a point mutation in chicken at the proximal gene region that resulted in GCGR mRNA reduction and weight increase. Overexpressing a natural human GCGR mutation (hsGCGRH339R) with modest constitutive activity in mice, demonstrated that high level expression of this variant augmented high blood glucose, while reducing body weight. The combination of high expression and constitutive activity of the glucagon receptor may have contributed to the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds."

 Rapid genotype-based drug susceptibility testing for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) relies on a comprehensive knowledgebase of the genetic determinants of resistance. Here we present a catalogue of resistance-associated mutations using a regression-based approach and benchmark it against the 2nd edition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) mutation catalogue. We train multivariate logistic regression models on over 52,000 MTBC isolates to associate binary resistance phenotypes for 15 antitubercular drugs with variants extracted from candidate resistance genes. Regression detects 450/457 (98%) resistance-associated variants identified using the existing method (a.k.a, SOLO method) and grades 221 (29%) more total variants than SOLO. The regression-based catalogue achieves higher sensitivity on average (+3.2 percentage points, pp) than SOLO with smaller average decreases in specificity (−1.0 pp) and positive predictive value (−1.6 pp). Sensitivity gains are highest for ethambutol, clofazimine, streptomycin, and ethionamide as regression graded considerably more resistance-associated variants than SOLO for these drugs. There is no difference between SOLO and regression with regards to meeting the target product profiles set by the WHO for genetic drug susceptibility testing, except for rifampicin, for which regression specificity is below the threshold of 98% at 97%. The regression pipeline also detects isoniazid resistance compensatory mutations in ahpC and variants linked to bedaquiline and aminoglycoside hypersusceptibility. These results inform the continued development of targeted next generation sequencing, whole genome sequencing, and other commercial molecular assays for diagnosing resistance in the MTBC.

 Inclusivity and transparency are the foundations of procedural justice in climate governance. However, concerns persist around the influence of business interest groups at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conferences of Parties (COPs). COPs have increased in size and complexity, obscuring agendas and organizational relationships. Here we analyse the discourse and networks of actors at COP side events from 2003 to 2023 using machine learning-based topic modelling and social network analysis. We trace how discussions on energy, food and forests have evolved. Focusing on energy topics, we show that fossil fuel lobbyists gain COP access through developed-country business non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and developing-country governments. Their nominators focus on renewable energy and system approaches but are peripheral in the anti-fossil fuel discourse which grew from a collaborative network of environmental NGOs. Despite data availability challenges, systematically tracing the inclusivity of COP processes can uncover power dynamics at the highest levels of climate governance.

However, the extent to which these direct and indirect impacts affect vegetation dynamics across cities worldwide and how urban greening will change in the future remain unclear. Using satellite-based greenness and impervious surface datasets, we show that positive indirect impacts mitigated 56.85% of the negative direct impacts across 4,718 cities worldwide from 2000 to 2019. Notably, the offsetting coefficient is much greater in Global North cities (79.13%) than in Global South cities (38.01%) partly due to their socioeconomic differences. This disparity in urban greening dynamics will continue in the future. Approximately 60% of Global North cities and 30% of Global South cities will become greener by 2040. Our results reveal the divergent trade-offs between vegetation loss and enhanced vegetation growth in cities of different socioeconomic levels and stages of urbanization. Such insights are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of urban greening dynamics and for devising strategies to attain sustainable development goals. Understanding the urbanization-driven vegetation dynamics is currently limited but would be important knowledge to guide sustainable urban development. This study explores such impacts across 4,718 cities worldwide and reveals divergent dynamics of vegetation loss and urban vegetation growth."

The authors show that polymeric flame retardants break down in the environment into small toxic molecules that can pose environmental hazards. 
 The industrial use of monomeric halogenated flame retardants has now gradually been phased out due to their toxicity to humans and ecosystems. Polymeric flame retardants are emerging as a ‘safe’ alternative and so have a high production and consumption volume. However, the environmental fate and toxicity of their derivatives remain unknown, making it difficult to understand and adequately manage the associated risk. We take two tetrabromobisphenol A-based polymers (polyTBBPAs) that are widely used in electronics as model flame-retardant chemicals, and we study their behaviour when they break down in the environment and the toxicity of the derivative products. Our results show that polyTBBPAs break down into smaller products in the environment. Using a non-target screening strategy called BrMiner developed by us, we identified 76 breakdown products of polyTBBPAs with molecular weights in the range 400–2,000 Da. These were detected in environmental samples taken from electronic waste recycling facilities in South China. Toxicity tests with zebrafish embryos showed that when they break down in the environment, polyTBBPAs become more toxic, with mitochondrial dysfunction representing a key toxicity mechanism. This study reveals that there are environmental risks associated with polymeric flame retardants, and therefore, their use should be adequately assessed and regulated.

Here the authors report a draw spinning/de-acetylation method to fabricate cellulose fibres that exhibit mechanical strength exceeding that of existing fibre materials. 
 Developing high-performance bio-based fibres is highly desirable for improving the sustainability of materials. Cellulose is one of the most abundant bio-derived feedstocks to fabricate such materials. However, the fabrication of high-strength macro cellulose fibres is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining ordered packing of cellulose molecular chains and nanocrystals in the macro-fibres. Here we develop a draw spinning/de-acetylation method to prepare cellulose fibres with highly ordered molecular packing that incorporates high strength in the obtained fibres. Specifically, a fibre draw spun from well-dispersed cellulose triacetate solution was de-acetylated to generate cellulose fibres, which were then twisted to spirally align the molecular chains. The resulting fibres exhibited mechanical strength of 3.08 GPa and toughness of 215.1 MJ m−3, much higher than existing fibre materials. This work paves the way to obtaining high-performance bio-based fibres.

 Possible existence of dense iron-rich silicate melt layer above Mars’ core is important in understanding the nature and evolution of Mars. However, gravitational stability of iron-rich silicate melt in the Mars’ interior has not been well constrained, due to experimental difficulties in measuring density of iron-rich peridotitic melt. Here we report density measurements of iron-rich peridotitic melts up to 2465 K by using electrostatic levitation furnace at the International Space Station. Our experimentally obtained densities of iron-rich peridotitic melts are markedly higher than those calculated by first principles simulation, and are distinct from those estimated by extrapolating a density model for SiO2-rich basaltic melts. Our determined density model suggests that peridotitic melt with the Fe/(Mg+Fe) ratio more than 0.4-0.5 has higher density than that at the base of the Mars’ mantle, which indicates gravitational stability of the iron-rich peridotitic melt at the core-mantle boundary in Mars.

 Land restoration projects, including reforestation and area protection, are being implemented across African drylands such as the Sahel. In addition to biodiversity, livelihood and carbon sequestration benefits, restoration can also affect the local climate through land-atmosphere interaction. Yet, it remains unknown to what extent dryland restoration can affect cloud cover development and, ultimately, precipitation. Here, we use twenty years of high-resolution data from the Meteosat Second Generation satellite to study the impact of land restoration on cloud development in West African drylands. Results show that cloud cover frequency and convective initiation are higher above vegetated areas, particularly during the start and end of the wet seasons. Furthermore, we find a more pronounced cloud cover enhancement over protected areas larger than 121 km2, suggesting a scale-dependent relationship between project size and cloud cover development.

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), as key oceanic boundary conditions, play a pivotal role in modulating regional climate variability. However, their influence on subseasonal dynamical prediction has yet to be fully understood. Focusing on Central Southwest Asia (CSWA), a region urgently needing accurate subseasonal prediction and significantly influenced by ENSO and IOD, this study investigates whether and how these interannual climate anomalies affect regional subseasonal rainfall prediction skills during early boreal winter using state-of-the-art Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) prediction models. First, the study finds that both deterministic and probabilistic prediction skills for domain-averaged rainfall anomalies and dry/wet events at a 2–4-week lead are significantly enhanced under La Niña and active IOD conditions compared to neutral states, while El Niño conditions show limited enhancement. This asymmetry in the ENSO impact is attributed to the inherent uncertainty in El Niño's influence on CSWA rainfall. Second, the analysis reveals that currently operational models exhibit higher skill in predicting ENSO at a 1-month lead, whereas predictions for IOD are comparatively less accurate. Nonetheless, prediction errors for both strong ENSO and IOD events at a 1-month lead are found to be significantly correlated with rainfall anomaly prediction errors over CSWA during the early boreal winter. This study confirms the significant effect of oceanic boundary conditions on regional subseasonal dynamical predictions and emphasizes the need to improve subseasonal prediction skills related to sea surface temperature variability associated with ENSO and IOD in order to reduce rainfall forecast errors and enhance the reliability of S2S predictions."
