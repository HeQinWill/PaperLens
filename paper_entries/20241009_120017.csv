10.1088/1748-9326/ad77e6,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了亚马逊雨林中反复发生的野火对森林结构和物种组成的影响。研究人员通过对不同火灾频率的森林样地进行调查，发现反复发生的野火导致了森林生物量、树木密度、物种丰富度和物种多样性的显著下降。研究结果表明，反复发生的野火正在将亚马逊雨林转变为以先锋树种为主导的再生森林，并对森林生态系统造成重大负面影响。这篇论文与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，主要关注的是野火对森林生态系统的影响，而非大气成分的监测或分析。,[],Cassio Alves Pereira;Jos Barlow;Marcelo Tabarelli;Andre Luiz Giles;Amanda Estefania de Melo Ferreira;Ima Célia Guimarães Vieira,Recurrent wildfires alter forest structure and community composition of terra firme Amazonian forests,"Wildfires associated with land-use and climate change have considered a key driver to the Amazon forest collapse. However, achieving a detailed understanding of how human-related disturbances impact forest successional trajectories needs comprehensive information spanning forest strata. Here, we investigate the impact of recurrent wildfires on forest structure, species diversity, and composition, making a comprehensive assessment of the regenerating, understory, and canopy tree communities in a sustainable use reserve in the eastern Amazon. Plant communities were described across 16 forest stands (old-growth, burned once and twice) sampling a total of 3620 individuals and 326 tree and palm species. Wildfires affected all attributes of forest structure. Aboveground biomass decreased by 44% in forest burned once, and 71% in twice-burned forest stands. Forest canopy was the most affected strata after the second fire, with a 44%-decrease compared to unburned forest. The same pattern emerged for basal area, which decreased by an average of 27.5% after the first fire and 53.8% following the second fire event. Overall, plant communities experienced a 50%-loss of species richness after two fires, including both dominant and rare species. Plant communities also became more dissimilar as fire events accumulated, with 58%–61% increase in species dissimilarity following two fires events. As wildfires reoccured, the old-growth forests of our focal landscape were converted into a mosaic of regenerating forest stands dominated by local short-lived pioneers (i.e. low-biomass early-regenerating forest stands) and a few tree species less sensitive to fire. Our findings highlight the urgent need to secure a resilient future for Amazonian forests with actions needed to support local livelihoods whilst reducing the prevalence of ignitions sources and allowing forest recovery."

The interlinkage is complex; it makes it difficult to make decisions and requires coordinated and integrated approaches. Policymakers face problems when attempting to identify and implement appropriate policy actions at the nexus of these challenges. This study interrogates the contribution of WEF challenges to HV in Harare to create good policies that can enhance synergies. Data was collected from 314 urban households through questionnaires. In addition, 11 in-depth interviews and one focus group discussion were conducted with the Harare Residents’ Association. The stakeholders interviewed included six city council officials, one representative from UNICEF, two from the World Food Program, and two from the Zimbabwe electricity supply authority. Survey data was analysed using both SPSS Statistics and SPSS AMOS software. While SPSS Statistics was used for descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and inferential tests, SPSS Amos was used for construct validation and structural equation modelling (SEM) path analysis. Interviews were recorded, collated, transcribed, and coded through the summative thematic analysis using QSR NVivo v14. SEM was used to test the proposed relationships between WEF challenges and HV. The findings revealed a positive relationship between the WEF constructs and HV among Harare residents. Socioeconomic factors were also found to have a statistically significant effect on the relationship between Climatic Change and HV. Most climate impacts were found to be water-related, meaning, interventions to address water challenges can boost energy and food production. This will enable policymakers to allocate resources for positive results."

McMurdie;Angela K. Rowe;Andrew J. Heymsfield,Simulated particle evolution within a winter storm: contributions of riming to radar moments and precipitation fallout,"Using a numerical model, the process whereby falling ice crystals accumulate supercooled liquid water droplets is investigated to elucidate its effects on radar-based measurements and surface precipitation. We demonstrate that this process accounted for 55% of the precipitation during a wintertime storm and is uniquely discernable from other ice crystal growth processes in Doppler velocity measurements. These results have implications for measurements from airborne and spaceborne platforms. 
 Remote sensing radars from airborne and spaceborne platforms provide critical observations of clouds to estimate precipitation rates across the globe. The ability of these radars to detect changes in precipitation properties is advanced by Doppler measurements of particle fall speed. Within mixed-phase clouds, precipitation mass and its fall characteristics are especially sensitive to the effects of riming. In this study, we quantified these effects and investigated the distinction of riming from aggregation in Doppler radar vertical profiles using quasi-idealized particle-based model simulations. Observational constraints of a control simulation were determined from airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements collected during the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) for a wintry–mixed precipitation event over the northeastern United States on 4 February 2022. From the upper boundary of a one-dimensional column, particle evolution was simulated through vapor deposition, aggregation, and riming processes, producing realistic Doppler radar profiles. Despite a modest observed amount of supercooled liquid water (0.05 g m−3), riming accounted for 55 % of the ice-phase precipitation mass, cumulatively increasing reflectivity by 44 % and Doppler velocity by 68 %. Independent evaluation of process-based sensitivities showed that, while radar reflectivity is comparably sensitive to either riming- or aggregation-based particle morphology, the Doppler velocity profile is uniquely sensitive to particle density changes during riming. Thus, Doppler velocity profiles advance the diagnosis of riming as a dominant microphysical process in stratiform clouds from single-wavelength radars, which has implications for quantitative constraints of particle properties in remote sensing applications."

It allows automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It has been conceived for subsequent elemental composition analysis (from Na to Pb) by PIXE, but optical techniques may also be applied to measure the Black and Brown Carbon. The combined use with other high temporal resolution instrumentation can provide complete chemical speciation of the aerosol on an hourly basis. 
 The joint use of hourly resolution sampling and analyses with accelerated ion beams such as Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) technique has allowed the measurement of hourly temporal patterns of particulate matter (PM) composition at many sites in different parts of the world. The demand within the scientific community for this type of analysis has been continuously increasing in recent years, but hourly resolution samplers suitable for PIXE analysis are now discontinued and/or suffer from some technical limitations. In this framework, a new hourly sampler, STRAS (Size and Time Resolved Aerosol Sampler), was developed for the collection of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It allows automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples (1 week), it is mechanically robust, compact, and easily transportable. To increase PIXE sensitivity, each sample is concentrated on a small surface area on a polycarbonate membrane. The comparison between the elemental concentrations retrieved by STRAS samples and samples collected using a standard sequential sampler operated in parallel shows a very good agreement; indeed, if both the samplers use the same kind of membrane, the concentrations of all detected elements are in agreement within 10 %."

It has investigated the Arctic middle atmosphere on a climatological basis for 30 years. We discuss major upgrades of the system implemented during recent years, including methods for reliable remote operation of this complex lidar. We also show examples that illustrate the performance of the lidar during measurements at different altitude ranges and timescales. 
 The ALOMAR (Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research)  Rayleigh/Mie/Raman (RMR) lidar is an active remote sensing instrument for investigation of the Arctic middle atmosphere on a routine basis during day and night. It was installed on the island of Andøya in northern Norway (69° N, 16° E) in summer 1994. During the past 30 years of operation, more than 20 200 h of atmospheric data have been measured, approximately 60 % thereof during sunlit conditions. At present, the RMR lidar is the only system measuring aerosols, temperature, and horizontal winds simultaneously and during daytime in the middle atmosphere. We report on the current status of the lidar, including major upgrades made during recent years. This involves a new generation of power lasers and new systems for synchronization, data acquisition, and spectral monitoring of each single laser pulse. Lidar measurements benefit significantly from a control system for augmented operation with automated rule-based decisions, which allows complete remote operation of the lidar. This was necessary in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it was impossible to access the lidar from outside Norway for almost 1.5 years. We show examples that illustrate the performance of the RMR lidar in investigating aerosol layers, temperature, and horizontal winds, partly with a time resolution below 1 s."

Based on this database, the evolution of the global vehicle stock over 50 years is analyzed, the dominant emission contributors by vehicle and fuel type are identified, and the age distribution of on-road CO2 emissions is characterized further. 
 Vehicles are among the most important contributors to global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the lack of fuel-, vehicle-type-, and age-specific information about global on-road CO2 emissions in existing datasets, which are available only at the sector level, makes these datasets insufficient for supporting the establishment of emission mitigation strategies. Thus, a fleet turnover model is developed in this study, and CO2 emissions from global on-road vehicles from 1970 to 2020 are estimated for each country. Here, we analyze the evolution of the global vehicle stock over 50 years, identify the dominant emission contributors by vehicle and fuel type, and further characterize the age distribution of on-road CO2 emissions. We find that trucks accounted for less than 5 % of global vehicle ownership but represented more than 20 % of on-road CO2 emissions in 2020. The contribution of diesel vehicles to global on-road CO2 emissions doubled during the 1970–2020 period, driven by the shift in the fuel-type distribution of vehicle ownership. The proportion of CO2 emissions from vehicles in developing countries such as China and India in terms of global emissions from newly registered vehicles significantly increased after 2000, but global CO2 emissions from vehicles that had survived more than 15 years in 2020 still originated mainly from developed countries such as the United States and countries in the European Union.

Therefore, turbidity and water sampling for suspended sediment concentration and sediment deposition are measured. The monitoring spans from May to October, enabling studies on seasonality and its variability over the years, and the dataset covers the whole fjord, including the inner basins in close proximity to the glaciers. 
 Several climate-driven processes take place in the Arctic fjords. These include ice–ocean interactions, biodiversity and ocean circulation pattern changes, and coastal erosion phenomena. Conducting long-term oceanographic monitoring in the Arctic fjords is, therefore, essential for better understanding and predicting global environmental shifts. Here we address this issue by introducing a new hydrographic dataset from Hornsund, a fjord located in the southwestern part of the Svalbard archipelago. Hydrographic properties have been monitored with vertical temperature, salinity and depth profiles in several locations across the Hornsund fjord from 2015 to 2023. From 2016 onward, dissolved oxygen and turbidity data are available for the majority of casts. The dataset contributes to the so far infrequent observations, especially in spring and autumn, and extends the observations, typically concentrated in the central fjord, to the areas adjacent to the tidewater glaciers. Because sediment discharge from glaciers and land is an inseparable part of the glacier–ocean interactions, the suspended sediment concentration in the water column and the daily sedimentation rate adjacent to the tidewater glaciers are monitored with regular water sampling and bottom-moored sediment traps. Here we present the planning and execution of the monitoring campaign from the collection of the data to the postprocessing methods. All datasets are publicly available in the repositories referred to in the “Data availability” section of this paper."

Pinto;Gabriele Messori,A New Database of Extreme European Winter Windstorms,"We created a new, publicly available database of the Top 50 most extreme European winter windstorms from each of four different meteorological input data sets covering the years 1995–2015. We found variability in all aspects of our database, from which storms were included in the Top 50 storms for each input to their spatial variability. We urge users of our database to consider the storms as identified from two or more input sources within our database, where possible. 
 European windstorms pose a significant threat to people, infrastructure and the natural environment. Several windstorms in the recent past have caused substantial damages, and losses associated with extreme windstorms may increase with climate change. Characterizing the footprints of destructive windstorms is thus key to providing quantitative estimates of storm-related economic losses. To that end, we have developed a new, publicly available database of extreme European windstorm footprints for the extended winter season during 1995–2015. In contrast to previously compiled European windstorm databases, we include storm footprints derived from four different data sets, rather than a single source: the ERA5 reanalysis, the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis for Europe, the COSMO-Climate Limited-area Mode regional climate model driven by ERA5 on the EURO-CORDEX domain, and simulation output from the same model but on an enlarged Germany domain with higher horizontal resolution. The database includes both the footprints themselves, expressed as the relative daily maximum wind gusts associated with a storm event, and the daily maximum wind gusts in absolute magnitude associated with the footprints. We derived and included the storm footprints associated with the 50 most extreme storms, or Top50 storms, identified within each of the four input data sets. We applied a consistent methodology, the storm loss index, across input data sets for identifying storm footprints and assessing their severity. This enables a direct comparison between the footprints derived from the different input sources, eases future efforts to extend the time record of the database or to include additional input data sets, and enables assessment of uncertainty in the footprints. Moreover, since we derived the Top50 storms from each input on its native horizontal resolution, the database also allows to characterize the impact that horizontal resolution can have on footprint identification and severity assessment. Our database thus supports both the research community and the insurance industry in exploring the data set and resolution dependence of assessments of extreme storm hazards."

This dataset overcomes the limitations of infrared observations and provides accurate, all-weather PWV data ,spanning all types of land surface. Researchers are expected to leverage it to explore the role of water vapor in weather patterns, refine precipitation forecasting, and validate climate simulations. 
 A global terrestrial precipitable water vapor (PWV) dataset has been developed using observations from the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI) aboard the FY-3 satellite series (FY-3B, FY-3C and FY-3D) spanning 2012 to 2020. The dataset offers twice-daily PWV records at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°, aligned with the ascending and descending orbits of the FY-3 satellites. The dataset was generated using an automated machine learning (ML) model that leverages MWRI-based features characterizing surface conditions and an enhanced Global Position System (GPS) PWV dataset as a reference. Trained on over one million sampling points from more than ten thousand stations worldwide, the model ensures a robust representation of global PWV variations. Independent evaluations against SuomiNet GPS and Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive Version 2 (IGRA2) PWV products yielded root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.47 mm and 3.89 mm, respectively, with RMSE values ranging from 2.90 to 5.49 mm across various surface conditions. The dataset effectively captures both spatial and temporal PWV variations, allowing for precise examination of localized and abrupt changes in water vapor induced by extreme weather events. Representing a significant advancement in global terrestrial PWV monitoring, the MWRI PWV dataset provides an all-weather, high-precision data record that bridges gaps in global coverage of passive microwave-based terrestrial PWV observations.

Here, we investigated the mechanism linking the above three aspects with the dose range relevant to low-level exposure in children. At 0.5 μg/kg bw/day, we found remarkable liver and gut inflammatory responses after 6-week exposure in mice age comparable to humans 7–12 years old. Through antioxidant intervention, we found that ROS played a driver role in macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses induced by DON in the liver and gut. Further bioinformatics analysis uncovered that ER stress-associated protein MAPK7 (ERK5) may bind with AhR to initiate a mitochondrial ROS burst and macrophage M1 polarization. The downstream cellular events of MAPK7-AhR interaction may be mediated by the AhR/STAT3/p-STAT(Ser727) pathway. This mechanism was further supported by DON toxicity mitigation using cyanidin-3-glucoside (C-3-G), which docks to MAPK7 oligomerization region 200–400 aa and disrupts MAPK7-AhR interaction.

However, we identify S2O42– as a new reaction intermediate and find that the currently accepted mechanism does not directly explain observed pH effects. Thus, we develop a new mechanism, which incorporates S2O42– as an intermediate and uses elementary steps to explain the pH dependence of thiosulfate ozonation. The proposed mechanism is tested using a kinetic model benchmarked to the experiments presented here, then compared to literature data. We demonstrate good agreement between the proposed thiosulfate ozonation mechanism and experiments, suggesting that the insights in this paper can be leveraged in wastewater treatment and in understanding potential climate impacts."

These energy sources, often referred to as “clean energy”, generate no operational onsite GHG emissions. They also offer the potential for clean hydrogen production through water electrolysis, presenting a viable solution to create an environmentally friendly alternative energy carrier with the potential to decarbonize industrial processes reliant on hydrogen. To conduct a full life cycle analysis, it is crucial to account for the embodied emissions associated with renewable and nuclear power generation plants as they can significantly impact the GHG emissions linked to hydrogen production and its derived products. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the embodied emissions associated with solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, hydro, and nuclear electricity. We investigated the implications of including plant-embodied emissions in the overall emission estimates of electrolysis hydrogen production and subsequently on the production of synthetic ammonia, methanol, and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) fuels. Results show that average embodied GHG emissions of solar PV, wind, hydro, and nuclear electricity generation in the United States (U.S.) were estimated to be 37, 9.8, 7.2, and 0.3 g CO2 e/kWh, respectively. Life cycle GHG emissions of electrolytic hydrogen produced from solar PV, wind, and hydroelectricity were estimated as 2.1, 0.6, and 0.4 kg of CO2 e/kg of H2, respectively, in contrast to the zero-emissions often used when the embodied emissions in their construction were excluded. Average life cycle emission estimates (CO2 e/kg) of synthetic ammonia, methanol, and FT-fuel from solar PV electricity are increased by 5.5, 16, and 49 times, respectively, compared to the case when embodied emissions are excluded. This change also depends on the local irradiance for solar power, which can result in a further increase of GHG emissions by 35–41% in areas of low irradiance or reduce GHG emissions by 21–25% in areas with higher irradiance."

So far, only a few bacterial isolates were recently found to degrade acesulfame efficiently. In Bosea and Chelatococcus strains, a Mn2+-dependent metallo-β-lactamase-type sulfatase and an amidase signature family enzyme catalyze acesulfame hydrolysis via acetoacetamide-N-sulfonate to acetoacetate. Here, we describe a new acesulfame sulfatase in Shinella strains isolated from wastewater treatment plants in Germany. Their genomes do not encode the Mn2+-dependent sulfatase. Instead, a formylglycine-dependent sulfatase gene was found, together with the acetoacetamide-N-sulfonate amidase gene on a plasmid shared by all known acesulfame-degrading Shinella strains. Heterologous expression, proteomics, and size exclusion chromatography corroborated the physiological function of the Shinella sulfatase in acesulfame hydrolysis. Since both acesulfame sulfatase types are absent in other bacterial genomes or metagenome-assembled genomes, we surveyed 73 tera base pairs of wastewater-associated metagenome raw data sets. Bosea/Chelatococcus sulfatase gene signatures were regularly found from 2013, particularly in North America, Europe, and East Asia, whereas Shinella sulfatase gene signatures were first detected in 2020. Moreover, signatures for the Shinella sulfatase and amidase genes co-occur only in six data sets from China, Finland, and Mexico, suggesting that the Shinella genes were enriched or introduced quite recently in wastewater treatment facilities."

CO2 data can be used to estimate outdoor air change rate (ACH) based on the mass balance principle, which can be further linked to human health, performance, and building energy consumption. This study used a novel machine learning method to automatically segment CO2 concentration time series data into build-up, equilibrium, and decay periods, and then estimated classroom ACH using the corresponding CO2 mass balance equations. This method, applied to 40 classrooms in two mechanically ventilated K-6 schools, generated up to ten ACH estimates per day per classroom. A comparison with ACH calculated using the mechanical ventilation rates with 100% outdoor air reported by the building automation system during the study period reveals a slight underestimation by the decay and build-up methods, while the equilibrium method produced closer estimates. These differences may be attributed to uncertainties in occupancy, activity, CO2 emission rates, and air mixing. This research underscores the potential of leveraging CO2 data for more comprehensive IAQ assessments and highlights the challenges associated with accurately estimating ACH in real-world settings."

Keoleian,Carbon and Energy Footprinting across Archetypes for U.S. Maple Syrup Production,"The production of maple syrup from sap requires extensive processing, which has traditionally led to significant energy inputs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per gallon produced. Technology advancements, e.g., vacuum tubing sap collection systems, reverse osmosis (RO), and electric evaporators have changed the way syrup is produced, resulting in widespread variability in processing equipment and sugar-making operational decisions. This paper evaluates these complex operations through a cradle-to-retail gate carbon footprinting model and by capturing variability in a series of producer archetypes. By isolating energy and emissions impacts, we find that implementing RO has the largest reduction effect on energy (54–77%) and emissions (57–82%), depending on both production size and evaporator fuel (wood, fuel-oil, or electricity). Results also demonstrate the effect of production scale on cumulative energy demand (CED) and emissions per gallon of syrup, with small producers ranging from 333–1,425 MJ/gal and 27–118 kg CO2e/gal (61–90% biogenic on-site) for wood-fired operations and 18–65 kg CO2e/gal for oil-fired operations.

However, next generation risk assessment (NGRA) intends to maximize the use of novel approach methodologies based on in vitro and in silico methods. Therefore, this study describes the development and evaluation of a generic physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for acute exposure to OP pesticides in rats and humans using quantitative structure property relationships and data from published in vitro studies. The models were evaluated using in vivo studies from the literature for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, methyl-parathion, ethyl-parathion, dimethoate, chlorfenvinphos, and profenofos. Evaluation was performed by comparing simulated and in vivo observed time profiles for blood, plasma, or urinary concentrations and other toxicokinetic parameters. Of simulated concentration–time profiles, 87 and 91% were within a 5-fold difference from observed toxicokinetic data from rat and human studies, respectively. Only for dimethyl-organophosphates further refinement of the model is required. It is concluded that the developed generic PBK model provides a new tool to assess species differences in rat and human kinetics of OP pesticides. This approach provides a means to perform NGRA for these compounds and could also be adopted for other classes of compounds."

Here, we use a coupled ocean‐biogeochemical model to investigate differing responses to chlorophyll‐induced solar absorption between Pacific and Atlantic coastal upwelling regions. Chlorophyll‐induced solar absorption leads to colder Pacific coastal upwelling but warmer Atlantic coastal upwelling. In the Pacific, the shading effect of the surface chlorophyll maximum leads to colder subsurface water, which is then upwelled, contributing to cooling. The more stratified upper ocean leads to shallower mixed layer depth, intensifying offshore transport and upwelling. In the Atlantic, the absorption of SR by the subsurface chlorophyll maximum causes warmer and weaker upwelling. The processes described, in turn, trigger positive feedback to ocean biogeochemistry and potentially interact with climate dynamics, underscoring the necessity to incorporate them into Earth system models."

Despite these effects, some materials substantially reduce required injection rates as well as perturbation of stratospheric winds, age of air and stratospheric warming compared to injection of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$, with the most promising results being shown by 150 nm diamond particles.

Previous studies have indicated that the moat width can regulate the interaction between the inner and outer eyewalls and has a salient relationship with the ERC timescale. In this study, a series of sensitivity experiments are carried out to investigate the essential mechanisms resulting in the diversity of the duration of CEs using both simple and full‐physics models. Results reveal that a larger moat can induce stronger inflow under the same inner eyewall intensity by providing a longer distance for air parcels to accelerate in the boundary layer. Thus, there is greater inward absolute vorticity flux to sustain the inner eyewall. Besides, the equivalent potential temperature (θe) budget indicates that the vertical advection and surface flux of moist entropy can overbalance the negative contribution from the horizontal advection and lead to an increasing trend of θe in the inner eyewall. This suggests that the thermodynamic process in the boundary layer is not indispensable to the inner eyewall weakening. It is also found that the contraction rate of the secondary eyewall, which directly influences the moat width, is subject to the activity of outer spiral rainbands. By directly introducing positive wind tendency outside the eyewall and indirectly promoting a vertically tilted eyewall structure, active convection in the outer region will impede or even suspend the contraction of the outer eyewall and hence extend the ERC timescale."

This study investigates the characteristics and mechanisms of extreme precipitation over SSTP from June to September during 2001–2020 using Global Precipitation Measurement satellite observation. The extreme precipitation days are defined as the days with top 5% of regional‐mean daily precipitation over SSTP in this period, which has an average precipitation of 27.2 mm/d. Averaging over the extreme precipitation days, precipitation peaks at an altitude of about 300 m, coinciding with the climatological maximum precipitation, but with a much larger value of 37.2 mm/d than the climatology of 11.9 mm/d. Composite analysis of circulations on extreme days reveals significant circulation anomalies in both the lower and upper troposphere. Specifically, the lower‐tropospheric circulations are characterized by significant westerly anomalies over northern India, and the upper‐tropospheric circulations are characterized by northerly anomalies over the central Tibetan Plateau, which are statistically independent. The lower‐tropospheric westerly anomalies blowing toward SSTP are blocked by the topography, favoring extreme precipitation over SSTP. The upper‐tropospheric northerly anomalies, on the other hand, correspond to anomalous northeasterlies north of SSTP in the middle troposphere and southeasterlies to the south in the lower troposphere, and the convergence of these circulation anomalies favors extreme precipitation over SSTP. Lastly, the lower‐tropospheric westerly and upper‐tropospheric northerly anomalies, respectively, correspond to less precipitation over the South Asian monsoon region and the Tibetan Plateau."

We use natural language processing, based on a new climate hazard taxonomy, to review, identify, and geolocate out of 100 million abstracts those that deal with hydro‐hazards. We find that the spatial distribution of study areas is mostly defined by human activity, national wealth, data availability, and population distribution. Hydro‐hazard events that impact large numbers of people lead to increased research activity, but with a strong disparity between low‐ and high‐income countries. We find that 100 times more people need to be affected by hazards before low‐income countries reach comparable research activity to high‐income countries. This “Wealth over Woe” bias needs to be addressed by enabling and targeting research on hydro‐hazards in highly impacted and under‐researched regions, or in those sufficiently socio‐hydrologically similar.

Furthermore, this study scrutinizes the trajectory of biodiversity credits across 31 provinces spanning from 2000 to 2050, considering 220 distinct scenarios. The findings reveal that China has attained the no net loss (NNL) objective concerning conventional area‐based conservation targets, with forest cover encompassing 27% of the total land area. However, biodiversity credits at the ecosystem level exhibit an escalating trend, with growth rates ranging from 0.73% to 1.0%, while credits at the species level depict a decremental trend, with an approximate growth rate of −0.21%. Under a scenario of moderate growth, projections for the year 2030 indicate that the EEP credit is poised to accrue approximately 4.76E + 20 solar emjoules (sej), the EEN credit is forecasted to accumulate around 1.03E + 21 sej, and the ESH credit is anticipated to decline by 1.46E + 23 sej within the context of the NNL paradigm. These outcomes underscore the necessity of delineating differentiated biodiversity goals, and furnish insights into the dynamics of supply and demand pertaining to biodiversity credits within the ambit of offsetting schemes across the nation."

Hyster,Emergence of a distinct mechanism of C–N bond formation in photoenzymes,"Emergence of a distinct mechanism of C–N bond formation in photoenzymes 
 C–N bond formation is integral to modern chemical synthesis due to the ubiquity of nitrogen heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Alkene hydroamination with unactivated alkenes is an atom economical strategy for constructing these bonds. However, these reactions are challenging to render asymmetric when preparing fully substituted carbon stereocenters. Here, we report a photoenzymatic alkene hydroamination to prepare 2,2-disubstituted pyrrolidines by a Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenase. Five rounds of protein engineering afforded a mutant, providing excellent product yield and stereoselectivity. Unlike related photochemical hydroaminations, which rely on the oxidation of the amine or alkene for C–N bond formation, this work exploits a through-space interaction of a reductively generated benzylic radical and the nitrogen lone pair. This antibonding interaction lowers the oxidation potential of the radical, enabling electron transfer to the flavin cofactor. Experiments indicate that the enzyme microenvironment is essential in enabling a novel C–N bond formation mechanism with no parallel in small molecule catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the substrate in the enzyme active site which further support this hypothesis. This work is a rare example of an emerging mechanism in non-natural biocatalysis, where an enzyme has access to a mechanism that its individual components do not. Our study showcases the potential of enhancing emergent mechanisms using protein engineering to provide unique mechanistic solutions to unanswered challenges in chemical synthesis."

 Water is essential to the formation of intracontinental granites, but its origin remains elusive. Here we address this scientific problem by analyzing D/H isotopes of apatites, hydrous minerals in Jurassic and Early Cretaceous granites and basalts from eastern North China Craton, where water was previously interpreted as derived from subducting slab. Results reveal extremely low δD values in pristine Early Cretaceous granitic (−203‰ to −127‰) and basaltic (−197‰ to −107‰) apatites, contrasting with relatively high δD values (−137‰ to −47‰) in Jurassic granites. Given the depth-dependent D/H isotopic fractionation during slab dehydration and high-water contents in coeval primitive mafic magmas, the Early Cretaceous magma water is attributed to the stagnant slab within the mantle transition zone. Secular change in the depth of water aligns with steepening of subducting Paleo-Pacific plate from Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, demonstrating the potential of apatite H isotopes in tracing water origin in granites and basalts.

Here, authors introduce AF_unmasked, a tool to integrate AF with experimental information to predict large or challenging protein assemblies with high confidence. 
 Since the release of AlphaFold, researchers have actively refined its predictions and attempted to integrate it into existing pipelines for determining protein structures. These efforts have introduced a number of functionalities and optimisations at the latest Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction edition (CASP15), resulting in a marked improvement in the prediction of multimeric protein structures. However, AlphaFold’s capability of predicting large protein complexes is still limited and integrating experimental data in the prediction pipeline is not straightforward. In this study, we introduce AF_unmasked to overcome these limitations. Our results demonstrate that AF_unmasked can integrate experimental information to build larger or hard to predict protein assemblies with high confidence. The resulting predictions can help interpret and augment experimental data. This approach generates high quality (DockQ score > 0.8) structures even when little to no evolutionary information is available and imperfect experimental structures are used as a starting point. AF_unmasked is developed and optimised to fill incomplete experimental structures (structural inpainting), which may provide insights into protein dynamics. In summary, AF_unmasked provides an easy-to-use method that efficiently integrates experiments to predict large protein complexes more confidently.

 Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions were predicted theoretically as the quantum dual to Josephson oscillations. A significant consequence of this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current I, defined via the frequency f of the external signal and the elementary charge e, I = ± n × 2ef, where n is a natural number. Here, we realize this fundamental relation by synchronizing the Bloch oscillations in small Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junctions to sinusoidal drives with frequencies from 1 to 6 GHz and observe dual Shapiro steps up to I ≈ 3 nA. Inspired by today’s voltage standards and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive regime and observe an asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps. This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.

 Reanalysis and satellite data indicate a decreasing precipitation area in recent decades, affecting local water resources and precipitation intensities. We have used CMIP6 simulations to test the hypothesis of a shrinking precipitation area in a warming climate. Our analyses reveal that SSP5-8.5 projections show a robust decrease in the precipitation area between 50 °S and 50 °N, and globally in 75% of the simulations. The new findings support the observed relationship, although to a lesser extent than earlier found in reanalysis and satellite data. We find a poleward shift of precipitation, increasing the daily precipitation area in the Arctic from 18% to 28%. At lower latitudes the precipitation area is reduced due to a decreasing occurrence of precipitation. These changes are related to the expansion of low relative humidity zones in the lower-to-mid troposphere, specifically at the poleward edges of the subtropics."

While the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is recognized as a key factor in modulating interannual precipitation variations in this region, atmospheric internal variability is often as important. Here, through targeted atmospheric model experiments, we identify an intrinsic low-frequency atmospheric mode in the warm pool region during the austral summer, and show that its impact on seasonal rainfall is comparable to ENSO. This mode resembles the horizontal structure of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and may play a role in initiating ENSO as stochastic forcing. We show that this mode is not merely an episodic manifestation of MJO events but primarily arises from barotropic energy conversion aided by positive feedback between convection and circulation."

 The East African Rift is one of Earth’s largest continental landforms. It is recognized as a critical region for understanding hominin evolution yet has also undergone important transformation through ongoing tectonic and volcanic activity. An understanding of the interplay of rift kinematics, magma genesis and geomorphic evolution requires firm geochronology but this has been lacking for much of the East African Rift. Here we present detailed stratigraphic observations and high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages for major volcanic units in the Central Main Ethiopian Rift. Our new data identify a volumetrically major episode of explosive volcanism between circa 3.85–3.42 million years ago, after aproximately 5-million years-long quiescence. Four other pulses followed but with intensity and magnitude declining over time. We suggest that the observed temporal clustering and the pulsatory volcanic activity may have influenced environmental conditions in the area, with possible implications for hominin evolution.

 This research investigates the environmental sustainability of three integrated power cycles: combined geothermal-wind, combined solar-geothermal, and combined solar-wind. Here, a promising solar technology, the perovskite solar cell, is considered and analysed in conjunction with another renewable-based cycle, evaluating 17 scenarios focusing on improving the efficiency and lifespan. Among the base cases, combined solar-wind had the lowest ozone depletion impact, while combined geothermal-wind had the lowest freshwater ecotoxicity and marine ecotoxicity impacts. The study shows that extending the perovskite solar cell lifespan from 3 to 15 years reduces CO2 emissions by 28% for the combined solar-geothermal and 56% for the combined solar-wind scenario. The most sustainable cases in ozone depletion, marine ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, and climate change impacts are combined solar-wind, combined solar-geothermal, and combined geothermal-wind, respectively, among all evaluated scenarios.

 It is widely acknowledged that the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves are increasing worldwide, including the Arctic. However, less attention has been paid to the land area affected by heatwaves. Here, using atmospheric reanalysis and global climate models, we show that the area covered by heatwaves is substantially expanding in the terrestrial Arctic. Compared to the mid-20th century, the total land area affected by severe heatwaves in the Arctic has doubled, the area of extreme heatwaves has tripled, and the area of very extreme heatwaves has quadrupled. Furthermore, climate model projections suggest that the extent of heatwaves will continue to increase in the 21st century, but with large regional differences in heatwave magnitudes due to summer intraseasonal temperature variability. Our findings underscore the growing vulnerability of the Arctic region to extreme heat, potentially leading to severe impacts on both ecosystems and societies.

 The geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine has escalated into international trade sanctions targeting Russia’s energy-related products. Here we combine a global general equilibrium model and an atmospheric source-receptor model to explore the environmental, economic, and public-health effects of varying intensities of trade sanction measures. Our results indicate that the trade-offs between economic development and environmental pressure might not be directly proportional, where one-fifth of global regions (e.g., Russia, China, and Central America) would experience a co-harm situation (e.g., decreased GDP and increased emissions and health risks). Intensifying trade sanction measures would reallocate the burdens of energy production and export to less-developed regions (e.g., Europe and Central Asia), thereby exacerbating the uneven distribution of environmental and health outcomes among regions. The global repercussions of the trade sanctions highlight the necessity of considering the consequences on regions beyond the conflict to formulate desired global initiatives for impact mitigation/adaptation and post-conflict restoration.

 Global warming significantly alters lake ecosystems worldwide. However, the effects of warming at a regional scale are often overlooked due to the scarcity of multidecadal to centennial regional studies. Here, we examined diatom sedimentary records from five lakes on São Miguel Island (Azores archipelago) over the last 170 years. Our analysis using hierarchical generalised additive models revealed an abrupt shift in the island-wide diatom community around 1982 CE, when the Northern Hemisphere temperature exceeded 0.35 °C above the 20th-century mean. This community regime shift resulted in a 27% loss in regional diatom diversity across the Island. Furthermore, previous anthropogenic impacts may have enhanced lakes’ rapid response to warming. These findings highlight the vulnerability of freshwater island ecosystems to climate warming and emphasise the importance of transitioning from local to regional assessments to preserve regional resilience and prevent irreversible damage to these essential freshwater resources and their biodiversity.

 Remote sensing has the potential to dramatically advance river discharge monitoring globally, but precision of primary data (water surface elevation (WSE) and river width) remains a limiting factor. WSE can be measured from altimeters, and river width from imagers, but the measurements historically have not been made concurrently from space. This is changing with the advent of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and is anticipated by the combination of high-resolution commercial imagery and DEMs from ArcticDEM. WSE and width respond to changing flow conditions as modulated by the three-dimensional structure of the river channel bed and banks. The relationship between WSE and width thus increases monotonically and is essentially the hypsometric curve of the river. In this study, we explore how simultaneous measurements of WSE and width, combined with the monotonic nature of the river hypsometric curve, can be used to improve measurements of river discharge. First, we present an algorithm to compute the river hypsometric curve from noisy measurements of WSE and width. Second, we demonstrate a method to compute estimates of WSE and width constrained to the river hypsometric curve, and we analyze the probability distribution function of the hypsometrically constrained WSE and width estimates. Specifically, we show that the variance of width and WSE is reduced by invoking a hypsometric constraint, at the cost of an induced correlation between the WSE and width errors. Third, we show that river discharge estimated with the hypsometrically constrained WSE and width is more precise than that without hypsometric constraint, and we predict the expected reduction in discharge error. Fourth, we look at six example river reaches measured by ArcticDEM. The WSE root mean square error had a median across the six reaches of 39.3 cm, which was improved to 33.4 cm across the six reaches using the hypsometric constraint. The discharge predictions were similarly improved: the constrained height and width produce more accurate discharge estimates for five of the six reaches and show reduced variation among flow laws. With the launch of SWOT, river hypsometry constraints applied to simultaneous measurement of WSE and width will support new discharge estimates globally."

 The wave spectrum describes the distribution of wave energy across frequency and direction. Obtaining wave spectrum information with high accuracy is of great value for oceanographic research and disaster prevention and reduction. Currently, wave spectral data can be obtained from remote sensing observations, global meteorological and climate reanalysis products, and in-situ observations, which exhibit different advantages and limitations in terms of spatio-temporal resolution, accuracy, and data coverage. Fusing these diverse spectral data to complement the advantage of improving the accuracy of wave spectrum is very promising. However, there is still no simple and effective method to fuse the above spectral data. In this study, a multi-source spectral fusion method is developed based on BU-NET, which realizes the integration of ERA5 spectra and SWIM spectra, with buoy spectra as the reference. The results of the systematic evaluation indicate that the fusion spectra alleviate parasitic peaks, address the issue of larger mean energy, and compensate for energy loss due to the cutoff frequency in the SWIM spectra. The fusion spectra also alleviate energy underestimation during high sea states in the ERA5 spectra. Furthermore, the accuracy of the significant wave height, mean wave period, dominant wave period, and dominant wave direction obtained from the fusion spectra is improved. The root mean square errors between these parameters from the fusion spectra and those from buoy spectra are 0.217 m, 0.378 s, 1.599 s, and 33.094°, respectively."

 There is a need to help farmers make decisions to maximize crop yields. Many studies have emerged in recent years using deep learning on remotely sensed images to detect plant diseases, which can be caused by multiple factors such as environmental conditions, genetics or pathogens. This problem can be considered as an anomaly detection task. However, these approaches are often limited by the availability of annotated data or prior knowledge of the existence of an anomaly. In many cases, it is not possible to obtain this information. In this work, we propose an approach that can detect plant anomalies without prior knowledge of their existence, thus overcoming these limitations. To this end, we train a model on an auxiliary prediction task using a dataset composed of samples of normal and abnormal plants. Our proposed method studies the distribution of heatmaps retrieved from an explainability model. Based on the assumptions that the model trained on the auxiliary task is able to extract important plant characteristics, we propose to study how closely the heatmap of a new observation follows the heatmap distribution of a normal dataset. Through the proposed a contrario approach, we derive a score indicating potential anomalies.Experiments show that our approach outperforms reference approaches such as f-AnoGAN and OCSVM on the GrowliFlower and PlantDoc datasets and has competitive performances on the PlantVillage dataset, while not requiring the prior knowledge on the existence of anomalies."

 Soil can release HONO, affecting atmospheric oxidation and tropospheric chemistry processes through the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and nitric oxide (NO) via photolysis.

The average HONO flux was 0.77 ± 0.72 ng N m−2 s−1, displaying a diurnal pattern of higher fluxes during the day and lower fluxes at night, similar to previous flux observations. A strong linear correlation between the HONO flux with the product of NO2 and solar radiation (R2 = 0.90) suggests that surface reactions involving NO2 and sunlight may dominate HONO production from the paddy fields, surpassing microbial activity within the soil.

 Snow plays a critical role in modulating surface energy, water cycles, and climate prediction. Optimizing snow-related parameterizations can enhance the model behaviors in simulating snow-related physical processes and reduce the cold bias observed in winter climate simulations in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, the topographic complexity and wind speed were incorporated into the parameterization of the snow cover fraction (SCF) and newly fallen snow density (SFD) respectively within the Noah with multi-parameterization (Noah-MP) LSM to optimize the simulation of snow-related processes in the mid-latitude regions of East Asia. A control simulation and three sensitivity experiments were conducted to investigate and quantify the effects of topographic complexity and wind speed on the simulation of snow-related processes and land surface temperature (LST) against MODIS products. The results showed that modifications to the two schemes effectively mitigated the overestimation of snow cover and albedo, and alleviated cold biases in the most of study area. The influence of SFD scheme considering wind speed was more pronounced in regions with more snowfall and higher wind speed, while the SCF scheme considering topographic complexity showed a more widespread effect.

 Sandstorm is a disastrous weather phenomenon that often occurs in arid and semi-arid areas, endangering the ecological environment and affecting people's lives and property safety seriously.

The results indicated that ecological, meteorological and geographical factors had dominant impacts on the spatio-temporal variation of sandstorms during 2000–2021, while hydrological and human factors played little role in the long-term variation of sandstorms.

Vegetation coverage, precipitation, surface pressure, surface roughness, and soil moisture content were negatively correlated with sandstorms, while wind speed, friction velocity, evaporation, and soil temperature were positively correlated with sandstorms. Precipitation, runoff, evaporation, soil moisture content, soil temperature, and surface temperature indirectly acted on normalized brightness temperature dust index (NBTDI) and sandstorms by changing soil texture. Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) had direct negative effects on NBTDI, while wind speed 10 m (WS10m), slope of sub-gridscale orography (SOSGO), and forecast surface roughness (FSR) had direct positive effects on NBTDI. This study comprehensively revealed the dominant factors and their driving mechanism of sandstorm weather in the Yellow River Basin since the 21st century, which had practical application value for the prevention of sandstorms."

 Using ERA-Interim reanalysis data and ensemble forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), we explore the roles of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex throughout the life cycle of the 2016 East Asian cold air outbreak (CAO). Our results reveal the distinct roles of the stratosphere in the initiation and intensification stages of this CAO. The occurrence of this CAO was directly related to an exceptionally strong Ural blocking ridge that advected cold air mass toward East Asia. Notably, the strengthening of Ural blocking is largely influenced by the behavior of the stratospheric polar vortex. Specifically, the contraction of the polar vortex toward the western Urals paved the way for reflecting planetary waves originating from the North Atlantic via changing the buoyancy frequency just above the tropopause. The reflected waves converged over the western Urals and acted to strengthen Ural blocking that in turn affected this CAO. Subsequently, an elongation of the polar vortex toward East Asia was observed, leading to a significant descent of the tropopause over East Asia. According to the invertibility theory of potential vorticity, the descending tropopause likely induced a cyclonic anomaly over East Asia, further contributing to the intensification of this CAO. However, the impact of this cyclonic anomaly induced by the polar vortex elongation is relatively limited compared to the influence of Ural blocking. In summary, our study highlights that the geometry of the polar vortex, rather than its strength, is crucial in understanding the stratospheric impacts on the 2016 East Asian CAO."
