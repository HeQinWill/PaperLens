10.5194/acp-25-7111-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了1850年至2014年期间地表臭氧浓度变化的驱动因素以及对人类健康的影响。研究发现，人为排放的氮氧化物（NOx）和全球甲烷（CH4）浓度是导致地表臭氧浓度显著增加的主要原因，进而增加了人类的健康风险。研究使用了CMIP6模型来模拟地表臭氧浓度，并评估了不同因素（包括人为排放、气溶胶、平流层臭氧和气候变化）的影响。此外，研究还计算了长期暴露于高臭氧浓度下导致慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）死亡的归因比例，以此评估对人类健康的风险。研究结果表明，将人为氮氧化物排放量固定在1850年的水平可以消除当前因长期暴露于臭氧而造成的健康风险。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对大气成分（特别是臭氧及其前体物）的关注，以及对空气质量和人类健康影响的评估，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测和大气成分分析）密切相关。遥感数据可以用于验证和补充模型模拟结果，从而更准确地评估臭氧污染及其影响。,"['surface ozone', 'anthropogenic NOx emissions', 'global CH4 concentrations', 'air quality', 'CMIP6 models', 'ozone precursors', 'aerosols', 'health risk assessment', 'attributable fraction', 'COPD', 'stratospheric ozone', 'climate change']",Steven T.

Reddington;Hantao Wang;Putian Zhou;Fiona O'Connor,Drivers of change in peak-season surface  ozone concentrations and impacts on human  health over the historical period (1850–2014),"We assess the drivers behind changes in peak-season surface ozone concentrations and risks to human health between 1850 and 2014. Substantial increases in surface ozone have occurred over this period, resulting in an increased risk to human health, driven mainly by increases in anthropogenic NOx emissions and global CH4 concentrations. Fixing anthropogenic NOx emissions at 1850 values in the near-present-day period can eliminate the risk to human health associated with exposure to surface ozone. 
 Elevated concentrations of ozone at the surface can lead to poor air quality and increased risks to human health. There have been large increases in surface ozone over the historical period associated with socio-economic development. Here, the change in peak-season ozone (OSDMA8) is estimated for the first time using hourly surface ozone output from three CMIP6 models over the 1850 to 2014 period. Additional results are obtained from one model to quantify the impact from different drivers of ozone formation, including anthropogenic emissions of ozone and aerosol precursors, stratospheric ozone, and climate change. The peak-season ozone concentrations are used to calculate the risk to human health, in terms of the attributable fraction metric (the percentage of deaths from COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – associated with long-term exposure to elevated ozone concentrations). OSDMA8 concentrations are simulated to increase by more than 50 % across northern mid-latitude regions over the historical period, mainly driven by increases in anthropogenic emissions of NOx and global CH4 concentrations. Small contributions are made from changes in other anthropogenic precursor emissions (CO and non-CH4 volatile organic compounds; VOCs), aerosols, stratospheric ozone and climate change. The proportion of the global population exposed to OSDMA8 concentrations above the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (32.4 ppb) increased from <20 % in 1855 to >90 % in 2010. This has also increased the risk to human health mortality due to COPD from long-term ozone exposure by up to 20 % across Northern Hemisphere regions in the present day. Like for OSDMA8 concentrations, the drivers of the increase in the ozone health risks are attributed mainly to changes in NOx and global CH4. Fixing anthropogenic NOx emissions at 1850 values can eliminate the risk to human health from long-term ozone exposure in the near-present-day period. Understanding the historical drivers of ozone concentrations and their risk to human health can help to inform the development of future pathways that reduce this risk."

The findings indicate that optimization is necessary for the forthcoming global implementation of an ultra-low-sulfur oil policy. Besides, we find that organic diagnostic markers of hopanes in conjunction with the ratio of octadecanoic to tetradecanoic could be considered potential tracers for heavy fuel oil exhausts. 
 The widespread utilization of low-sulfur fuels in compliance with global sulfur limit regulations has significantly mitigated the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) on ships. However, significant uncertainties still persist regarding the impact on intermediate-volatility/semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs). Therefore, onboard tests of I/SVOCs from three ocean-going vessels (OGVs) and four inland cargo ships (ICSs) with low-sulfur fuels (<0.50 % m/m) in China were carried out in this study. Results showed that the emission factors of total I/SVOCs were 881 ± 487, 1181 ± 421, and 1834 ± 667 mg per kg fuel for OGVs with heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil (MGO), and ICSs with no. 0 diesel, respectively. The transition from low-sulfur-content (<0.50 % m/m) to ultra-low-sulfur-content (<0.10 % m/m) fuels had evidently enhanced the emission factor of I/SVOCs, with unignorable contributions from particle-phase I/SVOCs, thereby further amplifying the secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP). Fuel type, engine type, and operating conditions comprehensively influenced the emission factor level, compositions, and volatility distribution of I/SVOCs. Notably, a substantial proportion of fatty acids had been identified in ship exhausts, necessitating heightened attention. Furthermore, organic diagnostic markers of hopanes, in conjunction with the C18:0-to-C14:0 acid ratio, could be considered potential markers for HFO exhausts. The findings suggest that there is a need to optimize the implementation of a global policy on ultra-low-sulfur oil in the near future."
10.5194/acp-25-7087-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注厄瓜多尔的基多和智利的圣地亚哥这两个城市中，臭氧的生成对于氮氧化物（NOx）和挥发性有机物（VOCs）的敏感性。论文通过化学箱模型模拟了不同条件下臭氧的生成速率，并分析了减少前体化学物质对臭氧形成的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气环境监测和大气成分分析密切相关，因为了解臭氧及其前体物的浓度和变化趋势对于空气质量管理至关重要。因此，该研究可以为利用遥感技术进行城市空气质量监测和模型验证提供参考。,"['ozone production', 'NOx', 'VOCs', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",María Cazorla;Melissa Trujillo;Rodrigo Seguel;Laura Gallardo,"Comparative ozone production sensitivity to NOx and VOCs in Quito, Ecuador, and Santiago, Chile","The current climate and environmental crises impose the need to take actions in cities to curb ozone as a pollutant and a climate forcer. This endeavor is challenging in understudied regions. In this work we analyze how reducing levels of precursor chemicals would affect ozone formation in Quito, Ecuador, and Santiago, Chile. 
 Amid the current climate and environmental crises, cities are being called to reduce levels of atmospheric pollutants that also act as short-lived climate forcers, such as ozone and PM2.5. This endeavor presents new challenges, especially in understudied regions. Here, we use a chemical box model to investigate ozone production sensitivity to NOx and VOCs in Quito, Ecuador, and Santiago, Chile. We present ozone production rates (P(O3)) calculated using VOC measurements taken in Santiago, along with VOC vs. CO linear regressions (LRs), and complement the analysis with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. In Quito, VOC measurements are unavailable. We therefore simulated a range of VOC concentrations using LRs and MC simulations. We modeled P(O3) in March 2021 and for typical conditions per season in 2022. We calculated a range of P(O3) in Quito of 15–50 ppbv h−1 year-round. In Santiago, we found that P(O3) is 23–50 ppbv h−1 in the ozone season (austral summer). Although the P(O3) magnitudes were found to be comparable, Santiago has a well-established ozone season, unlike Quito where concentrations are lower. From sensitivity experiments, alkenes and aromatics contribute 50 % to P(O3) in Santiago and could reach 70 %–90 % in Quito (noon and afternoon). Aldehydes and ketones contribute 30 %–40 % in Santiago and about 20 % in Quito (noon and afternoon). We estimate the isoprene contribution to be 20 % in Santiago and 10 % in Quito. VOC reduction experiments generally lowered P(O3) in both cities. In Santiago, NOx reductions increased the morning P(O3)."
10.5194/acp-25-7071-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用卫星观测数据反演南亚地区人为氨排放量，重点关注氨这种重要的大气成分。研究通过同化红外大气探测干涉仪（IASI）的观测数据，建立了一个氨排放清单，并使用四维集合变分法（4DEnVar）优化排放清单。研究结果通过与其他卫星仪器（如交叉轨道红外探测器CrIS）的观测数据以及地面观测数据（包括氨气和PM2.5浓度）进行验证。该研究对理解南亚地区的氨排放特征，以及为空气质量管理和减排策略的制定具有重要意义。,"['ammonia', 'emission inventory', 'satellite observations', 'IASI', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'emission inversion', 'CrIS', 'PM2.5']",Ji Xia;Yi Zhou;Li Fang;Yingfei Qi;Dehao Li;Hong Liao;Jianbing Jin,South Asia anthropogenic ammonia emission inversion through assimilating IASI observations,"This study established an ammonia emission inventory for South Asia via an assimilation-based inversion system. The posterior emissions, calculated by integrating the anthropogenic inventory and satellite observations, showed significant improvement over the prior. Validation against various measurements supports our results. The study offers a deep understanding of ammonia emissions for policymakers and researchers aiming to develop air quality management and mitigation strategies for South Asia. 
 Ammonia has attracted significant attention due to its pivotal role in the ecosystem and its contribution to the formation of secondary aerosols. Developing an accurate ammonia emission inventory is crucial for simulating atmospheric ammonia levels and quantifying its impacts. However, current inventories are typically constructed via the bottom-up approach and are associated with substantial uncertainties. To address this issue, assimilating observations from satellite instruments for top-down emission inversion has emerged as an effective strategy for optimizing emission inventories. Despite the severity of ammonia pollution in South Asia, research in this context remains very limited. This study aims to estimate ammonia emissions in this region by integrating the prior emission inventory from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) and the columned ammonia concentration retrievals from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI). We employ a newly developed four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar)-based emission inversion system to conduct the calculations, resulting in monthly ammonia emissions for 2019 at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.625°. The annual total estimate for the posterior emission inventory is 12.61 Tg, compared to the prior inventory's 13.32 Tg. Our simulations, driven by the posterior emission inventory, demonstrate superior performance compared to those driven by the prior emission inventory. This performance is validated through comparisons against the IASI observations, the independent column concentration measurements from the advanced satellite instrument Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and the ground concentration observations of ammonia and PM2.5. Additionally, the spatial and temporal characteristics of ammonia emissions in South Asia based on the posterior inventory are analyzed. Notably, emissions there exhibit a “double-peak” seasonal profile, with the maximum in July and the secondary peak in May. This observation differs from the “double-peak” trend suggested by the CEDS prior inventory, which identifies the maximum column concentration in May and a second peak in September. The differences may be attributed to a more accurate representation of regional agricultural practices, such as the timing of fertilizer application and meteorological influences like precipitation and temperature."
10.5194/acp-25-7037-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注含氧化挥发性有机物（OVOCs）的光解速率参数化问题，并将其整合到化学机制中。研究通过建立物种结构与光解频率之间的关系，克服了量子产率数据不足的限制，从而能够估算缺乏实验测量的化合物的光解速率常数。研究结果表明，非HCHO OVOCs，特别是多功能羰基化合物，对自由基的产生有重要贡献。由于OVOCs是大气成分的重要组成部分，并且它们的光解过程直接影响空气质量和大气氧化能力，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测和大气成分分析，具有很强的相关性。,"['oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs)', 'photolysis rates', 'chemical mechanism', 'radical production', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality']",Yuwen Peng;Bin Yuan;Sihang Wang;Xin Song;Zhe Peng;Wenjie Wang;Suxia Yang;Jipeng Qi;Xianjun He;Yibo Huangfu;Xiao-Bing Li;Min Shao,A new parameterization of photolysis rates for oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs),"A structural-based parameterization for the photolysis rates of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) was integrated into an updated chemical mechanism. This method links photolysis rates to species' structure, bypassing limitations of insufficient quantum yield data. Box model results show that non-HCHO OVOCs, particularly multifunctional carbonyl compounds, significantly contribute to radical production, with alkene and aromatic oxidation products playing key roles. 
 Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry, significantly influencing radical production and VOC degradation through photolysis. However, current research on OVOC photolysis is limited by insufficient species coverage in the mechanisms and incomplete understanding from a species-specific perspective. In this study, the photolysis frequencies of 109 OVOCs were compiled into a comprehensive photolysis dataset. Based on their molecular structures, a parameterization for the photolysis frequencies of carbon- and nitrogen-containing OVOCs was developed. By establishing a relationship between species structure and photolysis frequency, this approach avoids the limitation of insufficient quantum yield data, enabling the estimation of photolysis rate constants for compounds lacking experimental measurements. Photolysis frequencies for the dataset species were successfully reproduced with 21 reference values and 10 adjustment coefficients. Using an automated program based on this method, photolysis rate constants for 3039 OVOCs were predicted, and the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3.3.1 chemical mechanism was updated and expanded to include photolysis for 714 additional species. The introduction of the new photolysis mechanism has altered both the concentrations of photodegradable OVOCs and the relative proportions of their removal pathways. Non-HCHO OVOCs, particularly multifunctional species with carbonyl groups, contribute significantly to ROx radical production. At three different sites, non-HCHO OVOC photolysis accounts for 25 %–45 % of ROx production, surpassing HCHO photolysis. The importance of oxidation products from aromatics and alkenes is highlighted, offering new insights into OVOC photolysis from a species-specific perspective."

 Orphaned wells, meaning unplugged and non-producing wells lacking responsible owners, pose a significant and undersampled environmental challenge due to their vast number and unknown associated emissions. We propose, develop and test an alternative method for estimating emissions from orphaned wells using a forced advection sampling technique (FAST) that can overcome many of the limitations in current methods (cost, accuracy, safety). In contrast to existing ambient Gaussian plume methods, our approach uses a fan-generated flow to force advection between the emission source and a point methane (CH4) sensor. The fan flow field is characterized using a colocated sonic anemometer to measure the 3D wind profile generated by the fan. Using time-series measurements of CH4 concentration and wind, a simple estimate of the CH4 emission rate of the source can be inferred. The method was calibrated using outdoor controlled-release experiments and then tested on four orphaned wells in Lufkin, TX, and Osage County, OK. Our results suggest that the FAST method can provide a low-cost, portable, fast and safe alternative to existing methods with reasonable estimates of orphaned well emissions over a range of leak rates below 40 g h−1 and within certain geometric and atmospheric constraints."

However, clouds are transparent and often have tenuous boundaries. We evaluate the effect of this on stereoscopy using numerical simulations. Stereoscopic techniques retrieve a cloud boundary that is ~100 m interior to the true boundary and is smoother, depending on the cloud shape and resolution of the instrument. This error is similar across views, demonstrating the strength of stereoscopy for detecting changes in cloud geometry. 
 Multi-angle stereoscopic methods are a promising means for retrieving high-resolution cloud volumes and their temporal evolution. Stereoscopic retrievals assume that light emerges from localized points on a surface. We assess the errors introduced by this assumption using synthetic measurements at various wavelengths, solar-viewing geometries, and spatial resolutions generated by applying a 3D radiative transfer model to an ensemble of 841 cloud fields in (8 km × 8 km) domains of varying fractional cover, cloud top bumpiness, microphysics, and optical depth. We show that stereoscopic retrievals of cloud top height (CTH) have biases that vary from −175 to +20 m as the cloud edge extinction profile becomes sharper and absorption increases, all when mean visible cloud optical depth is greater than 5 and with little dependence on instrument resolution between 50 and 250 m. Stereo CTH fields are smoother than the ground truth when CTH variability is concentrated at small spatial scales, viewing angles are oblique, and absorption is weak. We attribute this effect to both the smoothing effect of multiple scattering, which is stronger at wavelengths with weak absorption, and the ill-posed nature of the retrieval in the presence of non-uniform CTH over the stereo-matching window. The standard deviation of stereo CTH errors increases from 25 to 200 m as the standard deviation of CTH increases to 200 m over the 8 km × 8 km domain. More than 50 % of stereo retrievals from two different 50 m resolution stereo viewing pairs of (0°, +38°) and (−38°, 0°) are consistent to within 30 m over 500 m × 500 m regions for clouds with a standard deviation of CTH of less than 200 m. We analyzed airborne lidar observations and found that 75 % of shallow cumulus clouds and all stratocumulus clouds have standard deviations of CTH of less than 200 m over 8 km transects. These results support the application of time-differenced stereoscopic cloud top height retrievals for the remote sensing of high-resolution cloud dynamics as well as macrophysics."

With its improved spatial resolution and reliable long-term trends, P-CAME offers valuable support for global emissions modeling, legacy impact studies, and evaluations of the Minamata Convention. 
 Mercury emissions from human activities persist in the environment, posing risks to humans and ecosystem, and are regulated by the Minamata Convention. Understanding historical mercury emissions is critical for explaining their presence in the environment, and a long-term gridded emission inventory is essential for simulation and evaluation. While previous studies have improved the spatial resolution of emission inventories for recent years, few have combined long timescales with high spatial resolutions. Here, we compile a new comprehensive point source database by fusing multiple data sources and integrate it with the previous China Atmospheric Mercury Emission model to develop a long-term gridded emission inventory for China, covering 1978–2021, named P-CAME. By integrating point sources, P-CAME improves the accuracy of gridded emissions, reducing the normalized mean error by 108 % compared to an inventory without point sources for the most recent year of 2021. P-CAME highlights potential pollution hotspots, revealing that 20 % of cumulative emissions originate from just 0.3 % of the grids, primarily in the provinces of Gansu, Yunnan, and Hunan. These areas are dominated by non-ferrous metal smelting or mixed emissions from coal-fired industries and cement production. P-CAME also demonstrates consistency with observed Hg0 (gaseous elemental mercury) concentration trends over the past decade and shows potential to enhance the simulation of atmospheric mercury concentrations in urban areas, though its capacity is still limited by overall model performance. With improvements in terms of spatial distribution accuracy and reliable long-term trends, this updated inventory will provide valuable data support for global emissions modeling, facilitate assessments of mercury cycling and legacy impacts, and aid in the evaluation of the Minamata Convention.

 We present top-down global gridded emissions of NOx for the year 2022. This dataset is constructed from retrievals of tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO2 by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) spaceborne instrument associated with winds and atmospheric composition data from ECMWF reanalyses, using an improved version of a mass-balance atmospheric inversion. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.0625° × 0.0625°, and delivers a detailed overview of the distribution of emissions. It allows the identification of intense area sources, such as cities, and isolated emitters, such as power plants or cement kilns, but does not correctly represent biomass burning. At global level, the emissions obtained are consistent with the EDGARv6.1 bottom-up inventory, although there are differences at regional level, particularly in emerging countries and countries with low observation densities. The emissions of the three largest emitting countries, China, the United States and India, are 6 %, 14 %, and 4% lower than EDGAR estimates, respectively. Uncertainties remain high, and a quantitative analysis of emissions over several averaging periods indicates that averaging emissions uniformly across the year may be sufficient to obtain estimates consistent with annual averages, in regions of the world with high retrieval densities.

Young leaves play a key role in this process, but their efficiency has been difficult to measure at large scales. Using satellite data, we developed a new method to track the seasonal patterns of young leaves’ photosynthetic capacity from 2001 to 2018. Our dataset helps scientists better understand forest growth and how ecosystems respond to climate change. 
 Determining the large-scale RuBisCO carboxylation maximum rate (Vc,max25) in relation to leaf age is essential for evaluating the photosynthetic capacity of canopy leaves in global forests. Young leaves (≤ 180 d), which exhibit higher Vc,max25 compared to old leaves (> 180 d), are key to controlling the seasonality of leaf photosynthetic capacity in tropical and subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests (TEFs). Nevertheless, quantifying the leaf photosynthetic capacities of different ages across TEFs remains challenging, especially when considering continuous temporal variations at continental scales. In this study, we propose a novel methodology that leverages neighborhood pixel analysis with nonlinear least-squares optimization to derive the Vc,max25 of young leaves at 0.25° spatial resolution. This approach utilizes satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) products spanning the period from 2001 to 2018, which were reconstructed using both TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) SIF and MODIS reflectance data (RTSIF). Validations against in situ observations demonstrate that the newly developed Vc,max25 products accurately capture the seasonality of young leaves in South America and subtropical Asia, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.66, and 0.95, respectively. The Vc,max25 of the young leaves simulated from the RTSIF-derived gross primary production (GPP) is effectively correlated (R > 0.51) with that dissolved from the global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)-based SIF (GOSIF) GPP. Furthermore, the gridded Vc,max25 dataset for young leaves successfully detects the green-up regions during the dry seasons in the tropics. Overall, this study presents the first satellite-based Vc,max25 dataset specifically targeting photosynthetically efficient young leaves, providing valuable insights for modeling large-scale photosynthetic dynamics and carbon cycles in TEFs. Herein, we provide the Vc,max25 time series derived from RTSIF GPP as the primary dataset, supplemented by GOSIF-derived and FLUXCOM products.

Using this algorithm, the North Pacific Black Hole Eddy dataset (BHE v1.0) is constructed for the first time, based on satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocity data from January 1, 1993 to May 5, 2023 (Tian et al., https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15597447, 2025a). BHE v1.0 contains 18387 eddies with radius larger than 20 km and lifetimes longer than 4 weeks and captures both the spatial-temporal characteristics and the trajectories of coherent eddies throughout lifetimes. Through the advection of Lagrangian particles in Eulerian eddy, rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices (RCLVs) and BHEs, it is confirmed that BHEs maintain strong material coherence and are able to maintain concentration during their life cycle, preserving their structure without significant filamentation or mixing with surrounding waters. Additionally, approximately 6 % of BHEs, which do not overlap with any RCLVs or Eulerian eddies, are identified and referred to as the Naked Black Hole Eddy and further analyze its coherence through advection. And Transport analysis shows that BHEs induce westward transport about 1.5 Sv, three times weaker than RCLVs, suggesting that they may offer a more accurate estimate of oceanic transport than RCLVs. These finding addresses the existing gap in Black Hole Eddy datasets within the field of oceanography and provides a novel perspective for studying the interactions between coherent eddies and oceanic physical phenomena."

The comprehensive modern pollen dataset covers the full range of climatic gradients across the TP and all vegetation types. The modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating net primary production and annual precipitation. 
 A dataset of pollen extracted from the surface-sediments of lakes with an even spatial distribution is essential for pollen-based reconstructions of past vegetation and climate. We collected 90 lake surface-sediment samples from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) covering major vegetation types. A comprehensive modern pollen dataset is established by integrating our newly obtained modern pollen dataset with previous modern lacustrine pollen datasets, covering the full range of climatic gradients across the TP with mean annual precipitation (Pann) from 97 to 788 mm, mean annual temperature (Tann) -9.09 to 6.93 °C, mean temperature of the coldest month (Mtco) -23.48 to -2.65 °C, and mean temperature of the warmest month (Mtwa) 1.77 to 19.26 °C. Numerical analyses revealed that Pann is the primary climatic determinant for pollen distribution, while net primary production (NPP) is a valuable variable reflecting vegetation conditions. To detect the quantitative relationship between pollen and Pann/NPP, both weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) and random forest algorithm (RF) were employed. The performance of both models suggests that this modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating past NPP and Pann, but RF has a slight advantage with this dataset. This comprehensive modern pollen dataset is considered reliable when reconstructing vegetation and climate from pollen spectra from the central TP, but caution is needed if it is applied to pollen spectra from the marginal regions of the TP and those covering the Last Glacial period, due to poor analogue quality in those cases. The dataset, including site locations, pollen percentages, NPP, and climate data for 90 lakes, is available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC; Tian, 2025; https://doi.org/10.11888/Paleoenv.tpdc.302470)."

In this study, we established CFC-11 emission inventory from coal combustion in China during 2000~2021. We found that CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion exhibited fluctuations and an overall upward trend, peaking in 2016, and Hebei and Shandong provinces had higher emissions. The CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion in the coastal regions might influence the monitored CFC-11 concentrations. 
 The trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emission from its production and use (PAU) has drawn wide attention, while its combustion sources have been overlooked. This study identified CFC-11 emission factors (EFs) as 3.6, 3.2, and 0.025 mg kg⁻1 from the combustion of domestic chunk coal, honeycomb briquette, and coal-fired power plant, respectively. A multi-year (2000~2021) emission inventory of CFC-11 from coal combustion was established in China. Results indicated that its annual emission averaged 233.5 t yr⁻1. It exhibited fluctuations and held an overall upward trend, increasing from accounting for 0.8 % of PAU emissions in 2000 to 9.8 % in 2021, with the peak value appearing in 2016. In Shandong and Hebei provinces with high coal consumption amounts, the CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion increased by approximately 74 % during 2014~2017 compared to 2011~2012. At the Gosan station close to Chinese mainland, CFC-11 emitted from coal combustion in Hebei and Shandong was approximately occupied by ~30 % of its average concentration during January 2016. An additional climate effect of the clean heating and coal-to-electricity policies in China was also observed, with an obvious decrease (2.2×106 t and 3.4×107 t) of CO2-equivalent emission. This study provides substantial evidence of CFC-11 emission from coal combustion and highlights the role of combustion emission under the background of reducing CFC-11 from PAU.

Using the FESOM2.1–REcoM3 model, concentrations of key organic biomolecules were estimated and integrated into the ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 aerosol–climate model. Results highlight the influence of marine biological activity and surface winds on PMOA emissions, with reasonably good agreement with observations improving aerosol representation in the southern oceans. 
 Primary marine organic aerosol (PMOA) contributes significantly to the aerosol loading over remote oceanic regions, where sea spray dominates aerosol production in the lower troposphere, and plays an important role in aerosol–cloud–climate interactions. The sea–atmosphere transfer of organic components depends on their abundance at the ocean surface and their physicochemical characteristics. We introduce a novel approach for representing the ocean concentration of the most abundant organic groups in seawater that are relevant for aerosols. By apportioning the phytoplankton-exuded dissolved organic carbon, modelled in the biogeochemistry model FESOM2.1–REcoM3, three biomolecule groups are computed (dissolved carboxylic acidic containing polysaccharides (PCHO), dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA), and polar lipids (PL)). The transfer of these marine groups to the atmosphere is represented by the OCEANFILMS (Organic Compounds from Ecosystems to Aerosols: Natural Films and Interfaces via Langmuir Molecular Surfactants) parameterization which is implemented in the aerosol–climate model ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 to represent the emission and transport processes in the atmosphere. The concentration of biomolecules in the ocean serves as the bottom boundary condition for the PMOA simulation within the aerosol model. Among the simulated organic groups in seawater, modelled PCHO is the most prevalent, followed by DCAA and PL. Conversely, PL contributes the most to the organic matter in aerosols, given the high air–seawater affinity of lipids compared to the other groups. Biomolecules exhibit minor variations in equatorial waters, whereas strong seasonal patterns are observed towards the polar regions. The global aerosol model simulations indicate that PMOA emission fluxes are primarily influenced by marine biological activity and surface wind conditions. Based on the most comprehensive evaluation to date, the computed levels of biomolecules in the ocean and species-resolved PMOA concentrations are compared with ground-based measurements across the globe. The comparison shows a reasonably good agreement, given the uncertainties in model assumptions and measurements. Model biases in the representation of the marine organic aerosol groups are caused by uncertainties in the aerosol-process representation and the simulated sea salt concentrations. A comparison with a set of long-range in situ aircraft measurements indicates that by including PMOA in the model, the representation of organic aerosols in the southern oceans is significantly improved."

A particular focus was to examine the ultimate fate of HOMs in suspended particles after the completion of gas phase chemistry. The observed dynamics of HOMs, therefore, provides direct insights into the role of condensed-phase chemistry, if any, in modifying their molecular composition. Individual SOA-bound HOMs exhibited remarkably diverse behaviors, and even certain isomers of identical elemental composition appeared to undergo different transformations. A small group of C8–10 and C20 HOMs decayed rapidly in hydrated particles, on a time scale akin to those of organic hydroperoxides. On the other hand, a subset of C12–20 dimers was found to continuously grow in abundance, and the presence of water substantially enhanced their growth rates. This rising trend was well captured by box model simulations that incorporate the kinetics of condensed-phase chemistry, specifically the peroxyhemiacetal formation pathway. The majority of HOMs remained structurally stable across all hydrous and photolytic conditions investigated in this study. This persistence highlights the potential of HOMs as a widespread and sustained source of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere."

Strong correlations were observed between peptide decay rate constants and both solvent-accessible surface areas (SASAs) of methionine residues (Pearson's r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) and SASAs per residue in methionine-lacking peptides (Pearson's r = 0.81, p < 0.0001). A multiple linear regression model fitted using these two independent structural variables accurately predicted peptide decay rate constants in the three viruses (R2 = 0.91 for MS2 peptides, R2 = 0.72 for PhiX174 peptides, and R2 = 0.86 for T4 peptides). Notably, the peptide decay kinetics in viral proteins responsible for host attachment and genome injection better predicted virus resistance than that in other viral proteins.

Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), a widely used novel brominated flame retardant, has raised concerns due to its widespread detection in human tissues. However, its role in chronic liver diseases remains poorly understood. In this study, we established both mouse and liver organoid (LO) models to investigate the impact of TBPH exposure on the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the underlying mechanisms. In a diet-induced NASH mouse model, TBPH exposure significantly enhanced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Lipidomic analysis revealed that TBPH induced dysregulation of phospholipid metabolism, particularly reduced levels of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylserine (PS). Mechanistically, TBPH decreased Mitofusin2 (MFN2) expression, leading to impaired endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria (ER-Mito) contacts, disrupted phospholipid transfer, and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. These alterations triggered both mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and ER stress. Importantly, the activation of MFN2 with the agonist M1 in LOs alleviated TBPH-induced NASH phenotypes by restoring ER-Mito contacts and cellular bioenergetics. Our findings identify TBPH as an environmental risk factor for NASH progression, providing novel insights into the MFN2-mediated ER-Mito contacts in lipid metabolic homeostasis and new perspectives for the health risk evaluation of brominated flame retardants."

However, the impact of Fe–Mn complex minerals from a redox reaction of Fe(II) and birnessite on OC dynamics remains unexplored. Herein, the immobilization and molecular transformation of fulvic acid (FA), mediated by a redox reaction of Fe(II) and birnessite, were investigated at pH 4.0–8.0 with 1–5 mM Fe(II). Higher pH and Fe(II) addition promoted Fe(II) oxidation coupled with the reductive transformation of birnessite. The coupled adsorption–oxidation of FA occurred, and FA sequestration efficiency increased with a decrease in pH and increasing Fe(II) concentrations. Fe(II) oxidation primarily formed ferrihydrite, and a small portion of lepidocrocite and feitknechtite was detected under higher pH and Fe(II) addition conditions. In mineral–organo composites, Fe/Mn–O, Fe–C, edge- and corner-sharing Fe–Fe, and Mn–Mn bonds constituted the coordination environment. FA was associated with Fe–Mn complex minerals to improve its stability, while C in FA distributed within nanopores and thin coaggregates exhibited a higher oxidation state. Compounds with high molecular weight, O/C, and aromatic and unsaturated structures, predominantly composed of lignin, tannin, and condensed hydrocarbons, exhibited stronger binding to Fe–Mn complex minerals under lower pH and higher Fe(II) addition conditions.

Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been a key component in aqueous film-forming foams, extensively used for firefighting in both military and civilian applications, including at oil refineries. During firefighting training, fuels have been historically used to ignite fires, and because of its use in foams, PFOS is often found alongside light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) petroleum hydrocarbons in subsurface soils and groundwater. The film-forming foams contain supersaturated PFOS, and upon contact with LNAPL and soil fluids, PFOS partitions between the phases. This phenomenon is challenging to investigate by using mesoscale approaches. Here, we use molecular-dynamics simulations to study the behavior of supersaturated PFOS, with a focus on micellization and partitioning at LNAPL–water interfaces. We demonstrate that large quantities of PFOS adsorb at LNAPL–water interfaces, suggesting that such interfaces may serve as major retention sites and long-term sources of PFOS contamination. Moreover, we show that both adsorption and micellization are considerably affected by the counterions used (sodium and hydronium). This may suggest a possible avenue for controlling the partitioning process through gaining a better understanding of the effect of water chemistry on PFOS."

We demonstrate that, compared to warming or eutrophication alone, their synergistic interaction amplified N2O flux by 100-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Nutrient loading exerts a dominant control over the regulation of N2O dynamics, surpassing that of warming. Mechanistically, eutrophication elevates substrate availability, while warming enhances microbial utilization thresholds, synergistically escalating N2O emissions. Microbial analyses reveal that nutrient enrichment increases (nirK + nirS)/nosZ and amoA abundance, whereas warming stimulates microbial enzyme activity. These dual stressors collaboratively reshape the microbial community structure, accelerating N2O metabolic rates. In addition, thermal stimulation enhances the gas diffusion coefficient and accelerates the release of N2O from the aqueous phase.

In contrast, fixed in situ measurements calibrated to World Meteorological Organization standards offer high precision continuous data, although with limited spatial coverage due to logistical constraints. This study uses in situ observations from single tower sites in five northeastern United States cities to estimate total urban CH4 emissions using a Bayesian scaling factor framework. Despite limited spatial sampling, the approach yields robust emission estimates consistent with other studies. To explore drivers of variability, the analysis examines correlations between inferred emissions and urban characteristics including population, residential gas usage, and infrastructure. Results show that residential building volume outperforms population as a predictor in some regions, highlighting the importance of infrastructure-specific factors.

Here, we combine data from a pair of pressure gauges deployed on either side of the FC at 27°N with satellite altimetry to extend daily transport estimates and fill gaps in the cable record. We demonstrate that transport estimates based on cross‐stream pressure differences represent a suitable interim substitute for cable‐based measurements, although they are limited by the vertical incoherence of the flow."

In this paper, we conducted laboratory experiments on subsurface cores from the Aquistore project to investigate the influence of heterogeneous porous structures with varying permeabilities on salt precipitation. The results show that due to capillary‐driven transport, salt precipitation primarily occurs at the front end of low‐permeability structures and within high‐permeability structures, consistent with observations in the Aquistore injector.

The observed characteristics of seasonally achieved regional radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) state over the eastern edge of the northwest Pacific region are investigated. The target region exhibits a sharp transition of energy balance from a strong energy‐losing state before summer to a near‐balance state in late summer with a west‐to‐east dry static energy transport. We then define the non‐RCE and RCE periods to derive and contrast the statistics of convective cloud from CloudSat and precipitation events from IMERG data. During the RCE period, upward mass flux and cloud frequency (CF) increase in moist conditions, while downward flux strengthens with the top‐heavy structure and CF at nearly all altitudes decreases in dry conditions. The longwave cloud radiative effect shows a similar change as the CF. The precipitation event of all sizes tends to be suppressed in dry conditions, while only the development of the large‐sized event is more active than during the non‐RCE period in moist conditions. We also found that over 20% of the large‐sized events are associated with tropical cyclones during the RCE period, while the ratio drops to 1.6% during the non‐RCE period. We propose a diagnostic framework by combining the series of analyses to evaluate convection‐circulation coupling under the constraint of regional RCE in global models with various resolution scales."

It is commonly used to anticipate future impacts of climate change on streamflow and is assumed to be constant in time, despite evidence that this relationship varies with climatological and landscape changes. To assess the need for a more flexible definition, we present a large‐sample non‐stationary regional regression approach to estimate long‐term trends and variability in interannual streamflow elasticity to precipitation in the USA. We find that elasticity is highly variable in water‐limited catchments year‐to‐year, indicating high sensitivity to climate variability in arid regions. Statistically significant long‐term trends in elasticity exist in some regions, but trend magnitude is generally small. We demonstrate that a single average estimate of elasticity may be a poor indicator of streamflow sensitivity to climate change. Consideration of the variability of response is essential for elasticity to be a useful hydrologic signature."

 Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of river floods1. Floods not only cause damage by inundation and loss of life2,3 but also jeopardize infrastructure because of bank failure and riverbed erosion processes that are poorly understood. Common flood safety programs include dike reinforcement and river widening4–9. The 2021 flood in the Meuse Basin caused 43 fatalities and a multibillion-dollar damage to infrastructure10. Based on analysis of the Meuse flood, we show how uneven widening of the river and heterogeneity of sediment deposits under the river can cause massive erosion. A recent flood safety program widened the river11, but created bottlenecks where widening was either prevented by infrastructure, or not yet implemented. Riverbed erosion was exacerbated by tectonic uplift that had produced a thin top gravel layer above fine-grained sediment. Greatly enhanced flow velocities produced underwater dunes with troughs that broke through the gravel armour in the bottlenecks, exposing easily erodible sands, resulting in extreme scour holes, one over 15 m deep. Our investigation highlights the challenges of re-engineering rivers in the face of climate change, increased flood risks, competition for river widening space, and calls for a better understanding of the subsurface."

Here we analyse 11,269 predicted and experimentally determined enzyme structures that catalyse 361 metabolic reactions across 225 pathways to investigate metabolic evolution over 400 million years in the Saccharomycotina subphylum2. By linking sequence divergence in structurally conserved regions to a variety of metabolic properties of the enzymes, we reveal that metabolism shapes structural evolution across multiple scales, from species-wide metabolic specialization to network organization and the molecular properties of the enzymes. Although positively selected residues are distributed across various structural elements, enzyme evolution is constrained by reaction mechanisms, interactions with metal ions and inhibitors, metabolic flux variability and biosynthetic cost. Our findings uncover hierarchical patterns of structural evolution, in which structural context dictates amino acid substitution rates, with surface residues evolving most rapidly and small-molecule-binding sites evolving under selective constraints without cost optimization. By integrating structural biology with evolutionary genomics, we establish a model in which enzyme evolution is intrinsically governed by catalytic function and shaped by metabolic niche, network architecture, cost and molecular interactions.

Lippman,Cryptic variation fuels plant phenotypic change through hierarchical epistasis,"Gene regulatory network architecture and complex dosage effects from paralogue diversification converge to shape phenotypic space, producing the potential for both strongly buffered phenotypes and sudden bursts of phenotypic change. 
 Cryptic genetic variants exert minimal phenotypic effects alone but are hypothesized to form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity driving trait evolvability through epistatic interactions1–3. This classical theory has been reinvigorated by pan-genomics, which is revealing pervasive variation within gene families, cis-regulatory regions and regulatory networks4–6. Testing the ability of cryptic variation to fuel phenotypic diversification has been hindered by intractable genetics, limited allelic diversity and inadequate phenotypic resolution. Here, guided by natural and engineered cis-regulatory cryptic variants in a paralogous gene pair, we identified additional redundant trans regulators, establishing a regulatory network controlling tomato inflorescence architecture. By combining coding mutations with cis-regulatory alleles in populations segregating for all four network genes, we generated 216 genotypes spanning a wide spectrum of inflorescence complexity and quantified branching in over 35,000 inflorescences. Analysis of this high-resolution genotype–phenotype map using a hierarchical model of epistasis revealed a layer of dose-dependent interactions within paralogue pairs enhancing branching, culminating in strong, synergistic effects. However, we also identified a layer of antagonism between paralogue pairs, whereby accumulating mutations in one pair progressively diminished the effects of mutations in the other. Our results demonstrate how gene regulatory network architecture and complex dosage effects from paralogue diversification converge to shape phenotypic space, producing the potential for both strongly buffered phenotypes and sudden bursts of phenotypic change.

 In the past decade, ancient protein sequences have emerged as a valuable source of data for deep-time phylogenetic inference1–4. Still, even though ancient proteins have been reported from the Middle–Late Miocene5,6, the recovery of protein sequences providing subordinal-level phylogenetic insights does not exceed 3.7 million years ago (Pliocene)1. Here, we push this boundary back to 21–24 million years ago (Early Miocene) by retrieving enamel protein sequences of a rhinocerotid (Epiaceratherium sp.; CMNFV59632) from Canada’s High Arctic. We recover partial sequences of seven enamel proteins and more than 1,000 peptide–spectrum matches, spanning at least 251 amino acids. Endogeneity is in line with thermal age estimates and is supported by indicators of protein damage, including several spontaneous and irreversible chemical modifications accumulated during prolonged diagenesis. Bayesian tip-dating places the divergence time of CMNFV59632 in the Middle Eocene–Oligocene, coinciding with a phase of high rhinocerotid diversification7. This analysis identifies a later Oligocene divergence for Elasmotheriinae, weakening alternative models suggesting a deep basal split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae8,9. The findings are consistent with hypotheses on the origin of the enigmatic fauna of the Haughton Crater, which, in spite of considerable endemism, has similarity to distant Eurasian faunas10,11. Our findings demonstrate the potential of palaeoproteomics in obtaining phylogenetic information from a specimen that is approximately ten times older than any sample from which endogenous DNA has been obtained so far.

 Spontaneous two-photon emission (STPE) is a second-order quantum radiation process with implications in astrophysics1, atomic physics2 and quantum technology3. In particular, on-demand STPE from single quantum emitters has long been predicted to revolutionize photonic quantum science and technology4,5. Here we report STPE with brightness comparable to that of competing single-photon radiation from a single semiconductor quantum dot deterministically coupled to a high-quality micropillar cavity. This is because of strong vacuum fluctuations in the microcavity, which drive a biexciton directly to the ground state. We show the quantum nature associated with STPE in the cavity quantum electrodynamics regime using photon statistics measurements. Furthermore, STPE is exploited to build unconventional entangled quantum light sources that can simultaneously achieve near-unity entanglement fidelity for spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and on-demand photon emission for atomic quantum emitters. Our work provides insights into the two-photon process in the quantum regime, which could empower photonic quantum technology with nonlinear quantum radiation.

 When two monolayer materials are stacked with a relative twist, an effective moiré translation symmetry emerges, leading to fundamentally different properties in the resulting heterostructure. As such, moiré materials have recently provided highly tunable platforms for exploring strongly correlated systems1,2. However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states near the Γ (refs. 3,4) or K (refs. 5–9) points of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Here we introduce a new class of moiré systems based on monolayers with triangular lattices but low-energy states at the M points of the BZ. These M-point moiré materials feature three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by threefold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of exfoliable 1T-SnSe2 and 1T-ZrS2 as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we identify twist angles that yield flat conduction bands, provide accurate continuum models, analyse their topology and charge density and explore the platform’s rich physics. Notably, the M-point moiré Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice structure. This represents, to our knowledge, the first experimentally viable realization of projective representations of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these systems act as six-flavour Hubbard simulators with Mott physics. Moreover, the presence of a momentum-space non-symmorphic in-plane mirror symmetry renders some of the M-point moiré Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger-liquid physics.

 Deuterated acids/bases are high-value bulk chemicals used for synthesizing deuterated pharmaceuticals1,2, modifying optoelectronic materials3 and mediating hydrogen isotope exchange reactions4,5. However, conventional synthesis methods require harsh reaction conditions with high energy consumption6,7. Here we propose a versatile platform that takes advantage of heavy water dissociation in bipolar membranes (BPMs) to produce deuterated acids and bases under particularly mild conditions. Specifically, D2SO4 (2.75 mol l−1) and KOD (5.82 mol l−1), which are comparable with commercial products, were prepared using inexpensive D2O and K2SO4. We find that the deuteron generation rate is approximately 1.25 times greater than that of the protons, which is attributed to less co-ion leakage of D+ than H+ through the anion-exchange membrane (AEM), lower salt leakage within BPMs in D2O than in H2O and lower dehydration barrier of deuterons than proton clusters in the membrane phase. Compared with other contributing factors, salt leakage plays a relatively minor role in the observed H+/D+ concentration difference. This flexible and robust platform facilitates the synthesis of various deuterium-labelled compounds.

 Plastic pollution of the marine realm is widespread, with most scientific attention given to macroplastics and microplastics1,2. By contrast, ocean nanoplastics (<1 μm) remain largely unquantified, leaving gaps in our understanding of the mass budget of this plastic size class3–5. Here we measure nanoplastic concentrations on an ocean-basin scale along a transect crossing the North Atlantic from the subtropical gyre to the northern European shelf. We find approximately 1.5–32.0 mg m−3 of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoplastics throughout the entire water column. On average, we observe a 1.4-fold higher concentration of nanoplastics in the mixed layer when compared with intermediate water depth, with highest mixed-layer nanoplastic concentrations near the European continent. Nanoplastic concentrations at intermediate water depth are 1.8-fold higher in the subtropical gyre compared with the open North Atlantic outside the gyre. The lowest nanoplastic concentrations, with about 5.5 mg m−3 on average and predominantly composed of PET, are present in bottom waters. For the mixed layer of the temperate to subtropical North Atlantic, we estimate that the mass of nanoplastic may amount to 27 million tonnes (Mt). This is in the same range or exceeding previous budget estimates of macroplastics/microplastics for the entire Atlantic6,7 or the global ocean1,8.

 Decreased brain levels of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an endogenously synthesized lipophilic antioxidant1,2, underpin encephalopathy in primary CoQ10 deficiencies3,4 and are associated with common neurodegenerative diseases and the ageing process5,6. CoQ10 supplementation does not increase CoQ10 pools in the brain or in other tissues. The recent discovery of the mammalian CoQ10 headgroup synthesis pathway, in which 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) makes 4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA) to synthesize the CoQ10 headgroup precursor 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB)7, offers an opportunity to pharmacologically restore CoQ10 synthesis and mechanistically treat CoQ10 deficiencies. To test whether 4-HMA or 4-HB supplementation promotes CoQ10 headgroup synthesis in vivo, here we administered 4-HMA and 4-HB to Hpdl−/− mice, which model an ultra-rare, lethal mitochondrial encephalopathy in humans. Both 4-HMA and 4-HB were incorporated into CoQ9 and CoQ10 in the brains of Hpdl−/− mice. Oral treatment of Hpdl−/− pups with 4-HMA or 4-HB enabled 90–100% of Hpdl−/− mice to live to adulthood. Furthermore, 4-HB treatment stabilized and improved the neurological symptoms of a patient with progressive spasticity due to biallelic HPDL variants. Our work shows that 4-HMA and 4-HB can modify the course of mitochondrial encephalopathy driven by HPDL variants and demonstrates that CoQ10 headgroup intermediates can restore CoQ10 synthesis in vivo.

 Optically active spin defects in solids1,2 are leading candidates for quantum sensing3,4 and quantum networking5,6. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)7–11, a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Owing to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing12, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects7–11 remain unknown and detecting a single nuclear spin with a hBN spin defect has been elusive. Here we report the creation of single spin defects in hBN using 13C ion implantation and the identification of three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S = 1/2 and S = 1 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a π-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.

 The carpus (wrist) of birds has a complex evolutionary history, long known to involve carpal reduction and recently shown to include topological replacement of one carpal (the ulnare) by another (the pisiform)1. The pisiform plays a crucial role in stabilization of the distal wingtip during flight2, and facilitates kinematic integration that ‘automates’ wing motion3. The apparent absence of a pisiform in all but the earliest theropod dinosaurs led to the proposal that it was lost early in theropod evolution and regained only in birds as a key step in the origin of flight1. Here, we describe the forelimb skeletons of two newly prepared theropod dinosaur specimens from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, each of which preserves a pisiform, establishing its presence in Oviraptorosauria and Troodontidae in addition to birds. Reinterpretation of published material in light of these specimens shows a pisiform in a wide range of theropod species, including Microraptor4, Ambopteryx5 and Anchiornis6. Our results indicate that the pisiform replaced the ulnare by origin of the clade Pennaraptora, phylogenetically coincident with the hypothesized origin(s) of flight in birds and their closest relatives7,8. Taken together, our results indicate that replacement of the ulnare by the pisiform was a terminal step in assembly of the dinosaurian flight apparatus that occurred close to the origins of flight in theropod dinosaurs, rather than a novelty restricted to birds.

 The Southwest United States is experiencing severe and persistent drought, although uncertainties regarding the causes limit our ability to predict changes in water availability. The severity of the current drought has been attributed to a combination of warming and natural changes in atmospheric circulation, suggesting that current rainfall deficits may improve as natural oscillations reverse sign. Here we use new leaf-wax stable isotope reconstructions and simulations for the mid-Holocene (6 thousand years ago) and demonstrate that moderate warming of the Northern Hemisphere can produce drought over the Southwest United States through an ocean–atmosphere response originating in the North Pacific. The patterns of ocean warming and rainfall change resemble the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that this mode can be excited by external forcings. A similar response to warming is evident in future projections, leading to sustained winter precipitation deficits through the mid-twenty-first century. However, the magnitudes of past and current precipitation deficits associated with this North Pacific response are systematically underestimated in models, possibly due to a weak coupling of ocean–atmosphere interactions. Projections may also underestimate the magnitude of this precipitation response to changes in the North Pacific, leading to greater drought risk in this already water-poor region.

Arblaster,Recent southwestern US drought exacerbated by anthropogenic aerosols and tropical ocean warming,"Climate model simulations suggest that both anthropogenic aerosols and tropical ocean warming have contributed to reduced precipitation over the southwestern United States in recent decades, thus making the current drought more likely than previously thought. 
 The southwestern United States is currently in a multi-decade drought that has developed since a precipitation maximum in the 1980s. While anthropogenic warming has made the drought more severe, it is the decline in winter–spring precipitation that has had a more profound effect on water resources and ecosystems. This precipitation decline is not well understood beyond its attribution to the post-1980 La Niña-like cooling trend in tropical sea surface temperatures, which caused a North Pacific anti-cyclonic atmospheric circulation trend conducive to declining precipitation in the southwestern United States. Using a hierarchy of model simulations, we show that, even under El Niño-like sea surface temperature trends, there is a tendency towards a North Pacific anti-cyclonic circulation trend and declining precipitation in the southwestern United States, counter to the canonical El Niño teleconnection. This unintuitive yet robust circulation change arises from non-additive responses to tropical mean sea surface temperature warming and radiative effects from anthropogenic aerosols. The post-1980 period exhibits the fastest southwestern US soil moisture drying among past and future periods of similar length due to the combination of this forced precipitation decline and anthropogenic warming. While the precipitation trend might reverse due to future projected El Niño-like warming and aerosol emissions reduction, it is unlikely to substantially alleviate the currently projected future drought risk.

 The human nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 interacts with SUMO1-modified RanGAP1 and the SUMO E2 Ubc9 at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to promote export and disassembly of exportin Crm1/Ran(GTP)/cargo complexes.

Here, we resolve cryo-EM structures of a RanBP2 C-terminal fragment in complex with Crm1, SUMO1-RanGAP1/Ubc9, and two molecules of Ran(GTP).

Here the authors reveal a non-monotonic size dependence of exciton radiative lifetime, suggesting optimal sizes for applications requiring fast photoemission. 
 Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted intense interest due to their desirable optical properties, diverse structural features, and size-tunable excitonic structure. Here we show that, under ambient conditions, a non-monotonic trend in radiative lifetime emerges from the interplay of size, lattice symmetry and excitonic structure. Small nanocrystals exhibit long radiative lifetimes due to weakly emissive excitons, but the oscillator strength increases and shortens the lifetime for nanocrystals approaching intermediate confinement. For larger nanocrystals with higher exciton density of states (DOS), the radiative lifetime is lengthened due to depopulation of the bright exciton manifold into thermally accessible dim states. A size-dependent structural symmetry lowering transition from cubic to orthorhombic is observed by XRD and MD simulations, and the non-monotonic radiative lifetime trend emerges only in lower symmetry structures with an increased dim exciton DOS. These findings shed light on the impact of nanocrystal size and structure on radiative lifetime and pave the way for tailored optical materials in various optical applications.

 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates the study of transcriptome diversity in individual cells. Yet, many existing methods lack sensitivity and accuracy. Here we introduce SCALPEL, a Nextflow-based tool to quantify and characterize transcript isoforms from standard 3’ scRNA-seq data. Using synthetic data, SCALPEL demonstrates higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other tools. In real datasets, SCALPEL predictions have a high agreement with other tools and can be experimentally validated. The use of SCALPEL on real datasets reveals novel cell populations undetectable using single-cell gene expression data, confirms known 3’ UTR length changes during cell differentiation, and identifies cell-type specific miRNA signatures regulating isoform expression. Additionally, we show that SCALPEL improves isoform quantification using paired long- and short-read scRNA-seq data. Overall, SCALPEL expands the current scRNA-seq toolkit to explore post-transcriptional gene regulation across species, tissues, and technologies, advancing our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms at the single-cell level.

 With their long lifetime and protection against decoherence, dark excitons in monolayer semiconductors offer a promising route for quantum technologies. Optical techniques have previously observed dark excitons with a long-lived valley polarization. However, several aspects remain unknown, such as the populations and time evolution of the different valley-polarized dark excitons and the role of excitation conditions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we obtain a holistic view of the dynamics after valley-selective photoexcitation. By varying experimental conditions, we reconcile between the rapid valley depolarization previously reported in TR-ARPES, and the observation of long-lived valley polarized dark excitons in optical studies. For the latter, we find that momentum-dark excitons largely dominate at early times sustaining a 40% degree of valley polarization, while valley-polarized spin-dark states dominate at longer times. Our measurements provide the timescales and how the different dark excitons contribute to the previously observed long-lived valley polarization in optics.

Here we show that inflowing Atlantic Water (AW) drives deoxygenation in the upper eastern Arctic Ocean and the intermediate layers of the western Arctic Ocean at rates from −0.41 ± 0.17 to −0.47 ± 0.07 µmol kg−1 yr−1, six times the global mean. Amplified Arctic warming is the primary driver, significantly reducing oxygen solubility in the Arctic gateway regions. Rapid subduction and circulation of AW further transmit the deoxygenation signal into Arctic deeper layers, greatly threatening marine ecosystems. Our findings highlight the dominant role of warming Atlantic inflow in shaping the Arctic Ocean oxygen dynamics, indicating that ongoing temperature increases will perpetuate deoxygenation trends and underscoring the need for widespread attention. Rapid warming of the global ocean and amplified Arctic warming will alter the ocean biogeochemistry. Here the authors show that Atlantic water inflow, and the subsequent subduction and circulation, is reducing dissolved oxygen in the Arctic due to reduced solubility with increased temperatures."

 Ice cores are crucial archives of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Despite the importance of nitrous oxide (N2O) as a GHG, existing ice core records contain gaps, particularly during glacial periods, due to the high dust content in ice samples that may cause in situ chemical or biological reactions, increasing N2O concentration. By developing an iterative process that applies machine learning (ML) models to existing data on CO2, CH4, and N2O from Antarctic ice cores, we simulated a continuous time series of atmospheric N2O concentrations for the past 800,000 years (kyr). The continuous N2O record allows us to investigate long-term variability and potential climate feedback that would otherwise remain obscured, as spectral analysis of this record has revealed significant N2O periodicities of ~100, 41, and 23 kyr. While ML-based simulations cannot fully replace real, artifact-free measurements, they provide a valuable complementary approach to interpreting past climate dynamics, especially when empirical data are limited or compromised."

 Perfluoroalkyl acids have been widely used during the last fifty years in a myriad of industrial and consumer applications, and are a paradigm of persistent “forever chemicals”. Earlier studies suggested a limited occurrence in the Southern Ocean as a consequence of the Antarctic circumpolar current preventing their oceanic transport southwards. Here we show perfluoroalkyl acids in the Bransfield Strait and Bellingshausen Sea (west of Antarctic Peninsula) at concentrations of comparable magnitude to those measured in the North Atlantic, a region impacted by historical sources. Atmospheric wet deposition of perfluoroalkyl acids previously aerosolized by sea-spray arises as the perfluoroalkyl acids source to Antarctica. The prevailing marine and atmospheric circulation in the region encapsulate these chemicals in the Antarctic region once these have crossed the Antarctic divergence. This work underscores the importance of persistence driving chemical’s environmental risk, and raises concern on the impact of the larger pool of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

 Cropland changes modulate local temperature by altering terrestrial biophysical properties, yet the global sign and magnitude of this impact remain uncertain due to fragmented distributions and complex natural land-cover conversions. Using satellite remote sensing (2000–2020), we quantify sub-pixel-level biophysical effects on land surface temperature from global cropland expansion into both forest and non-forest vegetation. Our results show that cropland expansion into non-forest vegetation (87% of global conversions) induces spatially heterogeneous temperature responses. Summer cropland conversions caused net global cooling (−0.002 ± 0.000 °C per five years), with 50% attributable to non-forest vegetation replacement. Boreal regions (40°N–50°N) exhibited pronounced cooling (−0.02 ± 0.001 °C per five years), while tropical zones (0°S–10°S) experienced localized warming (+0.07 ± 0.001 °C per five years). Winter cropland conversions contributed minimally to boreal temperature changes but amplified tropical warming (+0.07 ± 0.002 °C per five years; 10°S–20°S). Temperature sensitivity to cropland fraction varied asymmetrically with background land cover: Complete non-forest vegetation replacement in the Northern Hemisphere yielded stronger summer cooling (−0.06 °C) than warming from reversed conversions (+0.02 °C), whereas maximum forest replacement warming (+0.78 °C) exceeded its cooling benefits (−0.55 °C). These findings highlight the summer cooling capacity in boreal non-forest vegetation replacement and reveal the risk of tropical cropland expansion to climate mitigation. The global expansion of cropland onto non-forest vegetation during the summer over the period 2000–2020 caused a net global cooling of −0.002 °C every 5 years, mainly driven by boreal regions, but also led to localized warming in tropical areas, according to an analysis of satellite data."

 High-altitude platforms offer a low-cost and high-quality alternative to satellites and piloted aircraft for applications from remote sensing to communications. Unlike satellites, balloons can change altitude on demand to navigate or remain stationary by leveraging natural wind variability at different altitudes. While wind variability is known to exist across the upper stratosphere, real-world platforms are operationally constrained to a subset of altitude ranges. Therefore, it is crucial to find which altitude bands contain the most diversity to maximize navigability while minimizing system size and complexity. Here, we introduce an intuitive, effective method to quantify diversity in a wind column and apply it to 338 distinct altitude bands, each evaluated using over 250 million wind profiles from 2020 to 2024. Our results reveal a pronounced ‘Goldilocks’ zone achieved by altitude floors below 16 km and altitude ceilings above 21 km. Operating in this range is essential for having predictable steering winds. This analysis provides a quantitative framework to optimize operating altitudes to maximize navigational potential for the design and operating paradigms of any high-altitude platform.

 The application of Time-series Interferometry of Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) for monitoring small and narrow infrastructural elements can be limited when using medium spatial resolution SAR sensors, such as Sentinel-1, due to sparse coverage of coherent pixels. Therefore, carefully selecting coherent pixels is crucial to maximise the density of reliable measurement points and to minimise noisy observations. In this study, a novel framework is proposed for selecting coherent pixels within the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers Small Baseline (StaMPS-SB) approach based on the temporal coherence predicted by deep learning. Unlike previous complex deep learning approaches to this problem, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model is trained on time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from a time series of SAR amplitude images to predict the temporal coherence value of each individual pixel, and thus to select coherent pixels. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model, trained directly on the same amplitude time series, is used as a benchmark for evaluating the MLP model’s performance. Predictions of temporal coherence from MLP and LSTM models are similar, but the MLP model training time is much faster. Compared to standard amplitude difference dispersion (ADD) analysis, the MLP model increases the number of coherent pixels over buildings, linear infrastructure, and non-urban classes by 40 %, 68 %, and 45 %, respectively. In addition, the MLP model approach produces fewer unreliable (non-coherent) pixels; over non-urban regions, 70 % to 80 % of pixels selected by the ADD analysis have low temporal coherence (<0.8), compared to only 10 % to 12 % selected by the MLP model."

 In most West African countries, water authorities face real challenges in monitoring and managing lakes. These challenges include the limitation of resources for continuous field-based data collection for the assessment of both the ecological status and the implementation of regulations measures on these water bodies. In such a context, remote sensing-based monitoring could provide a sustainable solution. The current study used EO data Sentinel-1 SAR to develop a classification approach for detection a traditional fish method using dry branches (called acadja), and water hyacinth (which mainly occurs in acadja) in Lake Nokoué (Benin). The employed method analyses the distribution of VV and VH polarisation values to determine the boundary (threshold interval) between acadjas and water hyacinth objects on one hand, and open water on the other. This analysis, referred to as a ’quartile-based threshold analysis’, was conducted from 2019 to 2023, taking seasonal variations into account. The study results show that VH polarisation is a more stable method for detecting acadjas and water hyacinths. The overall accuracy of object detection is 87%, with a confusion rate of less than 5% throughout the study period. A comparison of these results with those produced by the Otsu algorithm and the use of NDVI indicates that the latter underestimates the areas covered by acadjas and water hyacinths."

 Real-time monitoring of river surface velocity and flow extent is crucial for flood risk mitigation, sustainable water resources management, and ecosystem protection. However, high computational demands and limited high-resolution river cross-section data make real-time river monitoring impractical, particularly for large or ungauged rivers during emergencies, impeding rapid analysis and decision-making. A key limitation is the lack of an all-in-one, efficient tool combining machine learning-based segmentation with real-time optical flow estimation on edge-computing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).To address these challenges, we introduce RivAIr, a novel UAV-mounted sensor system designed for real-time river monitoring. This self-contained, edge-computing module integrates custom hardware with real-time machine learning and optical flow algorithms, enabling onboard water segmentation and river surface velocity estimation. Unlike existing methods that rely on post-processing, RivAIr is purpose-built for real-time field deployment in data-scarce or emergency scenarios.RivAIr integrates YOLOv8 with an optimized Farneback dense optical flow algorithm focused on water bodies, improving motion estimation accuracy while reducing runtime for real-time UAV processing. Validated along the Basento River (Basilicata, Italy) under controlled conditions, the optimal configuration of RivAIr achieved a 90% confidence score in water surface area detection and velocity estimation with a −3% error relative to in-situ measurements, showing strong consistency with in-situ flow observations. Notably, RivAIr completed end-to-end processing in approximately 40 s, demonstrating operational feasibility across altitudes and distances up to 800 m from the ground unit.

 Monitoring crop phenology is crucial for improving agricultural management and supporting food security, especially in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries like Egypt, where smallholder farms account for most food production. This study evaluates the potential of fused Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 data, generated with the Sen2Like processor, for retrieving key phenological metrics at field-scale in a multi-cropping agricultural system of the Nile Delta. Forty-two fields were analysed over six years, focusing on wheat, maize, rice and clover in El Gharbia Governorate. Phenological metrics were derived using the Decomposition and Analysis of Time-Series Software (DATimeS) and were evaluated based on a reference crop calendar. Results showed that 91% of crop seasons were detected using the Sen2Like fused product compared to 88% using Sentinel-2 alone. For both datasets, the Start of Season (SOS) for summer crops presented a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 35 days from the calendar date, while the SOS for winter crops had an RMSE of about 14 days. Due to its daily temporal coverage, PlanetScope data was used for additional evaluation. Metrics extracted with Sen2Like and PlanetScope presented a good agreement, with an RMSE of 1 day for metrics occurring during spring months and an RMSE of 6 days for winter metrics. Moreover, mapping key phenological stages provided insights into the crops’ spatial and temporal distribution across the study area.

The effects were more pronounced in the male and younger populations for PM2.5 and NO2 in the warm season, and a positive association was also observed between PM10 and IS in the younger group. As for SO2, CO and O3, no statistically significant associations were found between them and IS.ConclusionOur findings suggested that short-term exposures to PM2.5, NO2, PM10 increase the risk of IS hospitalizations, especially in the male and younger populations.

 This study uses ground hail reports in the United States and Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory data from 2014 to 2022 to analyze the spatiotemporal evolutions of precipitation microphysical parameters (mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm), and generalized intercept parameter (Nw)) and its relationship with convective parameters during the two hours around hail. The results indicate that at 3 km above ground level, the regions with large raindrops, high reflectivity (Ze), high storm height and strong updrafts moved from northwest to southeast, indicating a typical hailstorm movement pattern. Vertically, the variations of Ze and Dm correlate well with their spatiotemporal variability at the 3 km. Regardless of altitude, Dm and Ze exhibited higher values in the northwestern sector prior to hail report time, while higher values shifted to the southeastern sector post-hail. Notably, Nw showed minimal temporal differences below 5 km, whereas above 5 km pre-hail Nw values were lower compared to post-hail. This suggests that different microphysical processes of precipitation particles may occur across different time periods and regions. Convective precipitation in hailstorm was primarily influenced by the collision-coalescence process, while stratiform precipitation primarily involved both break-up and collision-coalescence processes. Meanwhile, the height of 20/40 dBZ echo top (HT20/40) revealed nonlinear relationship with microphysical parameters. For example, the Dm at 3 km increased with HT40 when HT40 is less than 6 km, but changed a little when HT40 is larger than 6 km. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical processes surrounding hailstorms and contribute to improving hail prediction models."

Mitochondria harbor a host of intrinsic antioxidant defenses, but the contribution of extrinsic, nonmitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms is less well understood. We found a direct role for peroxisomes in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis through contact-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer. We found that ACBD5 and PTPIP51 form a contact between peroxisomes and mitochondria. The percentage of these contacts increased during mitochondrial oxidative stress and helped to maintain mitochondrial health through the transfer of mitochondrial ROS to the peroxisome lumen. Our findings reveal a multiorganelle layer of mitochondrial antioxidant defense—suggesting a direct mechanism by which peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial health—and broaden the scope of known membrane contact site functions."

However, the diversity of neuronal subtypes programmable in vitro remains unresolved. We modulated developmental signaling pathways combined with TF overexpression to explore the spectrum of neuron subtypes generated from pluripotent stem cells. We screened 480 morphogen signaling modulations coupled with TF induction using a multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic readout. Analysis of 700,000 cells identified diverse excitatory and inhibitory neurons patterned along the developmental axes of the neural tube. Patterning neural progenitors prior to TF overexpression expanded neuronal diversity by enabling access to regulons active in primary tissue counterparts. Our approach provides a strategy for programming diverse human cell subtypes as well as investigating how cooperative signaling drives neuronal fate."

Each observation has received its own tailored explanation involving multiple genetic and evolutionary causes. In this work, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory for sex chromosome evolution incorporating the coevolution of cis- and trans-acting regulators of gene expression and leading to systematic misexpression of dosage-compensated genes in heterogametic F1 hybrids, for both young and old sex chromosomes."

Spatially broad DA release has been extensively characterized, but how DA transmission affects striatal function at a subcellular scale remains poorly understood. Using 2P imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, we defined the spatiotemporal properties of DA transmission onto striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons. Sparse activation of DA release sites evoked localized DA signals, producing spatially discrete, D2 receptor–mediated responses across dendrites. The spatiotemporal properties of DA receptor signaling differed between downstream intracellular pathways. We propose that membrane-delimited Gβγ signaling occurs in parallel to intracellular second messenger pathways, but on different spatial and temporal scales, providing a mechanism for precise decoding of DA signals by striatal neurons."

Its monoallelic mutation causes CSF1R-associated microgliopathy (CAMP), a major form of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) and a fatal neurological disease without clinical cure. We developed mouse models harboring human hotspot mutations of CAMP and replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia with CSF1R-normal cells through microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT), which attenuated pathology in mice. We further demonstrated that, in the context of CSF1R deficiency, traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) in ALSP functions similarly to Mr BMT, efficiently replacing microglia and reducing disease progression. We then replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia in eight patients by tBMT. The disease progression was halted during the 24-month follow-up.

Previous structural work showed that human telomerase is typically monomeric, containing a single copy of TERT and hTR. Evidence for dimeric complexes exists, although the composition, high-resolution structure, and function remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human telomerase dimer bound to telomeric DNA. The structure reveals a 26-subunit assembly and a dimerization interface mediated by the Hinge and ACA box (H/ACA) RNP of telomerase. Premature aging disease mutations map to this interface. Disrupting dimer formation affects RNP assembly, bulk telomerase activity, and telomere maintenance in cells. Our findings address a long-standing enigma surrounding the telomerase dimer and suggest a role for the dimer in telomerase assembly."

In this study, we probed channel-pattern origins by mapping thread dynamics along 84 rivers from 36 years of global satellite imagery using particle image velocimetry. Results show that single-thread channels originate from a balance between lateral erosion and accretion, which enables a thread to migrate while maintaining equilibrium width. In contrast, multithread channels originate from imbalance—erosion outpaces accretion in individual threads, causing threads to repeatedly widen and split. Thread-width imbalance provides a mechanistic explanation for how multithread channels develop on Earth and other planets and, in application, can help lower the cost of nature-based river restoration projects."

Reconstructed genomes self-organize into six spatially distinct taxonomic cohorts and 10 functionally distinct biomes that are primarily structured by wind-driven circulation at the surface and density-driven circulation at depth.

This Fe-catalyzed method harnesses α-Cl radicals and couples an exceptionally wide array of carbenes in (2+1) cyclopropanations and σ-bond insertions. This mild, robust, and electronically tunable synthetic method facilitated the development of a better classification system for catalytic metal carbenes (validated by both kinetic and thermodynamic quantification), as well as a carbene “click-like” reaction and aqueous adaptation for chemical biology applications."
