10.1088/1748-9326/ad6f2b,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],Synchronous spring precipitation in Southeastern China and Bengal: a potential indicator for the Indian summer monsoon?,"Spring precipitation in southeastern China and Bengal, occurring during the transitional phase from winter to summer monsoons, serves as a critical window into the dynamics of large-scale circulations and the subsequent summer monsoon. While many studies have analyzed spring precipitation in southeastern China and Bengal, their interconnections and implications for the summer monsoon have remained relatively under explored. We utilized the Empirical Orthogonal Function of spring precipitation to reveal Synchronous Spring Precipitation (SSP) in southeastern China and Bengal. This synchronicity is bridged by the East Asian Subtropical Jet (EASJ) that extends from Bengal to southeastern China. The EASJ was predominantly correlated with precipitation in southeastern China prior to the 1990s, while it developed a more profound connection with precipitation in Bengal after the 1990s. Notably, SSP anomalies occurred during the developing phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The predictive capacity of SSP for the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) amplifies during periods of the intensified SSP-ENSO correlations and positive phase of the North Pacific Meridional Mode. Tree-ring based reconstructions spanning the past two centuries further corroborate the persistent linkages among the SSP, ISM, and ENSO. Our research sheds light on the intricate interplay of these factors and their significance in understanding and predicting the monsoon dynamics in the region.",Keyan Fang;Feifei Zhou;Hao Wu;Hui Tang;Zepeng Mei;Jinbao Li;Tinghai Ou;Zheng Zhao;Deliang Chen,这篇论文主要研究了中国东南和孟加拉地区的春季降水与印度夏季风之间的关系。研究利用经验正交函数分析春季降水，发现中国东南和孟加拉地区的春季降水存在同步性，并与东亚副热带急流和厄尔尼诺-南方涛动有关。论文探讨了春季降水同步性对印度夏季风的预测能力，并利用树木年轮重建了过去两个世纪的降水变化，进一步验证了春季降水、印度夏季风和厄尔尼诺-南方涛动之间的联系。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。

Potential predictors were initially identified based on the relationships between the year-by-year variation (DY) of the TYFs and preseason (March–May) environmental factors. These predictors were subsequently further refined, resulting in the selection of eight key predictors. Prediction models were constructed using twenty machine learning algorithms, utilizing data from 1965 to 2010. These trained models were then applied to perform hindcasts of TYFs from 2011 to 2023. The forecasted DY was added to the observed TYF of the preceding year to obtain the current year’s TYF. The results indicate that the TYFs predicted by the multi-model ensemble (MME) closely align with the observation during the hindcast period. Compared to individual models, the MME improves the prediction skill for the DY by at least 5.56% and up to 56.92%. Furthermore, the mean bias of the MME for TYF is notably smaller than that of the ECMWF’s most recent seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in the years of 2017‒2023. The superior performance of the ensemble prediction approach was also validated through leave-one-out cross-validation.

Traditionally, these influences are identified using numerical sensitivity experiments with numerical models like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which require substantial computational resources. This study investigates the potential of the Artificial intelligence (AI)-based Pangu-Weather model to reveal these complex mechanisms by comparing its performance with the WRF model, focusing on Typhoon Khanun’s impact on the extreme rainfall event in North China from 29 July to 1 August 2023. Our analysis shows that Pangu-Weather effectively captures key atmospheric systems and TC positions, outperforming WRF. Specifically, WRF simulations excluding Khanun demonstrate a reduction in northward moisture transport on the eastern side of North China, but minimal impact on the extreme precipitation area for most of the period. Pangu-Weather successfully reproduces these processes, aligning closely with WRF at larger scales (e.g. greater than 300 km). However, Pangu-Weather struggles to discern and explain smaller-scale processes (e.g. less than 300 km). These findings highlight Pangu-Weather’s potential to advance meteorological research and disaster prevention, demonstrating AI’s capability to accurately depict complex large-scale physical processes.",Hongxiong Xu;Yihong Duan;Xiangde Xu,该研究主要关注的是利用人工智能模型（Pangu-Weather）来模拟台风对极端降雨的影响，并与传统的数值天气预报模型（WRF）进行比较。研究重点在于评估AI模型在模拟台风诱发降雨的物理机制方面的能力，而不是直接利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测。

But by using observed crop yield statistics and an ensemble of statistical models, we demonstrate that over the last six decades the frequency of crop yield shocks in breadbasket regions has been decreasing due to both climate and non-climate factors. Here non-climate factors refer to interannual variability unrelated to abiotic stress, such as biotic stress and management decisions. We find that although the risk posed by extreme heat to crop yields has been increasing, this risk has been offset by changes to precipitation, extremely cold days, and average growing season temperature in many breadbaskets. As a result, total climate-related crop yield shocks have been decreasing for soybeans and wheat, while they have remained roughly constant for maize. Meanwhile, non-climate risks to crop yields have decreased in nearly every breadbasket region across crops. Because non-climate risks have decreased faster than climate risks, we find that the climate accounts for a greater proportion of crop yield shocks in the recent period (1991–2020) compared to an earlier period (1961–90). Our results indicate that extreme climate events are more important than ever to the relative stability of the food production system, even as the overall frequency of multiple breadbasket yield shocks decreases.",Xuan Chen;Weston Anderson;Liangzhi You;Edward Pope,该研究主要关注气候变化对全球主要粮食产区（面包篮地区）作物产量的影响。研究者利用统计模型分析了近几十年来作物产量波动趋势，发现尽管极端高温对作物产量构成越来越大的风险，但降水、极端低温和平均生长季温度的变化抵消了这一风险，导致整体作物产量冲击频率下降。研究还指出，非气候因素（如生物胁迫和管理决策）对作物产量的影响也在下降。因此，该研究侧重于气候变化和非气候因素对作物产量的影响，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

10.1088/1748-9326/ad7046,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],Linkage of El Niño-Southern Oscillation to astronomic forcing,"Deciphering the causes of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) represents one of the greatest scientific and societal challenges because ENSO impacts people’s safety, food, water, health, and economy. Traditionally, ENSO has been considered a phenomenon that is mostly influenced by the interactions between oceanic and atmospheric processes, i.e. by the internal variability in Earth’s ocean-atmosphere system. However, dendrochronological records of climate indices, ENSO among them, have statistically significant variance at periodicities related to solar activity (sunspots) and lunar precessions. Other studies indicate a modulation by the lunar nodal cycle of ocean’s mixing and its implications on water and air temperatures, steric sea levels, coastal flooding, rain, river discharge and heat transport. Those findings suggest that astronomic forces may influence ENSO. In fact, this study shows that a fit to well-established periodicities from lunar precessions, solar activity and their interactions explains 91% of the variance of an ENSO index smoothed at 5 years, and 67% of a 3 yr filtered ENSO index. Provided that the future Earth’s ocean-atmospheric system remains roughly within historical bounds under a changing climate in the next 2–3 decades, one can venture a projection into the future of 3- and 5 yr smoothed ENSO variability. Such projection is given here and might help in preparations for adaptation and mitigation measures caused by ENSO-related coastal hazards.",Arnoldo Valle-Levinson,这篇论文主要探讨了厄尔尼诺-南方涛动 (ENSO) 与天文因素之间的联系。研究表明，月球岁差、太阳活动及其相互作用的周期性变化可以解释 ENSO 指数 5 年平滑后的 91% 和 3 年滤波后的 67% 的方差。论文还预测了未来 3 年和 5 年平滑后的 ENSO 变异性，并指出这些预测可以帮助人们制定适应和缓解措施，应对 ENSO 相关的沿海灾害。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。

The algorithm is mathematically proved, and its performance is shown for a carbon flux observing system simulation experiment. These results legitimize and generalize this algorithm's current use and make available this effective algorithm to new DA domains. 
 Through the Bayesian lens of four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation, uncertainty in model parameters is traditionally quantified through the posterior covariance matrix. However, in modern settings involving high-dimensional and computationally expensive forward models, posterior covariance knowledge must be relaxed to deterministic or stochastic approximations. In the carbon flux inversion literature, (Chevallier et al., 2007) proposed a stochastic method capable of approximating posterior variances of linear functionals of the model parameters that is particularly well suited for large-scale Earth-system 4D-Var data assimilation tasks. This note formalizes this algorithm and clarifies its properties. We provide a formal statement of the algorithm, demonstrate why it converges to the desired posterior variance quantity of interest, and provide additional uncertainty quantification allowing incorporation of the Monte Carlo sampling uncertainty into the method's Bayesian credible intervals.

Observed results highlighted remarkably different aqueous processing of primary and secondary submicron aerosol components under distinct ambient relative humidity (RH) conditions and that RH levels significantly impact aerosol sampling through the aerosol swelling effect. 
 Aerosol hygroscopic growth and activation under high-relative-humidity (RH) conditions significantly influence the physicochemical properties of submicron aerosols (PM1). However, this process remains poorly characterized due to limited measurements. To address this gap, we deployed an advanced aerosol–fog sampling system that automatically switched between PM1, PM2.5 and total suspended particulate (TSP) inlets at a rural site in the North China Plain in the cold season. The results revealed that aerosol swelling due to water vapor uptake influenced aerosol sampling under high-RH conditions by shifting the cut-off size of impactors. At subsaturated high RH (> 90 %), over 25 % of aerosol mass with dry diameters below 1 µm resided in supermicron ranges, while in supersaturated foggy conditions, more than 70 % of submicron aerosol migrated to supermicron ranges. Hygroscopic growth and activation particularly affected highly hydrophilic inorganic salts,  shifting a significant number of submicron sulfate and nitrate particles to supermicron ranges, with 27 %–33 % at 95 % ≤ RH ≤ 99 % and more than 78 % under supersaturated foggy conditions. Moreover, more than 10 % of submicron biomass burning organic aerosols grew beyond 2.5 µm during fog events, while fossil-fuel-related organic aerosol (FFOA) remained dominantly in submicron ranges, suggesting inefficient aqueous conversion of FFOA. The two secondary organic aerosol (SOA) factors (OOA1 and OOA2) behaved differently under supersaturated conditions, with OOA2 exhibiting a higher activated fraction despite a lower oxygen / carbon ratio. A substantial increase in organic nitrate and organosulfur mass concentrations in activated droplets during fog events suggested aqueous conversions and formations of brown carbon with potential radiative impacts. Overall, our study highlights remarkably different cloud and fog processing behaviors between primary and secondary aerosols, which would benefit a better understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions under distinct atmospheric conditions.",Weiqi Xu;Ye Kuang;Wanyun Xu;Zhiqiang Zhang;Biao Luo;Xiaoyi Zhang;Jiangchuang Tao;Hongqin Qiao;Li Liu;Yele Sun,该研究主要关注了北华平原地区亚微米气溶胶在不同相对湿度条件下的吸湿增长和活化过程，以及该过程对气溶胶物理化学性质的影响。研究发现，高湿度条件下，气溶胶的吸湿增长和活化会导致气溶胶粒径发生显著变化，并影响气溶胶的采样。研究还发现，不同来源的气溶胶在云雾处理过程中表现出不同的行为，例如，生物质燃烧有机气溶胶在雾事件期间更容易被活化，而化石燃料相关有机气溶胶则主要保持在亚微米范围内。研究结果表明，气溶胶的吸湿增长和活化对气溶胶-云相互作用具有重要影响，这对于理解不同大气条件下的气溶胶-云相互作用具有重要意义。

It involves a stepwise approach to estimate the basin-level floodplain hydraulic geometry parameters that best respect the scaling law while approximating the global hydrodynamic flood maps. A ~90 m resolution global floodplain map, the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT), is delineated with demonstrated superiority. 
 Floodplains are a vital part of the global riverine system. Among all the global floodplain delineation strategies empowered by remote sensing, digital elevation model (DEM)-based delineation is considered to be computationally efficient with relatively low uncertainties, but the parsimonious model struggles with incorporating the basin-level spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological and geomorphic influences into the map. In this study, we propose a globally applicable thresholding scheme for DEM-based floodplain delineation to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, we develop a stepwise approach to estimate the floodplain hydraulic geometry (FHG) scaling parameters for river basins worldwide at the scale of the level-3 HydroBASINS to best respect the scaling law while approximating the spatial extent of two publicly available global flood maps derived from hydrodynamic modeling. The estimated FHG exponent exhibits a significant positive relationship with the basins' hydroclimatic conditions, particularly in 33 of the world's major river basins, indicating the ability of the approach to capture fingerprints from heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphic influences. Based on the spatially varying FHG parameters, a ∼ 90 m resolution global floodplain map named the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT) is delineated, which takes the hydrologically corrected MERIT Hydro dataset as the DEM inputs and the height above nearest drainage (HAND) as the terrain attribute. Our results demonstrate that SHIFT validates better with reference maps than both hydrodynamic-modeling- and DEM-based approaches with universal parameters. The improved delineation mainly includes better differentiation between main streams and tributaries in major basins and a more comprehensive representation of stream networks in aggregated river basins. SHIFT estimates the global floodplain area to be 9.91×106 km2, representing 6.6 % of the world's total land area. SHIFT data layers are available at two spatial resolutions (90 m and 1 km), along with the updated parameters, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11835133 (Zheng et al., 2024).

The current study explored the potential of deploying a coupled modelling framework for the estimation and forecasting of this parameter. The framework showed promising potential in addressing the challenge of estimating and forecasting the under-ice discharge. 
 Year-round river discharge estimation and forecasting is a critical component of sustainable water resource management. However, in cold climate regions such as Canada, this basic task gets intricated due to the challenge of river ice conditions. River ice conditions are dynamic and can change quickly in a short period of time. This dynamic nature makes river ice conditions difficult to forecast. Moreover, the observation of under-ice river discharge also remains a challenge since no reliable method for its estimation has been developed till date. It is therefore an active field of research and development. The integration of river ice hydraulic models in forecasting systems has remained relatively uncommon. The current study has two main objectives: first is to demonstrate the development and capabilities of a river ice forecasting system based on coupled hydrological and hydraulic modelling approach for the Chaudière River in Québec; and second is to assess its functionality over selected winter events. The forecasting system is developed within a well-known operational forecasting platform: the Delft Flood Early Warning System (Delft-FEWS). The current configuration of the systems integrates (i) meteorological products such as the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS); (ii) a hydrological module implemented through the HydrOlOgical Prediction LAboratory (HOOPLA), a multi-model based hydrological modelling framework; and (iii) hydraulic module implemented through a 1D steady and unsteady HEC-RAS river ice models. The system produces ensemble forecasts for discharge and water level and provides flexibility to modify various dynamic parameters within the modelling chain such as discharge timeseries, ice thickness, ice roughness as well as carryout hindcasting experiments in a batch production way. Performance of the coupled modelling approach was assessed using “Perfect forecast” over winter events between 2020 and 2023 winter seasons. The root mean square error (RMSE) and percent bias (Pbias) metrics were calculated. The hydrologic module of the system showed significant deviations from the observations. These deviations could be explained by the inherent uncertainty in the under-ice discharge estimates as well as uncertainty in the modelling chain. The hydraulic module of the system performed better and the Pbias was within ±10 %.",Kh Rahat Usman;Rodolfo Alvarado Montero;Tadros Ghobrial;François Anctil;Arnejan van Loenen,这篇论文主要关注的是加拿大寒冷地区河流的冰冻情况，以及如何利用耦合水文-水动力模型来预测冰下河流流量。它涉及到水文模型、水动力模型、冰冻条件等方面，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

Traditional modeling methods such as Lagrangian particle tracking and Eulerian discrete class (DC) methods have limitations as they are not best placed to account for the diverse characteristics of individual particles, namely, size, density, and shape, which are crucial for determining the transport of MPs. In this work, we address the issue of particle size diversity by using the population balance equations (PBE) method.

The evolution of particle size distribution is compared between the two methods using a simplified test case of a schematized estuary with tidal forcing and river discharge.

A multiwell plate protocol was developed to assess mitochondrial membrane potential using the JC-1 dye. The suitability of five common anesthetics was initially tested, and 5% ethanol performed best in terms of anesthetic effects and healthy recovery. The staining conditions were optimized to 30 min staining with 2 μM JC-1 for best J-aggregate formation. The protocol was validated with the model compound carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and used to measure the effect of four environmental contaminants, 2,4-dinitrophenol, triclosan, n-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), and ibuprofen, on mitochondrial health. Test organisms were imaged using an automated confocal microscope, and fluorescence intensities were automatically quantified. The effect concentrations for CCCP were lower by a factor of 30 compared with the traditional OECD 202 acute toxicity test. Mitochondrial effects were also detected at lower concentrations for all tested environmental contaminants compared to the OCED 202 test. For 2,4-dinitrophenol, mitochondria effects were detectable after 2 h exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations and predicted organism death was observed after 24 h.

This requires identifying and understanding a proxy that is well-correlated with ground-level ozone variation and available with spatiotemporal high-resolution data. This study introduces a high-resolution ozone modeling method utilizing the XGBoost algorithm with satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) as the primary predictor. Focusing on China in 2019, our model achieved a cross-validation R2 of 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13.51 μg/m3. We provide detailed maps highlighting ground-level ozone concentrations in urban areas, uncovering spatial variations previously unresolved, along with time series aligning with established understandings of ozone dynamics. Our local interpretation of the machine learning model underscores the significant contribution of LST to spatiotemporal ozone variations, surpassing other meteorological, pollutant, and geographical predictors in its influence. Validation results indicate that model performance decreases as spatial resolution becomes coarser, with R2 decreasing from 0.91 for the 1 km model to 0.85 for the 25 km model.

We adopted a sibling-matched case-control design to analyze 9332 stillbirths and 17,421 live births. We associated the risk of stillbirth simultaneously with dust and nondust components of PM2.5 and developed a nonlinear joint exposure–response function. Next, we estimated the burden of stillbirths attributable to the PM2.5 mixture. The concentration index was used to evaluate whether the burden of PM2.5-related stillbirths was disproportionally distributed among pregnancies exposed to dust-rich particles. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in dust PM2.5 was associated with a 14.5% (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 24.2%) increase in the odds of stillbirth.

Here, an ultrathin hydrogel layer (40 nm) with hydrophilic–hydrophobic textures was in situ grown onto the polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane surface using an organic-radical-initiated interfacial polymerization technique. The interfacial polymerization of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers ensured the molecular-scale distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanodomains on the membrane surface. These nanodomains, with their molecular lengths, facilitated dynamic repulsion interactions between the uniformly textured surface and foulant components with different degrees of hydrophilicity. Chemical force characterization confirmed that the adhesion force between the hydrophilic–hydrophobic textured membrane surface and foulants (dodecane, bovine serum albumin, and humic acid) was greatly reduced. Dynamic filtration experiments showed that a hydrophilic–hydrophobic textured membrane always possessed the largest water flux and the best antifouling performance. Furthermore, the foulant coverage ratio on the membrane surface was first evaluated by measuring changes in surface streaming potentials, which demonstrated a 69% reduction in the amount of foulant adhering to the hydrophilic–hydrophobic textured membrane surface. Therefore, the construction of hydrophilic–hydrophobic nanodomains on the membrane surface provides a promising strategy for alleviating membrane fouling caused by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components during ultralow pressurized ultrafiltration processes.",Mansheng Chen;Panpan Wang;Jiaying Yan;Shiyi Qiu;Hao Zhang;Hui Xie;Jun Ma,这篇论文主要研究了在超低压超滤过程中，通过在膜表面原位生长亲水-疏水纳米域来增强膜的防污能力。论文重点关注的是膜材料的表面改性，以提高其在水处理过程中的性能，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

LCMs were generally accumulated in organisms from sediment, and the LCM concentrations in all organisms ranged from 32.35 to 1367 ng/g lipid weight. The main LCMs in organisms were biphenyls and analogues (BAs) (76.6%), followed by cyanobiphenyls and analogues (CBAs) (15.1%), and the least were fluorinated biphenyls and analogues (FBAs) (11.2%).

This study examines the effect of low-level air pollution exposure on a subclinical biomarker of hyperglycemia (i.e., HbA1c) in pregnant people without diabetes before conception. We measured HbA1c in 577 samples repeatedly collected from 224 pregnant people in Rochester, NY, and estimated residential concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 using high-resolution spatiotemporal models. We observed a U-shaped trajectory of HbA1c during pregnancy with average HbA1c levels of 5.13 (±0.52), 4.97 (±0.54), and 5.43 (±0.40)% in early-, mid-, and late pregnancy, respectively. After adjustment for the U-shaped trajectory and classic GDM risk factors, each interquartile range increase in 10 week NO2 concentration (8.0 ppb) was associated with 0.09% (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.16%) and 0.18% (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.28%) increases in HbA1c over the entire pregnancy and in late pregnancy, respectively. These associations remained robust among participants without GDM. Using separate distributed lag models, we identified a period between 8th and 14th gestational weeks as critical windows responsible for increased levels of HbA1c measured at 14th, 22nd, and 30th gestational weeks.

The typical degradation route on titanium-based catalysts, “toluene–benzaldehyde–carbon dioxide”, necessitates the oxidation of the methyl group as a prerequisite for photocatalytic toluene oxidation. However, the inherent planar adsorption configuration of toluene molecules, dominated by the benzene rings, leads to significant steric hindrance for the methyl group. This steric hindrance prevents the methyl group from contacting the active species on the catalyst surface, thereby limiting the removal of toluene under indoor conditions. To date, no effective strategy to control the steric hindrance of the methyl group has been identified. Herein, we showed a B–Ti–O interface that exhibits significantly enhanced toluene removal efficiency under indoor conditions. In-depth investigations revealed that, compared to typical Ti-based photocatalysts, the steric hindrance between the methyl group and the catalyst surface decreased from 3.42 to 3.03 Å on the designed interface. This reduction originates from the matching of orbital energy levels between Ti 3dz2 and C 2pz of the benzene ring. The decreased steric hindrance improved the efficiency of toluene being attacked by surface active species, allowing for rapid conversion into benzaldehyde and benzoic acid species for subsequent reactions.

In this study, the contribution of a typical abiotic (photoaging) and biotic (biodegradation) process and the underlying aging pathway of MPs with different degradabilities (including polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polylactic acid) were studied. With a quantified relative importance of photoaging (>55%) vs biodegradation, the crucial contribution of photoaging on MP aging was highlighted. This was likely attributed to more generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under sunlight irradiation conditions, containing O2•– and H2O2. By raising higher the level of malondialdehyde (0.5–3.5 times as high as that in the dark condition), these photochemically formed ROS caused oxidative stress and inhibited the selective attachment of plastic-degrading microbes on the MP surface, thereby weakening the effect of biodegradation. On this basis, the aging characteristics and potential pathway of different MPs were revealed. The functional group of nondegradable polypropylene tends to be broken by ROS first, while biodegradation (Arthrobacter oryzae and Bacillus sp.) played a relatively dominant role in biodegradable polylactic acid.

Herein, we designed a nanoconfined FeCo2O4-embedded ceramic membrane (FeCo2O4−CM) under flow-through pattern for PMS activation. Confining PMS and FeCo2O4 within nanochannels (3.0−4.7 nm) enhanced adsorption interactions (−7.84 eV vs −2.20 eV), thus boosting mass transfer. Nanoconfinement effect regulated electron transfer pathways from PMS to FeCo2O4−CM by modulating the active site transformation to ≡Co(III) in nanoconfined FeCo2O4−CM, enabling selectively generating 1O2. The primary role of 1O2 in the nanoconfined system was confirmed by kinetic solvent isotope experiments and indicative anthracene endoperoxide (DPAO2).

Source-to-health benefit relationships are quantified using a benefit-per-ton (BPT) metric, accounting for the impacts on premature mortality due to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter. In the base analysis, the approach used a 12 km resolution, four 2-week episodes chosen to capture annual responses, emissions for 2016, and the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to link exposures to premature mortality. Here, we investigate the impacts those choices have on results using a range of sensitivity analyses. The choice of four representative episodes led to relatively little bias and error. Finer model resolution, investigated by comparing 36, 12, 4, and 1 km simulations over two urban areas, tended to increase BPT estimates, though the impact was inconsistent between different regions. While BPTs and burden estimates were consistent across resolutions over New York City, they sharply increased for Los Angeles, particularly for NOx and ammonia, leading to 90% increase in burden estimates at 1 km resolution. We find that, for primary PM2.5 emissions, better resolved population distribution is the main contributing factor to higher BPTs, but for secondary precursor emissions (ammonia and NOx), higher model resolution that avoids dilution in coarser grids is more important. Changing emissions from 2016 to 2001 and 2028 resulted in fairly consistent primary PM2.5 BPTs but impacted the BPTs for NOx and ammonia more significantly due to changes in SO2 emissions. We found that BPTs tend to stabilize, as emission changes in 2028 lead to a lower deviation from 2016 BPTs compared to changes from the 2001 episode. The role of the epidemiological model also led to relatively modest uncertainties, 15–30% depending on the species, even when different shapes of concentration–response functions were employed. We found the impact of the choice of CRF to be larger or comparable in size to the reported epidemiological model uncertainties for log–linear CRFs.

 The 2023 Canadian forest fires have been extreme in scale and intensity with more than seven times the average annual area burned compared to the previous four decades1. Here, we quantify the carbon emissions from these fires from May to September 2023 on the basis of inverse modelling of satellite carbon monoxide observations. We find that the magnitude of the carbon emissions is 647 TgC (570–727 TgC), comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of large nations, with only India, China and the USA releasing more carbon per year2. We find that widespread hot–dry weather was a principal driver of fire spread, with 2023 being the warmest and driest year since at least 19803. Although temperatures were extreme relative to the historical record, climate projections indicate that these temperatures are likely to be typical during the 2050s, even under a moderate climate mitigation scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway, SSP 2–4.5)4. Such conditions are likely to drive increased fire activity and suppress carbon uptake by Canadian forests, adding to concerns about the long-term durability of these forests as a carbon sink5–8.

 Numerous correlated many-body phases, both conventional and exotic, have been reported in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1–24. However, the dynamics associated with these correlated states, crucial for understanding the underlying physics, remain unexplored. Here we combine exciton sensing and optical pump–probe spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of isospin orders in MATBG with WSe2 substrate across the entire flat band, achieving sub-picosecond resolution. We observe remarkably slow isospin dynamics in a broad filling range around ν = 2 and between ν = −3 and −2, with lifetimes of up to 300 ps that decouple from the much faster cooling of electronic temperature (about 10 ps). This non-thermal behaviour demonstrates the presence of abnormally long-lived modes in the isospin degrees of freedom. This observation, not anticipated by theory, implies the existence of long-range propagating collective modes, strong isospin fluctuations and memory effects and is probably associated with an intervalley coherent or incommensurate Kekulé spiral ground state. We further demonstrate non-equilibrium control of the isospin orders previously found around integer fillings. Specifically, through ultrafast manipulation, it can be transiently shifted away from integer fillings. Our study demonstrates a unique probe of collective excitations in MATBG and paves the way for actively controlling non-equilibrium phenomena in moiré systems.

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has recently been associated with diverse cell states1–11, yet when and how these states affect the onset of AD remains unclear. Here we used a data-driven approach to reconstruct the dynamics of the brain’s cellular environment and identified a trajectory leading to AD that is distinct from other ageing-related effects. First, we built a comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.65 million single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles sampled from 437 older individuals, and identified specific glial and neuronal subpopulations associated with AD-related traits. Causal modelling then prioritized two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations—one drives amyloid-β proteinopathy while the other mediates the effect of amyloid-β on tau proteinopathy—as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediates the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the dynamics of cellular environments, we devised the BEYOND methodology, which identified two distinct trajectories of brain ageing, each defined by coordinated progressive changes in certain cellular communities that lead to (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain ageing. Thus, we provide a cellular foundation for a new perspective on AD pathophysiology that informs personalized therapeutic development, targeting different cellular communities for individuals on the path to AD or to alternative brain ageing.

10.1038/s41586-024-07890-3,Nature,False,[],Mating proximity blinds threat perception,"A state-dependent dopamine filter system in the male Drosophila brain balances threat perception against the drive to mate. 
 Romantic engagement can bias sensory perception. This ‘love blindness’ reflects a common behavioural principle across organisms: favouring pursuit of a coveted reward over potential risks1. In the case of animal courtship, such sensory biases may support reproductive success but can also expose individuals to danger, such as predation2,3. However, how neural networks balance the trade-off between risk and reward is unknown. Here we discover a dopamine-governed filter mechanism in male Drosophila that reduces threat perception as courtship progresses. We show that during early courtship stages, threat-activated visual neurons inhibit central courtship nodes via specific serotonergic neurons. This serotonergic inhibition prompts flies to abort courtship when they see imminent danger. However, as flies advance in the courtship process, the dopaminergic filter system reduces visual threat responses, shifting the balance from survival to mating. By recording neural activity from males as they approach mating, we demonstrate that progress in courtship is registered as dopaminergic activity levels ramping up. This dopamine signalling inhibits the visual threat detection pathway via Dop2R receptors, allowing male flies to focus on courtship when they are close to copulation. Thus, dopamine signalling biases sensory perception based on perceived goal proximity, to prioritize between competing behaviours.

 Cold plasma of ionospheric origin has recently been found to be a much larger contributor to the magnetosphere of Earth than expected1–3. Numerous competing mechanisms have been postulated to drive ion escape to space, including heating and acceleration by wave–particle interactions4 and a global electrostatic field between the ionosphere and space (called the ambipolar or polarization field)5,6. Observations of heated O+ ions in the magnetosphere are consistent with resonant wave–particle interactions7. By contrast, observations of cold supersonic H+ flowing out of the polar ionosphere8,9 (called the polar wind) suggest the presence of an electrostatic field. Here we report the existence of a +0.55 ± 0.09 V electric potential drop between 250 km and 768 km from a planetary electrostatic field (E∥⊕ = 1.09 ± 0.17 μV m−1) generated exclusively by the outward pressure of ionospheric electrons. We experimentally demonstrate that the ambipolar field of Earth controls the structure of the polar ionosphere, boosting the scale height by 271%. We infer that this increases the supply of cold O+ ions to the magnetosphere by more than 3,800%, in which other mechanisms such as wave–particle interactions can heat and further accelerate them to escape velocity. The electrostatic field of Earth is strong enough by itself to drive the polar wind9,10 and is probably the origin of the cold H+ ion population1 that dominates much of the magnetosphere2,3.

 Spatial learning in teleost fish requires an intact telencephalon1, a brain region that contains putative analogues to components of the mammalian limbic system (for example, hippocampus)2–4. However, cells fundamental to spatial cognition in mammals—for example, place cells (PCs)5,6—have yet to be established in any fish species. In this study, using tracking microscopy to record brain-wide calcium activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish7, we compute the spatial information content8 of each neuron across the brain. Strikingly, in every recorded animal, cells with the highest spatial specificity were enriched in the zebrafish telencephalon. These PCs form a population code of space from which we can decode the animal’s spatial location across time. By continuous recording of population-level activity, we found that the activity manifold of PCs refines and untangles over time. Through systematic manipulation of allothetic and idiothetic cues, we demonstrate that zebrafish PCs integrate multiple sources of information and can flexibly remap to form distinct spatial maps. Using analysis of neighbourhood distance between PCs across environments, we found evidence for a weakly preconfigured network in the telencephalon. The discovery of zebrafish PCs represents a step forward in our understanding of spatial cognition across species and the functional role of the early vertebrate telencephalon.

 Early expansion and long-term persistence predict efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs)1–7, but mechanisms governing effector versus memory CART differentiation and whether asymmetric cell division induces differential fates in human CARTs remain unclear. Here we show that target-induced proximity labelling enables isolation of first-division proximal-daughter and distal-daughter CD8 CARTs that asymmetrically distribute their surface proteome and transcriptome, resulting in divergent fates. Target-engaged CARs remain on proximal daughters, which inherit a surface proteome resembling activated-undivided CARTs, whereas the endogenous T cell receptor and CD8 enrich on distal daughters, whose surface proteome resembles resting CARTs, correlating with glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, respectively. Despite memory-precursor phenotype and in vivo longevity, distal daughters demonstrate transient potent cytolytic activity similar to proximal daughters, uncovering an effector-like state in distal daughters destined to become memory CARTs. Both partitioning of pre-existing transcripts and changes in RNA velocity contribute to asymmetry of fate-determining factors, resulting in diametrically opposed transcriptional trajectories. Independent of naive, memory or effector surface immunophenotype, proximal-daughter CARTs use core sets of transcription factors known to support proliferation and effector function. Conversely, transcription factors enriched in distal daughters restrain differentiation and promote longevity, evidenced by diminished long-term in vivo persistence and function of distal-daughter CARTs after IKZF1 disruption. These studies establish asymmetric cell division as a framework for understanding mechanisms of CART differentiation and improving therapeutic outcomes.

 Sterile inflammation after myocardial infarction is classically credited to myeloid cells interacting with dead cell debris in the infarct zone1,2. Here we show that cardiomyocytes are the dominant initiators of a previously undescribed type I interferon response in the infarct borderzone. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis in mice and humans, we find that myocardial infarction induces colonies of interferon-induced cells (IFNICs) expressing interferon-stimulated genes decorating the borderzone, where cardiomyocytes experience mechanical stress, nuclear rupture and escape of chromosomal DNA. Cardiomyocyte-selective deletion of Irf3 abrogated IFNIC colonies, whereas mice lacking Irf3 in fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils or endothelial cells, Ccr2-deficient mice or plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-depleted mice did not. Interferons blunted the protective matricellular programs and contractile function of borderzone fibroblasts, and increased vulnerability to pathological remodelling. In mice that died after myocardial infarction, IFNIC colonies were immediately adjacent to sites of ventricular rupture, while mice lacking IFNICs were protected from rupture and exhibited improved survival3. Together, these results reveal a pathological borderzone niche characterized by a cardiomyocyte-initiated innate immune response. We suggest that selective inhibition of IRF3 activation in non-immune cells could limit ischaemic cardiomyopathy while avoiding broad immunosuppression.

 Faithful DNA replication is essential for genome integrity1–4. Under-replicated DNA leads to defects in chromosome segregation, which are common during embryogenesis5–8. However, the regulation of DNA replication remains poorly understood in early mammalian embryos. Here we constructed a single-cell genome-wide DNA replication atlas of pre-implantation mouse embryos and identified an abrupt replication program switch accompanied by a transient period of genomic instability. In 1- and 2-cell embryos, we observed the complete absence of a replication timing program, and the entire genome replicated gradually and uniformly using extremely slow-moving replication forks. In 4-cell embryos, a somatic-cell-like replication timing program commenced abruptly. However, the fork speed was still slow, S phase was extended, and markers of replication stress, DNA damage and repair increased. This was followed by an increase in break-type chromosome segregation errors specifically during the 4-to-8-cell division with breakpoints enriched in late-replicating regions. These errors were rescued by nucleoside supplementation, which accelerated fork speed and reduced the replication stress. By the 8-cell stage, forks gained speed, S phase was no longer extended and chromosome aberrations decreased. Thus, a transient period of genomic instability exists during normal mouse development, preceded by an S phase lacking coordination between replisome-level regulation and megabase-scale replication timing regulation, implicating a link between their coordination and genome stability.

 Superconductivity in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years (refs. 1–5), yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve6,7. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials8, which exhibit both superconductivity9–11 and charge-density-wave orders12–14, are nonmagnetic8,9 and weakly correlated15,16. Thus these materials are unlikely to host the exotic superconductivity theoretically proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr3Sb5, which is contrastingly featured with strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, this kagome metal undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, with a stripe-like 4a0 structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, possibly associated with charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings. These density-wave-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65–8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, Tcmax = 6.4 K, appears when the density-wave-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors17,18.

 Early plant responses to different stress situations often encompass cytosolic Ca2+ increases, plasma membrane depolarization and the generation of reactive oxygen species1–3. However, the mechanisms by which these signalling elements are translated into defined physiological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, to study the basis for encoding of specificity in plant signal processing, we used light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins). We developed a genetically engineered channelrhodopsin variant called XXM 2.0 with high Ca2+ conductance that enabled triggering cytosolic Ca2+ elevations in planta. Plant responses to light-induced Ca2+ influx through XXM 2.0 were studied side by side with effects caused by an anion efflux through the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin ACR1 2.04. Although both tools triggered membrane depolarizations, their activation led to distinct plant stress responses: XXM 2.0-induced Ca2+ signals stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and defence mechanisms; ACR1 2.0-mediated anion efflux triggered drought stress responses. Our findings imply that discrete Ca2+ signals and anion efflux serve as triggers for specific metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming enabling plants to adapt to particular stress situations. Our optogenetics approach unveiled that within plant leaves, distinct physiological responses are triggered by specific ion fluxes, which are accompanied by similar electrical signals.

In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), phase engineering using chemical lithiation with the organometallization agent n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), to convert the semiconducting 2H (trigonal) to the metallic 1T (octahedral) phase, has been widely explored for applications in areas such as transistors, catalysis and batteries1–15. Although this chemical phase engineering can be performed at ambient temperatures and pressures, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the use of n-BuLi raises notable safety concerns. Here we optically visualize the archetypical phase transition from the 2H to the 1T phase in mono- and bilayer 2D TMDs and discover that this reaction can be accelerated by up to six orders of magnitude using low-power illumination at 455 nm. We identify that the above-gap illumination improves the rate-limiting charge-transfer kinetics through a photoredox process. We use this method to achieve rapid and high-quality phase engineering of TMDs and demonstrate that this methodology can be harnessed to inscribe arbitrary phase patterns with diffraction-limited edge resolution into few-layer TMDs. Finally, we replace pyrophoric n-BuLi with safer polycyclic aromatic organolithiation agents and show that their performance exceeds that of n-BuLi as a phase transition agent. Our work opens opportunities for exploring the in situ characterization of electrochemical processes and paves the way for sustainably scaling up materials and devices by photoredox phase engineering.

10.1038/s41586-024-07851-w,Nature,False,[],Cooperative thalamocortical circuit mechanism for sensory prediction errors,"Experiments in mice show that a cortico-thalamic circuit generates prediction-error signals in primary visual cortex that amplify visual input that deviates from animals’ expectations. 
 The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1–10. Despite the importance of prediction-error signals for various neural computations across the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit that is required for generating sensory prediction-error signals in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that violating animals’ predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of the layer 2/3 V1 neurons that are most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing non-specific surprise or difference signals about how the visual input deviates from the animal’s predictions. This selective amplification is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits. Experiments in mice show that a cortico-thalamic circuit generates prediction-error signals in primary visual cortex that amplify visual input that deviates from animals’ expectations.",Shohei Furutachi;Alexis D.

 Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing1,2 to informing hiring decisions3. However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans4–7. Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement8,9. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology.

 Severe defects in human IFNγ immunity predispose individuals to both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis, whereas milder defects predispose only to tuberculosis1. Here we report two adults with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis who are homozygous for a private loss-of-function TNF variant. Neither has any other clinical phenotype and both mount normal clinical and biological inflammatory responses. Their leukocytes, including monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not produce TNF, even after stimulation with IFNγ. Blood leukocyte subset development is normal in these patients. However, an impairment in the respiratory burst was observed in granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-matured MDMs and alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells2 from both patients with TNF deficiency, TNF- or TNFR1-deficient induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived GM-CSF-matured macrophages, and healthy control MDMs and AML cells differentiated with TNF blockers in vitro, and in lung macrophages treated with TNF blockers ex vivo. The stimulation of TNF-deficient iPS-cell-derived macrophages with TNF rescued the respiratory burst. These findings contrast with those for patients with inherited complete deficiency of the respiratory burst across all phagocytes, who are prone to multiple infections, including both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis3. Human TNF is required for respiratory-burst-dependent immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages but is surprisingly redundant otherwise, including for inflammation and immunity to weakly virulent mycobacteria and many other infectious agents.

 Fertilization introduces parental genetic information into the zygote to guide embryogenesis. Parental contributions to postfertilization development have been discussed for decades, and the data available show that both parents contribute to the zygotic transcriptome, suggesting a paternal role in early embryogenesis1–6. However, because the specific paternal effects on postfertilization development and the molecular pathways underpinning these effects remain poorly understood, paternal contribution to early embryogenesis and plant development has not yet been adequately demonstrated7. Here our research shows that TREE1 and its homologue DAZ3 are expressed exclusively in Arabidopsis sperm. Despite presenting no evident defects in sperm development and fertilization, tree1 daz3 unexpectedly led to aberrant differentiation of the embryo root stem cell niche. This defect persisted in seedlings and disrupted root tip regeneration, comparable to congenital defects in animals. TREE1 and DAZ3 function by suppression of maternal RKD2 transcription, thus mitigating the detrimental maternal effects from RKD2 on root stem cell niche. Therefore, our findings illuminate how genetic deficiencies in sperm can exert enduring paternal effects on specific plant organ differentiation and how parental-of-origin genes interact to ensure normal embryogenesis. This work also provides a new concept of how gamete quality or genetic deficiency can affect specific plant organ formation.

 Life-threatening thrombotic events and neurological symptoms are prevalent in COVID-19 and are persistent in patients with long COVID experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection1–4. Despite the clinical evidence1,5–7, the underlying mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 and its consequences in inflammation and neuropathology remain poorly understood and treatment options are insufficient. Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits1,5,8–10. Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID.

 Artificial intelligence-guided closed-loop experimentation has emerged as a promising method for optimization of objective functions1,2, but the substantial potential of this traditionally black-box approach to uncovering new chemical knowledge has remained largely untapped. Here we report the integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer (CLT), to yield chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions. CLT was used to examine the factors dictating the photostability in solution of light-harvesting donor–acceptor molecules used in a variety of organic electronics applications, and showed fundamental insights including the importance of high-energy regions of the triplet state manifold. This was possible following automated modular synthesis and experimental characterization of only around 1.5% of the theoretical chemical space. This physics-informed model for photostability was strengthened using multiple experimental test sets and validated by tuning the triplet excited-state energy of the solvent to break out of the observed plateau in the closed-loop photostability optimization process. Further applications of CLT to additional materials systems support the generalizability of this strategy for augmenting closed-loop strategies. Broadly, these findings show that combining interpretable supervised learning models and physics-based features with closed-loop discovery processes can rapidly provide fundamental chemical insights.

Here the authors find that RNase H1 displays 3′-to-5′ exonuclease activity. Moreover, RPA reinforces RNase H1’s 3′-to-5′ nucleolytic rate and processivity and stimulates its 5′-to-3′ exonuclease activity. 
 RNase H1 has been acknowledged as an endoribonuclease specializing in the internal degradation of the RNA moiety within RNA–DNA hybrids, and its ribonuclease activity is indispensable in multifaceted aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism underlying RNase H1-mediated hybrid cleavage remains inadequately elucidated. Herein, using single-molecule approaches, we probe the dynamics of the hybrid cleavage by Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase H1. Remarkably, a single RNase H1 enzyme displays 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity. The directional RNA degradation proceeds processively and yet discretely, wherein unwinding approximately 6-bp hybrids as a prerequisite for two consecutive 3-nt RNA excisions limits the overall rate within each catalytic cycle. Moreover, Replication Protein A (RPA) reinforces RNase H1’s 3′-to-5′ nucleolytic rate and processivity and stimulates its 5′-to-3′ exoribonuclease activity. This stimulation is primarily realized through the pre-separation of the hybrids and consequently transfers RNase H1 to a bidirectional exoribonuclease, further potentiating its cleavage efficiency. These findings unveil unprecedented characteristics of an RNase and provide a dynamic view of RPA-enhanced processive hybrid cleavage by RNase H1.

 Anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have the dual potential of mediating virus neutralization and antiviral effector functions through their Fab and Fc domains, respectively. So far, bNAbs with enhanced Fc effector functions in vitro have only been tested in NHPs during chronic simian-HIV (SHIV) infection. Here, we investigate the effects of administering in acute SHIVAD8-EO infection either wild-type (WT) bNAbs or bNAbs carrying the S239D/I332E/A330L (DEL) mutation, which increases binding to FcγRs. Emergence of virus in plasma and lymph nodes (LNs) was delayed by bNAb treatment and occurred earlier in monkeys given DEL bNAbs than in those given WT bNAbs, consistent with faster clearance of DEL bNAbs from plasma. DEL bNAb-treated monkeys had higher levels of circulating virus-specific IFNγ single-producing CD8+ CD69+ T cells than the other groups. In LNs, WT bNAbs were evenly distributed between follicular and extrafollicular areas, but DEL bNAbs predominated in the latter. At week 8 post-challenge, LN monocytes and NK cells from DEL bNAb-treated monkeys upregulated proinflammatory signaling pathways and LN T cells downregulated TNF signaling via NF-κB. Overall, bNAbs with increased affinity to FcγRs shape innate and adaptive cellular immunity, which may be important to consider in future strategies of passive bNAb therapy. In this work, the authors study the immunological and virological effects of administering either wild-type anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) or bNAbs with a mutation that increases binding to Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) to rhesus macaques in the acute phase of SHIVAD8-EO infection.",Joana Dias;Giulia Fabozzi;Slim Fourati;Xuejun Chen;Cuiping Liu;David R.

Using 1,1’-thiocarbonyldiimidazole chemistry, the authors propose a double network hydrogel formulation for heart valve regeneration. 
 Regenerative heart valve prostheses are essential for treating valvular heart disease, which requested interactive materials that can adapt to the tissue remodeling process. Such materials typically involves intricate designs with multiple active components, limiting their translational potential. This study introduces a facile method to engineer interactive materials for heart valve regeneration using 1,1’-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (TCDI) chemistry. TCDI crosslinking forms cleavable thiourea and thiocarbamate linkages which could gradually release H2S during degradation, therefore regulates the immune microenvironment and accelerates tissue remodeling. By employing this approach, a double network hydrogel was formed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs), showcasing robust anti-calcification and anti-thrombosis properties post fatigue testing. Post-implantation, the DHVs could adaptively degrade during recellularization, releasing H2S to further support tissue regeneration. Therefore, the comprehensive endothelial cell coverage and notable extracellular matrix remodeling could be clearly observed. This accessible and integrated strategy effectively overcomes various limitations of bioprosthetic valves, showing promise as an attractive approach for immune modulation of biomaterials.

Here, by comparing markers during acute infection in individuals who developed PASC with those who recovered, the authors found that early viral dynamics and immune responses might play a role in PASC pathogenesis. 
 To understand the roles of acute-phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test. Participants self-collected up to 21 nasal specimens within the first 28 days post-symptom onset; interviewer-administered questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment, days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom onset. Defining PASC as the presence of any COVID-associated symptom at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of nasal viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. Compared to those who fully recovered, those reporting PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and N-antigen, burden of RNA and infectious viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within 9 days post-illness onset. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers. Our results suggest early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC, highlighting the importance of understanding early biological markers in the natural history of PASC.

10.1038/s41467-024-51875-9,Nature Communications,False,[],Hydrogen sulfide coordinates glucose metabolism switch through destabilizing tetrameric pyruvate kinase M2,"Low level of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activity in cancer cells is essential for the dependence on aerobic glycolysis. Here the authors show that PKM2 sulfhydration by hydrogen sulfide destabilizes the PKM2 tetramer, leading to reduced PKM2 enzyme activity and enhanced proliferation of breast cancer cells. 
 Most cancer cells reprogram their glucose metabolic pathway from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis for energy production. By reducing enzyme activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), cancer cells attain a greater fraction of glycolytic metabolites for macromolecule synthesis needed for rapid proliferation. Here we demonstrate that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) destabilizes the PKM2 tetramer into monomer/dimer through sulfhydration at cysteines, notably at C326, leading to reduced PKM2 enzyme activity and increased PKM2-mediated transcriptional activation. Blocking PKM2 sulfhydration at C326 through amino acid mutation stabilizes the PKM2 tetramer and crystal structure further revealing the tetramer organization of PKM2-C326S. The PKM2-C326S mutant in cancer cells rewires glucose metabolism to mitochondrial respiration, significantly inhibiting tumor growth. In this work, we demonstrate that PKM2 sulfhydration by H2S inactivates PKM2 activity to promote tumorigenesis and inhibiting this process could be a potential therapeutic approach for targeting cancer metabolism.

Here, the authors show that image acquisition parameters influence AI models trained to predict patient race from chest x-rays and that mitigating these factors reduces an underdiagnosis bias. 
 A core motivation for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is to reduce existing healthcare disparities. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated two distinct findings: (1) AI models can show performance biases in underserved populations, and (2) these same models can be directly trained to recognize patient demographics, such as predicting self-reported race from medical images alone. Here, we investigate how these findings may be related, with an end goal of reducing a previously identified underdiagnosis bias. Using two popular chest x-ray datasets, we first demonstrate that technical parameters related to image acquisition and processing influence AI models trained to predict patient race, where these results partly reflect underlying biases in the original clinical datasets. We then find that mitigating the observed differences through a demographics-independent calibration strategy reduces the previously identified bias. While many factors likely contribute to AI bias and demographics prediction, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering data acquisition and processing parameters in AI development and healthcare equity more broadly. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can perform unequally across patient groups and can also be trained to recognize patient demographics.

They show divergent responses to short- and long-term drainage in Sphagnum versus non-Sphagnum wetlands determined by plant traits and plant–microbe interactions. 
 The carbon storage of wetlands is related to inhibited enzyme activity (particularly phenol oxidase) under oxygen-deprived conditions. However, phenol oxidase response to field drainage is highly uncertain, constraining our ability to predict wetland carbon–climate feedbacks. Here, using literature data, laboratory simulations and a pair-wise survey of 30 diverse wetlands experiencing long-term (15–55 years) drainage across China, we show that while short-term drainage generally leads to increased phenol oxidative activity, its response to long-term drainage diverges in Sphagnum versus non-Sphagnum wetlands. In non-Sphagnum wetlands, long-term drainage is linked to increased plant secondary metabolites and decreased phenol oxidase-producing microbes, while in Sphagnum wetlands, drainage is linked to replacement of antimicrobial Sphagnum by vascular plants and increased phenol oxidative activity with cascading effects on hydrolytic enzymes. Our findings highlight that trait-based plant dynamics are pivotal to decipher wetland carbon dynamics and feedback to climate change under shifting hydrological regimes.

 The growing global capacity for renewable energy generation necessitates the deployment of energy storage technologies with a combination of low cost, good performance and scalability. With these advantages, aqueous organic flow batteries have the potential to be the system of choice because they could store energy from organic redox-active molecules. Here we report naphthalene derivatives as organic redox-active molecules that exhibit high solubility (~1.5 M) and a stable redox-active framework with no obvious capacity decay over 40 days (50 Ah l−1) in an air atmosphere in flow batteries. We report a battery that runs smoothly even under continuous airflow without obvious capacity decay for ~22 days (more than 600 cycles). A series of spectral analyses and theoretical calculations reveal that the dimethylamine scaffolds improve the water solubility and protect the active centre, ensuring the stability of the molecules during the charge and discharge process. Owing to the success in kilogramme-scale molecular synthesis, pilot-scale stack expansion with notable cycling stability over 270 cycles (~27 days) is attained. The cost benefit evidenced by technoeconomic analysis together with the stability even under open-air conditions indicates the practical value of the present molecular system in grid-scale energy storage.

Here the authors develop a membrane-free electrochemical system that allows efficient and robust ammonia recovery from real nitrate-rich wastewater. 
 Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction has great potential for simultaneously achieving ammonia recovery and nitrate-rich wastewater treatment. However, the complexity of wastewater matrices has long hampered its implementation and commercialization in the wastewater treatment industry. Here we develop a membrane-free electrochemical system, called electrochemical NO3− conversion synchronized with NH3 recovery (ECSN), which synchronizes nitrate reduction with ammonia recovery for treating real nitrate-rich wastewater. Key components of this system include a 3D-printed metallic glass decorated Cu–Ni (MPCN) working electrode bearing good corrosion resistance and a UV-assisted stripping unit. When treating real electroplating wastewater, the ECSN system converts over 70% of nitrate into high-purity ammonia chloride. Long-term stability test demonstrates the robustness of the ECSN system in treating real wastewater. Further, the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of this system are evidenced by technoeconomic analysis and life-cycle analysis. Overall, this work brings the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction process one step closer to practical application, contributing to both environmental protection and the circularity of anthropogenic nitrogen flow.

This study evaluates the impact of pesticide use on wild bee populations across the contiguous United States. 
 The decline of many wild bee species has major consequences for pollination in natural and agro-ecosystems. One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation. Bees provide important pollination ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but the extent to which they are affected by pesticide use on a continental scale has yet to be explored.

 Wastewater treatment is a major source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the current emission estimations rely on a uniform emission factor (EF) proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change based on a limited database suffering from large uncertainties and inaccuracies. To address this limitation, this study expands the database 12-fold and develops a tier-based approach. Our method considers emission variations across spatial scales, treatment processes and monitoring techniques, enabling more-precise estimations. Here, applying this approach to the US database, we highlight the limitations of current estimations based on uniform EFs and quantified the mean wastewater N2O emission in the United States to be 11.6 MMT CO2-eq. The results also reveal the diverse nature of wastewater N2O emissions and underscore the need for a customized approach to inform facility-level N2O emission estimation as well as inform national- and sector-wide greenhouse gases inventories with emphasis on site-specific considerations.

This study assessed the impact of such global change drivers on tree species distributions across Southeast Asian forests. 
 The forests of Southeast Asia harbour high levels of species diversity, providing a plethora of ecosystem services. However, this biodiversity is threatened by both climate and land-use change, the impacts of which are poorly understood. We modelled 1,498 tree species distributions under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with varying global change intensities, and classified species into 11 spatially associated groups. We found both global changes to cause severe losses in tree distributions. Only under SSP1–2.6, the sustainable pathway with low intensities in both global changes, were distribution losses mitigated. Unexpectedly, losses were overall greatest under intermediate climate change pathways SSP2–4.5 and SSP3–7.0 rather than under the most extreme pathway, SSP5–8.5. This was because, although climate-driven losses were greatest under SSP5–8.5, land-use-driven losses were much more extensive under SSP2–4.5 and SSP3–7.0 than under SSP5–8.5. Crucially, other than SSP1–2.6, each SSP led to worst-case scenarios for several species groups. Our findings highlight that to most effectively conserve Southeast Asian tree distributions, policymakers need to prioritize a sustainable pathway that mitigates both global changes.

An spontaneous lithiation strategy enables direct recycling of spent cathode material at ambient conditions, with clear economic and environmental benefits. 
 Direct recycling is a promising route for the sustainable management of end-of-life spent cathodes. However, its practical implementation is greatly restricted as most existing methods require heating or high-pressure conditions during the lithiation step to overcome the thermodynamic obstacles and realize lithium replenishment. In this study, we explored a strategy to realize spontaneous lithiation via simple solid–liquid mixing at ambient conditions. The thermodynamic barrier of the lithiation reaction was reduced by self-adsorbed amyloxylithium, which can spontaneously adsorb on the surface of degraded cathode particles without an external driving force. This strategy can regenerate both laboratory-dismantled LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 from 10 Ah pouch cells and industrial-dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. The capacity retention rate of a 1 Ah pouch cell assembled using regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 as cathode material was 80.5% after 500 cycles. The proposed strategy has big economic advantages over conventional pyro- and hydrometallurgical methods, as evidenced by the techno-economic analysis, accompanied by obvious environmental benefits, as evidenced by reduced CO2 emissions.

 Deposition of wildfire smoke on snow contributes to its darkening and accelerated snowmelt. Recent field studies have identified dark brown carbon (d-BrC) to contribute 50–75% of shortwave absorption in wildfire smoke. d-BrC is a distinct class of water-insoluble, light-absorbing organic carbon that co-exists in abundance with black carbon (BC) in snow across the world. However, the importance of d-BrC as a snow warming agent relative to BC remains unexplored. We address this gap using aerosol-snow radiative transfer calculations on datasets from laboratory and field measurement. We show d-BrC increases the annual mean snow radiative forcing between 0.6 and 17.9 W m−2, corresponding to different wildfire smoke deposition scenarios. This is a 1.6 to 2.1-fold enhancement when compared with BC-only deposition on snow.

 Long-lasting La Niña events (including double-year and triple-year La Niña events) have become more frequent in recent years. How the multi-year La Niña events affect tropical cyclone (TC) activities in the western North Pacific (WNP) and whether they differ from single-year La Niña events are unknown. Here we show that TCs are more active over the far-WNP (FWNP, 110°–150°E), leading to marked high risks at China coasts during the second decaying summer of double-year La Niña events. The anomalous TC activities are directly related to the enhanced cyclonic anomaly over the FWNP, possibly a result of large-scale remote forcing initiated by the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) cooling. The persistent TNA cooling from the decaying winter to summer of double-year La Niña events drives westerlies over the Indo-western Pacific through Kelvin waves, which induce the cooling over the north Indian Ocean via the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature effect, favoring the asymmetric heat distribution pattern and stimulating an anomalous vertical circulation over the eastern Indian Ocean to FWNP. The cooling over the north Indian Ocean also excites Gill responses, magnifying the TNA-induced westerlies and boosting the anomalous vertical circulation, and thus gives rise to the strong cyclonic circulation anomaly over the FWNP in summer. We suggest that the key point of the process is the strong TNA cooling related to the persistent negative Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) while double-year La Niña events decay, distinct from the rapid decline of PNA and NAO during single-year La Niña events.

Here, we aimed to observationally quantify the full aerosol effects on DCS by tracking their entire lifecycle and spatial extent in tropical regions. We found that fine aerosols (FA) can invigorate DCS, making them taller and longer lived, and resulting in up to ×5 increase in total area and rainfall amount. In contrast, added coarse sea salt aerosols (CSA) over the ocean can inhibit the vertical development of DCS through enhancing warm rain formation, yet resulting in longer lived and extensive DCSs. Notably, combining FA and CSA generates the strongest aerosol invigoration effect at the concentrations of ~5 and ~80 μg/m³, leading up to ×10 increase in rainfall amount.

 Detecting and interpreting long-term changes in typhoon translation speed in observations remains challenging, contrasting with increased confidence in the poleward migration of typhoons. Here, I show a significant relationship between the basin-wide translation speed and the latitudinal position of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific over 1980–2023. First, because tropical cyclones move faster at higher latitudes, the significant poleward migration (80 km/decade) increases the yearly basin-wide translation speed by 5% over the period. This effect reduces the detectability of a slowing trend. Second, the basin-wide translation speed solely contributed by regional translation speed has slowed by 18%, mostly in the late stage of the cyclone lifecycle.

In this study, a comprehensive field observation of HONO was conducted in the autumn of 2021 in urban Beijing. The box model using a default Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) was unable to reproduce the observed HONO concentrations with a normalized mean bias (NMB) of −92.8%.

 Shifts in the magnesium to calcium ratio of seawater in the geological history are thought to have profoundly affected biomineralization of marine invertebrates, including some echinoderms, which changed their skeletal mineralogy from high-magnesium to low-magnesium calcite and vice versa. Here we report on experiments that aimed to investigate the effect of ambient seawater magnesium to calcium ratio on magnesium to calcium ratio and nanomechanical properties in the spines of two echinoid species (Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus). We found that echinoids cultured in seawater with a low magnesium to calcium ratio produced a skeleton with lower both magnesium content and nanohardness than those of the control specimens incubated under normal (high) magnesium to calcium ratio conditions.

Increased skeletal hardness of echinoids from the so-called aragonite seas is expected to enhance their taphonomic potential, thus, to some extent, mitigates the preservation bias related to increased solubility of high-magnesium calcite.

We compiled radiogenic isotope data of mid-ocean ridge and plume-induced basalts from both present-day and past oceans for the past 900 million years of the relatively isotopically enriched African mantle domain. Our analysis shows that oceanic rocks of the African mantle domain exhibit a relatively homogenous composition similar to the prevalent mantle estimates (PREMA8) until ca. 350 million years ago when plume-derived rocks started becoming isotopically enriched with maximum enrichment reached in the mid-Cretaceous. From that point in time, plume-derived rocks shift toward depletion, getting closer to the prevalent mantle value. The enrichment trend is interpreted to have resulted from the recycling of crustal material during the assembly and the early stage of a break-up of Gondwana and Pangea, whereas the subsequent depletion trend is due to the outward retreat of the subduction girdle during the break-up of Pangea, thus both are legacies of geodynamic processes related to the supercontinent cycle. Geochemical enrichment and depletion patterns in the African mantle domain from the last 900 million years may be attributed to focused recycling of crustal material as part of the supercontinent cycle, supported by isotopic data in palegeographically constrained ophiolitic rocks.",Piero A.

 Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is known to cause adverse health outcomes. Most of the evidence has been derived from developed countries, with lower pollution levels and different demographics and comorbidities from the rest of the world. Here we leverage new satellite-based measurements of PM2.5, combined with comprehensive public records in Chile, to study the effect of PM2.5 pollution on elderly mortality. We find that a 10 μg/m3 monthly increase in PM2.5 exposure is associated with a 1.7% increase (95% C.I.: 1.1–2.4%) in all-cause mortality for individuals aged 75+. Satellite-based measurements allow us to comprehensively investigate heterogeneous effects. We find remarkably similar effect sizes across baseline exposure, rural and urban areas, income, and over time, demonstrating consistency in the evidence on mortality effects of PM2.5 exposure. The most notable source of heterogeneity is geographical, with effects closer to 5% in the center-south and in the metropolitan area.

 Organic food systems are recognised as an important component in meeting United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. A leverage points perspective can help to identify approaches which have the potential to facilitate transformative systemic change towards organic and sustainable farming. Using fuzzy cognitive maps developed from expert stakeholder opinions, we modelled a system of drivers of organic food production and consumption in the United Kingdom, according to the UN Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems framework. The most influential concepts in the uptake of organic systems were related to system norms and values and social structures, such as short-term economic thinking, landowner engagement, and relationships with certification bodies. However, in a scenario analysis, organic stakeholders identified relatively shallower leverage points as more likely to change under a sustainable future, resulting in limited systemic change. This demonstrates the need for policies targeting system norms, values and social structures relating to food systems to facilitate the transition to organic and sustainable farming.

 2023 was the warmest year on record, influenced by multiple warm ocean basins. This has prompted speculation of an acceleration in surface warming, or a stronger than expected influence from loss of aerosol induced cooling. Here we use a recent Green’s function-based method to quantify the influence of sea surface temperature patterns on the 2023 global temperature anomaly, and compare them to previous record warm years. We show that the strong deviation from recent warming trends is consistent with previously observed sea surface temperature influences, and regional forcing.

 The Ediacaran ocean (635-541 million years ago) is typically viewed as a stagnant, redox-stratified ocean with low phosphorus availability. However, this contradicts the high total organic carbon (up to 15 wt%) recorded in the upper Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in South China. Here, we present a quantitative reconstruction of primary productivity and sediment total organic carbon using basin-scale simulations based on various redox-nutrient scenarios. Our results indicate that oceanic upwelling was the primary driver of enhanced primary productivity, with estimates over 2.5 times the modern ocean’s average, providing quantitative evidence for oceanic circulation in the Ediacaran Nanhua Basin. Our results also indicate the development of spatially linked but opposing redox trends, i.e., a ‘redox anticouple’, whereby the expansion of the oxic surface layer occurred concurrently with intensification of deep-water anoxia due to enhanced PP in surface and its consumption of oxidants in underlying waters. This model may explain the conflicting redox records across the Nanhua Basin. Our findings explain the unusually high rates of organic matter production and preservation in the low-pO2 Ediacaran ocean and provide a mechanism for its progressive oxygenation. “Increased organic matter production during the late Ediacaran is likely the result of an enhanced rate of primary production caused by a high rate of oceanic upwelling, suggests a basin-scale simulation under different environmental conditions, for the Doushantuo Formation in South China.”",Fuencisla Cañadas;Dominic Papineau;Thomas J.

 Copper and gold-rich seafloor massive sulfide deposits formed in intra-oceanic subduction settings are typically associated with hydrous and oxidized magmas, but processes leading to their formation remain controversial. Sulfide-bubble interaction has been suggested to play an important role in metal transfer from magmas to seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids. Here we use textural observations of magmatic sulfides, geochemical numerical models of chalcophile element concentrations, and numerical models of magmatic sulfide growth within a mafic to felsic submarine magmatic suite (Fatu Kapa, SW Pacific) associated with copper-gold-rich seafloor massive sulfide deposits. We demonstrate that concomitant sulfide and aqueous fluid formation at the andesitic stage results in floating sulfide-bubble compound drops in magmas, which play a crucial role in the transfer of copper and gold toward the surface. We emphasize that late sulfide saturation in copper-gold-rich intra-oceanic subduction-derived felsic magmas favors upward sulfide transfer via flotation.

 Seasonal snow plays a crucial role in society and understanding trends in snow depth and mass is essential for making informed decisions about water resources and adaptation to climate change. However, quantifying snow depth in remote, mountainous areas with complex topography remains a significant challenge. The increasing availability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations from active microwave satellites has prompted opportunistic use of the data to retrieve snow depth remotely across large spatial and frequent temporal scales and at a high spatial resolution. Nevertheless, these novel SAR-based snow depth retrieval methods face their own set of limitations, including challenges for shallow snowpacks, high vegetation cover, and wet snow conditions. In response, here we introduce a machine learning approach to enhance SAR-based snow depth estimation over the European Alps. By integrating Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, optical snow cover observations, and topographic, forest cover and snow class information, our machine learning retrieval method more accurately estimates snow depth at independent in-situ measurement sites than current methods. Further, our method provides estimates at 100 m horizontal resolution and is capable of better capturing local-scale topography-driven snow depth variability.

 Urban public open spaces (POS) are pivotal in sustainable urban planning, recognized for their positive impacts on the health of residents and environments. However, understanding their physical features in detail via remote sensing remains challenging due to the small and complex area characteristics. Advanced approaches struggle with the requirement for extensive training datasets, which are difficult to obtain and potentially inaccurate in certain settings. Sparse sampling of training data may offer a solution to these challenges, but its inability to consider useful contextual characteristics from objects remains as a significant barrier.To address these challenges, we propose an innovative methodology utilizing the Multivariate Long Short Term Memory–Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN).
