10.1088/1748-9326/ad893f,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文探讨了开放气候科学的重要性，特别强调了开放共享气候数据对实现联合国可持续发展目标的关键作用。虽然大型开放气候数据项目已经证明了其有效性，但论文指出，科学界内部仍然存在一些个人层面的顾虑，阻碍了数据的完全公开。因此，论文认为，除了完善基础设施和服务外，还需要在科学共同体中建立一种接受和鼓励开放数据共享的文化和氛围，才能真正推动气候数据共享的进步。论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为开放的气候数据很大程度上依赖于卫星观测、大气成分分析和空气质量监测等遥感技术所获取的数据。这些数据是进行气候变化研究、预测和应对气候变化影响的基础。,"['climate data', 'open data', 'data sharing', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'sustainable development goals']",Lena M Thöle;Martin Wegmann,Open climate science is brave climate science,"The pivotal role of climate science in advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals underscores the urgent need for ample and open climate data sharing. While numerous large-scale endeavours highlight the efficacy of open climate data, we often encounter personal reservations in our scientific community. Here we argue that beyond infrastructure and service availability, a framework of acceptance and courage is needed in progressing data visibility."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad89dd,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是公众对空气污染的认知如何影响他们对气候变化的认知和应对气候变化的意愿。研究通过调查中国在线消费者，运用结构方程模型分析了空气污染认知、气候变化认知和为支持气候行动的支付意愿之间的关系。结果表明，较高的空气污染认知与较高的气候变化认知显著相关，但较高的气候变化认知并不一定转化为较高的支付意愿。空气污染认知可以通过促进避免行为意图间接提高支付意愿。研究认为，强调减缓气候变化对改善空气质量的共同效益，以及将气候变化与个人经验和切身利益联系起来，有助于提高公众对气候政策的支持和理解，并促进个人行为改变。该研究主要关注的是社会科学领域，侧重于公众认知和行为，与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,"['air pollution', 'climate change perception', 'public awareness', 'willingness to pay', 'behavioral change']",Li Sun;Jianxun Yang;Miaomiao Liu;Wen Fang;Zongwei Ma;Jun Bi,Do attitudes toward air pollution influence climate change perception? Evidence from online customers in China,"The perception of climate change as an abstract and distant concept hinders climate action. Previous studies suggest that individuals may conflate climate change and local air pollution due to misconceptions, as these environmental issues share similar emission sources and mitigation strategies. However, it remains uncertain whether leveraging the public’s high perception of air pollution can lead to increased climate change awareness and supportive behaviors. In this study, we surveyed 1236 Chinese online customers to explore the influence of air pollution perception on climate change perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for supporting climate actions. Structural equation modeling results revealed that higher air pollution perception, which is connected to an individual’s living environment and health status, is significantly associated with higher climate change perception. Despite this link, higher climate change perception does not necessarily translate to higher WTP for climate actions. However, air pollution perception can indirectly increase WTP for climate actions by fostering avoidance behavior intentions. For practical implications, our findings suggest that an emphasis on the co-benefits of climate change mitigation efforts for improving air quality may help lead to greater policy support and understanding. Additionally, promoting individual behavioral changes requires connecting these issues to personal experiences and highlighting tangible benefits such as improved health and well-being."
10.5194/acp-24-12203-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了中亚天山山区降水的稳定同位素组成（氧和氢）及其来源区域。研究人员收集了900多个降水样本，利用环形腔衰荡光谱法分析了δD和δ18O值，并结合大气轨迹分析和混合模型，确定了不同季节不同地点降水来源的比例。结果表明，中亚天山山区降水有相当大一部分来源于区域陆地蒸发，特别是阿姆河和锡尔河盆地的灌溉土地，以及当地水体的再蒸发。研究强调了陆地水汽循环对天山地区降水形成的重要作用。该研究主要关注的是水汽循环和同位素示踪技术，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的关系并不直接或密切。,"['water isotopes', 'atmospheric moisture', 'precipitation', 'air mass trajectories', 'ground-based measurement']",Zarina Saidaliyeva;Maria Shahgedanova;Vadim Yapiyev;Andrew John Wade;Fakhriddin Akbarov;Mukhammed Esenaman uulu;Olga Kalashnikova;Vassiliy Kapitsa;Nikolay Kasatkin;Ilkhomiddin Rakhimov;Rysbek Satylkanov;Daniiar Sayakbaev;Eleonora Semakova;Igor Severskiy;Maxim Petrov;Gulomjon Umirzakov;Ryskul Usubaliev,Precipitation in the mountains of Central Asia: isotopic composition and source regions,"Ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation are used to trace source regions and pathways of atmospheric moisture. A database of these measurements was developed for the mountains of Central Asia and analysed in the context of atmospheric trajectories. Over 50 % of precipitation was formed from moisture re-evaporated from regional terrestrial sources including the irrigated land in the Aral Sea basin, highlighting its support of the water tower function of the mountains. 
 Over 900 event-based precipitation samples were collected in 2019–2021 in the Tien Shan and its foothills and analysed using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. δD and δ18O values were highest in summer and lowest in winter, and annual cycles of deuterium excess (d-excess) varied between sites, reflecting local conditions. The δ18O and δD values increased from north to south in all seasons except autumn, and latitude was a statistically significant predictor of δ18O and δD in the overall data set, along with elevation in winter and elevation and longitude in autumn. Elevation was a significant predictor of d-excess in all seasons, and local air temperature was a more important control over δ18O and δD than precipitation depth. Local meteoric water lines were derived using seven regression methods applied to non-weighted and weighted precipitation. Non-weighted ordinary least squares regression and reduced major axis regression methods are recommended overall, except for summer when the precipitation-weighted least squares regression should be used, particularly in the south. Atmospheric back-trajectory and mixing-model analyses were applied in combination to identify air mass source regions and their relative contribution to precipitation. Recycled moisture from irrigated land in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya basins and from the study catchments accounted for 29 %–71 % of precipitation, depending on the site and season. In the Chon Kyzyl-Suu catchment, local re-evaporation from Issyk-Kul accounted for up to 85 % of precipitation. These findings highlight the importance of moisture from terrestrial sources, especially irrigated land, for the formation of precipitation in the Tien Shan."
10.5194/amt-2024-151,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions,这篇论文研究了一种校正气球采样中水汽扩散影响的方法，以提高无人机在高空大气中进行水汽同位素成分分析的精度。研究人员开发了一个理论模型，并通过实验室实验校准参数，该模型可以根据气球内外的测量结果重建水汽样品的初始同位素组成。他们将此方法应用于无人机收集的来自对流层上层不同压力的空气样本，并通过与IASI卫星数据对比验证了该方法的有效性。这项工作解决了传统水汽同位素测量方法在高空应用中存在的局限性，提升了无人机气球采样技术的可靠性和适用性，为更全面地研究大气水汽循环和同位素组成提供了新的手段。,"['water vapor isotope', 'upper troposphere', 'drone-based sampling', 'satellite observation', 'IASI', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Di Wang;Camille Risi;Lide Tian;Di Yang;Gabriel Bowen;Siteng Fan;Yang Su;Hongxi Pang;Laurent Li,Correcting for water vapor diffusion in air bag samples for isotope composition analysis: cases studies with drone-collected samples,"We developed and validated a theoretical model for water vapor diffusion through sampling bags. This model accurately reconstructs the initial isotopic composition of the vapor samples. When applied to upper troposphere samples, the corrected data aligned closely with IASI satellite observations, enhancing the accuracy of drone-based measurements. 
 Traditional methodologies, such as mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy, have been widely employed for precise water vapor isotope measurements. Nevertheless, these techniques are limited by logistical challenges in fieldwork, consequently constraining the temporal and spatial resolution of measurements. Specifically, water vapor isotope measurements are primarily limited to near-surface levels, while measurements associated with processes aloft connecting tropospheric water vapor to surface precipitation are notably scarce. Portable sampling devices, such as air bags and glass bottles, have therefore become necessary alternatives for collecting, storing, and transporting gaseous samples in diverse environments prior to analysis with less portable instruments. In drone-based high-altitude vapor sampling, air bags are preferred for their lighter weight and greater flexibility compared to glass bottles. Nevertheless, they present specific challenges, such as potential sample contamination and isotopic fractionation during storage, primarily due to the inherent permeability of air bags. Here, we developed a theoretical model for water vapor diffusion through the sampling bag surface, with parameters calibrated through laboratory experiments. This model enables the reconstruction of the initial isotopic composition of sampled vapor based on measurements obtained within the bag and from the surrounding environment. We applied this correction method to air samples collected at various pressures up to the upper troposphere using an air bag-mounted drone that we developed, thereby estimating the initial isotopic composition and uncertainty based on our observations. The corrected observations closely match the IASI satellite data. Our correction method significantly enhances the reliability and applicability of water vapor isotope observations conducted using drones equipped with air bags. This approach leverages the strengths of drone-based air bag sampling while mitigating its limitations, thus facilitating the convenient collection of isotopic data throughout the troposphere."

Combining precise lab measurements with advanced simulations, we accurately determined ACSs for various gases, including reactive ones, without costly reference materials. This approach lowers uncertainty, ensures traceability to standard units, and enhances measurement reliability, making it ideal for field applications. 
 A low-cost differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) spectrometer has been calibrated using a hybrid approach in which multiple absorption cross sections (ACSs) are measured and compared with previously obtained ACSs. The ACSs obtained from the measurement in this study are referred to as precise measurement (PM) ACSs, while those obtained from the simulation are referred to as hybrid simulation (HS) ACSs. The compact UV grating spectrometer was used to measure PM ACSs at different pressures and temperatures ranging from 295.75 K to 298.15 K. The spectral range was 230–320 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.28–0.39 nm. Uncertainties were evaluated and traceable to SI units. The relative standard measurement uncertainty of the PM ACS for o-xylene, p-xylene, SO2, benzene, styrene and toluene were 3.1 %, 3.1 %, 3.1 %, 3.0 %, 3.0 % and 2.9 %. respectively. This combined relative standard uncertainty includes contributions from optical path length (1.4 %), CRM concentration (≤0.74 %), absorbance repeatability (≤1.5 %), pressure (0.78 %) and temperature (2.1 %). ACSs for reactive trace gases without CRMs were derived using the HS method. This involved convolving literature spectra with measured instrumental functions (IFs) and subsequently applying spectral fitting to achieve ACSs that are well-aligned with those that would be obtained if measured with this spectrometer. The uncertainty of the HS ACSs results from the referenced ACSs, the determination of the IFs and the fitting procedures. The uncertainty of the referenced ACSs is taken directly from the literature and ranges from 0.05 % for benzaldehyde and formaldehyde to 5 % for oxygen. The uncertainty of the IFs is 0.67 %, 0.74 % and 0.65 % in regions I, II and III respectively. The total uncertainty for HS ACS is estimated to be 0.25 % for benzaldehyde, 1.01 % for NO2, 0.95 % for formaldehyde, 0.75 % for p-cresol, 0.74 % for m-xylene, 4.13 % for phenol, 4.19 % for ethylbenzene, 2.83 % for ozone in region I, 3.51 % for ozone in region II, 5.24 % for oxygen in region I and 5.31 % for oxygen in region II, taking into account the above uncertainty components. In a laboratory measurement of a gas mixture (benzene, toluene and ortho-xylene), the difference between the measurement values of the certified reference material (CRM) produced by the gravimetric method and the DOAS measurement is 8.5 % for benzene, 1.6 % for toluene and 4.9 % for ortho-xylene. Therefore, the uncertainty of the DOAS system was estimated to be 15.2 % for benzene, 8.2 % for toluene and 11.6 % for o-xylene, taking into account the uncertainties of the ACS (≤3.1 %), the fitting procedure (≤0.6 %), the difference with the CRM value (≤8.5 %) and the path length (1.4 %). In general, the system is ready for use in field measurements using the long-path DOAS technique."

The data comprise collocated petrophysical–mineralogical–geochemical–structural–metasomatic characterisation of 23 deposits from a highly complex mineral system. This approach enables translation of the mineral system processes into physics, providing a framework for smarter geophysics-based exploration. 
 Recent decades have seen an exponential rise in the application of machine learning in geoscience. However, fundamental differences distinguish geoscience data from most other data types. Geoscience datasets are typically multi-dimensional, and contain 1D (drill holes), 2D (maps or cross-sections), and 3D volumetric and point data (models/voxels). Geoscience data quality is a product of the data's resolution and the precision of the methods used to acquire them. The dimensionality, resolution, and precision of each layer within a geoscience dataset translate into limitations to the spatiality, scale, and uncertainty of resulting interpretations. Historically, geoscience datasets were overlaid cartographically to incorporate subjective, experience-driven knowledge and variances in scale and resolution. These nuances and limitations that underpin the reliability of automated interpretation are well understood by geoscientists but are rarely appropriately transferred to data science. For true integration of geoscience data, such issues cannot be overlooked without consequence. To apply data analytics to complex geoscience data (e.g. hydrothermal mineral systems) effectively, methodologies that characterise the system quantitatively at a common scale, using collocated analyses, should be sought. This paper provides research and exploration insights from an innovative district-wide, scale-integrated geoscience data project, which analysed 1590 samples from 23 mineral deposits and prospects across the Cloncurry district, Queensland, Australia. Nine different analytical techniques were used, including density, magnetic susceptibility, remanent magnetisation, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, radiometrics, conductivity, automated mineralogy based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), geochemistry, and short-wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data with 561 columns of scale-integrated data (+2151 columns of SWIR data). All data were collected on 2.2 cm × 2.5 cm sample cylinders, a scale at which the confidence in the coupling of data from techniques can be high. These data are integrated by design to eliminate the need to downscale coarser measurements via assumptions, inferences, inversions, and interpolations. This scale-consistent approach is critical to the quantitative characterisation of mineral systems and has numerous applications in mineral exploration, such as linking alteration paragenesis with structural controls and petrophysical zonation.

 This article presents a 45-year data series (from 1978 to 2023) acquired under the IGA (“Impact des Grands Aménagements” in French; Impacts of Major Developments) program, conducted by Ifremer for EDF (Électricité de France, the French multinational electricity utility company). The IGA program was established to monitor the ecological and environmental quality of the coastal area surrounding the Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), located in the southern bight of the North Sea. The main objective of this program is to assess medium- and long-term environmental evolution by providing means to identify possible changes in the local marine habitats. Since 1978, the IGA program has measured key parameters, including temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, oxygen levels, chlorophyll-a concentrations, as well as the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. These measurements have been taken at different sampling stations around the NPP, including the “Canal d’amenée” sampling station, for which hydrological and biological characteristics are considered as representative of broader coastal area of the southern bight of the North Sea. This data paper provides an overview of the main statistical characteristics of the time series, including long-term trends and shifts analysis. Despite the importance and length of this dataset, one of the longest available for this region, its application in advancing knowledge of hydrological and biological processes has been surprisingly limited. The aim of this paper is to make this valuable dataset available to the scientific community, stakeholders, and society to help decipher the local and global influence of anthropogenic activities in a world increasingly affected by climate change. Since all the main statistics and patterns are still available thanks to our analysis, the user should be able to use this data and combine it with other sources (in situ, satellite, modelling), in order to dive into deeper analyses, and to investigate new key scientific challenges as well as more specific ones."
10.5194/essd-2024-493,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,这篇论文研究了中国1961年至2022年逐日日照时数的均质化处理。研究人员发现，2019年仪器升级导致日照时数数据中出现零值频率骤降的问题，这是一种非气候因素导致的不连续性。他们开发了一种均质化方法，系统地校正了这种不连续性，并对其他非气候因素引起的不连续性进行了调整，从而得到了一个更连续、更准确的日照时数数据集。该数据集可用于更准确地评估中国区域的“变暗”和“变亮”现象，并支持其他应用，例如太阳能规划和农业管理。研究结果表明，均质化后的日照时数数据更能反映出中国大气污染防治行动计划实施后日照时数趋势的变化，以及云量和气溶胶光学厚度与日照时数之间的关系。总的来说，这项研究通过改进数据质量，提高了对中国地区气候变化和空气质量研究的精度。,"['Aerosol optical depth', 'Cloud cover fraction', 'Sunshine duration', 'Dimming and brightening', 'Air pollution', 'Surface solar radiation', 'Ground-based observation']",Yanyi He;Kaicun Wang;Kun Yang;Chunlüe Zhou;Changkun Shao;Changjian Yin,Homogenized daily sunshine duration over China from 1961 to 2022,"To address key gaps in data availability and homogeneity of sunshine duration, we compiled raw data and made a homogenization protocol to produce a homogenized daily observational dataset of sunshine duration from 1961 to 2022 in China. The dataset avoids a sharp drop in zero-value frequency after 2019, caused by the instrument upgrade, but also is more continuous for various periods. This dataset is crucial for accurately assessing the dimming and brightening, and supporting other applications. 
 Inhomogeneities in the sunshine duration (SSD) observational series, caused by non-climatic factors like China’s widespread transition from manual to automatic SSD recorders in 2019 or station relocations, have hindered accurate estimate of near-surface solar radiation for the analysis of global dimming and brightening as well as related applications, such as solar energy planning and agriculture management. This study compiled raw SSD observational data from 1961 to 2022 at more than 2,200 stations in China and clearly found that the improved precision from 0.1 hour to 1 minute following the instrument update in 2019 led to a sudden reduction in the frequency of zero SSD from 2019 onwards, referred to as the day0-type discontinuity. For the first time, we systematically corrected this known day0-type discontinuity at 378 stations (17 %) in China, resulting in an SSD series with comparable frequencies of zero value before and after 2019. On this base, we constructed a homogenization procedure to detect and adjust discontinuities in both the variance and mean of daily SSD from 1961 to 2022. Results show that a total of 1,363 (60 %) stations experienced breakpoints in SSD, of which ~65 % were confirmed by station relocations and instrument replacements. Compared to the raw SSD, the homogenized SSD is more continuous to the naked eye for various periods, and presents weakened dimming across China from 1961 to 1990 but a non-significant positive trend by a reduction of 60 % in the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the homogenized SSD tends to better capture the dimming phenomenon. The northern regions continue dimming from 1991 to 2022 but the southern regions of China brighten slightly. The implementation of the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control since 2013 has contributed to a reversal of SSD trend thereafter, which is better reflected in the homogenized SSD with a trend shift from -0.02 to 0.07 hours·day-1/decade from 2013 to 2022 in China, especially in heavily polluted regions. Besides, the relationships of cloud cover fraction and aerosol optical depth with SSD are intensified in the homogenized dataset. These results highlight the importance of the homogenized SSD in accurately understanding the dimming and brightening phenomena.

Data are stored in connected datasets, including recommended averages of ~1500 constituents for 14 globally relevant fire types. Individual compounds were mapped to common model species to allow better attribution of emissions in modeling studies that predict the effects of fires on air quality and climate. 
 Accurate representation of fire emissions is critical for modeling the in-plume, near-source, and remote effects of biomass burning (BB) on atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate. In recent years application of advanced instrumentation has significantly improved knowledge of the compounds emitted from fires, which, coupled with a large number of recent laboratory and field campaigns, has facilitated the emergence of new emission factor (EF) compilations. The Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.0 is one such compilation in which the EFs for 14 globally relevant fuel and fire types have been updated to include data from recent studies, with a focus on gaseous non-methane organic compounds (NMOC_g). The data are stored in a series of connected tables that facilitate flexible querying from the individual study level to recommended averages of all laboratory and field data by fire type. The querying features are enabled by assignment of unique identifiers to all compounds and constituents, including thousands of NMOC_g. NEIVA also includes chemical and physical property data and model surrogate assignments for three widely used chemical mechanisms for each NMOC_g. NEIVA EF datasets are compared with recent publications and other EF compilations at the individual compound level and in the context of overall volatility distributions and hydroxyl (OH) reactivity (OHR) estimates. The NMOC_g in NEIVA include ∼4–8 times more compounds with improved representation of intermediate volatility organic compounds, resulting in much lower overall volatility (lowest-volatility bin shifted by as much as 3 orders of magnitude) and significantly higher OHR (up to 90 %) than other compilations.

Craig;Bryan A. Tolson,A reach-integrated hydraulic modelling approach for large-scale and real-time inundation mapping,"We aim to improve mapping of floods, and present a new method for hydraulic modelling that uses a combination of novel geospatial analysis and existing hydraulic modelling approaches. This method is wrapped into a modelling software called Blackbird. We compared Blackbird to two other existing options for flood mapping and found that the Blackbird model outperformed both. The Blackbird model has the potential to support real-time and large-scale flood mapping applications in the future. 
 Flooding is one of the world's most common and costly natural hazards, inflicting billions in damages each year. However, current hydraulic models to support flood mapping are not well suited for large-scale applications or frequent updates, either due to limited accuracy of simple methods or lack of scalability (i.e., large computational requirements) for more sophisticated hydrodynamic models. This results in flood maps being decades out of date or simply nonexistent in some areas. Recent advances in generating flood maps have been made seemingly in parallel between geospatial methods and hydrodynamic models, such as the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method, hybrid 1D-2D hydrodynamic models and more efficient computing of 2D models. This study presents the Geospatially Augmented Standard Step (GASS) method, which combines a novel improvement to the HAND method, Dynamic Height Above Nearest Drainage (DHAND), with a 1D hydraulic model for rapid flood inundation mapping at large scales while maintaining the accuracy of hydrodynamic models. This method is implemented into a new modelling software package called Blackbird, and is benchmarked in two case studies, including a verification of the code and a benchmark test comparing multiple approaches in the ability to approximate 2D model results. The Blackbird model vastly outperforms the simpler HAND-Manning method and also outperforms a traditional HEC-RAS 1D model when evaluated for accuracy of approximating a 2D model benchmark. This new method is shown to reduce the incidence of falsely predicting flooded areas through improved resolution of landscape connections over HAND-based or 1D hydraulic models. Blackbird also streamlines the model development effort relative to existing 1D or 2D models while maintaining a computational speed that was 10, 000 times less than a comparable 2D model in one case study. The method also allows for future integration of hydraulic structures, ice jams and other features that are unavailable in HAND-based models. Overall, the GASS method provides a viable option for large-scale and real-time fluvial flood mapping applications."

 Grid-wise Vienna Mapping Functions 1 (VMF1) and Vienna Mapping Functions 3 (VMF3) tropospheric products have been widely used to interpolate the a priori zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delay (ZWD) over the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) stations for the mitigation of tropospheric delays inherited in GNSS observations. Since the two products only provide ground surface ZHD and ZWD for global grid points, the ZHD and ZWD of the four grid points nearest to the GNSS site need to be reduced to the same height of the GNSS site before a horizontal interpolation (e.g., bilinear interpolation or inverse-distance weighted interpolation) is implemented. However, the accuracy of the officially recommended simple reduction model may not be as good as desired if the height of a GNSS site largely differs from that of the four ground surface grid points to be used in the interpolation. In this contribution, a new reduction model for each grid point is developed for reducing the grid-wise ZHD and ZWD to the target height to improve the interpolation performance. The sample data for the modelling were the 10-year (2010–2019) ZHD and ZWD profiles over the grid points obtained from ERA5 monthly-mean reanalysis data, while 3-year (2020–2022) ERA5 hourly reanalysis and IGS (International GNSS Service) site-wise ZTD products were used to evaluate the new model. Test results showed that the accuracy of the ZHD, ZWD (as well as the ZTD) interpolated from the VMF1/VMF3 products deduced by the new model was significantly better than the ones deduced by traditional methods, especially for sites with substantial height disparities from adjacent VMF grid points. It is expected that the new model adds good value to related fields such as GNSS positioning and GNSS meteorology for better performance."

Current methods, while accurate, are slowed by complex calculations. We developed a new approach that simplifies these calculations and speeds them up significantly using a technique called the BFGS algorithm. This breakthrough reduces computation time by more than five times, potentially unlocking new horizons in modeling reactive magmatic systems. 
 Prediction of mineral phase assemblages is essential to better understand the dynamics of the solid Earth, such as metamorphic processes, magmatism and the formation of mineral ore deposits. While recently developed thermodynamic databases allow the prediction of stable phase mineral assemblages for an increasing range of pressure, temperature and compositional spaces, the increasing complexity of these databases results in a significant increase of computational cost, hindering our ability to perform realistic models of reactive fluid/magma transport. Presently, prediction of stable phase equilibrium in complex systems is therefore largely limited by how efficiently single phase minimization can be performed, as more than 75 % of the total computational time is generally dedicated to individual solution phase minimization. This limitation becomes critical for non-ideal solution phase models that involve both a large number of chemical components, and mixing on a large number of sites, resulting in many inequality constraints of the form 0 ≤ xMl  ≤ 1, where xMl  is the fraction of element l mixing on site M."

From 2013–2020, local emissions dominated Beijing's pollution events. The Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan reduced regional transport pollution, but the eastern region showed the smallest decrease. Beijing should prioritize local emission reduction while considering the east region's contributions in future strategies. 
 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is closely linked to human health, with its sources generally divided into local emissions and regional transport. This study combined concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis with the HYSPLIT trajectory ensemble to obtain hourly-resolution pollutant source results. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was then employed to simulate local emissions and ambient PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2020. The results revealed that clean air masses influencing the Beijing area mainly originated from the north and east regions, exhibiting a strong winter and weak summer pattern. Following the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan) by the Chinese government in 2017, pollution in Beijing decreased significantly, with the most substantial reduction in regional transport pollution events occurring in the west region during summer. Regional transport pollution events were most frequent in spring, up to 1.8 times higher than in winter. Pollutants mainly originated from the west and south regions, while polluted air masses from the east showed the least reduction, and the proportion of pollution sources from this region is gradually increasing. From 2013 to 2020, local emissions were the main contributors of pollution events in Beijing. The Action Plan has more effectively reduced pollution caused by regional transport, particularly during autumn and winter. This finding underscores the importance of Beijing prioritizing local emission reduction while also considering potential contributions from the east region to effectively mitigate pollution events."

In this study, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), an economical and eco-friendly inorganic ligand, was introduced to enhance the degradation of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the Mn(II)/PAA process. NaHCO3 could significantly improve the oxidizing ability of the Mn(II)/PAA process over the initial pH range of 3.0–11.0. Mn(V) was identified as the primary reactive species for degrading naproxen in the NaHCO3/Mn(II)/PAA process. HCO3– could complex with Mn(II) to generate Mn(II)-HCO3–, which has a lower redox potential to enhance the catalytic activity of Mn(II). Mn(II)-HCO3– reacted with PAA to produce Mn(III)-HCO3– and CH3C(O)O•. Mn(V)-HCO3– was generated via two-electron transfer between Mn(III)-HCO3– and PAA. Although organic radicals were detected in the NaHCO3/Mn(II)/PAA process, naproxen was mainly degraded by Mn(V)-HCO3– via one-electron transfer along with the formation of MnO2. Notably, the coexisting hydrogen peroxide was vital in the reduction of MnO2 to Mn(II/III), thereby enhancing the continuous generation of Mn(V)-HCO3–. NaHCO3/Mn(II)/PAA process exhibited exceptional oxidation performance in actual water samples.

The technique is flexible enough to consider a wide range of air pollutants and be deployed at roadside ambient monitoring locations. The new approach is used to quantify emissions and concentration source apportionment for ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

We tracked the evolution of Fe and Zn speciation with 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and with bulk and micro-X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We show that Fe was readily reduced and incorporated into a poorly crystalline mixed-valence Fe(II)–Fe(III) phase resembling green rust. In parallel, Zn was released in the surrounding porewater and scavenged by precipitation with available ligands, particularly as zinc sulfide (ZnS) or Zn-carbonates. Early in the mineral transformation process, the chemical behavior of Fe was decoupled from Zn, suppressing the impact of Zn on the rates and products of the ferrihydrite transformation.

Levoglucosan is the most well-recognized organic marker compound of BB and has been used to quantitatively assess BB’s contribution to ambient aerosols. However, little is known about levoglucosan’s evaporation under atmospheric conditions, primarily due to the uncertainty of its effective saturation vapor concentration (C*) and its unknown activity coefficient (γ), in the complex BB emission matrix. Here, we utilized a thermodenuder to investigate the evaporation of levoglucosan from mixtures with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or BB primary organic aerosol (BBPOA) matrices, respectively. We estimate a pure component log10(C*/[μg m–3]) of levoglucosan of 1.1 ± 0.1 at 298 K. We reveal that levoglucosan mixed with PEG or BBPOA becomes more volatile than when treated as a single component due to nonideal molecular interactions. Considering that phase separation might occur in such systems, we term γ apparent activity coefficient (γa). We estimate  log10C* and γa of levoglucosan in BBPOA of 1.8 ± 0.1 and 3.8 ± 0.3, assuming a liquid phase state. Consequently, γa must be considered to avoid significant underestimation of levoglucosan evaporation via gas–particle partitioning during transport."

Measurements of air pollutant concentrations are sparse in both regions contributing to large uncertainties in both fire emissions and air quality degradation.

Median indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios were 1.01 in rural areas, considerably higher than those reported during wildfires in other regions of the world (e.g., USA), indicating housing stock in the region provides little protection from outdoor PM2.5.

 The prevailing view of the formation of porphyry copper deposits along convergent plate boundaries involves deep crustal differentiation of metal-bearing juvenile magmas derived from the mantle wedge above a subduction zone. However, many major porphyry districts formed during periods of flat-slab subduction when the mantle wedge would have been reduced or absent, leaving the source of the ore-forming magmas unclear. Here we use geochronology and thermobarometry to investigate deep crustal processes during the genesis of the Late Cretaceous–Palaeocene Laramide Porphyry Province in Arizona, which formed during flat-slab subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath North America. We show that the isotopic signatures of Laramide granitic rocks are consistent with a Proterozoic crustal source that was potentially pre-enriched in copper. This source underwent water-fluxed melting between 73 and 60 Ma, coincident with the peak of granitic magmatism (78–50 Ma), porphyry genesis (73–56 Ma) and flat-slab subduction (70–40 Ma). To explain the formation of the Laramide Porphyry Province, we propose that volatiles derived from the leading edge of the Farallon flat slab promoted melting of both mafic and felsic pre-enriched lower crust, without requiring extensive magmatic or metallogenic input from the mantle wedge. Other convergent plate boundaries with flat-slab regimes may undergo a similar mechanism of volatile-mediated lower-crustal melting.

 A promising route towards the deterministic creation and annihilation of single-phonons is to couple a single-photon emitter to a mechanical resonator. The challenge lies in reaching the resolved-sideband regime with a large coupling rate and a high mechanical quality factor. We achieve this by coupling self-assembled InAs quantum dots to a small mode-volume phononic-crystal resonator with mechanical frequency Ωm/2π = 1.466 GHz and quality factor Qm = 2.1 × 103. Thanks to the high coupling rate of gep/2π = 2.9 MHz, and by exploiting a matching condition between the effective Rabi and mechanical frequencies, we observe the interaction between the two systems via correlations in the emitted photons.

 Direct current (DC) motors are crucial in drones, robotics, and electrical devices.

However, the rapid on-off switching actions in the switching electricity converter would cause electromagnetic interference (EMI), impairing the functionality of drive systems.

 Structural variants (SVs) are significant contributors to inter-individual genetic variation associated with traits and diseases.

We show that Asian populations can be stratified by their global SV patterns and identified 42,239 novel SVs that are specific to Asian populations. 52% of these novel SVs are restricted to one of the three major ancestry groups studied (Indian, Chinese or Malay). We uncovered SVs affecting major clinically actionable loci. Lastly, by identifying SVs in linkage disequilibrium with single-nucleotide variants, we demonstrate the utility of our SV catalogue in the fine-mapping of Asian GWAS variants and identification of potential causative variants.

 Poleward water vapor transport in the midlatitudes mainly occurs in meandering filaments of intense water vapor transport, spanning thousands of kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide and moving eastward. The water vapor filaments are known as atmospheric rivers (ARs). They can cause extreme wind gusts, intense precipitation, and flooding along densely populated coastal regions. Many recent studies about ARs focused on the statistical analyses of ARs, but a process-level understanding of ARs remains elusive. Here we show that ARs are streams of air with enhanced vapor kinetic energy (VKE) and derive a governing equation for Integrated VKE to understand what contributes to the evolution of ARs. We find that ARs grow mainly because of potential energy conversion to kinetic energy, decay largely owing to condensation and turbulence, and the eastward movement is primarily due to horizontal advection of VKE. Our VKE framework complements the integrated vapor transport framework, which is popular for identifying ARs but lacks a prognostic equation for understanding the physical processes.

 Amorphous powder cores are promising components for next-generation power electronics. However, they present inherent challenges of internal air gaps and stresses during cold compaction, which significantly deteriorate soft magnetic properties. Here, we report the formation of a local adaptive insulation structure of biconcave lens in amorphous powder cores by ultrasonic rheomolding. Consequently, compared with conventional cold-compacted powder cores, the ultrasonic rheomolded powder cores offer significant simultaneous improvements in the permeability from 31.3–32.4 to 41.8–43.3 and the direct-current bias performance from 69.4–69.7% to 87.4–87.8% (7960 A/m), thereby overcoming the trade-off between permeability and direct-current bias performance. In particular, their core losses are as low as 13.73–15.45 kW/m3, approximately one twentieth of that of the cold-compacted powder cores (282.84–304.03 kW/m3) at a magnetic field of 100 mT and 100 kHz. The biconcave-lens insulation structure can effectively buffer the impact of high mechanical stress on the magnetization of magnetic powder particles, allowing for the ultrasonic rheomolded powder cores to maintain better magnetization efficiency and consequently resulting in excellent soft magnetic properties under the cooperative effect of very low internal stresses and low porosity. The ultrasonic rheomolded powder cores can be used as alternative core components in next generation miniaturized power electronics.

 Intensification of farming since the Green Revolution has led to large increases in yield but has also increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

 Many high-quality educational innovations are freely available, and some are known to motivate evidence-based climate and sustainability action. Typically, efforts to propagate educational innovations rely on outreach and word-of-mouth diffusion, but these approaches tend to achieve little. We develop and analyse a dynamic computational model to understand why and to test other propagation strategies. Our analysis reveals that outreach has limited impact and does little to accelerate word-of-mouth adoption under conditions typical in higher education. Instead, we find that community-based propagation can rapidly accelerate adoption, as is also shown by a small number of successful real-world scaling efforts. This approach supports a community of ‘ambassadors’, facilitating and rewarding their sharing the innovation with potential adopters. Community-based propagation can generate exponential growth in adopters, rapidly outpacing outreach and word-of-mouth propagation. Without it, we are unlikely to rapidly scale the educational innovations needed to build urgently needed capacity in sustainability.

 Forest floor vegetation plays a crucial role in ecosystem processes of temperate and boreal forests. Remote sensing offers a valuable tool to characterize the forest floor through reflectance spectra. While passive optical airborne and satellite data have been used to map spectral properties of forest understory, these sensors are limited by cloud cover, especially in high latitudes. To date, LiDAR and SAR have not been explored for this application even though their data are less dependent on illumination conditions and provide information on tree canopy structure and tree distribution which is connected to forest floor properties. We investigated active remote sensing techniques to establish links between forest structure and spectral properties of forest floor across European temperate, hemiboreal and boreal forest ecosystems. First, in the exploratory part, the research question was : Which forest structure metrics are connected to the spectral properties of the forest floor? Next, our predictive part focused on: What is the potential of (1) terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, (2) airborne laser scanning data, (3) satellite-borne SAR data, and (4) these data sources combined to predict forest floor spectral properties? Our results revealed that nine forest structure metrics were potentially associated with forest floor reflectance. We identified TLS-derived clumping index and SAR-derived VV backscatter coefficient and VH/VV ratio as significantly connected to forest floor reflectance in certain Sentinel-2 spectral bands. Overall, the active remote sensors achieved the best predictions for forest floor reflectance in red-edge, near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions. Using data from all three sensors together to predict the forest floor spectra yielded better results than using any of the sensors alone. When data from a single sensor were used, the highest prediction accuracies for forest floor reflectance in the red-edge and near-infrared regions were achieved with SAR data, and in the shortwave infrared region with either SAR or TLS data. In the future, the accuracy of predicting forest floor characteristics in temperate and boreal forests could benefit from a synergy of passive and active technologies."
