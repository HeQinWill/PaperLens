10.1088/1748-9326/ae06bb,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注南极洲Terra Nova Bay Polynya海冰动力学与强下降风事件变率之间的关系。虽然论文提到了卫星数据的使用，但其重点在于分析海冰浓度、风力模式以及它们如何影响南极底层水的形成。 该研究与大气环境遥感技术的直接关联较弱，因为它不涉及空气质量监测、大气成分分析或特定大气传感器的开发与应用。主要侧重于气候变化背景下海冰的物理过程。,"['sea ice concentration', 'katabatic wind', 'polynya', 'satellite data', 'sea ice dynamics']",Yuanyuan Xu;Rui Mao;Seong-Joong Kim;Minghu Ding;Dao-Yi Gong,"Impact of strong katabatic wind event variability on sea ice dynamics in Terra Nova Bay Polynya, Antarctica","Polynyas along the Antarctic coastline are essential for sea ice production and the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). They are formed and maintained by strong and persistent katabatic winds that push the ice away from the coast. Satellite data, in-situ meteorological observations and Reanalysis datasets all indicate a decline in sea ice concentration (SIC) over the Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP) from 2013 to 2022, consistent with the occurrence of an increasing trend of strong katabatic wind events (SKWEs). On the interannual timescale, significant correlations between the TNBP area and the duration of SKWEs were observed in austral summer, autumn and winter, and also in April and October during 2003–2022. Sea ice volume budget analysis shows that SKWEs drive rapid sea-ice removal through advection and divergence, whereas thermodynamic processes dominate sea ice formation on an annual basis. The increase in SKWEs was associated with a deepened and southwestward-displaced Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and an enhanced pressure gradient between the interior plateau and the coast, both potentially linked to a more positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM). These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of long-term polynya variability, with implications for regional sea-ice changes and AABW."

The coastline deep ocean floor calls for floating offshore wind (FOSW), a new technology whose application has yet to be built to scale. Given the novelty, deep uncertainty, and lack of data regarding FOSW, we fielded an expert elicitation regarding the costs, probability and duration of failure, and likely potential system architectures. We find that there is significant disagreement among experts: cost estimates vary by a factor of at least 3. Probabilities of failure range from 0.01% to 20% for most parts of the system. Experts diverged on likely transmission configurations that are likely to be used with FOSW projects, though most agreed DC technologies will be used in the future. Overall, experts believe California’s 2030 FOSW targets will not be met but could be achieved by 2035, and 2045 targets could be realized with faster buildout of future lease areas."

Under ongoing climate change, the frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of such events are projected to increase, with disproportionately severe impacts on ecologically sensitive and conservation-priority areas. Despite this growing risk, existing vulnerability assessment frameworks for PHAS have primarily focused on long-term, gradual climatic shifts, largely overlooking the episodic and often catastrophic nature of EWEs. Here, we propose a structured methodological framework to assess the vulnerability of PHAS to extreme climatic events, based on the three IPCC vulnerability components including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (ExP-SeN-AdC). The framework introduces the Extreme Event Vulnerability Index (EVI), an integrative metric designed to quantify vulnerability of PHAS to EWEs in a transparent, standardized, and scalable manner. The framework follows an eight-step process: (1) defining the assessment scope; (2) selecting ecologically meaningful indicators; (3) evaluating data availability and acquiring data; (4) constructing component indices for ExP-SeN-AdC; (5) computing the composite vulnerability metric; (6) evaluating uncertainties through validation and sensitivity analysis; (7) communicating and refining results through stakeholder engagement; and (8) formulating science-based conservation and adaptation recommendations. Finally, we demonstrate application of the proposed framework through a case study on Atlantic Salt Meadow habitats (Glauco-Puccinellietalia Maritimae) located within Dublin Bay’s Natura 2000 sites, encompassing a mosaic of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protected Areas (SPAs) under the EU Habitat Directive. The framework and its methodological approach lay the foundation for the vulnerability analysis and mapping, advancing adaptation planning, and guiding targeted interventions and conservation efforts, and the development of forward-looking conservation policies in the face of escalating extreme climatic threats."

While many studies assess the realized impacts of hurricane strikes, less attention has been paid to the economic consequences of anticipatory responses. Using 25 years of weekly refinery crude oil input data and 36 h hurricane forecast information, we estimate the effect of projected storm strength and strike location on regional refinery oil input. We find that stronger forecasted hurricanes targeting larger refinery subregions significantly reduce oil input, with impacts lasting several weeks. We also identify substantial economic losses that occur even when storms do not ultimately make landfall, highlighting the cost of forecast-driven disruption. For example, our estimates show that under a category 4 hurricane that is forecast to threaten 31% of Gulf Coast capacity, there would be a reduction of 18 million barrels in refinery throughput and an operating profit loss of $770 million."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0e87,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是海洋深层结构对飓风强度的影响，特别是利用机器学习方法分析不同深度（0-500米）的海洋异常数据，以提高对强飓风的预测能力。虽然与气象相关，但其重点在于海洋学，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关联。,[],Veronica Nieves;Javier Martinez-Amaya,AI-driven insights beneath the surface: deeper ocean layers at play in severe hurricane forecasting,"Understanding the underexplored role of deeper ocean layers in hurricane dynamics is pivotal amidst escalating storm intensities and growing threats to coastal communities. While early forecasting approaches focused almost exclusively on near-surface variables (e.g. sea surface temperature) or upper-ocean layers (0–100 m), some follow-up efforts integrated subsurface information using ocean heat content analyses relative to the 26 °C isotherm, yielding modest enhancement for the most intense storms. By contrast, our convolutional neural network–random forest (RF) framework explicitly exploits the three‐dimensional structure of ocean anomalies from the surface down to 500 m—indirectly capturing heat redistribution, salinity‐driven stratification, and mixed‐layer dynamics across depths. We demonstrate that the layered information within 40–500 m accounts for 44.91 ± 0.24% of total variable importance in the RF model and supports 72-h lead‐time severe‐hurricane forecasts with a precision of 73.04 ± 7.95%. This substantially extends ocean-heat-content‐only approaches by: 1) avoiding a hard threshold, 2) providing the first quantification of layer-specific subsurface contributions to severity forecasting through a multi-depth anomaly analysis across multiple variables using an RF-based framework, and 3) leveraging fine‐scale spatial patterns via convolutional-neural-network‐derived features. Subsurface variables down to 500 m are not merely ancillary—they are indispensable for capturing the ocean precursors of the strongest hurricanes, particularly when the 26 °C isotherm (typically shallower than 100 m) fails to represent the full heat reservoir. This deeper thermal structure may represent a key energy source that can support—and potentially accelerate—severe hurricane intensification. These findings highlight the untapped predictive value of deep-layer ocean information and its potential to enhance early-warning systems for high-impact storm events."

One common practice that is well-known to benefit crop yields is crop rotation, yet there remains limited understanding of how the benefits of crop rotation vary for different crop sequences and for different weather conditions. To address these gaps, we leverage crop type maps, satellite data, and causal machine learning to study how precrop effects on subsequent yields vary with cropping sequence choice and weather. Complementing and going beyond what is known from randomized field trials, we find that (i) for those farmers who do rotate, the most common precrop choices tend to be among the most beneficial, (ii) the effects of switching from a simple rotation (which alternates between two crops) to a more diverse rotation were typically small and sometimes even negative, (iii) precrop effects tended to be greater under rainier conditions, (iv) precrop effects were greater under warmer conditions for soybean yields but not for other crops, and (v) legume precrops conferred smaller benefits under warmer conditions. Our results and the methods we use can enable farmers and policy makers to identify which rotations will be most effective at improving crop yields in a changing climate."

Low-carbon hydrogen produced from fossil resources is often viewed as a bridge in the energy transition. This study comparatively evaluates life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of diverse pathways of fossil-based hydrogen production for fuel cell vehicle use. Life cycle emissions of hydrogen production alone vary significantly with production technology and are highly influenced by the supply sources of feedstock and electricity. Reforming and chemical looping with carbon capture and storage (CCS) are competitive to produce low-carbon hydrogen, whereas plasma pyrolysis is not competitive. Using low-carbon hydrogen to replace gasoline and diesel can significantly reduce life cycle emissions for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. Low-carbon hydrogen production by steam methane reforming, autothermal reforming, gasification, and chemical looping with CCS accounts for 64%–78% of the total life cycle emissions associated with hydrogen production, transport, leakage, and vehicle use. Although nominal hydrogen leakage alone has no remarkable effect on life cycle emissions, the expansion of assessment system boundary by including hydrogen transport and utilization can sizably elevate emissions. To secure short-term climate benefits for replacing diesel-fueled heavy-duty trucks and transit buses with hydrogen-fueled vehicles, however, it is necessary to simultaneously limit methane and hydrogen leakage along their supply and utilization chains. These findings imply that economic incentives and policies for a low-carbon hydrogen economy should be developed based on the life cycle emissions of both hydrogen production and utilization."

When ground ice melts, surface subsidence produces thermokarst landforms that expand wetlands at the edges of permafrost plateaus. Thermokarst represents an accelerating climate feedback, but uncertainties remain about how ground ice, hydrology, and vegetation interact to shape landscape change and carbon fluxes. We extended the process-based model ecosys to simulate thermokarst dynamics in laterally coupled 2D transects at a well-characterized boreal peatland site in Canada’s Northwest Territories. After benchmarking against site observations, we varied ground ice content and hydrologic boundary conditions across ranges typical near the southern permafrost limit. Simulations revealed distinct degradation regimes governed by the elevation difference between the frost table and the external water table. Rates of lateral retreat, the thaw-driven encroachment of wetlands into adjacent plateaus, ranged from 0 to >2 m yr−1 under identical weather forcing, consistent with observations and highlighting the strong role of WT and ground ice. Simulated vegetation dynamics indicate that black spruce mortality cannot be explained by anoxia alone, pointing to additional stressors such as root damage, pathogens, or physical destabilization. Despite large hydrologic shifts, net ecosystem CO2 exchange remained a slight sink after collapse, while methane (CH4) emissions rose by one to two orders of magnitude. As a result, lateral retreat substantially increases the greenhouse warming potential of permafrost peatlands (1.7 million km2 in area), with simulated emissions of 0.1–10 Mt CO2-eq decade−1 depending on hydrology and retreat rates. These results underscore the need to account for both ground ice and hydrologic dynamics when assessing thermokarst-driven climate feedbacks."

However, the long-term variability of chlorophyll-a production is not fully understood. Here we explored the long-term changes in austral summer chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Ross Sea region during the 1997–2023 period. The results indicate a clear east–west asymmetric change in chlorophyll-a concentration between 180°W–130°W: decreasing (increasing) in the west (east), which is dominated by the changes in wind forcing and sea ice coverage. Cyclonic wind anomalies drive regional sea ice divergence off Marie Byrd Land, while increasing coastal easterly winds off Marie Byrd Land and southerly wind anomalies in the western Ross Sea drive regional sea ice convergence. As a result, photosynthetically active radiation availability increased (decreased), promoting (limiting) phytoplankton growth in the eastern (western) zone. The warming sea surface temperature and potential increases in dissolved iron also may contribute to the chlorophyll-a blooms in the eastern zone."

However, a high landscape heterogeneity and small size of ponds make it challenging to assess trends in surface water extent and associated carbon and energy fluxes, especially in the understudied Eastern Siberian tundra. Here, we show that surface water extent in these landscapes can be highly dynamic, shaped by small-scale pond processes. Using a time-series of aerial imagery at 12 cm resolution spanning eight years (2014–2021), we classified surface water at three sites in Kytalyk National Park and traced all 465 ponds (i.e. patches of surface water) larger than 1 m2. The total surface water extent at the sites varied between 102%-124% relative to the time-series mean, without significant trends in contrast to previous reports. Individual pond area fluctuated by 52% on average, and two thirds of ponds were present for less than six years. One-quarter of ponds showed evidence for thermokarst or vegetation colonisation as drivers of change, based on our high-resolution surface elevation models. These findings highlight that tundra ponds in Siberia can be highly dynamic in nature and stresses the need for improved change detection of very small surface water bodies in remote sensing analyses to better model carbon and energy fluxes in the tundra biome."

ABM can simulate how humans interact and co-adapt with their environment, which is beneficial for understanding the effects of humans’ decisions in the face of hazards and climate change. ABMs can serve as tools for examining the effects of current and future hydrological hazard management strategies. However, the implementation of hydrological hazard management in ABMs has not yet been systematically evaluated for floods and droughts. To map the current status of ABMs in hydrological hazard modelling and facilitate a discussion on further potential, we conducted a systematic mapping review based on the ROSES protocol. In this review, we investigate what kinds of hydrological hazards and management strategies that are represented in ABMs. Additionally, we synthesise current practices regarding agent types and their decision-making. A total of 377 articles were screened, and 77 articles were analysed in full text. Our findings indicate that hydrological hazard management strategies in ABMs include both structural and non-structural measures. However, there is an emphasis on the complexity of individual agents’ decision-making in implementing these measures, whereas collective agents (e.g. governments) performing non-individual hazard management are implemented more simplistically, often as static scenarios or collective agents with ad-hoc or rational decision-making. Conversely, individual agents are commonly implemented with human-like behaviour. Our study highlights that the simplicity of hazard management in these models could restrict the potential of ABMs as policy and predictive tools, as the implemented hazard management does not capture the full dynamics of human–water systems. Involving stakeholders, adopting interdisciplinary methods, or incorporating bounded-rational decision-making could represent a significant shift to further enhance the explanatory power of ABM for addressing challenges in hydrological hazard management."

Surface daily PM2.5 observations exceeded 100 µg m−3, affecting major cities such as New York City and Philadelphia, while many areas lacked PM2.5 monitors, making it difficult to assess local air quality conditions. To address this gap, we developed a WRF-CMAQ-BenMAP modeling system to provide rapid, spatially continuous estimates of wildfire-attributable PM2.5 concentrations and associated health impacts, particularly benefiting regions lacking air quality monitoring. CMAQ simulations driven by two wildfire emissions datasets and two meteorological drivers showed good agreement with PM2.5 observations, with linear regression results of R2∼0.6 and slope ∼0.9. We further quantified uncertainties introduced by varying emissions and meteorological drivers and found the choice of wildfire emissions dataset alone can alter PM2.5 simulations by up to 40 µg m−3 (∼40%). Short-term health impacts were evaluated using the BenMAP model. Validation against asthma-associated emergency department (ED) visits in New York State confirmed the framework’s ability to replicate real-world outcomes, with ED visits increased up to ∼40%. The modeling results identified counties most severely affected by wildfire plumes, the majority of which lack regulatory air quality monitors. Our approach highlights the value of integrated modeling for identifying vulnerable populations and delivering timely health burden estimates, regardless of local monitoring availability."

While global temperature is widely expected to be reversible under such conditions, regional climate responses are much less well understood. We analyse results from two CMIP6 overshoot scenarios run by an ensemble of Earth system models to assess changes in temperature and precipitation across the globe. We find that overshooting a temperature target by a larger amount leads to a warmer Southern Hemisphere, a cooler Northern Hemisphere, and larger decreases of precipitation in North Africa and increases in East Asia, compared to a smaller temperature overshoot. Some differences, notably increases in extreme temperatures, persist for centuries after the overshoot. These findings show that reversal of global temperatures will not be felt evenly across the globe and that the size of an overshoot matters long term."

Mangroves, as biodiversity hotspots offering crucial ecosystem services, have seen some conservation gains, yet key drivers of high-value mangrove loss remain unaddressed in intergovernmental policy frameworks. It is the first global assessment linking GBF Targets 1 & 3 to mangrove loss drivers and ecosystem assessment. We apply an interdisciplinary approach—combining global-scale geospatial analysis of mangrove loss trajectories between 2000 and 2016 and ecosystem value distribution, and thematic policy analysis. We classify all 120 countries where mangroves are present by their short- and long-term mangrove loss management strategies and evaluate the inclusion of relevant actions under Targets 1 and 3 of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Between 2000 and 2016, 78% of mangrove loss occurred in areas rich in biodiversity, biomass, and coastal protection, mostly outside protected zones. Of 120 mangrove-holding countries, 30 (25%) experienced significant loss. Among them, 11 have the potential to implement short-term mitigation by expanding or managing protected areas, though only 5 included these strategies in national targets. Four countries referenced broader measures like indigenous rights and the prioritisation of ecosystem service hotspots. Only Cameroon, Colombia, Gabon, Panama, and Tanzania are positioned to address major loss drivers within the GBF timeline. This paper is the first global assessment of GBF-aligned national targets to mitigate mangrove loss, contributing to SDGs 14 and 15. We show that mangrove loss cannot be halted by 2030 under the current level of national targets. Policy amendments at national scales can include short-term (area-based protection) and long-term strategies (restoration, rehabilitation and ecosystem-based approaches) to halt mangrove loss."

Eastham;Jerome P. Jarrett,Zero-dimensional contrail models could underpredict lifetime optical depth,"Contrails are clouds that form behind aircraft and can warm the atmosphere as much as carbon dioxide emissions from those planes. This work compares two contrail models of different complexities to understand their lifecycle and impact. The models differ in how contrails evolve over time, implying that we may be significantly underestimating their climate impact. This highlights the need for model diversity and more evaluation against observations of long-lived contrails. 
 Proposed contrail avoidance schemes rely on being able to robustly predict which contrails cause the most climate warming. However, it has not yet been shown that different contrail models agree sufficiently to support the targeting of individual contrails by climate impact. To address this, we compare the most widespread contrail model, the Contrail Cirrus Prediction (CoCiP), to a higher-fidelity contrail model, the Aircraft Plume Chemistry, Emissions, and Microphysics Model (APCEMM), under parameterized meteorological conditions. The results show that the time-integrated total extinction (a proxy for climate impact) in APCEMM is 3.8 times that in CoCiP and that the models have opposite sensitivities of their time-integrated total extinction to relative humidity. We argue that these differences are due to the differing representations of the distribution of ice particles in space and in size across the contrails. The use of a monodisperse ice particle size distribution in a Gaussian plume means that CoCiP models the contrail exclusively as an accelerating, falling mass. The use of a spatially gridded and size-resolved aerosol scheme allows APCEMM to represent the separation of the precipitation plume from the contrail core, hence modeling behavior beyond the initial phase in which the contrail grows unconstrained. This behavior is consistent with prior large-eddy simulation studies, and it accounts for 92 % of the aggregate APCEMM time-integrated total extinction across all simulations. This suggests that models lacking a size-resolved aerosol scheme may underestimate the time-integrated total extinction. While a strategy avoiding a given proportion of persistent contrails in an unbiased way is still expected to yield a proportional reduction in the time-integrated total extinction, implementing strategies using contrail models to select the specific contrails to avoid may lead to fewer reductions in the time-integrated total extinction, primarily due to the current level of disagreement between models. We therefore recommend more research to establish confidence in model predictions at later contrail ages."

An unprecedented evaluation of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative phase 4 models is performed on different deposition schemes in relation to the land use and land cover (LULC) used. Among the results, LULC masks have to be harmonized and up-to-date information used in place of masks that are outdated and too coarse. Alternatively, LULC masks should be evaluated and intercompared when multiple model results are analyzed. 
 We present the collective evaluation of the regional-scale models that took part in the fourth edition of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The activity consists of the evaluation and intercomparison of regional-scale air quality models run over North American (NA) and European (EU) domains for 2016 (NA) and 2010 (EU). The focus of the paper is ozone dry deposition. Dry deposition is among the most important processes of removal of chemical compounds from the atmosphere and an important contributor to the overall chemical budget of the latter. Furthermore ozone dry deposition is very important as it can be severely detrimental to vegetation physiology. The collective evaluation begins with an operational evaluation, namely a direct comparison of model-simulated predictions with monitoring data aiming at assessing model performance (Dennis et al., 2010). Following the AQMEII protocol and Dennis et al. (2010), we also perform a probabilistic evaluation in the form of ensemble analyses and an introductory diagnostic evaluation. The latter analyzes the role of dry deposition in comparison with dynamic and radiative processes and land use/land cover (LULC) types in determining surface ozone variability. Important differences are found across dry deposition results when the same LULC is considered. Furthermore, we found that models use very different LULC masks, thus introducing an additional level of diversity in the model results. The study stresses that, as for other kinds of prior and problem-defining information (emissions, topography, or land–water masks), the choice of  LULC mask should not be at modeler discretion. Furthermore, LULC should be considered as a variable to be evaluated in any future model intercomparison, unless set as common input information. The differences in LULC selection can have a substantial impact on model results, making the task of evaluating dry deposition modules across different regional-scale models very difficult."

An effective method to prevent these at a free surface already exists. Here this is tested for compositional layers deeper in the mantle. The stabilisation method works effectively if density gradients due purely to compositional gradients are used but produces severe artefacts if total density is used. 
 Large density jumps in numerical simulations of solid Earth dynamics can cause numerical “drunken sailor” oscillations. An implicit method has previously been shown to be very effective in stabilising the density jump that occurs at a free surface against such instabilities (Kaus et al., 2010; Duretz et al., 2011). Here the use of this to prevent oscillations of compositional layers deeper in the mantle is examined. If the stabilisation algorithm uses the total density field including the steady increase of density with depth due to adiabatic compression and jumps due to phase transitions, then a severe artificial reduction in convective vigour occurs because the algorithm assumes that density is advected with the flow but these density gradients are not. This artificial vigour reduction increases with Rayleigh number but decreases with decreasing grid spacing. Thus, it is essential to use only composition-related density gradients in the stabilisation algorithm, and a simple method for isolating these is presented. Once this is done, the stabilisation method works effectively for internal compositional layers as well as a free surface."

The particles' trajectories depend on advection and turbulence, represented by a random-walk model. Three numerical methods are compared to estimate their trajectory, evaluating accuracy and computational cost. Tests show that the Euler method offers the best balance. Finally, a rainfall event in a catchment is simulated to validate the model's performance over irregular terrain. 
 This paper presents a Lagrangian model for particle transport driven by a two-dimensional (2D) shallow water model, assuming that the particles have negligible mass and volume, are located at the free surface, and without interactions between them. Particle motion is based on advection and turbulent diffusion, which is added using a random-walk model. The equations for particle advective transport are solved using the flow velocity provided by a 2D shallow water solver and an online first-order Euler method, an online fourth-order Runge–Kutta method and an offline fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The primary objective of this work is to present the capabilities of the new Lagrangian particle transport (LPT) model, while also providing an analysis of the accuracy and computational efficiency of the numerical schemes and their implementation for particle transport. To verify the accuracy and computational cost, several test cases inspired by laboratory set-ups are simulated. In this analysis, the Euler online method provides the best compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, a localized precipitation event in the Arnás catchment is simulated to test the model's capability to represent particle transport in overland flow over irregular topography."

 Linear carbon (Cn), an elusive sp-hybridized carbon allotrope, has long attracted interest for its remarkable properties and debated structures. Here, we report the synthesis of an uncapped linear C5 via tip-induced dehalogenation and ring-opening reaction of C5Br6, with its cumulenic structure confirmed by atomic force microscopy. We further demonstrate the tip-induced coupling of linear C5 to form longer chains (e.g., C10, C15). By applying higher voltage pulses to C5Br6 (also C6Br6), various carbon chains, including C9, C10, C13, C14, C15, C17, C18, C21, C23, could be synthesized. Even-numbered chains (C10, C14 and C18) adopt polyynic structures due to a Peierls transition on NaCl, whereas for odd-numbered chains, C9 adopts a cumulene-like structure, and longer ones exhibit hybrid structures with terminal triple bonds and cumulene-like interiors. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals smaller transport gaps for odd- than even-numbered chains, consistent with Peierls theory, and decreasing gaps with increasing chain length.

 Sulfated fucan is one of the most recalcitrant polysaccharides. The molecular mechanism underlying the endo-1,3-fucanase, which plays a critical role in the breakdown of sulfated fucan, remains unexplained. Here, we conduct a comprehensive structure-function relationship investigation on the endo-1,3-fucanases within a family space—GH168. The family can be divided into four subfamilies according to phylogenetic relationship and functional similarities. Subfamily I, Ⅱ and Ⅳ preferentially recognize Fucp2(OSO3−), Fucp2,4(OSO3−) and Fucp units at the +1 subsite, respectively, while consistently recognizing the Fucp2(OSO3−) unit at the −1 subsite. Remarkably, two-thirds of the interacting residues are dedicated to the recognition of sulfate groups along the glycoside chains. This mechanism is distinct from the direct recognition of the sugar backbone employed by neutral polysaccharide hydrolases. These findings unveil a critical enzyme recognition mechanism for sulfate polysaccharides and promote the application of endo-1,3-fucanases in the structural analysis and oligosaccharide production of sulfated fucan.

 Pd nanoparticles, together with bulk and thin film Pd, constitute the archetype model system for metal-hydrogen interactions. The density of defects in Pd nanoparticles, such as grain boundaries and dislocations, combined with their size, shape, composition and lattice strain, dictate their hydrogen sorption kinetics and thermodynamics. Despite decades of research and its relevance in applications, such as solid-state hydrogen storage, hydrogen sensors, hydrogen embrittlement, and hydrogen separation membranes, a coherent picture of the intricate interplay between defects, strain and Pd nanoparticle hydrogen sorption properties is missing. Here, we employ a combination of single particle nanocompression, single particle plasmonic nanoimaging and high-resolution cross-sectional single particle TEM imaging to investigate hydrogen absorption kinetics and hydride phase formation pressures in a nanofabricated array of Pd nanoparticles on sapphire substrate with systematically varied levels of plastic deformation – and thus defects and strain. We not only show a clear deformation-level dependent trend of both the kinetics and the hydride formation pressure, but also reveal their complex evolution upon hydrogen cycling. We discuss how these results provide a quantitative view of the impact of plastic deformation on nanoscale metal hydrides, and how they reveal the surface and bulk morphology of Pd nanoparticles upon repeated hydrogen cycling.

 Advanced large-scale neural interfaces call for efficient algorithms to automatically process and optimally exploit the richness of their heavy continuous flow of data. In this context, we introduce here a very frugal generic single-layer Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for fully unsupervised identification and classification of multivariate temporal patterns in continuous data streams. This approach is first validated on simulated multivariate data, Mel Cepstral representations of speech sounds, and multichannel multiunit neural recordings. Then, this very simple SNN was found to be effective at classifying action potentials in a fully unsupervised and online-compatible mode on simulated and real spike sorting datasets. These results pave the way for highly frugal SNN architectures for automatic unsupervised real-time pattern recognition in high-dimensional neural data recordings, which could be suitable for future embedding into ultra-low power hardware platforms, such as active neural implants.

This study assesses changes in the P cycle upon abrupt thaw and shows accelerated soil P cycling and increased plant uptake, which may boost primary production and partially offset soil carbon loss. 
 Permafrost thaw can stimulate soil carbon release, triggering a positive carbon–climate feedback, which may be mediated by changes in soil phosphorus (P) availability. However, the response of soil P cycling to permafrost thaw and the potential biotic and abiotic mechanisms involved are largely unknown. We investigate how soil P cycling responds to abrupt permafrost thaw based on large-scale sampling along a permafrost transect on the Tibetan Plateau, combined with 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 33P-labelling and metagenomic sequencing. In collapsed areas, gross phosphate (Pi) mobilization in the topsoil (0–15 cm) is 50% faster compared with non-collapsed landforms, linked to a higher abundance of microbial P-cycling genes. Meanwhile, plant P uptake increases by 71% due to the enhanced gross Pi mobilization, improved plant P-acquisition capabilities and reduced microbial competition with plants upon permafrost collapse. These findings demonstrate that abrupt permafrost thaw accelerates soil P cycling, which could then mediate the permafrost carbon–climate feedback.

This study explores why this is yet to be seen in observations, finding that recent surface freshening increases stratification and traps the CO2-rich water in the subsurface layer, which prevents atmospheric outgassing. 
 The Southern Ocean mitigates global surface warming by taking up a large portion of the carbon released by human activities. While models suggest this carbon sink should weaken as climate change increases upwelling of carbon-rich deep water, such a decline has not been observed over the past decades. Here, using circumpolar hydrographic observations, we reveal that Southern Ocean freshening since the 1990s has enhanced density stratification, which prevents these CO2-enriched waters from reaching the surface. Meanwhile, the surface layer has become thinner, allowing the CO2-rich circumpolar deep water to get closer to the surface, replacing winter water between 100 m and 200 m. In this layer, the CO2 fugacity increased by ~10 µatm because of changing ocean dynamics since the 1990s. Our findings imply that the observed surface freshening temporarily buffered the model-predicted weakening of the Southern Ocean carbon sink, but that such a signal could potentially emerge if stratification weakened. The Southern Ocean carbon sink is predicted to decline under climate change.

 Damage features, such as rifts and crevasses, are the first signs of a weakened ice shelf and the precursor for retreat. Yet, damage changes are not widely quantified on Antarctic ice shelves, leaving future ice shelf weakening poorly understood. Here we use satellite imagery to detect both long-term (24-year) and short-term (annual, 2015–2021) Antarctic-wide damage changes, revealing a multiyear damage development cycle strongly correlated to ice shelf area changes, and a net decline in damaged area from 1997 to 2021. We establish a data-driven link between damage and ice flow characteristics, which shows that ice flow acceleration, strain rate increases and thinning lead to more damage development, in particular under high-emission climate scenarios. This sensitivity to warming suggests that without quantification of damage impacts by detailed physical models the (timing of) ice shelf retreat and Antarctic mass loss may currently be underestimated.

Here the authors assess cascading climate impacts on the EU and identify intervention points for adaptation related to water, livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure and economy, and violent conflict. 
 In an interconnected world, climate change impacts can cascade across sectors and regions, creating systemic risks. Here we analyse cascading climate change impacts on the EU, originating from outside the region, and identify critical intervention points for adaptation. Using network analysis, we integrate stakeholder-co-produced impact chains with quantitative data for 102 countries across foreign policy, human security, trade and finance. Our archetypal impact cascade model reveals critical intervention points related to water, livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure and economy, and violent conflict. Livelihood instability, with violence exacerbating conditions in conflict-prone regions, tends to amplify risks of cascading impacts emerging from low-income countries. High-income countries can trigger cascading impacts through, for example, reduced crop exports. Our findings highlight the importance of policy coherence in addressing interconnected vulnerabilities rather than isolated risks. Thus, agricultural intensification without integrated water management may exacerbate scarcity, whereas safeguarding livelihoods alleviates cascading risks related to forced migration, violent conflict and instability.

 Tropical climate is considered to be one of the decisive keys to global climate dynamics. The extent to which extratropical forcing mechanisms contributed to changes of tropical heat and thus global changes in the climate system, however, is only poorly understood. Here, we reconstruct early Quaternary hydrographic variability of the tropical deep thermocline of the eastern margin of the West Pacific Warm Pool using magnesium to calcium and oxygen isotope ratios of surface and deep-dwelling foraminifera. This approach allows to determine past ocean temperatures and relative salinity changes likely related to extratropical oceanographic reorganisations. Our proxy records point to a freshening of the tropical Pacific deep-thermocline and exhibit a strong coupling to the volume increase of the Antarctic ice shield and cooling of high/mid latitude surface water masses at 1.5 Ma. This temporal coincidence is accompanied by the progressive increase in Earth´s obliquity amplitude and suggests high latitude climate impact via ocean tunnelling of southern-sourced sub-surface water masses towards the equatorial Pacific. We hypothesize that ocean tunnelling of mid-latitude Southern Ocean/South Pacific water to the West Pacific Warm Pool effectively contributed to global climate between 1.7 Ma and 1.2 Ma prior the Mid-Pleistocene-Transition, particularly through changes in oceanic heat budget across vast latitudinal ranges.

 Climate models project an Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown under anthropogenic greenhouse warming. Despite a ~1.5 °C increase in the global mean surface temperature, debate remains on whether and when this circulation has slowed. Here we identify a distinctive temperature fingerprint in the equatorial Atlantic that signals the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation change through numerical ocean model experiments. The equatorial Atlantic is a crucial crossroads for the circulation anomalies to propagate to other oceans. A slowdown drives a mid-depth (1000–2000 m) warming in the equatorial Atlantic in a decade via baroclinic Kelvin waves. Analysis of climate models shows that this mid-depth temperature change is a better indicator for Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation change on decadal and longer timescales than other surface proxies. Observations reveal a robust mid-depth warming since 1960 that emerged from natural variability in the early 2000s, suggesting a slowdown that already started in the late 20th century.

 Flooding exacerbated by climate change presents growing risks to communities worldwide.

 This review integrates vent fluid chemistry and biogeochemical processes to assess how hydrothermal systems influence oceanic iron distribution. Despite rapid precipitation of iron-bearing minerals immediately after venting, buoyant hydrothermal plumes disperse dissolved and nanoparticulate iron across thousands of kilometers, aided by slow oxidation, reversible exchanges between soluble and particulate iron, and biological interactions. These mechanisms underscore hydrothermal vents as a widespread iron source, impacting deep and surface marine ecosystems. Transport dynamics are governed by temperature, pH, microbial activity, and water-mass residence times. We investigate the controls on hydrothermal iron distribution by examining relationships between iron and pH, temperature, chlorinity and hydrogen sulfide in vent fluids, along with solubility modeling of iron(III) hydroxide and iron(II) sulfide.

 Large explosive volcanic eruptions can cover wide areas of land with tephra, sometimes with profound hydrological, ecological, and societal impacts. However, while consequences of tephra fallout and flow deposits have been well studied on annual to decadal timescale, little is known about centennial and longer-term changes in vegetation composition. Here, we consider the enduring impacts of the 946 CE Millennium Eruption of the Changbaishan volcano. We reconstruct the pre-eruption vegetation composition based on species, age, and size of carbonized trees recovered from the pyroclastic deposits and analysis of phytolith records in peat cores. Compared with the early 10th century forest composition and structure, the present montane forest hosts a higher abundance of broad-leaved species. Higher elevations, which today are dominated by alpine tundra, were covered in a spruce forest before the eruption. These differences reflect the long process of ecological recovery following the eruption rather than the effects of recent warming, as has been suggested. However, present warming trends are likely to drive the ecological succession towards a reduction of the alpine vegetation zone. Our study emphasizes the importance of interpreting contemporary ecological change in the context of past massive disturbances, together with subfossil evidence of vegetation composition.

 Global atmospheric rivers are major conduits for moisture and energy transport, playing a critical role in the global hydrological cycle and energy redistribution as climate changes. Here, we assess their evolving roles using observations and climate simulations. By 2100, under a high-emission scenario, about 70% of mid-latitude atmospheric rivers are projected to carry more moisture than the Amazon River, with 11% of this intensification driven by future warming. This trend is expected to increase flood risks in densely populated basins such as the Yangtze, Loire, and Sacramento. Moist static energy provides insight into atmospheric rivers’ behavior on subseasonal scales. Atmospheric rivers redistribute meridional energy transport during active seasons, a process projected to intensify and shift poleward.

 Projecting future climate change is important for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions to a level that would keep the global average temperature increase to 2100 below 2 °C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses emissions scenarios for projecting climate change, but since 2017, an alternative fully statistical Bayesian probabilistic approach has been developed. Both approaches rely on an equation that expresses emissions as the product of population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, and carbon intensity, namely carbon emissions per unit of GDP. Here, we use data on these quantities for 2015–2024 to probabilistically assess the changes in climate change prospects associated with post-Paris emissions. These show that carbon intensity declined (i.e., improved) substantially over that period, but that overall carbon emissions rose, due to the rapid rise in world GDP, which more than canceled out the progress made. We found that the projected temperature increase to 2100 declined only slightly, from 2.6° C to 2.4 °C. Meanwhile, the chance of staying below 2 °C remained low, at 17%.

 For over fifty years, the Landsat satellite series has provided continuous and comprehensive data for monitoring changes on the Earth's terrestrial surface. Eight successive missions, carrying progressively more sophisticated sensors, with improved radiometric, geometric, and spatial characteristics, have provided an unbroken series of optical and thermal imagery, unparalleled globally. With limited lifetimes for each Landsat satellite, planning of each mission typically overlaps to ensure continuity. Commencing in 2021, planning of a Landsat-9 successor gathered user needs from across the Earth Observation (EO) community, resulting in the Landsat Next (LNext) mission design of three sun-synchronous satellites to acquire reflective and thermal wavelength observations with two to three times the temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of previous missions. Proposed 2026 U.S. budgets have significantly reduced NASA Earth Science funding. Alternate architectures are now being investigated for Landsat Next that would only meet Landsat-9 design requirements. While this would provide observation continuity, this implies a revised Landsat Next program launched in the early 2030s with nearly 30 year old capabilities, that may acquire data with lower radiometric quality than the current on-orbit Landsat-8 and 9 missions, and that will not support the new capabilities advocated for by the EO user community. This correspondence serves to raise community awareness that the decision is pending, and outlines the observation requirements originally envisioned for LNext and how they were derived to provide context for evaluating the restructured and descoped capability now being considered."

 NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project recently started to produce in forward production a total of nine Vegetation Index (VI) products from the HLS version 2.0 Landsat 8–9 30 m (L30) and Sentinel-2 30 m (S30) surface reflectance data. The HLS version 2.0 dataset provides revisit observations every 1.6 days globally and every 2.2 days in the tropics (the least frequently covered latitudes), when data from four satellites (Landsat 8–9 and Sentinel-2 A/B) are available. HLS-derived VIs can provide a valuable resource for studying vegetation dynamics, including crop growth, forest loss, and disturbance severity and recovery among others. To characterize the suitability of these VIs for scientific applications, we assessed the between-sensor uncertainties for the nine HLS VI products and 12 additional ones, using VIs derived from HLS V2.0 (L30 and S30) surface reflectance for the years 2021 and 2022. A random sample of over 136 million cloud-free observations from 545 same-day L30 and S30 image pairs were selected to represent different landscapes globally in subarctic, temperate, and tropical climates. First, we evaluated between-sensor consistency for each VI derived from L30 and S30 and found high consistency (R2 > 0.94) for most VIs, except for chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI, R2 = 0.5). Second, we quantified the impact of potential factors on VI uncertainties using the mean absolute difference (MAD) between L30 and S30. Large view azimuth angle differences (VAD) between observation pairs (> ∼ 125°) increased MAD by ≤0.01 in most VIs. The impact on the Root Mean Square Error Interquartile Range (RMSEIQR) for these VIs varied from a decrease of 0.029 to an increase of 0.017. High solar zenith angle (SZ) (> ∼ 60°), prevalent during winter, also increased MAD by <0.07 and RMSEIQR by <0.2 for most VIs. Furthermore, one of the largest discrepancies was found in the area of terrain shadow, with a relative difference of over 20 %. The findings showed the importance of continuing HLS algorithm refinement. Finally, we analyzed VI uncertainties across VI values and for the qualitative aerosol optical depth characterization at three levels. Using VIs derived from low-level aerosols as a baseline, we assessed the impact of aerosol levels. VIs derived from moderate-level aerosol conditions closely aligned with the baseline. However, high aerosol levels introduced evident discrepancies, highlighting increased uncertainty in VIs under these conditions. Notably, even for low-level aerosol observations, uncertainties increased at VI tail values. For robust application of HLS V2.0 VIs in scientific studies, we recommend VI value ranges associated with low uncertainty. Additionally, we reported standard deviations of discrepancies, stratified by aerosol level and VI value, enabling users to account for uncertainties in their analyses, especially for VIs derived from high aerosol levels or beyond recommended ranges."

 Urban renewal has been elevated to a national strategy in China, leading to rapid development and transformation of street blocks. However, monitoring construction events at high temporal resolution remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods, which often struggle with noise interference and lack continuous monitoring capabilities. To address this, we propose Semantic Similarity Contrast-based Street Block Monitoring (SSC-SB), a method that leverages Sentinel-2 time series imagery for automated, high-frequency detection of street block development and renewal. By extracting deep semantic features with a pretrained encoder, SSC-SB analyzes similarity curves to identify development and demolition construction events. Applied to the Middle Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) urban agglomeration shows that SSC-SB achieves 90.4% spatial domain accuracy, with construction start and end date detection accuracies of 68.8% and 54.9%, respectively. Results indicate an increasing emphasis on urban renewal, as demolished street blocks outnumbered new developments for the first time in 2023, with Hunan Province leading in renewal efforts, where renewal blocks accounted for 41.5% of all changed street blocks, reflecting a balanced focus on expansion and infrastructure renewal. Transfer experiments in Xi’an further demonstrate that SSC-SB retains up to 80% of the performance of a locally trained model when applied across regions without fine-tuning, indicating a decent level of generalizability. By providing fine-grained, continuous monitoring, SSC-SB presents a scalable solution for tracking urban transformation."

 Retrieval of suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM) from remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) is useful for frequent and widespread monitoring of water quality. However, Rrs values vary not only with SPM but also with particle composition (organic-dominated or mineral-dominated) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), making it difficult to accurately estimate SPM in diverse aquatic environments using a single algorithm. In this study, two water type classification schemes: optical water type classification scheme and particle composition classification scheme, were integrated into a semi-analytical method to improve the accuracy of SPM estimation in various water bodies. By combining these two classification schemes, we classified water bodies around the world into 12 water types and developed an SPM estimation algorithm for each water type. Using 4,513 in situ Rrs-SPM measurements, the performance of the new SPM estimation algorithm was compared to that of 11 existing SPM estimation algorithms, and the results show that the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) was reduced from 51.3 to 58.9% to 43.2%. The performance of the proposed method was also evaluated using 226 satellite matchups, with an MdAPE of 43.4%. Further comparative analysis and showcases based on several satellite images demonstrate that the two water type classification schemes play different roles that can effectively enhance the accuracy of SPM estimation."

 Low-cost sensors (LCS) and mobile monitoring can enhance existing regulatory air pollution monitoring programs, to obtain more comprehensive spatial and temporal data on air quality. In this study, we evaluate rapid and hyperlocal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution gradients in London using a network of LCS nodes and mobile monitoring through a Mobile Air Pollution Sensing (MAPS) car. Based on both stationary and in-transit measurements, the correlations (R2) between the MAPS car and the LCS nodes decreased from 0.80 to 0.19 as their distance increased from 0–5 m to 16–45 m. Case studies in parks and tunnels revealed that NO2 mixing ratios varied significantly over small distances and times. For example, the mean mixing ratio of NO2 in the urban environment was 21.2 ± 11.8 ppb, whereas it increased to 61.3 ± 25.0 ppb in the Rotherhithe Tunnel, while NO2 increased from a mean of 11.4 ± 3.0 ppb to 22.0 ± 16.3 ppb, from the center of Regent’s Park to the roads that surround it.

 Aerosols significantly impact the regional radiation budget and global climate change. The aerosol extinction coefficient, which quantifies the absorption and scattering of light by aerosol particles in the atmosphere, is essential for environment monitoring and atmospheric optics research. While satellite retrievals, such as the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE), provide high-precision measurements of aerosol extinction coefficients, their spatial coverage is inherently limited. Conversely, the MERRA-2 reanalysis data offers global 3-D aerosol mass mixing ratios but suffers from significant uncertainties. Statistics indicate that the correlation coefficient is only about 0.42 (0.36) between aerosol extinction coefficients calculated directly from MERRA-2 and those retrieved by CALIPSO (SAGE). To address this issue, this study employed a machine learning approach to integrate MERRA-2 data with CALIPSO and SAGE retrievals, producing an optimal full-coverage 3-D aerosol extinction coefficient dataset. The optimized extinction coefficients achieve significantly improved correlation coefficients of 0.70 with CALIPSO and 0.75 with SAGE retrievals. Importantly, the optimized results can reflect the extinction characteristics of faint aerosols, which are missed by CALIPSO L2 layer product. This study provides valuable 3-D data for further understanding global distribution of aerosols, aerosol-climate interactions, and atmospheric processes."

 The Twain-Hu Basin (THB) in Central China, characterized by low-elevation topography and prevailing northerly winter winds, serves as a critical receptor for transboundary air pollutants from the North China Plain (NCP). This study systematically investigates the synergistic mechanisms between regional transport and local meteorology-terrain interactions that drive winter PM2.5 pollution events in this region, by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) vertical profiling, ground-based monitoring, and synoptic dynamic analyses. Results indicate that air pollutants from NCP are transported southward along the Dabie-Funiu Mountains corridor under northerly flows, where topographic barriers enhance pollutant retention within the quasi-basin structure of THB via airflow obstruction and subsidence, forming a dynamic “transport-stagnation” pollution pattern. UAV-based observations reveal a two-layer PM2.5 vertical structure: cold air intrusion and turbulent mixing promote vertical dispersion during transport phases, whereas shallow boundary layers (<200 m) and temperature inversions during stagnation exacerbate near-surface accumulation via aerosol-boundary layer positive feedback. THB's terrain-meteorology coupling amplifies vertical redistribution and horizontal transport efficiency through synergistic valley wind circulations and mesoscale weather systems. This study establishes a dynamical framework for understanding regional “transport-stagnation” PM2.5 pollution and proposes strategic prioritization of topographic corridors and meteorologically sensitive periods in cross-regional governance.

 Black carbon (BC) aerosols are major climate-forcing agents and hazardous air pollutants that contribute to excess mortality in East Asia, yet their public health impacts and associated economic impacts remain under-evaluated in East China in the context of global warming. Here we assess BC pollution characteristics and associated health outcomes in Hangzhou, East China, during 2017. BC from fossil fuel (BCff) combustion dominated BC levels year-round, accounting for about 80 %, with additional regional contributions from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and from ship emissions in summer and autumn. High-pollution episodes were driven by intensified transportation emissions and unfavorable meteorological conditions, with vehicle type playing a critical role. The relative risk of mortality associated with BC exposure peaked in winter, with stronger effects observed for respiratory mortality than for cardiovascular mortality. We estimate that long-term exposure to BC in 2017 resulted in 1442 (95 % CI: 1314, 1561) all-cause deaths, 83 % of which were attributable to BCff, corresponding to an economic loss of 312 (95 % CI: 284, 338) million USD. Besides the regional transport influence, targeted emission reductions in fossil fuel consuming sectors, such as cleaner vehicle technologies and traffic or coal restrictions during pollution episodes in the city, could have substantially reduced mortality: a 50 % reduction in BC concentrations could have avoided 724 deaths and 157 million USD in economic losses, while a more stringent 80 % reduction could have prevented more than 1000 deaths and 216 million USD in losses.

 The precipitating hydrometeor parameters used in cloud microphysics schemes carry inherent uncertainties. The quantification of these uncertainties, together with parameter optimization, can significantly improve precipitation forecasts. This study investigates the effects of 13 parameters in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Double-Moment 6-class (WDM6) microphysics scheme, which define the hydrometeor characteristics such as fall velocity–diameter and mass–diameter relationships, as well as the shape parameter of the drop size distribution for precipitating particles such as rain, snow, and graupel on simulated winter precipitation. A comparison between the model's pre-defined parameters and observations from the International Collaborative Experiments for the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign reveals that the fall velocity–diameter relationship for rain, the mass–diameter relationships for snow and graupel, and the shape parameters for all precipitating particles in the WDM6 scheme deviate from the median values observed by the two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD). To quantify parameter sensitivities, a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of 256 simulations was conducted within parameter ranges constrained by 2DVD observations for three winter precipitation cases. Bayesian optimization was then applied to identify parameter sets that minimized the root mean square error (RMSE) for each case, achieving reductions of up to 30.2 %. These results demonstrate that ensemble-based uncertainty quantification and parameter optimization can help identify key parameters and provide a pathway to improving precipitation simulation performance.

 This study investigates the characteristics of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) based on their organizational structures over the eastern and northeastern parts of the Indian subcontinent, during premonsoon (March–May) and monsoon (June–September) seasons, using 27-years (1998–2024) of TRMM and GPM satellite observations, together with ERA5 reanalysis and surface observations. MCSs were objectively identified from satellite precipitation features using rainfall area and convective thresholds, and then separated into linear and nonlinear systems according to convective geometry. Linear MCSs were further classified into five modes such as Trailing/Leading Stratiform (TS/LS), Parallel-Stratiform (PS), Embedded-Line (EL), No-Stratiform (NS) and Bow-Echo (BE) based on the shape of the convective region and the arrangement of stratiform precipitation.Linear MCSs, though less frequent, produce stronger convection, more extreme hourly rainfall, and intense winds, whereas nonlinear MCSs occur more often and contribute the majority of seasonal rainfall. Among linear modes, TS/LS modes are the most frequent, while infrequent modes such as BE and NS produce the most intense convection, highest rain rates, and greatest potential for damaging winds and extreme hourly rainfall. PS modes display intermediate convective intensity, while EL modes remain the weakest. Environmental composites show notable differences in Convective-Available-Potential-Energy, Total-Column-Water-Vapour and wind shear across modes, with shear contrasts reduced in monsoon.This work provides the first comprehensive characterization of MCS organizational structures in the subcontinent, clarifying their role in seasonal rainfall and severe weather.

(v) The presence of a lee trough has been detected by observation in more than 60 % of the studied eight cases and evaluated by the numerical simulation in all but two cases. (vi) The constant or slight decrease of the Scorer parameter between the levels of 925 and 850 hPa seems to be a good indicator for the formation of the downslope windstorm."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108563,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注的是多源降水数据的融合策略，旨在提高降水估计的准确性，从而服务于水资源管理、气候变化适应、区域水文预报、农业决策和灾害风险评估等领域。虽然使用了包括卫星数据在内的遥感数据，但其核心在于降水量的估算和验证，而非大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['Precipitation', 'Remote Sensing Data Fusion', 'Hydrological Forecasting', 'Climate Change Adaptation']",Jian Sun;Xungui Li;Qiyong Yang,Multi-source precipitation product fusion strategy based on a novel ensemble validation framework,"•A novel ensemble validation precipitation framework (EVPF) is proposed. •EVPF demonstrates superior performance compared to all existing precipitation products. •Systematically addresses validation bias issues in small-sample spatiotemporal heterogeneity scenarios. 
 Accurate precipitation estimation is crucial for water resource management and climate change adaptation, yet traditional methods suffer from significant validation randomness issues in multi-source precipitation data fusion. This study develops a novel Ensemble Validation Precipitation Framework (EVPF) for the Yujiang River Basin in China, systematically addressing the substantial impact of validation set selection on model performance assessment. By integrating six precipitation products (CMORPH, ERA5, PERSIANN, GsMAP, IMERG, and CHIRPS) across 15 meteorological stations, we reveal that (1) there are enormous performance variations across different validation configurations. The maximum RMSE difference reaches 14.4 % between optimal and worst validation configurations, highlighting systematic deficiencies in traditional validation approaches; (2) the EVPF framework, based on CNN-LSTM deep learning architecture, employs cyclical training using different stations as validation sets, effectively eliminating the “validation set gambling” phenomenon and achieving robust performance with RMSE = 8.14 mm d−1, MAE = 3.07 mm d−1, CC = 0.78, R2 = 0.60, POD = 0.88, FAR = 0.39, CSI = 0.57, ETS = 0.41, and HSS = 0.58; (3) there exist significant geographical differentiation patterns from spatial analysis. Coastal stations exhibit larger absolute errors but lower coefficients of variation with systematic error characteristics, while inland mountainous stations show smaller average errors but higher variability, reflecting complexity differences in precipitation mechanisms across diverse geographical environments; (4) the complex attention mechanisms and the Transformer architectures provide limited marginal benefits over the baseline CNN-LSTM framework, while data source ablation experiments confirm that all six precipitation products contribute meaningful information to the fusion process. The EVPF provides a novel methodological foundation for multi-source remote sensing data fusion, with significant application value for regional hydrological forecasting, agricultural decision-making, and disaster risk assessment."
