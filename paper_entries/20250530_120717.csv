10.1088/1748-9326/add178,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注热浪带来的风险，包括对环境、人类健康、水和食物安全等的影响。它分析了大量关于热浪风险评估的文献，并指出了当前研究中的一些不足，例如缺乏对热浪强度和持续时间的考虑，以及缺乏标准化的热浪指标。论文强调需要更全面的风险评估框架，并关注不同领域之间的风险相互依赖性。虽然气候变化与大气环境有关，但该论文的重点在于热浪的风险评估和管理，而不是大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],L Brogno;F Barbano;L S Leo;S Di Sabatino,Review on heatwaves: a risk perspective,"Current anthropogenic climate change is increasing the occurrence and magnitude of heatwaves causing closely interconnected and interdependent risks across multiple domains, such as environmental and human health, water and food security, etc. The following systematic literature review synthesizes the state of the art concerning risks related to heatwaves by analyzing 1459 publications. Since risks arise from the interaction of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, publications were first classified by risk components and then further categorized by research fields: healthcare, society, ecosystem, agriculture, infrastructure, and heritage. The analysis allowed the identification of gaps in the current research with implications for policies and practical applications of risk assessments. First, only 3.1% of the revised literature integrates all three components in risk assessments. Second, most of the literature provides average risks over several heatwave events, thus neglecting critical factors like heatwave magnitude and duration. Third, the absence of standardized indices for identifying and classifying heatwaves hinders effective comparisons of results within the same field. It is recommended that future studies in the same field adopt a common methodology and that the above gaps are taken into account as this would enable building more robust and coherent scientific evidence while reducing ambiguities and uncertainties in risk estimates. Decisionmakers may otherwise struggle to develop effective heatwave adaptation and mitigation strategies if risk assessments are inconsistent or unreliable, and fail to account for risk interdependencies across different domains. More research is needed to develop quantitative frameworks that estimate heatwave risks by summing contributions from each affected domain. This is particularly important, as most of the papers reviewed only focused on healthcare (61.1%) or ecosystems (16.3%). However, we acknowledge that this literature review may have excluded some relevant studies, such as those in the heritage field, due to the specific search string applied in our methodology."

Recent studies in the literature suggest that climate change will likely lead to an increase in the severity and frequency of inland flooding events in the U.S. We review the diverse literature on inland flooding to synthesize the current state of knowledge and to identify knowledge gaps. The topics covered include flood risk perception, insurance uptake, impact on property values, public mitigation strategies, behavioral responses to flooding, fatalities, and damages. We identify important gaps in the literature related to flood insurance demand, adoption of policies that encourage private and public investment in flood management, and flood risk management impacts in disadvantaged communities. Future research should identify factors that have decreased flood-related fatalities over time. Disentangling how infrastructure investments and better flood information improve outcomes during and after a flood could generate more effective tools and policies for mitigating damage from inland floods. Finally, creating and publishing comprehensive datasets that integrate economic, flood, and policy variables over space and time would facilitate future research on the economics of inland flooding. Our findings point to specific future research opportunities that would improve available databases, inform flood risk management strategies, and ultimately reduce the costs of inland floods."

So far, this trend has been driven by increasing coastal development. However, as the climate continues to warm, changing TC climatology may also cause large changes in coastal damages in the future. Approaches to quantifying regional TC risk typically focus on total storm damage. However, it is crucial to understand the spatial footprint of TC damage and ultimately the spatial distribution of TC risk. Here, we quantify the magnitude and spatial pattern of TC risk (in expected annual damage (EAD)) across the US from wind, storm surge, and rainfall using synthetic TCs, physics-based hazard models, and a county-level statistical damage model trained on historical TC data. We then combine end-of-century TC hazard simulations with US population growth and wealth increase scenarios (under the SSP2 4.5 emission scenario) to investigate the sensitivity of changes in TC risk across the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts. We find that not directly accounting for the effects of rainfall and storm surge results in much lower risk estimates and smaller future increases in risk. TC climatology change and socioeconomic change drive similar magnitude increases in total EAD across the US (roughly 160%), and that their combined effect (633% increase) is much higher."

These changes may increase microbially mediated production of the neurotoxic substance methylmercury due to enhanced sulfate metabolism in mountain environments. Here, we assess methylmercury concentrations and formation rates across high-elevation wetlands in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We also investigate sulfate controls on methylmercury production within subalpine peatlands by amending soils with sulfate to mimic increased stream export of sulfate from the alpine zone and measuring methylmercury formation rates for different sulfate treatments. We found that subalpine peatlands have statistically significant higher methylmercury concentrations and formation rates compared to alpine, mineral-soil wetlands. Methylmercury production in subalpine peatlands also increased significantly (p < 0.05) following sulfate additions; the highest rates occurred in sediments with intermediate extractable sulfate concentrations (∼0.60–1.4 mg sulfate g−1 dry soil). Our study is the first to identify soil sulfate-related thresholds for methylmercury production and sulfate-limitation of methylmercury production in subalpine peatlands. These findings highlight important linkages between climate-driven mineral weathering and mercury cycling in mountain regions globally."

As temperatures reached 40.3 °C, thousands of excess deaths were recorded. Based on 38 expert interviews and 4 focus groups with key decision-makers and stakeholders working on the frontline of the 2022 UK heatwaves, we found that the country is not prepared for extreme heat because: (1) policies and planning prioritise coping over resilience; (2) insufficient preventative actions were taken; and (3) a range of barriers hinder effective short and longer-term measures. We argue that whilst the UK coped with the heatwaves in 2022, it lacks the resilience needed to deal with persistent and prolonged heat events."
10.1088/1748-9326/add94d,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是光伏阵列在半干旱草原地区缓解干旱影响的潜力。它探讨了光伏阵列如何通过改善植物的水分关系来抵消减少阳光对光合作用和地上净初级生产力（ANPP）的负面影响。研究发现，在干旱年份，光伏阵列可以提高ANPP，但在降水丰富的年份，这种效应会减弱或消失。因此，该研究主要关注的是光伏技术在生态系统中的应用，以及其对植物生长和水分利用的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['photovoltaic', 'aridity mitigation', 'semi-arid grasslands', 'water stress', 'forage production', 'aboveground net primary production (ANPP)', 'precipitation']",Matthew A Sturchio;Alan K Knapp,Evidence of photovoltaic aridity mitigation in semi-arid grasslands,"In water-limited ecosystems, evidence suggests that photovoltaic (PV) arrays may alleviate water stress, potentially mitigating the loss of key ecosystem services such as forage production. This hypothesized aridity mitigation potential (AMP) of PV arrays posits that negative effects of reduced sunlight on photosynthesis and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) are offset by improved water relations, maintaining or enhancing productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Field tests of this hypothesis are lacking, however. Here we test the AMP hypothesis in a semi-arid Colorado (USA) grassland by contrasting ANPP responses to a single-axis tracking PV array in years with above- and below average precipitation. At all sites within and outside the PV array, precipitation inputs strongly limited ANPP. But in dry years, ANPP was increased by ∼20% in the array relative to adjacent open grassland, with ANPP in some array locations (near PV panel edges) increased by ∼90%. This AMP effect was muted with average precipitation and disappeared in wet years. We conclude that with climate change projections of increased aridity and drought, PV arrays that reduce plant water stress could provide a unique opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate some of their ecosystem consequences in water-limited grasslands."

For the first time, the potential effects of climate change on SSTs were investigated using the SST data from five meteorological observation stations located along the Black Sea coast of Türkiye, covering the period 1963–2014. The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenario outputs of the general circulation models, namely CNRM-ESM2-1, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, and NORESM2-MM, selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 archive were downscaled to station scale by conventional regression analysis and artificial neural networks as statistical downscaling method in the study. SST values for the future periods (2023–2052 and 2053–2082) were obtained using the ensemble model approach for each station. Additionally, quantile delta mapping was used for bias correction. Three performance metrics were used to evaluate the downscaling performance of the methods. The model with the best performance was selected, and the future SST results were obtained and compared with the historical observation data. It was projected that monthly SSTs may increase by 1.66 °C–4.25 °C under the SSP2-4.5 scenario and 1.71 °C–5.75 °C under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. This increases may cause the deterioration of the marine ecosystem and local economic downturn in the Southwestern Black Sea."

Historical and future warming rates are commonly obtained from global climate models, which exhibit considerable spread in terms of global mean and region-dependent warming rates. While the multi-model spread in global mean warming rate has been widely reported in past literature, the multi-model spread in terms of the global warming pattern and its temporal evolution remain unclear. Here, we show that the multi-model spread in the simulated global warming pattern depends closely on the level of warming. The simulated global warming pattern deviates substantially among CMIP6 models before the 2010s and converges afterwards, as the levels of global greenhouse gases and mean warming elevates. Moreover, the consistency of model-predicted future warming patterns varies by emission scenario. Models predict increasingly consistent warming patterns under intermediate and high emission scenarios during the entire 21st century; whereas under low emission scenarios, the multi-models consistency in their simulated future warming patterns reaches a hiatus around the middle of the 21st century. While our study detects a synchronism between the multi-model consistency in the global warming pattern and the global warming level, the physical mechanisms underlying such varying multi-model consistency in the warming pattern merits further investigation."

During the global financial crisis, we found that major countries changed their energy inputs and achieved a rapid low-carbon transition in the global power sector. In this study, we employ two-stage decomposition models to reveal the diverse drivers of the peak-and-decline dynamics in the global CO2 intensity of electricity. We then examine the regional heterogeneous drivers of CO2 intensity from major electricity-producing countries within three income groups. Results show that the global CO2 intensity of electricity reached its peak in 2007 and has declined by 0.35% per year since then. High-income countries consistently reduce the CO2 intensity, while upper- and lower-middle income countries contributed to a reduction of the CO2 intensity until recently. The adoption of renewable energy, the phase-out of thermal power, and improvements in energy efficiency supported by pronounced regional allocation effects contribute to the rapid decline in the global CO2 intensity of electricity. This paper reveals breakthroughs in the recent global energy transition and sheds light on future CO2 mitigation pathways in the global power sector."
10.1088/1748-9326/adda62,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注美国西部地区21世纪末地表气温的上限。它结合大气理论和动态降尺度预测，旨在估算历史和未来的气温上限，并探讨影响这些上限的物理机制。虽然研究涉及大气过程，但其重点在于极端高温的理论上限估计，而非直接利用或开发大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['Surface air temperature', 'Heatwaves', 'Climate Projections', 'Upper Bounds', 'Western United States']",Mark D Risser;Daniel R Feldman;William R Boos;Stefan Rahimi,Upper bounds for 21st-century surface air temperatures in the Western United States,"The last decade has seen a large number of severe heatwaves that were unprecedented in the observational record, highlighting challenges associated with observationally-based statistical quantification of the likelihood and magnitude of future extreme temperatures. An alternative to such probabilistic assessments is identification of upper bounds that quantify the hottest surface air temperatures that can possibly be achieved by the end of the 21st century. Theory, simulations, and observational analyses support the existence of a finite upper bound for surface air temperature; however, estimates for future upper-bound values that are realistic and usable for planning remain unavailable. Here, we combine atmospheric theory with large ensembles of dynamically downscaled projections to estimate historical and end-of-century upper bounds for surface air temperatures. A number of physical mechanisms can influence upper bounds, and at the end of the 21st century, estimates based on mechanisms that yield more moderate upper-bounds produce values around C for much of the Western United States and in excess of C for the hottest parts of the domain. Even cooler high-altitude locations have end-of-century upper bounds over C. Although these upper-bound estimates might seem implausibly large, increases in the upper bounds over the 21st century are similar to increases in dynamically downscaled peak surface temperatures after adjusting those downscaled temperatures to eliminate the possibly biased model trends in surface specific humidity. While upper bound estimates are high relative to historical observations, they nonetheless suggest that heatwave intensity risk is bounded, with uncertainty dominated by projections of surface and upper-level humidity."

However, rapid socioeconomic development poses significant threats to the ecological security of the region. To address this issue, this study used normalized difference vegetation index data to identify ecological source areas. Using optimal parameters-based geographical detector model processed a multi-source data set to develop an ecological spatial network. Methods for topological and pattern analysis were utilized to examine the network. Additionally, various ecosystem services (ESs) within the ecological source areas and their interrelationships were calculated to analyze their associations with network characteristics, climate, and human factors under different network patterns. Finally, based on the importance of the structure and function of regional vegetation, a series of strategies has been proposed to optimize and protect the stability of its spatial distribution. The research findings show that: (1) areas with high ES indicator values are mainly found in the upper reaches of the YRB and the adjacent regions of the Taihang Mountains (2) the ecological spatial network of the YRB is denser in the mid-upper reaches and sparser in the lower reaches. (3) There is a significant synergy between water supply and water conservation within the ecological source areas, while landscape aesthetics and carbon storage, as well as water supply and carbon storage, exhibit significant trade-off effects. (4) Five network patterns and six ES bundles were identified. The correlation between ESs, network topological metrics, and climate-human factors varies across different patterns, with more structurally complete network patterns generally providing better ESs."

Using multiple sets of reanalysis data, this study identifies a systematic co-occurrence of cold extremes and intense surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation in winter over this region, forming compound cold-UV extreme events (cold-UV CEEs). The cold extremes are primarily driven by the East Atlantic blocking which disrupts the typical westerly flow, causing meridional transport of Arctic cold air masses into the East European Plain. Concurrently, the blocking high, which induces subsidence and stabilizes the atmosphere, suppresses cloud formation. The resultant cloud reduction elevates surface UV radiation intensity by about 20% relative to the climatology. In addition, our analysis identifies a significant 9 year cycle in the frequency of cold-UV CEEs, providing a critical foundation for predicting these cascading hazards."

This study provides an updated analysis of global heatwave characteristics using reanalysis data up to 2023. We examined trends in heatwave frequency (HWF), intensity, and duration at multiple spatial/temporal scales, investigating how trend patterns and magnitudes vary across different periods. Results reveal substantial spatial heterogeneity in total heatwave days, with maxima exceeding 24 d per year in the Brazilian Highlands, the west coast of North America, parts of southwest Africa, and India, while cumulative temperature anomalies are highest at high latitudes. Notably, boreal summer is not consistently the season of most extreme heatwaves; over 65% of land areas experienced maximum HWF and severity in non-summer seasons. Long-term trends reveal an accelerating increase in HWF and severity globally, with exceptions in parts of India and central North America. Furthermore, varying-period analyses highlight substantial inter-decadal climate variability.

Emerging evidence has suggested that the resulting disordered respiratory microbiome is caused by disturbed lung architecture and homeostasis responding to inhalable PMs. Lung microbiome dysbiosis also contributes to injury to the lung and distant organs, such as the intestine, through the lung–gut axis. Current studies on the microbiome–disease interplay are still in their infancy, and sufficient understanding of microbial heterogeneity in pathological processes is lacking. Here we investigated the microbiome in the lung and gut of patients with pneumoconiosis in comparison to healthy individuals. Our findings indicated reciprocal causation between lung injuries and microbial dysbiosis under particle exposure; pulmonary Streptococcus and Stenotrophomonas, along with intestinal Ligilactobacillus and Blautia, may represent key microbial communities influencing pneumoconiosis progression. We defined close microbiota crosstalk between the lung and gut, as evidenced by their interaction networks, implying considerable effects on the gut microenvironment through either direct microbial translocation or other mechanisms such as inflammation-driven alterations. Animal experiments further corroborated the findings in humans. Collectively, our results highlight the potential involvement of the lung–gut axis microbial dysbiosis in pneumoconiosis pathogenesis and open a new avenue to develop microbiome-targeted diagnosis and treatment strategies."

Mn species effectually reduced the dissociation energy barrier of H2O adsorbed on the surface, and the surface hydroxyl group promoted the dissociation of O2 and the formation of •O2– under light and humid conditions. The introduction of K promoted the formation of more oxygen vacancies, which served as adsorption sites for gaseous O2. Meanwhile, the electron transfer accelerated by K contributed to the activation of H2O and the rapid production of •OH under light. The synergistic effect of Mn and K successfully achieved simultaneous improvements in the activity, stability, and water resistance of Co3O4/TiO2. Furthermore, the catalyst was applied to the degradation of multicomponent VOCs, and the reaction path was analyzed through the test of intermediates, along with an investigation of the interaction among different types of VOCs.

Herein, we developed a universal ML strategy for precisely predicting the adsorption capacity of polymers for oxyanions and identifying the adsorption driving force based on the combination of experimental and published literature data. The adsorption mechanism was explored through classification of RDkit descriptors with different SHAP importance values, and electrostatic interaction was found to be the driving force in the oxyanion adsorption process, which was further verified by theoretical calculations, adsorption experiments, and effective targeted adsorbent design. In comparison, analysis relying on a separate literature data source led to decreased model performance, some biased conclusions, and invalid targeted adsorbent design. Overall, this study proposed a strategy for data set optimization as well as dominant mechanism identification, which could shed light on better treatment of oxyanions in wastewater."

As an example of what sensor networks can achieve, we describe quantification of emissions from a small urban fire in the Bay Area of California using the Berkeley Environmental Air-quality and CO2 Network (BEACO2N), a dense air quality and greenhouse gas monitoring network. Pollutant enhancements are measured at multiple sites, and the ensemble of observations are fit to a 2-D Gaussian model to characterize the extent of dilution prior to observation and derive emissions at the location of the fire. Distinct approaches are used for calibration of the CO2, air quality gases, and PM2.5 instruments. Consistency of the ratios at multiple locations downwind of the fire supports the precision of the network. We find that the fire emitted approximately 770 ± 30 kg of PM2.5, 70,000 ± 20,000 kg of CO2, 2500 ± 300 kg of CO, and 28 ± 9 kg of NOx. The emission ratios are in the range of typical wildland fires. Using this example, we explore the minimum plume emissions that could be observed and quantified by the network."

Bernard;P. A. van der Beek;V. K. Pedersen;C. Colleps,Production and Preservation of Elevated Low‐Relief Surfaces in Mountainous Landscapes by Pliocene‐Quaternary Glaciations,"Global cooling during the Late Cenozoic led to periodic glaciations in many mountain regions. The repeated waxing and waning of glaciers and ice sheets resulted in continuously changing erosion regimes that modified the underlying topography. While some studies have argued that relief increased due to glaciation, others have argued that glaciations limit relief. The (pre‐glacial or glacial?) origin of elevated low‐relief surfaces (ELRS) in mountain belts is similarly controversial. ELRS have been used to reconstruct pre‐glacial landscapes, trace patterns of glacial incision, and infer tectonic uplift; it is thus important to test to what extent, and under which circumstances, glaciations may produce ELRS. We use a glacial landscape‐evolution model to quantify the integrated effect of Pliocene‐Quaternary glaciations on the topography of a mountain range. Our simulations show that glaciations can produce ELRS by shielding bedrock under slow‐moving, non‐erosive ice at intermediate elevations, with erosion focused on ice‐free summits and at lower elevations. We term this mechanism for ELRS formation the glacial shelter effect. The final extent of ELRS strongly depends on the climatic history and the efficacy of local erosion, which affect both ELRS formation and preservation. Specifically, efficient fluvial erosion during warm interglacials may dissect previously formed ELRS. Modeled ELRS are distributed across elevations because their formation and preservation depend on ice extent rather than on the average equilibrium‐line altitude. Our model results provide a comprehensive framework for the impact of glaciations on topography that explains both the presence and absence of ELRS in glaciated areas."

However, synoptic‐scale variations in precipitation δ18O are rarely discussed. This study presents synoptic‐scale variations in precipitation δ18O induced by the Indian monsoon depression (MD) during June‐September. The MD drives intense convection and rainfall over India, playing a crucial role in upstream processes on the TP. We use daily precipitation δ18O from four sites along a south‐north profile on the southern TP, spanning 92 MD events (1997–2018), and apply machine learning to rank the influencing climate factors. Results show clear spatial differences in precipitation δ18O response to synoptic events on the TP. During the MD, precipitation δ18O decreases significantly on the southern side of the Himalayas but slightly increases on the northern side. On the southern side, lower precipitation δ18O is resulted from an increase in westward water vapor flux while higher δ18O in the north is associated with an increase in southward water vapor flux and a decrease in the intensity of water vapor flux. Precipitation δ18O strongly depends on upstream rainfall and convection during the MD events on the southern side of the Himalayas, but less on the northern side. A positive correlation between precipitation δ18O and the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation index is observed in the Asian Summer Monsoon region, though the MD activity weakens this correlation on the southern side of the Himalayas. Our findings clarify the understanding of precipitation δ18O in a synoptic scale system on the southern TP."

This study presents the first two vertically measured CO2 profiles from the ground to 25 km in the economically developed regions of southeast China using a balloon‐borne AirCore system. From higher to lower altitudes, the two CO2 profiles revealed distinct characteristics, showing an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase with fluctuations up to 13.1 ppm. Notable peaks were observed in the stratosphere, contrasting with findings from northwestern China, likely due to strong aircraft emissions in economically active southern regions. Additionally, air mass transport from urban areas elevated upper‐atmosphere CO2 levels. After 2‐hr storage, the CO2 profile achieved a vertical resolution of 260 m at 10 km with the segmented design and narrow tube diameter enhancing high‐altitude resolution. Although CarbonTracker simulations and Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) prior profiles matched the overall trends, significant differences in concentrations and key altitude fluctuations highlight limited prior profile information and uncertainties in remote sensing inversions. Observations from OCO‐3, TCCON, and GOSAT‐2 likely overestimate column‐averaged CO2 concentration by 1–7 ppm due to limitations in spatial resolution, prior information, and inherent method constraints. The CO2 profiles in the same regions remain variable, influenced by terrain, meteorology, and sampling season. Given the scarcity of CO2 profile data, existing global data sets may lack regional representativeness, emphasizing the need for higher spatial and temporal resolution monitoring to accurately capture global CO2 dynamics."

However, there still exist significant knowledge gaps in understanding optical characteristics and molecular composition of chromophores of brown carbon (BrC) in PM emitted from agricultural machinery. Therefore, BrC in PM from six typical agricultural machines in China were measured to investigate the light absorption, chromophore characteristics, and influencing factors. Results showed that the average emission factors of methanol‐soluble organic carbon (MSOC) and water‐soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were 0.96 and 0.21 g (kg fuel)−1, respectively, exhibiting clear decreasing trends with increasing engine power and improving emission standards. Despite the light absorption coefficient of methanol‐extracted BrC (Abs365,M) being approximately 2.2 times higher than that of water (Abs365,W), mass absorption efficiency of water‐extracted BrC (MAE365,W) exhibited significantly greater values than MAE365,M. Among the detected chromophores, nitro‐aromatic compounds (NACs) exhibited the highest contribution to light absorption that was about 14.5 times more than to total light absorption compared to their mass contributions to MSOC (0.04%), followed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs). Besides, the average integrated simple forcing efficiency values were estimated to be 1.5 W g−1 for MSOC and 3.7 W g−1 for WSOC, indicating significant radiative forcing absorption of agricultural machinery. The findings in this study not only provide fundamental data for climate impact estimation of but also propose effective strategies to mitigate BrC emissions, such as enhancing emission standards and promoting the adoption of high‐power agricultural machinery."

However, the diurnal precipitation across mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) and the factors influencing its spatial variations are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated diurnal precipitation patterns in summertime (June–August) from 2002 to 2005 over MSEA using ground‐based observations, satellite products, the global ERA5 reanalysis, and high‐resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model at 9‐ and 3‐km grid spacing forced by ERA5 hourly data on ∼0.25° grids. Various observation‐based data sets including GHCN‐Daily, Multi‐Source Weighted‐Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Asian Precipitation ‐ Highly‐Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), and Integrated Multi‐satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) were used. In evaluating daily precipitation over MSEA, MSWEP, and APHRODITE data sets show similar patterns in precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity, while IMERG tends to produce higher amounts but with less frequency. ERA5 overestimates light precipitation compared to the other data sets. The WRF simulations generally produce heavier but less frequent light precipitation, with the 3‐km simulation producing less intense precipitation than the 9‐km simulation. A k‐means classification of IMERG data revealed five distinct spatial regimes with varying diurnal precipitation cycles. The WRF simulations closely match these regimes, capturing key diurnal cycles missed by ERA5 over mountainous regions and coastlines. Additionally, convective activities and near‐surface winds influence these cycles, with WRF simulations better representing coastal and mountain precipitation patterns than ERA5. High‐resolution WRF simulations, especially the 3‐km simulation, capture diurnal precipitation more accurately than ERA5, highlighting the importance of employing convection‐permitting models to simulate precipitation diurnal cycles over complex terrain."

This study involves three experiments designed to evaluate the impacts of assimilating the polarimetric variable specific differential phase (KDP) for a squall line case in Jiangsu Province, including a control experiment without DA and two experiments with radar DA. In the first DA experiment, only conventional radar variables reflectivity and radial velocity are assimilated at 6‐min intervals, while the other DA experiment additionally assimilates KDP. Strong correlations between model variables and KDP are established based on the prior ensemble, which contributes to the positive DA effects. The assimilation of KDP leads to significant improvements in both the horizontal and vertical structures of the analyses, with stronger lower‐layer convergence and updrafts in front of the squall line. Additionally, the rainwater mixing ratio intensifies and expands in the northern part of the squall line with KDP assimilation. Consequently, the precipitable water and convective available potential energy are increased from 70 to 80 mm and from 1,559 to 2,116 J/kg, respectively, supported by higher pseudo‐equivalent potential temperatures at 925 hPa. Furthermore, the analyzed and predicted composite reflectivity is enhanced with KDP assimilation, aligning well with observations. In the 1‐hr rainfall forecast, both the location and intensity of the short‐term precipitation are improved by assimilating KDP, which is further confirmed by objective quantitative assessments."

This trend can be reversed by reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A large‐ensemble model experiment, in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations are quadrupled and then reduced to the initial state, shows an overall recovery of Arctic SIA by CO2 removal, but at a slower rate than its decline to CO2 increase. The exception is the North Atlantic, where SIA increases rapidly with decreasing CO2 concentrations. The under‐recovery of Central Arctic SIA can be attributed to a slow decrease in Arctic ocean heat storage, due to a lagged ocean cooling and heat transport, and enhanced downward longwave radiation in the Arctic atmosphere, partly due to frequent atmospheric rivers across the Arctic Circle. In contrast, the over‐recovery of North Atlantic SIA is primarily attributed to weakened ocean heat transport by a delayed recovery of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This over‐recovery is shown to be model dependent, following each model's AMOC change. Full recovery of Arctic SIA takes over 300 years after CO2 removal. This result suggests that the response of Arctic sea ice to CO2 removal may be spatially inhomogeneous, with different impacts on regional climate, potentially affecting the climate of the Northern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes."

 Modelling liver disease requires in vitro systems that replicate disease progression1,2.

Here, we describe a multicellular organoid system composed of adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells that recapitulates the architecture of the liver periportal region and, when manipulated, models aspects of cholestatic injury and biliary fibrosis. We first generate reproducible hepatocyte organoids with functional bile canaliculi network that retain morphological features of in vivo tissue. By combining these with cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts, we generate assembloids that mimic the cellular interactions of the periportal region. Assembloids are functional, consistently draining bile from bile canaliculi into the bile duct. Strikingly, manipulating the relative number of portal mesenchymal cells is sufficient to induce a fibrotic-like state, independently of an immune compartment. By generating chimeric assembloids of mutant and wild-type cells, or after gene knockdown, we show proof-of-concept that our system is amenable to investigating gene function and cell-autonomous mechanisms. Taken together, we demonstrate that liver assembloids represent a suitable in vitro system to study bile canaliculi formation, bile drainage, and how different cell types contribute to cholestatic disease and biliary fibrosis, in an all-in-one model."

 The degree to which the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) weakens over the twenty-first century varies widely across climate models, with some predicting substantial weakening. Here we show that this uncertainty can be greatly reduced by using a thermal-wind expression that relates the AMOC strength to the meridional density difference and the overturning depth in the Atlantic. This expression captures the intermodel spread in AMOC weakening, with most of the spread arising from overturning depth changes. The overturning depth also establishes a crucial link between the present-day and future AMOC strength. Climate models with a stronger and deeper present-day overturning tend to predict larger weakening and shoaling under warming because the present-day North Atlantic is less stratified, allowing for a deeper penetration of surface buoyancy flux changes, larger density changes at depth and, consequently, larger AMOC weakening. By incorporating observational constraints, we conclude that the AMOC will experience limited weakening of about 3–6 Sv (about 18–43%) by the end of this century, regardless of emissions scenario. These results indicate that the uncertainty in twenty-first-century AMOC weakening and the propensity to predict substantial AMOC weakening can be attributed primarily to climate model biases in accurately simulating the present-day ocean stratification. Observational constraints, along with a better understanding of climate model behaviour, suggest that the projected weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in the twenty-first century will be less severe than previously anticipated."

 Lung injury in preterm infants leads to structural and functional respiratory deficits, with a risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that in its most severe form is accompanied by pulmonary hypertension (PH). To identify potential cellular and molecular drivers of BPD in humans, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of preterm infant lungs with evolving BPD and BPD + PH compared to term infants. Examination of endothelial cells reveals a unique, aberrant capillary cell-state in BPD + PH defined by ANKRD1 expression. Within the alveolar parenchyma in infants with BPD/BPD + PH, predictive signaling analysis identifies surprising deficits in the semaphorin guidance-cue pathway, with decreased expression of pro-angiogenic transcription factor FOXF1. Loss of semaphorin signaling is replicated in a murine BPD model and in humans with causal FOXF1 mutations for alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACDMPV), suggesting a mechanistic link between developmental programs underlying BPD and ACDMPV and uncovering a critical role for semaphorin signaling in normal lung development.

Aureobasidin A (AbA), a natural cyclic peptide, displays antifungal activity and inhibits IPC synthase, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae IPC synthase, composed of catalytic subunit Aur1 and regulatory subunit Kei1, in its AbA-bound state. The complex is resolved as a dimer of Aur1-Kei1 heterodimers, with Aur1 mediating homodimerization. AbA occupies a predominantly hydrophobic pocket in the catalytic core domain of each Aur1 subunit, blocking the entry of both substrates. Mutations conferring AbA resistance cluster near the AbA-binding site, thus interfering with AbA binding. Our study lays a foundation for the development of therapeutic drugs targeting fungal IPC synthase. The antifungal peptide aureobasidin A (AbA) inhibits a fungal enzyme, IPC synthase, through unclear mechanisms.

 Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) can be invasive or aggressive, yet the mechanisms behind these behaviors remain poorly understood, impeding treatment advancements. Here, we integrat single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, analyzing over 177,000 cells and 35,000 spots across 57 tissue samples. This comprehensive approach facilitates the identification of PitNETs tumor populations and characterizes the reconfiguration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as PitNETs progress and invade. We trace the trajectory of TPIT-lineage PitNETs and identify an aggressive tumor cluster marked by elevated p53-mediated proliferation and a higher Trouillas classification, both associated with tumor progression. Additionally, we document the heterogeneity of immune stromal cells within PitNETs, particularly noting the enrichment of SPP1+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in invasive tumors. These TAMs facilitate tumor invasion through the SPP1-ITGAV/ITGB1 signaling pathway. Our in-depth single-cell and spatial analysis of PitNETs uncovers the molecular dynamics within the TME, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Here the authors show that inhibiting b-catenin with lipid nanoparticles encapsulating siRNA targeting CTNNB1 impairs tumor growth and promotes anti-tumor immunity in preclinical HCC models. 
 First-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations show responses in subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Nearly half of HCCs are Wnt-active with mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for β-catenin), AXIN1/2, or APC, and demonstrate heterogeneous and limited benefit to ICI due to an immune excluded tumor microenvironment. We show significant tumor responses in multiple β-catenin-mutated immunocompetent HCC models to a novel siRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle targeting CTNNB1 (LNP-CTNNB1). Both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cellular and zonal reprogramming, along with activation of immune regulatory transcription factors IRF2 and POU2F1, re-engaged type I/II interferon signaling, and alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity upon β-catenin suppression with LNP-CTNNB1 at early- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, ICI enhances response to LNP-CTNNB1 in advanced-stage disease by preventing T cell exhaustion and through formation of lymphoid aggregates (LA). In fact, expression of an LA-like gene signature prognosticates survival for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the IMbrave150 phase III trial and inversely correlates with CTNNB1-mutatational status in this patient cohort. In conclusion, LNP-CTNNB1 is efficacious as monotherapy and in combination with ICI in CTNNB1-mutated HCCs through impacting tumor cell-intrinsic signaling and remodeling global immune surveillance, providing rationale for clinical investigations. Gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for b-catenin) leading to deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling are frequently observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Here, the authors shed light into this mechanism of chemoresistance, showing that chemotherapeutic drugs can promote the degradation of CAD following cleavage by activated caspase-3 on its Asp1371 residue. 
 Metabolic heterogeneity resulting from the intra-tumoral heterogeneity mediates massive adverse outcomes of tumor therapy, including chemotherapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms inside remain largely unknown. Here, we find that the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway determines the chemosensitivity. Chemotherapeutic drugs promote the degradation of cytosolic Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II, Aspartate transcarbamylase, and Dihydroorotase (CAD), an enzyme that is rate-limiting for pyrimidine synthesis, leading to apoptosis. We also find that CAD needs to be cleaved by caspase-3 on its Asp1371 residue, before its degradation. Overexpressing CAD or mutating Asp1371 to block caspase-3 cleavage confers chemoresistance in xenograft and Cldn18-ATK gastric cancer models. Importantly, mutations related to Asp1371 of CAD are found in tumor samples that failed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and pharmacological targeting of CAD-Asp1371 mutations using RMY-186 ameliorates chemotherapy efficacy.

 How does the motor cortex combine simple movements (such as single finger flexion/extension) into complex movements (such as hand gestures, or playing the piano)? To address this question, motor cortical activity was recorded using intracortical multi-electrode arrays in two male people with tetraplegia as they attempted single, pairwise and higher-order finger movements. Neural activity for simultaneous movements was largely aligned with linear summation of corresponding single finger movement activities, with two violations. First, the neural activity exhibited normalization, preventing a large magnitude with an increasing number of moving fingers. Second, the neural tuning direction of weakly represented fingers changed significantly as a result of the movement of more strongly represented fingers. These deviations from linearity resulted in non-linear methods outperforming linear methods for neural decoding. Simultaneous finger movements are thus represented by the combination of individual finger movements by pseudo-linear summation. Here, the authors show that Intracortical recordings in human motor cortex during attempted multi-finger movements reveal a largely linear code with two violations: magnitude normalization and greater shifts in tuning direction for weakly represented fingers."

 AlGaN alloys with high Al content offer the possibility to create deep ultraviolet light sources emitting at wavelengths ≤ 240 nm with enhanced quantum efficiency. However, increasing the band gap when the Al content surpasses  ~80% leads to problems with n-type doping of AlGaN alloys with the standard choice of Si donors, due to the formation of the so-called negative Si DX center. In this paper, we show that the amphoteric nature of the Si dopant in AlGaN alloys is fundamentally controlled by the local environment and the ordering of the Ga and Al atoms in the vicinity of the Si atom. Our conclusions are based on advanced characterization sensitive to the local environment of defects and impurities, complemented by electronic structure calculations. We propose that spatial ordering of Ga and Si atoms could allow efficient n-type doping at even higher Al contents, including AlN.

Accessions were given a future climate resilience score and a genomic adaptive capacity score using genomic estimated adaptive values generated from environmental genomic selection. We identified the best potential parents and the geographies that harbour the most promising genotypes for crop improvements, as well as more at-risk areas. Such methods may be expanded to other crops and used for decision support for future breeding.

 The physical dimension of cities and its spatial patterns play a crucial role in shaping society and urban dynamics. Understanding the complexity of urban systems requires a detailed assessment of their physical structure. Urban geography has long focused on framing typologies to represent common patterns in the urban fabric using various methodologies. However, only recent advancements in computational methods and global land cover data have enabled to comprehensively identify typologies of urban patterns at the city scale through new unsupervised approaches. Nevertheless, typologies of finer-grained patterns at intra-urban scale have not yet been explored comprehensively at a global level. In this paper, building upon these advances, we explore the intra-urban patterns of more than 1500 cities across the globe. We rely on a Local Climate Zone land cover classification to represent the multidimensional variabilities of intra-urban morphology. Adapting a deep learning based unsupervised clustering approach, we find a typology of 138 intra-urban patterns. Analyzing the results of this data-driven approach, we prove that each pattern identified is unique, i.e. statistically different, in its composition and configuration. With this study summarizing the global diversity of the urban fabric, we reveal that any city of the world can be described as a specific assemblage of a fraction of these 138 universal patterns.

 Upright maize straw left in the field during autumn and winter significantly contributes to severe air pollution in agricultural ecosystems due to burning. It is essential to obtain the spatial distribution of upright maize straw quickly and accurately for effective management and environmental protection. However, identifying upright maize straw using remote sensing is difficult because its spectral properties resemble those of other land covers like straw residue, bare soil, and sparse wheat at the same period. This study proposes a novel index for extracting upright maize straw by integrating low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) visible to near-infrared spectral bands with digital surface model (DSM) data. First, we analyzed the spectral characteristics of four land cover types: upright maize straw, straw residue, bare soil, and sparse wheat, and proposed the adjusted straw index (ASI) that leverages green, red, and red-edge bands. Next, we combined DSM data with the ASI to develop the adjusted height straw index (AHSI), considering the height of the upright maize straw. Finally, the combination of index-plus-Otsu threshold segmentation and random forest (RF) methods was applied to identify and extract the spatial distribution of upright maize straw. The results showed that our method effectively detected the main regions of upright maize straw.

 The wheat powdery mildew (WPM) is one of the most severe crop diseases worldwide, affecting wheat growth and causing yield losses. The WPM was a bottom-up disease that caused the loss of cell integrity, leaf wilting, and canopy structure damage with these symptoms altering the crop’s functional traits (CFT) and canopy spectra. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral analysis became a mainstream method for WPM detection. However, the CFT changes experienced by infected wheats, the relationship between CFT and canopy spectra, and their role in WPM detection remained unclear, which might blur the understanding for the WPM infection. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a new method that considered the role of CFT for detecting WPM and estimating disease severity. The UAV hyperspectral data used in this study were collected from the Plant Protection Institute’s research demonstration base, Xinxiang city, China, covering a broad range of WPM severity (0–85 %) from 2022 to 2024. The potential of eight CFT [leaf structure parameter (N), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll a + b content (Cab), carotenoids (Car), Car/Cab, anthocyanins (Ant), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and average leaf angle (Deg)] obtained from a hybrid method combining a radiative transfer model and random forest (RF) and fifty-five narrow-band hyperspectral indices (NHI) was explored in WPM detection. Results indicated that N, Cab, Ant, Car, LAI, and CCC showed a decreasing trend with increasing disease severity, while Deg and Car/Cab exhibited the opposite pattern. There were marked differences between healthy samples and the two higher infection levels (moderate and severe infection) for Cab, Car, LAI, Deg, CCC, and Car/Cab. N and Ant only showed significant differences between the healthy samples and the highest infection level (severe infection). As Cab, Car, and Ant decreased, the spectral reflectance in the visible light region increased. The decrease in N and LAI was accompanied by a reduction in reflectance across the entire spectral range and the near-infrared area, which was exactly the opposite of Deg. The introduction of CFT greatly improved the accuracy of the WPM severity estimation model with R2 of 0.92. Features related to photosynthesis, pigment content, and canopy structure played a decisive role in estimating WPM severity. Also, results found that the feature importance showed a remarkable interchange as increasing disease levels. Using features that described canopy structure changes, such as optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, LAI, visible atmospherically resistant indices, and CCC, the mild infection stage of this disease was most easily distinguished from healthy samples. In contrast, most severe impacts of WPM were best characterized by features related to photosynthesis (e.g., photochemical reflectance index 515) and pigment content (e.g., normalized phaeophytinization index). This study help deepen the understanding of symptoms and spectral responses caused by WPM infection."

 To characterize the distribution characteristics of PM2.5 pollution within a small scale within the city, PM2.5 concentration estimation data with high spatial resolution is required. However, the existing PM2.5 data mostly have a resolution of more than 1 km, and the spatial scale is relatively coarse, which makes it difficult to meet the actual needs of fine pollution monitoring and governance in cities. To address this limitation, this study based on the deep neural network (DNN) model, used multi-source auxiliary data such as the top atmospheric reflectance (TOAR) data and meteorological data of the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite to achieve near-ground PM2.5 concentration retrieval with a spatial resolution of 30 m in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The model's performance was evaluated by a cross-validation (CV) method based on samples and sites. The results showed that the sample-based R2 was 0.912 with an RMSE of 10.326 μg/m3, while the site-based R2 was 0.780 with an RMSE of 16.375 μg/m3. The high-resolution PM2.5 data retrieved in this study can reveal the spatial differences in pollution at the urban block and even building scale. Combined with the analysis of a typical pollution event, the practical application potential of this high-resolution data in identifying local pollution sources and analyzing pollution changes within the city was verified. This study provides a new technical path for high-resolution PM2.5 retrieval and provides important data support for refined urban air quality monitoring and scientific governance."

 Using a methodology for the estimation of coarse particle exchanges via Doppler lidar, based on the eddy covariance technique, profiles of vertical transport velocities were derived and analyzed. The methodology was tested across diverse atmospheric conditions in two different Mediterranean dryland landscapes in Southeastern Spain, namely Guadiana-UGR (extensive, inland olive grove), and Aguamarga (shrubland with maritime influence). Firstly, study cases were analyzed and the main atmospheric mechanisms impacting particle transport were identified. Convective mixing within the boundary layer was found to be the primary driver of the upward particle transport. However, cloud cover was observed to attenuate the transport velocity, while significant deposition events were observed during a Saharan dust outbreak. Secondly, positive transport velocities were found during convective periods and lower, yet positive, values during non-convective periods. Higher transport velocities were observed during a drier period at Guadiana-UGR, likely due to drier soil conditions. Aguamarga exhibited notably lower transport velocities. Considering only the lowermost observational level (105 m above the ground), net emission of particles was observed. Footprint analysis supported the representativeness of the fluxes. Our findings provide novel insights into particle exchanges over Mediterranean drylands, quantifying the turbulent transport and identifying its atmospheric drivers. Additionally, the considered ecosystems were found to be net sources of particles during the study periods. These results highlight the role of drylands as emerging contributors to global dust emissions in the context of climate change."

Elevated pollution sources and long-distance transport have important effects on the distribution of NH4+in Beijing. •The contribution of NH4+to PM2.5remains at a relatively stable level in two years, and increases slightly during the pollution period, which is related to the increase in hygroscopic growth of NH4+particles. •Most of the NH4+over Beijing during the study period is in the form of NH4NO3. 
 Atmospheric ammonium (NH₄+), a key component formed through complex chemical reactions and particulate transformations involving nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and ammonia (NH₃), plays a critical role in climate dynamics, ecological balance, and human health. Understanding the vertical distribution of NH₄+ is essential for comprehensively characterizing regional aerosol patterns. However, the lack of systematic and spatiotemporally resolved studies has hindered the development of accurate NH₄+ distribution models and predictive capabilities. In this study, we present an innovative algorithm based on the GRASP model to retrieve hourly NH₄+ mass concentration data from 2021 to 2022, enabling a detailed investigation of NH₄+ vertical distribution characteristics in Asia super megacity-Beijing. Our findings reveal that transportation emissions are a primary source of NH₄+ in Beijing, while elevated pollution sources and long-range transport also significantly influence local NH₄+ distribution. The vertical profiles exhibit strong seasonal consistency over the two-year study period, with higher concentrations typically observed in upper atmospheric layers compared to near-surface layers, and distinct peaks at 1 km and 300 m above ground level. NH₄+ concentrations are highest in spring and lowest in winter. In spring, the influence of northern dust leads to elevated NH₄+ levels, particularly on moderately polluted days, with more pronounced vertical gradients. During autumn, a significant peak in NH₄+ concentration at 1 km altitude is attributed to long-range transport from southern urban centers. The contribution of NH₄+ to PM₂.₅ remains relatively stable over the two years, with a slight increase during polluted hours due to enhanced hygroscopicity of NH₄+ particles driven by higher atmospheric humidity. Strong correlations among chemical components across various altitudes indicate a high degree of homogeneity. Additionally, ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) is identified as the predominant form of NH₄+ in Beijing during the study period. These insights advance our understanding of NH₄+ dynamics and its role in urban air quality, providing a foundation for improved aerosol modeling and pollution mitigation strategies."

 The study aimed to assess the impact of blocking situations (BS) on maximum air temperature (Tmax) and the daily sum of solar radiation (DSSR) in Poland during the summer months (June–August) from 1971 to 2023. The results indicate an increasing trend in the frequency of BS days, particularly in southern Poland, with statistically significant upward tendencies. However, multi-decadal variability is also evident, with periods of more and less frequent BS occurrences. On average, BS occurred for 3–8 days per summer, varying by region, while in extreme years (e.g., 2015), over 20 BS days were recorded in southern Poland. During all BS days, Tmax anomalies averaged up to 7 °C, and DSSR anomalies reached as high as +6 MJ·m−2·day−1 relative to multi-year averages. A strong correlation was found between the number of BS days and Tmax (r = 0.57, p < 0.001), as well as DSSR (r = 0.55, p < 0.001). Interestingly, smaller temperature anomalies were recorded near the Baltic coast, likely due to the moderating influence of sea breezes. These findings underscore the spatial variability of BS and their pivotal role in driving extreme weather conditions in Poland."

By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation.

The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO2efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC.

We addressed this issue by isolating defective octahedra at the perovskite surface using a vapor-deposited polydentate ligand. Surface octahedra isolation suppresses ion migration into the charge transport layer and reduces surface ionic defects, modulating the kinetics of ion migration during light-dark cycles. Our 785-square-centimeter industrial-scale perovskite solar modules achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%. Our modules demonstrated enhanced diurnal stability, retaining more than 97% of their initial PCE even after 101 light-dark cycles at 50°C. Our perovskite modules maintained stable power output during 45 days of outdoor operation under severe summer conditions, exhibiting stability comparable with that of the reference silicon cell."

Depletion in the copy number of the plasmid-encoded virulence geneplaoccurred in later-dated strains of the first and second pandemics, yet the biological relevance of thepladeletion has been difficult to test. We identified modernY. pestisstrains that independently acquired the samepladepletion as ancient strains and herein show that excision ofplafrom the multicopy pPCP1 plasmid is accompanied by the integration of a separate full pPCP1 harboringplainto the single-copy pCD1 plasmid, reducingpladosage. Moreover, we demonstrate that this depletion decreases the mortality of mice in models of bubonic plague but not in the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the disease. We hypothesize thatpladepletion may have been selectively advantageous in bubonic plague, owing to rodent fragmentation after pandemic-induced mortality."

Very few causal loci underlying diapause variation have yet been identified. By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years. Our study proposes a model that explains how adaptive phenotypes can evolve rapidly without affecting related essential functions."

In this work, we present theg-factor measurement of lithium-like tin, accurate to 0.5 parts per billion, as well as ab initio theoretical calculations that include an advanced treatment of the interelectronic interaction. We further improved the prediction by using the experimental result for the hydrogen-like tingfactor, inferring from it the unknown higher-order quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects.

Using eight glacier models, we simulated global glacier evolution over multicentennial timescales, allowing glaciers to equilibrate with climate under various constant global temperature scenarios. We estimate that glaciers globally will lose 39 (range, 15 to 55)% of their mass relative to 2020, corresponding to a global mean sea-level rise of 113 (range, 43 to 204) mm even if temperatures stabilized at present-day conditions. Under the +1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, more than twice as much global glacier mass remains at equilibration (53% versus 24%) compared with the warming level resulting from current policies (+2.7°C by 2100 above preindustrial). Our findings stress the need for stringent mitigation policies to ensure the long-term preservation of glaciers."

In this study, we synthesized an ionic salt from C60, 4-(1′,5′-dihydro-1′-methyl-2′H-[5,6] fullereno-C60-Ih-[1,9-c]pyrrol-2′-yl) phenylmethanaminium chloride (CPMAC), and used it as the electron shuttle in inverted PSCs. The CH2-NH3+head group in the CPMA cation improved the ETL interface, and the ionic nature enhanced the packing, leading to a ~threefold increase in the interfacial toughness compared with that of C60. Using CPMAC, we obtained ~26% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with ~2% degradation after 2100 hours of 1-sun operation at 65°C. For minimodules (four subcells, 6 square centimeters), we achieved a PCE of ~23% with <9% degradation after 2200 hours of operation at 55°C."

We synthesize the mechanisms that determine biological responses to seasonality, to demonstrate how their interconnections can propagate impacts of altered seasonal patterns and complicate predictions. Given the potential for nonlinearities and the propagation of impacts across levels of ecological complexity, we advocate the use of mechanistic approaches that acknowledge species-specific responses to the environment and potential seasonal adaptations."
