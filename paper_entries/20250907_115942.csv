10.5194/acp-25-9859-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了2022年汤加火山爆发后，大量水汽进入平流层对气溶胶动力学过程的影响。研究重点关注水汽对二氧化硫氧化、硫酸盐气溶胶形成以及火山灰老化的加速作用。论文利用ICON-ART模型模拟了火山爆发后第一周的 plume 演变，并与卫星观测数据进行对比，验证了模型对二氧化硫氧化和气溶胶动力学过程的模拟效果。研究结果表明，水汽的注入加速了硫酸盐的形成，并增强了火山灰的涂层效应，但气溶胶动力学过程本身不足以解释火山灰的快速消失现象。此外，气溶胶与辐射的相互作用会加热 plume，从而影响水汽 plume 的下降。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及大气成分分析（如二氧化硫、硫酸盐气溶胶、火山灰和水汽），卫星观测数据的应用，以及气溶胶光学厚度等参数的分析，对理解火山爆发后大气环境的变化具有重要意义。,"['SO2', 'Sulfate Aerosols', 'Ash', 'Water Vapor', 'Aerosol Optical Depth', 'Satellite Observations', 'Aerosol Dynamics', 'Aerosol Aging', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Aerosol-Radiation Interaction']",Julia Bruckert;Simran Chopra;Richard Siddans;Charlotte Wedler;Gholam Ali Hoshyaripour,Aerosol dynamic processes in the Hunga plume in January 2022: does water vapor accelerate aerosol aging?,"The 2022 Hunga eruption emitted about 150 Tg of water vapor into the stratosphere. Here, we show that the water vapor injection not only accelerates SO2 oxidation and sulfate production but also increases the aging of ash (coating of ash by sulfate). Our study shows that aerosol aging alone does not explain the rapid loss of ash after the Hunga eruption as observed by satellite instruments. However, some ash might be masked in the observation due to the strong coating. 
 The 2022 Hunga eruption injected an unprecedented 150 Tg of water vapor into the stratosphere, accelerating SO2 oxidation and sulfate aerosol formation. Despite releasing less ash than previous eruptions of similar magnitude, the role of ash in the early plume and its rapid removal remain unclear. We performed experiments with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) to better understand the role of water vapor, SO2 and ash emissions, the aerosol–radiation interaction, and aerosol dynamical processes (nucleation, condensation, and coagulation) in the Hunga plume in the first week after the eruption. Furthermore, we compared our results with satellite observations to validate SO2 oxidation and aerosol dynamical processes. Our results show that about 1.2 Tg of SO2 emission, along with water vapor emission, is necessary to explain both the SO2 column loadings and sulfate aerosol optical depth during the first week after the eruption. Although the model reproduces the development of SO2 and sulfate aerosols well, the aerosol dynamics alone cannot explain the ash removal after the eruption, as was seen in satellite images. However, some of the ash might not be detected due to the exceptionally strong coating of the ash particles. Both the strong coating and a doubling of the sulfate effective radii within 1 week occur only when water vapor emission is included in the chemistry. Furthermore, the aerosol–radiation interaction warms the plume and reduces or, depending on the experiment, even reverses the descent of the water vapor plume that would otherwise occur due to radiative cooling."

Nussbaumer;Laura Stecher;Matthias Kohl;Samuel Ruhl;Holger Tost;Jos Lelieveld;Andrea Pozzer,Changes in global atmospheric oxidant chemistry from land cover conversion,"This work examines the impact of replacing forests with farmland and grazing areas on atmospheric composition. Using a global climate–chemistry model, we found that deforestation reduces biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), increases farming emissions, and shifts ozone chemistry. These changes result in a slight cooling effect on the climate. Restoring natural vegetation could reverse some of these effects. 
 Human activities have profoundly altered natural vegetation, primarily by converting pristine natural land to agriculture and grazing. Land cover change (LCC) influences the Earth system through modifications of surface albedo, roughness length, evapotranspiration, and atmospheric composition. This work investigates how LCC-driven changes in biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) fluxes, anthropogenic surface emissions, natural soil NO emissions, and O3 deposition fluxes affect atmospheric chemistry. The chemistry–climate model EMAC was used to compare: (1) present-day land cover, which includes areas deforested for crops and grazing, with the potential natural vegetation (PNV) cover simulated by the model, and (2) an extreme reforestation scenario where grazing land is restored to natural vegetation. Our results show that the expansion of agricultural land reduces global BVOC emissions, leading to larger annual average surface OH concentrations (+5.7 %) and lower CO mixing ratios (−6.2 %), despite increased CO from agricultural burning. Meanwhile, NOx mixing ratios increase (+7.8 %) due to enhanced anthropogenic and natural soil sources. While regional ozone responses vary, global ozone production sensitivity shifts from a NOx- to a VOC-sensitive regime. These changes influence radiative forcing with reductions in tropospheric O3 and CH4 lifetimes exerting a combined radiative effect of −60 mW m−2 (cooling), partially offsetting the warming from reduced BVOC-driven aerosol formation. Reforestation of grazing areas reverses these trends to some extent, though with a weaker response."

The algorithm improves upon the OMI O2–O2 operational cloud algorithm in several aspects. The new approach improves consistency in cloud parameters and NO2​ retrievals between two sensors. 
 We present a new cloud retrieval algorithm using the O2–O2 absorption band at 477 nm, designed to provide harmonized cloud datasets from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The goal of these derived cloud data is to mitigate the influence of clouds on the retrieval of tropospheric trace gases from UV–Visible nadir satellite spectrometers. The retrieval process consists of two main steps. First, spectral fitting is performed using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) method to determine the O2–O2 slant column and calculate the reflectance at the center of the fitting window. Second, these parameters are used to derive cloud fraction and cloud pressure.This retrieval algorithm builds on the OMI O2–O2 operational cloud algorithm (OMCLDO2) with several improvements. The fitting procedure uses a broader fitting window, incorporating the O2–O2 absorption bands at 446 and 477 nm, to more accurately derive O2–O2 slant column densities (SCDs). A de-striping correction is applied to address across-track variability, and an offset correction of −0.08 × 1043 molec.2 cm−5, motivated by radiative transfer simulations, is applied in the TROPOMI retrieval to improve the consistency with OMI. Additionally, a temperature correction factor is included to account for the temperature dependence of both the O2–O2 SCD and the O2–O2 absorption cross-section. Consistent auxiliary data, such as meteorological information and a surface albedo database, are used for both sensors. Due to the inadequate signal-to-noise ratios in the daily solar irradiance measurements by OMI, a fixed annual-averaged irradiance for 2005 is used as a reference for the reflectance spectra in the spectral fittings.To evaluate the performance of our retrieval approach, we compare it with the OMCLDO2 algorithm for both OMI and TROPOMI. The cloud fraction retrievals demonstrate good agreement, whereas the cloud pressure retrievals show a systematic bias, particularly in nearly cloud-free scenes. Our cloud pressure estimates tend to be higher than OMCLDO2 for OMI and lower for TROPOMI. Notably, our approach demonstrates improved consistency in cloud parameters, especially cloud pressure, between the two sensors compared to OMCLDO2. However, a consistent bias of approximately 0.05 in cloud fraction retrievals is observed, primarily attributed to differences in L1b data that show systematic biases between the OMI and TROPOMI reflectances. Applying these cloud corrections to NO2 retrievals reveals that the average impact of cloud corrections ranges from −6 % to 11 % in polluted regions. Differences in NO2 air mass factor (AMF) resulting from varying cloud correction methods can exceed 10 %. Importantly, the new correction approach achieves better consistency in NO2 retrievals between OMI and TROPOMI."

Meadows,A typology of global relief classes derived from digital elevation models at 1 arcsec resolution,"Surveys of global relief classes are important for understanding the morphology and land processes of Earth's surface. This study proposes a novel framework integrating the accumulated slope and a new surface relief index for global relief classification (GRC) with 1 arcsec resolution. This dataset can provide abundant and detailed land surface information for the field of Earth sciences. 
 Understanding land surface morphology and its relief components, which record the dynamics of the planet's evolution and interaction of multiple environmental factors, constitutes a critical aspect of Earth system science. Advances in Earth observation technologies have enabled access to higher-resolution data, e.g. remote sensing imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs). However, classified relief and landform data with a resolution of approximately 1 arcsec (approximately 30 m) are lacking at the global scale, which limits the progress of related studies at finer scales. Here, we propose a novel framework for global relief classification and release a unique dataset called global relief classification (GRC), which incorporates a comprehensive set of objects that constitute the range of terrains and landforms on Earth. Constructed from multiple 1 arcsec DEMs, GRC covers the global land and ranks among the highest-resolution global geomorphic datasets to date. Its development integrates land surface ontologies, with cores, transitions and boundaries, and key derivatives to strike a balance between mitigating local noise and preserving valuable landform details. GRC categorizes Earth's land relief into two levels, yielding raster files and discrete vector units that record relief type and distribution. Comparative analyses with previous datasets reveal that GRC better captures details of surface morphology, enabling a more precise depiction of geomorphological boundaries. This refinement facilitates the identification of finer and more precise spatial disparities in landform patterns than before, exemplified by marked contrasts between Asia and other continents, and highlights the distinct prominence of Peru and China in terms of relief diversity. Given that the data resolution of GRC accords well with accessible remote sensing imagery and other Earth science datasets, it is readily incorporated into analytical workflows, exploring the relationship between land morphology, surface runoff, climate, and land cover. The full dataset is available on the Deep-time Digital Earth Geomorphology platform and from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15641257, Yang et al., 2024)."

A univariate interpolation algorithm is applied to predict missing data points without relying on ancillary variables. The dataset includes gap-free uncertainty estimates for all predictions and was validated with independent in situ reference measurements. Our data record is recommended for applications which require global long-term gap-free satellite soil moisture data. 
 The ESA CCI Soil Moisture multi-satellite climate data record is a widely used dataset for large-scale hydrological and climatological applications and studies. However, data gaps in the record can affect derived statistics such as long-term trends and – if not taken into account – can potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions. Here, we present a novel gap-free dataset, covering the period from January 1991 to December 2023. Our dataset distinguishes itself from other gap-filled products, as it is purely based on the available soil moisture (SM) measurements (independent of ancillary variables to make predictions), and further due to the inclusion of uncertainty estimates for all interpolated data points.Our gap-filling framework is based on a well-established univariate discrete cosine transform with the penalized least-squares (DCT-PLS) algorithm. This ensures that the dataset remains fully independent of other soil moisture and biogeophysical datasets and eliminates the risk of introducing non-soil-moisture features from other variables. We apply DCT-PLS on a spatial moving window basis to predict missing data points based on temporal and regional neighbourhood information. The challenge of providing gap-free estimates during extended periods of frozen soils is addressed by applying a linear interpolation for these periods, which approximates the retention of frozen water in the soil. To quantify the inherent uncertainties in our predictions, we developed an uncertainty estimation model that considers the input observations quality and the performance of the gap-filling algorithm under different surface conditions. We evaluate our algorithm through performance metrics with independent in situ reference measurements and by its ability to restore GLDAS Noah reanalysis data in artificially introduced satellite-like gaps. We find that the gap-filled data perform comparably to the original observations in terms of correlation and unbiased root mean squared difference (ubRMSD) with in situ data (global median R=0.72, ubRMSD = 0.05 m3 m−3). However, in some complex environments with sparse observation coverage, performance is lower.The new ESA CCI SM v09.1 GAPFILLED dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.48436/hcm6n-t4m35 (Preimesberger et al., 2024) and will see yearly updates due to its inclusion in the operational ESA CCI SM production."

The dataset is considered unique with respect to a range of applications, including compensating for spatiotemporal gaps of sediment-trap measurements, assessments of model simulations, shedding light on physical processes related to the dust cycle, and improving the understanding of dust biogeochemical impacts on oceanic ecosystems, weather, and climate. 
 Quantification of atmospheric dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean is provided. The estimates rely on the four-dimensional structure of atmospheric dust provided by the ESA-LIVAS climate data record established on the basis of CALIPSO-CALIOP observations. The data record of the atmospheric dust deposition rate is provided for the Atlantic Ocean region, between latitudes 60° S and 40° N, and is characterized by 5° (zonal) × 2° (meridional) spatial resolution and seasonal-mean temporal resolution for the period December 2006–November 2022. The estimates of dust deposition are evaluated on the basis of sediment-trap measurements of deposited lithogenic material. The evaluation intercomparison shows a good agreement between the two datasets, revealing the capacity of the satellite-based product to quantitatively provide the amount of dust deposited into the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by a correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a mean bias of 5.42 mg m−2 d−1. Integration of the satellite-based dust deposition rate dataset into AeroVal allowed assessment comparison of the dust deposition product against dust deposition field estimates provided by the MONARCH, EMEP MSC-W, and EC-Earth3-Iron models. The comparison revealed the capacity of the satellite-based product to follow the seasonal activation of dust source regions and the four-dimensional migration of dust transport pathways. Overall, the annual-mean amount of dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean is estimated at 274.79 ± 31.64 Tg yr−1, of which 243.98 ± 23.89 Tg yr−1 of dust is deposited into the North Atlantic Ocean and 30.81 ± 10.49 Tg yr−1 of dust is deposited into the South Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, a negative statistically significant trend in atmospheric dust deposition over the Atlantic Ocean is revealed. The satellite-based dust deposition product is considered unique with respect to a wide range of potential applications, including compensating for geographical and temporal gaps of sediment-trap measurements, supporting evaluation assessments of model simulations, unraveling physical processes related to the atmospheric cycle of dust, and providing a deeper understanding of dust biogeochemical impacts on oceanic ecosystems, weather, and eventually climate.

While most studies have focused on the effects of individual MP types, MPs in natural environments typically coexist as multiple types, and their combined effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a microcosm experiment with four levels of MP diversity (0, 1, 3, and 5 types) to investigate the effects of MP diversity on soil ecosystem functions using metagenomic sequencing. Our results revealed that increasing MP diversity significantly raised soil pH and organic carbon content while reducing available nitrogen. Notably, bacterial alpha diversity (Shannon and Invsimpson indices) increased significantly with higher MP diversity. Moreover, increasing MP diversity markedly shifted bacterial life-history strategies to adapt to the altered environment. Importantly, the abundance of nitrogen-related functional genes also increased with MP diversity. In particular, the abundance of denitrifying genes, predominantly driven by Rhodocyclaceae, was notably enhanced, resulting in a reduction of soil available nitrogen. Collectively, these findings offer valuable insights into the impact of MP diversity on soil function─especially within the nitrogen cycle─and have important implications for soil management strategies under MP stress."

Herein, we propose a highly effective ARB disinfection approach via activating an ultralow concentration (10 μM) of chlorite (ClO2–) by naturally abundant sunlight to generate various reactive species (i.e., HO•, Cl•, ClO•, and ClO2) with negligible generation of halogenated DBPs. Combining in situ characterization with theoretical calculations, we reveal that, in addition to the photolysis of ClO2– in the bulk solution, ClO2– ions electrostatically adsorbed on the positive local sites of lipids can boost light absorption and facilitate the in situ generation of reactive species upon sunlight irradiation, enabling more efficient attacks toward cell membranes and the intracellular antioxidant enzyme system. The intracellular antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are then released and further degraded, inhibiting horizontal ARG transfer. This approach can also achieve excellent ARB disinfection performance in real water matrices (e.g., lake and river water) in 1 L tanks and 500 mL plastic bottles with natural sunlight irradiation. Overall, this work presents an efficient, safe, and sustainable method to inactivate ARB with deep insights into disinfection mechanisms at the subcellular level."

Therefore, this study investigated the visual–neuro influence of 3cH2B (a frequently detected LCM) under environmentally relevant concentrations in zebrafish. The findings revealed that 40 μg/L 3cH2B induced visual behaviors after 40 days of exposure, which was accompanied by decreased retinoic acid (RA) levels and retinal structural deformation in the eyes. Simultaneously, a decline in the number of synaptic vesicles and loss of neurons were observed in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, downregulation of RA metabolism pathways was identified in inhibitory neurons of the CNS.  Spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that 3cH2B exposure reduced both the proportion of inhibitory neurons and the expression of RA-related genes in the optic tectum of the midbrain.  Furthermore, RA supplementation significantly alleviated the behavioral alterations and retinal damage induced by 3cH2B, highlighting the critical role of RA in regulating these effects."

It was found that TC wind and SWH radii become asymmetric as sea states intensify. Notably, wind radii correlations (CORs) increase on the left‐right and left‐back quadrants for wind speeds larger than 20 m/s, while SWH radii exhibit the opposite trend. XGBoost is employed to obtain the improved relationship between wind fetch and SWH (COR < 0.17). Validation against buoys and Haiyang‐2 (HY‐2) observations of 20 TCs indicates that the root mean squared error in SWH predictions is reduced by up to 1.1 m using XGBoost instead of empirical model.

Westward geostrophic advection, driven by the meridional density gradient, tends to shift the subsurface nutrients and Chl‐a anomalies toward the left side of the generally northwestward TC track. The total biomass in the upper ocean, as indicated by integrated Chl‐a, decreases shortly after the TC passage and subsequently starts to rise, ultimately resulting in a net increase."

Traditional methods often lack the spatial and temporal resolution to track groundwater variations. This study calculates instantaneous travel‐time shifts, dt(t) $dt(t)$, from ambient noise cross‐correlation functions in central Oklahoma and projects them onto 2‐D near‐surface seismic velocity maps (dv/v) $(dv/v)$ by using sensitivity kernels of coda‐wave interferometry. The lateral variations in these dv/v $dv/v$ maps align with major bedrock aquifers in Oklahoma, revealing correlations between near‐surface seismic velocity, surface deformation, and gravity field, highlighting the role of water storage across time and space. The maps suggest that near‐surface seismic velocity responds are sensitive to groundwater dynamics, including discharge, recharge, and lateral flow. The confined and unconfined aquifers in Oklahoma, with diverse depth ranges and adaptive capacities, are characterized by distinct spatiotemporal patterns in our dv/v $dv/v$ maps.

Nevertheless, the uncertainties of temperature and humidity profiles in the boundary layer from the sounders are relatively large due to the difficulty on distinguishing surface contributions from radiances measured by low‐peaking channels, which limits the quantitative applications. Since the dense ground stations provide rich 2‐m temperature and moisture observations near continuously, although those observations do not contain vertical profile information directly, integration together with sounder measurements can improve the boundary layer profiling. Using Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard Fengyun‐4B (FY‐4B) as a precursor geostationary sounder through theoretical analysis, simulation, and real data experiments using the optimal estimation method, it is found that integration of ground station observations and satellite sounder measurements can substantially reduce errors by 0.3 K and 2% (absolute) for temperature and humidity, respectively, in the boundary layer, highlighting the value of integrating geostationary hyperspectral IR measurements with ground station observations for quantitative applications such as nowcasting the high impact weather events in near real time."

Heatwaves can be classified as daytime, nighttime, and compound, depending on their occurrence time. However, the factors shaping global spatiotemporal patterns of heatwaves remain poorly understood, especially regarding links to large‐scale climate mode and local water‐energy (LWE) exchange. Here, we analyzed the frequency and intensity of these three heatwave types from 1980 to 2022 using ERA5L air temperature data and examined their associations with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and LWE‐related factors through the LSTM model. Our results show a significant global increase in all types of heatwaves. Compound heatwaves exhibited higher annual frequency and intensity than individual daytime or nighttime events. The three types of heatwaves displayed distinct associations with El Niño and La Niña episodes, with the tropics experiencing the most frequent and intense heatwaves during El Niño years. Meanwhile, terrestrial LWE exchange significantly influenced heatwave development, with stronger effects in dryland and temperate zones than in continental and polar regions. These findings highlight the importance of ENSO and LWE exchanges in shaping heatwave patterns and suggest that future forecasts should consider the temporal evolution and fluctuations in heat accumulation to improve accuracy and reliability."

By applying common Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to three global reanalysis data sets, combined with Common Basis Function (CBF) approach for the GCMs, a unified framework for evaluating performance is established. Two distinct leading modes of monthly summer heatwave variability over NA–dipole and tripole patterns–are identified using the common EOF. The GCMs reproduce these modes, showing agreement in the centers of positive and negative anomalies with the reanalysis data sets, particularly when evaluated using the CBF approach. The GCMs capture large‐scale North Pacific to North American wave train patterns associated with the two modes of heatwave variability over NA, showing a phase shift between them. They reproduce atmospheric moisture conditions, such as total column water vapor and precipitation; however, performance in capturing these anomalies is lower due to the complexities of moisture transport and convection. The GCMs also effectively reproduce regional‐scale surface radiation and turbulent heat flux anomalies related to heatwave variability. Ensemble means of the GCMs generally outperform individual models, highlighting the advantages of multi‐model ensembles in reducing uncertainty and improving overall accuracy. Higher‐resolution models outperform lower‐resolution counterparts in capturing the intricate details of heatwave variability and associated processes, underscoring the importance of resolution in achieving accurate simulations of these extremes."

The results show that the northern European snow anomalies significantly correlate with the second dominant pattern of summer N‐Asia drought conditions during 1955–2017. In addition, the snow anomalies occur in preceding winter and strengthen in spring, providing a possible predictor for N‐Asia summer drought conditions. The physical processes linking spring snow anomalies over northern Europe to summer N‐Asia drought conditions are as follows. Increased spring snow anomalies enhance the surface albedo and increase overall amount of snowmelt in early summer, which cool the local 2‐m temperature and increase the soil moisture in early summer. The increased soil moisture persists from early summer to late summer through positive soil‐precipitation feedback, consequently weakening summer surface sensible heat flux and decreasing air temperature over northern Europe. Then the decreased temperature strengthens the meridional air temperature gradients around 60°N, and further induces a cyclone anomaly over northern Europe by modulating the diabatic cooling and synoptic transient eddy activities, further triggering an eastward‐propagating Rossby wave train throughout Eurasia. This wave train results in a western Siberian anticyclone anomaly and an eastern Siberian cyclone anomaly. By adjusting the conditions of water vapor, dynamics, heat and radiation fluxes, the precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration conditions over N‐Asia are changed. Therefore, the pronounced atmospheric circulation pattern leads to less/more precipitation and more/less PET over western/eastern Siberia, favoring development of a zonal dipole pattern of N‐Asia drought conditions."

However, the impacts of assimilating its observations on tropical cyclones (TCs) remain unclear. This study investigates these effects of assimilating XPAR radial wind velocity observations, both alone and in combination with S‐band Doppler radar radial winds, for TC Saola (2023). Compared with experiments assimilating only S‐band Doppler radar data, assimilating data from a single XPAR significantly reduces TC intensity errors by up to 6.4 m/s and improves structural representation in the inner‐core region, as well as demonstrates optimal enhancement in forecast skill for 9‐hr accumulated rainfall exceeding 100 mm threshold. Furthermore, higher‐frequency XPAR data assimilation yields additional improvements in intensity and inner‐core structure forecasting skills, albeit with increased computational demands. Joint assimilation of S‐band Doppler radar and XPAR data demonstrates superior performance over solely assimilating XPAR observations, achieving maximum intensity error reduction of 8.0 m/s, more realistic structural representation of both inner‐core features and outer rainbands, and optimal improvement for 50–100 mm rainfall forecasts.

Since 1994, scientists have recorded weather observations from stations installed on the glaciers. These records help understand how the local climate is changing and implications for glacier melt. The weather station network covers many parts of the glaciers, especially on Vatnajökull, Iceland's largest ice cap. It captures conditions in the accumulation areas where ice builds up, to the ablation areas where ice melts. For other glaciers, the data give a broader look at regional climate patterns. The results show that winters were coldest from December to February, and summers were warmest in July and August. Winter temperatures ranged from around 0°C near the coast to −10°C at higher elevations. Summer temperatures were above freezing at nearly all sites, which allows melting to occur. One sign of increased melting was a rise in “Positive Degree Days,” days warm enough to melt ice. These were more common at lower elevations and near the coast. Another sign was that glacier surfaces were getting darker in spring, especially in places with thinner winter snow. Darker surfaces absorb more sunlight, leading to faster melting. Volcanic ash and airborne dust have also darkened glacier surfaces in some years. By keeping track of these changes, this study helps to understand how Iceland's glaciers are responding to a warming climate—and why continued long‐term observations are essential."

This study investigates the sources of Ts biases in CoLMv2024 and Noah‐MP land surface model (LSM) using identical forcing data over China by decomposing the surface energy balance equation using ERA5‐Land reanalysis (ERA5L), MODIS, and ground‐based reference data sets. Both LSMs show significant seasonal and regional Ts biases, characterized by summer warm biases and pronounced winter cold biases. Uncertainty in energy fluxes across reference data sets limits single‐dataset evaluations. Energy fluxes in both LSMs are generally within uncertainty ranges of reference data, except that Noah‐MP consistently underestimates winter net radiation and sensible heat flux. Compared with ERA5L, the largest Ts bias across regions is caused by radiation forcing, that is, downward solar radiation or longwave radiation (DLW), except that the largest winter cold bias is caused by upward solar radiation (USW) in Noah‐MP in Northern China. Compared with MODIS, DLW probably contributes most to Ts biases for Noah‐MP in autumn and for CoLMv2024 in autumn and winter, except that USW contributes most to the winter cold bias in Noah‐MP. In March and April, the largest contributing term is ground heat flux in both LSMs. Despite large discrepancies in simulated snow properties, Ts simulations in two LSMs over the snow‐covered regions are similar and underestimated during the cold season.

While previous studies focused on dynamics of the potential northern limit of maize (PNLine), the movement of the actual northern limit of maize (ANLine) and its agricultural impacts remain underexplored. To bridge the gap, this study first developed a method to detect the ANLine using satellite‐derived crop data and kernel density estimation. To assess the driving factors behind the expansion of maize acreage, an empirical analysis was conducted in the maize‐soybean key competitive region (KCR). Finally, we calculated the climate‐warming driven maize acreage expansion over the past two decades and projected its changes for the next decade. Results showed that the PNLine and ANLine moved northwards by an average of 101.67 and 75.4 km from 2000 to 2020. The two lines showed a strong correlation (r = 0.78, p < 0.05). The increasing accumulated temperature was the key driver behind these movements. A 10°C·d increase in AAT10 is associated with a 3.12% increase in maize acreage in the KCR. From 2001 to 2020, ∼49.5% (2.83 × 106 ha) of the maize acreage expansion could be attributable to climate warming.

 The GPR-based soil moisture detection method achieves an effective balance between spatial scale coverage and detection accuracy; however, the automation level and efficiency still need improvement. This study adopts refined gradient modeling, optimizing delay, envelope amplitude area, and centroid frequency as key indicators for soil moisture prediction. Random forest feature importance analysis indicates that the selected three indicators can effectively characterize soil moisture variation at different scales. Single-factor and three-factor soil moisture prediction models were constructed, and comparisons reveal that the three-factor model significantly outperforms the single-factor model in both prediction accuracy and stability. Bayesian regression was used to assess model and data uncertainty, and the results indicate that the model exhibits low uncertainty within the existing three-factor knowledge range. To achieve automated soil moisture detection, this study proposes an error recursive optimization framework, overcoming the bottlenecks in GPR-based soil moisture automation, and significantly improving detection accuracy and efficiency."

 This study investigated regional contrasts in the vertical structure and radiative characteristics of clouds between two mid-latitude continental regions—Oklahoma in the central United States and the Korean Peninsula in East Asia—using 12 years of satellite observations (2006–2017) from CloudSat and CALIPSO. Despite being located within a similar latitudinal band, the two regions exhibited contrasting cloud regimes due to variations in meteorological conditions, boundary-layer structure, and convective forcing. Satellite observation analyses showed that vertical development of clouds was generally deeper and more vertically continuous over Oklahoma, while clouds over Korea were typically shallower and more seasonally variable, especially confined to lower altitudes during winter. The analysis of radiative heating indicates that relatively stronger shortwave heating and longwave cooling frequently occur in the upper troposphere over Oklahoma, consistent with deep convective systems. In contrast, Korea exhibited heating rates that were dominant below the mid troposphere, associated with relatively weak vertical development of clouds. Thermodynamic analysis using equivalent potential temperature and relative humidity profiles showed that the atmospheric conditions over Korea were relatively more stable and humid, and exhibited greater seasonal variability compared to those over Oklahoma. Our findings showed that cloud radiative characteristics between Oklahoma and Korea regions were notably different based on long-term satellite observations. This study can contribute to providing a conceptual reference for conducting observational analysis of mid-latitudinal climate regions."

This study reports the activities of 32P and 33P in individual precipitation events for the first time on the coast of the East China Sea, Shanghai, China (31°1′35.5″N, 121°26′49.3″E) from March 2021 to April 2023. The average specific activity of 32P and 33P was 1.56 ± 0.14 dpm L−1 and 1.55 ± 0.17 dpm L−1, respectively, and exhibited to decrease with increasing rainfall (n = 83). The 33P/32P activity ratios ranged from 0.70 to 1.22 (average, 0.96 ± 0.13), showing significant seasonal variations with high in spring/winter and low in summer/autumn. The higher 33P/32P activity ratios (>1.0) in typhoons and thunderstorms precipitation, suggested the intrusion of stratospheric air masses associated with those extreme weather events. The average irradiation period of tropospheric air masses and aerosols residence time was estimated to be 47 ± 32 d and 72 ± 119 d based on the 32P and 33P mass balance model, respectively. The wet deposition fluxes of 32P and 33P ranged from 0.94 to 84.46 dpm m−2 d−1 and 0.84 to 91.03 dpm m−2 d−1, respectively, and higher deposition fluxes were found in spring and summer. The relationship between individual rainfall event wet deposition fluxes and rainfall throughout 2021 to 2023 appears to follow a power law, though it showed high correlation in spring/winter. Moreover, a significant correlation with precipitation intensity indicated that precipitation intensity played a more dominant influence on the scavenging of 32P and 33P."

 Several studies have assessed the relationship between exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ≤10 μm (PM10) and assisted reproduction technology (ART) success rates, with controversial findings. This review aimed to consolidate the current evidence from fresh ART cycles and explore sources of heterogeneity across studies. The outcomes of interest were biochemical and clinical pregnancy, and live birth. Four exposure timeframes were considered: T0 (within 90 days before starting the stimulation protocol), T1 (from the first day of stimulation protocol to oocyte retrieval), T2 (from oocyte retrieval to embryo transfer), and T3 (from embryo transfer to pregnancy).Database searches were conducted on PubMed/Medline and Embase up to April 2025, using a combination of MeSH/Emtree and generic terms relating to ART patients and air pollution exposure. Fourteen studies, involving 333,438 cycles, were included in the meta-analysis. The studies were conducted between 2010 and 2024 primarily in China (10/14), while 3 were from the USA and one from Korea. We estimated pooled relative risks (RRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 for biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, and live births, using random-effects meta-analytic models.The pooled RRs for 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 and PM10 at T0 were respectively 0.97 (95%CI: 0.91–1.04) and 0.98 (95%CI: 0.95–1.02) for biochemical pregnancy; for clinical pregnancy they were respectively 0.98 (95%CI: 0.96–1.01) and 0.99 (95%CI: 0.98–1.00). All other findings were close to unity. Substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies for selected outcomes and exposure periods for both pollutants.This systematic review found no significant association between PM2.5 and PM10 exposure and ART outcomes after fresh embryo transfer for any of the four exposure windows."

 Winter precipitation events, involving complex transitions between rain and snow, pose a significant forecasting challenge and often lead to severe weather hazards. The difficulty in predicting precipitation type stems from an incomplete understanding of the microphysical processes that govern these transitions under diverse atmospheric conditions. This study investigates two rain-to-snow transition events in western Liaoning, China. Both cases shared a common evolution from rain to snow, with the melting of ice-phase particles aloft serving as the initial source for raindrops. However, they occurred under contrasting near-surface thermodynamic and moisture conditions—one with a sub-freezing, dry sub-cloud layer (Case 1) and the other with a near-0 °C, moist layer (Case 2), leading to distinct transition processes. Ground-based disdrometer observations revealed distinct surface precipitation characteristics driving rain-to-snow transitions. In Case 1, a bimodal velocity-diameter (V–D) distribution indicated the coexistence of rain and snow. In contrast, Case 2 was characterized by a unimodal V–D distribution of dense, rimed particles. High-resolution WRF simulations using the Thompson microphysics scheme successfully reproduced these transitions. The simulations accurately captured the particle size distributions (PSDs) of rain and graupel. A comparative analysis identified distinct microphysical processes as the primary difference between the two cases, governed by the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. In Case 1, melting initiated at higher altitudes, followed by in-cloud riming. In the subsequent descent through the sub-cloud dry layer, strong evaporation and sublimation cooled the environment and removed liquid water, causing a rapid transition to snow. In Case 2, a deeper warm layer resulted in lower-altitude melting, while high near-surface moisture fueled dominant riming processes within the near-surface layer, prolonging the mixed-phase period with dense hydrometeors. Conceptual models illustrate how near-surface temperature and relative humidity jointly regulate the key microphysical processes such as melting, riming, evaporation, and sublimation."

Here, we report highly efficient ET in a 2D hybrid organic-inorganic heterostructure (HOIST) of Me-PTCDI/WS2. Resonant ET is observed leading to enhanced WS2photoluminescence (PL) by 124 times. We identify Dexter exchange between the Frenkel state in donor and an excited 2sstate in acceptor as the main ET mechanism, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrate ET-enhanced phototransistor devices with enhanced responsivity by nearly 1000 times without sacrificing the response time.

We find that putative long-range projections are more strongly affected by stimulation than other cells. Specifically, they are both more entrained on average and account for occurrences of extremely strong entrainment.

This weakening of correlations persists for hundreds of picoseconds and exhibits a recovery time independent of photodoping density across two orders of magnitude.

Hydrogen was retained in fractures sealed by mud and carbonate. However, hydrogen alone cannot produce the explosive capacity responsible for the formation of pipes.

Furthermore, we leverage the dipole selection rule associated with the wurtzite crystal structure of the nanosheets for side mode suppression, achieving single-mode lasing at room temperature with lasing threshold as low as 14 μJ cm−2pulse−1. Optimal light-cavity coupling is evidenced by spontaneous emission factors as high as 0.8, showcasing the potential of bottom-up BIC lasers in realizing near-thresholdless lasing at room temperature."
