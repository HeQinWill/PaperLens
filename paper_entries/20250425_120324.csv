10.1088/1748-9326/adc8bc,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注环境灾害期间的非疏散现象，探讨了社区“原地不动”的原因以及政府对此的看法。研究通过比较印度尼西亚、美国和日本的案例，分析了不同文化和政治背景下非疏散行为的社会因素。研究重点在于社区和政府对灾害时间认知的差异，以及社会过程如何影响这些认知，从而影响疏散决策。该论文属于环境社会科学领域，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Evan A Singer;Andrés Triana Solórzano;Shoko Yamada;Michael R Dove,Staying put: a comparative study of non-evacuation during environmental disasters,"Effective evacuations mitigate the harm of environmental disasters. Yet, many people who are able to evacuate remain in place during environmental disasters. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events that require evacuation, such as flooding and wildfires, warrant closer study of why some communities do not evacuate. This study seeks to explore the social phenomenon of non-evacuation through two central questions: Why do some communities ‘stay put’ during environmental disasters? And, how do governments view the non-evacuation of these communities? Investigating these two questions together allows for the consideration of differences in how local communities and governments understand evacuation. Better understanding this contrast benefits the development of effective environmental disaster policy which relies on coordination between local communities and governments. We answer these research questions by comparing cases in Indonesia, the United States, and Japan. These cases provide examples of non-evacuation during three types of environmental disasters in distinct geographic, cultural, political contexts. This study analyzes multiple forms of qualitative data including academic publications, popular media, policy documents, interviews, and fieldnotes taken during participant observation. This study presents two key findings. First, local communities and governments often differently perceive how environmental disasters unfold over time. Second, social processes influence these contrasting orientations toward time, by focusing attention—or not—on particular events and attributing meaning to these events according to one’s social role. Differing orientations toward time help to explain contrasting expectations about evacuation. This paper contributes to environmental social science scholarship on disasters, vulnerability, local knowledge systems, and temporality."

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), consisting of actual photosynthetic activity, is closely related to gross primary productivity. However, it is unclear whether paddy rice yield can be effectively estimated by SIF. Here, we used a mechanistic light reaction (MLR) model and SIF data coupled with rice phenology and climate information to estimate net primary productivity (NPP). Subsequently, we used a harvest index (HI) based on absorbed photosynthetically active radiation data in combination with NPP to estimate paddy rice yield in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from 2001 to 2019. The results showed that the MLR model coupled with SIF was excellent in estimating crop yield, showing a high correlation between simulated and actual yield (R2 = 0.71 on average, P < 0.01). NPP rather than HI was the predominant factor influencing paddy rice yield. Photosynthetically active radiation presents a more pronounced effect on paddy rice yield (early and single rice) than that of air temperature and precipitation. These findings emphasize the crucial role of SIF in estimating large-scale crop yields."

Because extreme temperatures often pose threats to the elderly, members of the disability community, and other vulnerable populations, this study seeks to understand the level of influence that extreme temperatures may have on transit users across different demographic groups. In this case study for Atlanta, GA, heat stress is predicted for 2019 transit riders (using transit rider activity survey data) and for three future climate scenarios, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, into the year 2100. The ThermoRoute Analyzer and TransitSim 4.0 models were applied to predict cumulative heat exposure and trip-level risk for 35 999 trip equivalents for an average Atlanta area weekday in the summer of 2019. The analyses show that under 2019 weather conditions, 8.33% of summer trips were estimated to be conducted under extreme heat. With the projected future climate conditions, the percentage of trips under extreme heat risk grows steadily. By 2100, 37.1%, 56.1%, and 76.4% are projected to be under extreme heat risk for low, medium, and high future climate projections (scenarios SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585), respectively. Under current weather conditions, Atlanta transit riders that own no vehicles and transit riders that are African American are disproportionately influenced by extreme heat. The disparity between these two groups and other groups of transit riders becomes wider as climate change continues to exacerbate. The findings of the study highlight an urgent need to implement heat mitigation and adaptation strategies in urban transit networks."

However, most modelled pathways assume continued economic growth throughout the century, even for high-income nations. This has sparked calls for modellers to expand their visions of sustainable futures. One suggested approach is post-growth, which shifts the focus of the economy from economic growth to ecological stability, equality, human well-being and enhanced democracy. In this review, we examine current post-growth scenario modelling approaches, spanning national to global scales and single-sector to whole-economy approaches, to identify best practices and key gaps in representing a post-growth transition. We develop a framework for evaluating these scenarios along five key dimensions of post-growth theorisation: feasible technological change, scale-down of harmful production, good life for all, wealth redistribution, and international justice. We then explore current approaches to post-growth scenario modelling, focusing on the types of models used, the mechanisms employed to simulate post-growth scenarios and the representation of post-growth policies. Finally, drawing on the wider post-growth literature, we offer recommendations for improving post-growth model representation, focusing on five main areas: the energy-economy connection, spatial differentiation, sectoral differentiation, the inclusion of different provisioning systems and feasibility considerations."

However, most metrics struggle to accurately represent temperature change across different time scales, especially in response to short-lived GHGs such as methane (CH4). GWP* has been developed as a more accurate climate metric, but it has implementation challenges, such as its misuse to create the false impression of climate neutrality. We propose a new metric, Sum44, the 44 year lagged cumulative sum of methane, that can accurately predict temperature change without the implementation challenges identified for GWP*. Here, we compare the performance of Sum44 and GWP* in projecting temperature change under various emissions scenarios. We perform these comparisons using strictly CH4 emissions scenarios, although other GHGs could be included in the future. We show that for the wide range of scenarios considered here, Sum44 is comparable to GWP* as a temperature indicator, and frequently outperforms it. Given this, we suggest that there are substantial implementation advantages to using Sum44 when considering policy controls to meet near-term climate change targets."

These processes can generate ongoing lulls and fluxes of secondary microplastics, prolonging threats to ecosystems and human health for millennia. In this perspective, we explore how understanding the way todays rivers move and deposit sediment—based on fluvial geomorphological knowledge—can help explain where and how plastic debris breaks down into microplastics, and how this insight can be used to better manage and reduce long-term plastic pollution in rivers."

While previous studies address urban warming at specific time points, the dynamic relationship between land cover and land use (LCLU) changes and land surface temperature (LST) along urban-rural continuums remains understudied. This study examines LST, LCLU, and NDVI changes across 19 SEA cities of varying urbanization levels from 2000 to 2022 using Landsat images. Results show that LST change rates differ by urbanization levels, with built-up lands driving urban warming. Larger cities exhibited more intense and widespread LST increases extending into rural areas. The megacities experienced significant LST growth within 5 km of city centers despite limited built-up expansion. However, some areas in many cities experience decreasing trends of heat. NDVI significantly influenced LST changes through its cooling effect and the warming impact due to vegetation loss caused by urban expansion. Findings support urban planning strategies that balance growth with enhancing green spaces, redirecting growth to smaller cities, and shifting development from city centers to urban outskirts."

Projections of vulnerability drivers, such as income distribution, are needed for assessing future climate risk. In Europe, existing studies typically rely on inadequate proxies, such as gross domestic product per capita, to account for future vulnerability associated with income levels. This study presents a novel top–down iterative methodology to produce decadal, high-resolution (1 km) maps of disposable income across Europe for the 21st century consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). More specifically, our method aligns with SSP narratives on future economic growth, income distribution, population dynamics and settlement expansion. We illustrate two possible applications of these projections by analysing future shifts in income distribution and estimating the evolution of the number of people at risk of poverty across different development pathways. In highly unequal pathways (SSP3 and SSP4), poverty levels across Europe are projected to increase significantly, with over 30% of the population at risk of poverty by 2100. On the other hand, pathways with high economic growth, specifically SSP1 and SSP5, result in a decrease in poverty rates. This dataset can serve as a resource for examining future vulnerabilities to climate change and socioeconomic inequalities, providing valuable insights for more effective climate risk assessments and targeted adaptation strategies."

Over vast regions, the ensemble is skillful in predicting the observed probability of extreme hot seasons within the upcoming five years. For extreme dry summer seasons significant positive skill is limited to the Sahel region. Overall the results suggest that the proposed approach can be used to extract useful information on the probability of extreme seasons over a five year period from current decadal predictions.

Results showed traffic's impact on nitrogen dioxide levels and atmospheric dynamics on particulate matter. The research confirmed MARS-corrected sensors as cost-effective for monitoring, despite challenges like sensor ageing and data quality control. 
 As part of the TURBAN project, the “Legerova campaign” investigated air quality and meteorology in a traffic-dense area of Prague, Czech Republic, from 30 May 2022 to 28 March 2023. The study deployed a network of 20 low-cost sensor (LCS) stations to measure NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, complemented by advanced meteorological instruments such as a microwave radiometer and Doppler lidar. Ensuring data quality from LCS measurements presented significant challenges. Initial field tests at a reference monitoring station revealed strong correlations between raw LCS and reference data (r > 0.90 for NO2 and PM2.5, r > 0.80 for O3 and PM10). However, individual biases were observed. Applying the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) method effectively reduced biases and enhanced alignment with reference measurements for all pollutants (R2 0.88–0.97). During the campaign, sensor ageing and technical issues were identified through double mass curve analysis and final field testing. The highest NO2 concentrations were recorded in streets with dense building blocks and traffic lights, corresponding to peak traffic patterns (with medians of concentrations 20–34 ppb). Aerosol concentrations were generally low (medians of PM10 < 25 µg m−3 at all sites), with less temporal and spatial variability than NO2. Elevated PM10 and PM2.5 levels occurred primarily during temperature inversions, often linked to local sources, and during a short, non-local episode. This study highlights the MARS method as a reliable tool for field calibration of LCS networks and provides valuable data on urban air quality and its dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution."

Ice crystals from rime splintering form the lowermost layer of ice crystals around the updraft core. The majority of ice crystals in the anvil of the convective cloud stems from frozen droplets. Ice stemming from homogeneous and deposition nucleation was only relevant in the overshoot. 
 For pure ice clouds in the cold-temperature regime (T<235 K), two major formation pathways are possible. Liquid origin ice clouds stem from droplets that freeze close to water saturation. In-situ-formed ice clouds form directly from the vapor phase below water saturation. For a better investigation of these pathways, we developed a novel microphysics scheme. The new two-moment scheme distinguishes between five ice classes (“ice modes”) each with their own unique formation mechanism: homogeneous freezing of solution droplets, deposition nucleation, homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets and raindrops, immersion freezing, and secondary ice from rime splintering. The ice modes interact with each other, e.g., in competition for growth by deposition of water vapor and aggregation, but also with the other cloud particle classes, i.e., cloud droplets, rain, snow, graupel, and hail.This scheme was employed to investigate the liquid origin vs. in situ formation in the fully glaciated parts of an idealized convective cloud. The majority of the cloud ice in the deep convection cloud consisted of frozen droplets (liquid origin). This was caused by the high number concentration of cloud droplets available for freezing. In-situ-formed ice was only relevant for the overshoot where ice from both formation pathways mixed.The new scheme is also useful for investigation of the ice formation in the mixed-phase parts of the convective cloud. We find a vertical layering of ice modes in the cloud. The lowermost layer consists of secondary ice from rime splintering and occurs near the updraft core at temperatures around the Hallett–Mossop zone. At altitudes between 6 and 9 km, ice mostly stems from immersion freezing. We find a correlation between the abundance of ice from immersion freezing and snow. The majority of ice crystals above 9 km stems from homogeneously frozen cloud droplets since ice-nucleating particles (INPs) required for immersion freezing were quickly depleted."

Emme;Hannah M. Horowitz,Impacts of sea ice leads on sea salt aerosols and atmospheric chemistry in the Arctic,"There is uncertainty in the sources of Arctic cold-season (November–April) sea salt aerosols. Using a chemical transport model and satellite observations, we quantify Arctic-wide sea salt aerosol emissions from fractures in sea ice, called open sea ice leads, and their atmospheric chemistry impacts for the cold season. We show that sea ice leads contribute to Arctic sea salt aerosols and bromine, especially in under-observed regions. 
 The processes contributing to Arctic cold-season (November–April) sea salt aerosols (SSAs) remain uncertain. Observations from coastal Alaska suggest that emissions from open leads in sea ice, which are not included in climate models, may play a dominant role. Their Arctic-wide significance has not yet been quantified. Here, we create an emission parameterization of SSAs from leads by combining satellite data of lead area (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observation System (AMSR-E) product) and a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to quantify pan-Arctic SSA emissions from leads during the cold season from 2002 to 2008 and to predict their impacts on atmospheric chemistry, evaluating the results of our simulated SSAs against in situ observations. The AMSR-E product detects large leads with certainty (> 3 km in size), and, hence, our study is limited to quantifying emissions from large leads. Lead emissions vary seasonally and interannually. Simulated total monthly SSA emissions increase by 1.1 %–1.8 % (≥60° N latitude) and 5.6 %–7.5 % (≥75° N) for the 2002–2008 cold seasons. SSA concentrations primarily increase at the location of leads, where standard model concentrations are low. GEOS-Chem overestimates SSA concentrations at Arctic sites compared to ground observations, even when lead emissions are not included, suggesting underestimation of SSA sinks and/or uncertainties in SSA emissions from blowing snow and the open ocean. Multi-year monthly mean surface bromine atom (Br) concentrations increase by 2.8 %–8.8 % due to SSAs from leads for the 2002–2008 cold seasons. Changes in ozone concentrations are negligible. While leads contribute < 10 % to Arctic-wide SSA emissions in the years 2002–2008, these emissions occur in regions of low background aerosol concentrations. Leads may increase in frequency under future climate change, which could increase SSA emissions from leads."

The results uncovered three factors that influence calibration performance: calibration period, concentration range and time averaging. We developed a comprehensive framework for the best sensor calibration practices, which serves as a valuable reference for calibrating various sensor types used in air quality monitoring. 
 The rapid expansion of low-cost sensor networks for air quality monitoring necessitates rigorous calibration to ensure data accuracy. Despite numerous published field calibration studies, a universal and comprehensive assessment of factors affecting sensor calibration remains elusive, leading to potential discrepancies in data quality across different networks. This study deployed eight sensor-based monitors in strategically chosen locations continuously for 2 years in Hong Kong, Macau and Shanghai. These locations covered a wide range of climatic conditions: Hong Kong's subtropical climate, Macau's similar yet distinct urban environment and  Shanghai's more variable climate. Each monitor employed a dynamic baseline tracking method for the gas sensors, which isolates the concentration signals from temperature and humidity effects, enhancing the sensors' accuracy and reliability. This strategic deployment ensured that the sensors' performance and calibration processes were tested across diverse atmospheric conditions. The tests, which involved evaluating the validation performance by analysing randomly selected calibration sample subsets ranging from 1–15 d, indicated that the length of the calibration period, pollutant concentration range and time-averaging period are pivotal for sensor calibration quality. We determined that a 5–7 d calibration period minimizes calibration coefficient errors, and a wider concentration range improves the validation R2 values for all sensors, suggesting the necessity of setting specific concentration range thresholds.  A time-averaging period of at least 5 min for data with 1 min resolution was recommended to enable optimal calibration in field operation.  This study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive calibration assessment and the importance of considering environmental variability in the sensor calibration condition. These findings offer methodological guidance for the calibration of other sensor types, providing a reference for future research in the field of sensor calibration."

Here we investigate how sounding continuity can improve across the full CLIMCAPS record (2002 to the present day), spanning multiple instruments and satellites. 
 The Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Combined Atmospheric Product System (CLIMCAPS) characterizes the atmospheric state as vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, CO2, CO, CH4, O3, HNO3 and N2O, together with a suite of Earth surface and cloud properties. The CLIMCAPS record spans more than 2 decades (2002–present) because it utilizes measurements from a series of hyperspectral infrared sounders on different satellite platforms. In this paper, we take a stepwise approach to diagnosing CLIMCAPS V2 with the goal of identifying which Bayesian retrieval components to improve for a future V3 release. CLIMCAPS is based on the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) heritage retrieval approach and is the first system to extend the Aqua record with sounders on next-generation platforms in the same orbit. With the baseline quality of CLIMCAPS V2 soundings well-established, the objective of a V3 upgrade is to improve retrieval consistency across the different instruments and platforms for the sake of a seamless global record of atmospheric soundings. We demonstrate how the retrieval averaging kernels (AKs) are key metrics in diagnosing a multi-instrument system such as CLIMCAPS, and we conclude with the recommendation to upgrade the channel subsets and radiative transfer model error spectrum used in defining the Bayesian measurement error covariance matrix."

As water is a main component of beer and the brewing process, we surmised that the polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) presence and spatial variability in drinking water systems are a PFAS source in beers. This is the first study to adapt EPA Method 533 to measure PFAS in beer from various regions, brewery types, and water sources. Statistical analyses were conducted to correlate PFAS in state-reported drinking water, and beers were analyzed by brewing location. PFAS were detected in most beers, particularly from smaller scale breweries located near drinking water sources with known PFAS. Perfluorosulfonic acids, particularly PFOS, were frequently detected, with PFOA or PFOS above U.S. EPA’s Maximum Contaminant Limits in some beers. There was also a county–level correlation between the total PFAS, PFOA, and PFBS concentrations in drinking water and beers. Given that approximately 18% of U.S. breweries are located within zip codes with detectable PFAS in municipal drinking water, our findings, which link PFAS in beer to the brewery water source, are intended to help inform data-driven policies on PFAS in beverages for governmental agencies, provide insights for brewers and water utilities on treatment needs, and support informed decision-making for consumers."

However, the risk of potential chemical leaching associated with physical enrichment items has been largely overlooked (i.e., artificial plants or shelter). Most enrichment items lack information on their chemical composition and have not undergone testing for plastic or metal leachates that can alter water chemistry and impair animal physiology. In fish and invertebrate research, these leachates have the potential to modify the health of aquatic animals or their reproductive processes. Moreover, in toxicology research, altered chemical exposure concentrations and interactive effects with leachates could invalidate toxicity assays and lead to misleading results. We identify key contaminants associated with common enrichment items and highlight the substantial lack of empirical research focusing on the confounding factors associated with aquatic enrichment. We explore the mechanisms through which relevant leachates can complicate experimental outcomes, detailing the pathways by which these substances may interact with both the experimental environment and the animals themselves. We conclude that there is widespread potential for serious complications to research outcomes and chronic toxicity from enrichment materials. Therefore, we advocate for the establishment of standardized regulations and a global certification system for aquatic enrichment items to ensure the validity of studies and to safeguard animal welfare.

Given the technological advancements in PU production processes, the production volume of PUs in China in 2022 was 11 times that of 2000.

In this study, we investigated the visual toxicity of triphenyl phosphate (TPHP, one traditional OPFR) and cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP, one emerging OPFR) on zebrafish larvae at environmentally relevant concentrations (3 and 30 nM). After 5 days of exposure, an opposite toxicity was found between the two OPFRs, manifested in the light perception and the gene expressions of visual opsins. CDP caused a weak reaction to light and overall inhibition of opsin expression (0.7- to 0.8-fold) in the larvae, while TPHP tended to stimulate these events (1.2- to 2.4-fold). Besides, we identified a key transcription factor, tbx2a, that was significantly disrupted in both OPFRs’ exposure.

However, recycling synthetic and blended (cotton and synthetic) textiles can contribute to the release of microplastic fibers (MPFs) into the environment. This study investigated MPF release across different stages of two chemical recycling approaches, acid and alkaline hydrolysis, of polyester/cotton-blended textiles. Recycling involves various stages, including dye removal, treatment stage, and product. In the treatment stage, acid hydrolysis breaks down cotton into cellulose, leaving the polyester (PET) intact, whereas alkaline hydrolysis degrades PET, allowing cotton recovery. Across all stages, dye removal generated the highest MPF count, averaging nearly 10,055 MPFs g–1 of textile waste. Statistical analysis confirmed that the recycling approach significantly affected MPF release (p < 0.05), whereas the fabric type did not (p > 0.05). Alkaline hydrolysis reduced MPF release during the treatment stage by 87.55% compared to acid hydrolysis, indicating that recovering cotton and chemically degrading PET can significantly minimize MPF emissions during recycling. Ridge regression analysis identified the reaction conditions as key factors in MPF fragmentation, with blend ratios influencing the number of released MPFs. Surface characterization revealed treatment-induced fiber alterations, raising concerns regarding MPF emissions throughout the process. These findings highlight the textile recycling industries can be a source of MPF release into the environment, but recovering PET through degradation or dissolution can help minimize this impact of the treatment stage."

Hoek,Role of Transmembrane Pressure and Water Flux in Reverse Osmosis Composite Membrane Compaction and Performance,"This study explores the compaction behavior of thin-film composite reverse osmosis (TFC RO) membranes for different combinations of transmembrane pressure (TMP) and transmembrane water flux. Operating a crossflow system at constant feed pressure (60 bar) but different feed solution osmotic pressures enabled adjusting the TMP─the difference between hydraulic and osmotic pressure─and water flux. The extent of membrane compaction increases as TMP (and flux) increases. Both commercial and hand-cast TFC RO membranes showed substantial compaction at high TMP (up to 30% compaction at 50 bar TMP) compared to less than 10% at 10 bar TMP. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal a direct relationship between TMP and polysulfone (PSU) support layer compaction, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed decreased porosity and reduced thickness in the polyamide (PA) active layer as TMP increases. Combined findings from wet-testing and MD simulations confirm a hydraulic pressure drop occurs across both the PA active layer and the meso-to-macro-porous support layer; higher TMP exacerbates compaction in both layers resulting in lower water permeability but higher water flux, observed salt rejection, and salt permeability. Transitioning from high TMP to low TMP or vice versa did not notably alter the extent of membrane compaction. This observation is attributed to the highly cross-linked PA active layer’s ability to recover after pressure is released, whereas the compaction in the PSU support layer is largely irreversible. While TMP dictates the overall pressure gradient, our findings suggest that flux-induced frictional forces play a crucial role in compaction dynamics. Specifically, higher flux generates additional drag forces on the polymer matrix of both the PSU support layer and the PA selective layer, intensifying structural deformation. Overall, our findings offer critical insights into the mechanisms of membrane compaction, providing a foundation for optimizing RO membrane performance and advancing next-generation membrane technologies."

However, the validity of the cubic relation (M0 ∝ T3) inferred for large (Mw ≥ 7) megathrust events has been recently questioned due to the scarcity of observations and similarities to slow earthquakes. Here, by compiling events over the past 500 years from global subduction zones, we double the number of earthquakes studied (>260) compared to previous studies. A possible scale change is observed, at moment‐magnitude and duration of ∼7.6 and ∼38.1 s, respectively. The new catalog reveals an accelerated decrease of the scaling exponent as a function of magnitude from 2.5 (Mw ≥ 7) to below 1 (Mw > 8.7), indicating increasingly longer durations than expected for larger events.

We found that lava flow dynamics transition from a volume‐limited regime to a cooling‐limited regime as the effusion duration increases. In the volume‐limited regime, flow length increases with erupted volume raised to the power of 0.67, while in the cooling‐limited regime, it increases with effusion rate raised to the power of 0.60. We also found that Mauna Loa's flows follow the volume‐limited regime, while Mt.

Flattening topography eliminates NH SSWs, while removing the ocean meridional overturning circulation reduces their frequency by half. The SSW response to boundary conditions is controlled by the hemispheric asymmetry of eddy heat flux. The reduction is driven by a decrease in amplitude of both eddy meridional wind and eddy temperature, as well as an increase in the cosine of the difference between their phases. The results suggest boundary conditions play an important role in shaping SSWs, especially topographic forcing, but that the boundary condition interactions are nonlinear."

Three convective organization metrics that are positively correlated with the area of MCS, that is, convective organization potential, the area fraction of precipitating MCS, and the precipitation fraction of MCS, are used to indicate the degree of convective organization. Our results show that the contrast in the LW ACRE inside and outside an MCS is consistent across different MCS precipitation intensities throughout the life cycle of an MCS, typically 90–100 W/m2, and provides important positive feedback to the circulation of the given MCS. However, the LW ACRE inside and outside an MCS as well as their difference are not strongly related to the degree of organization, suggesting that the LW cloud radiative feedback may be supportive of MCS formation and maintenance without necessarily being a dominant factor for spatial organization of MCSs. The domain average vertical velocity does tend to be related to the measures of convective organization, suggesting that factors that favor large‐scale low‐level convergence may exert a leading effect in creating an environment favorable for mesoscale organization of deep convection."

 Anti-viral immunity can vary tremendously from individual to individual but mechanistic understanding is still scarce. Here, we show that a defined, low complex bacterial community (OMM12) but not the general absence of microbes in germ-free mice leads to a more potent immune response compared to the microbiome of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice after a systemic viral infection with LCMV Clone-13. Consequently, gnotobiotic mice colonized with OMM12 have more severe LCMV-induced disease pathology but also enhance viral clearance in the intestinal tract.

This allows retrospective analysis and predictions, revealing that PM sources are distinct, dynamically changing over time, and often asynchronous with interventions. Additionally, we estimate source contributions to PM2.5 and its compounds, highlighting the increasing impact of biomass burning. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2100, PM levels may decline to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m³ in the Americas and 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m³ in Asia under climate mitigation scenarios but will still exceed WHO guidelines without further controls on natural emissions. Guiding future interventions with isotopic big data is essential for addressing air pollution challenges. A blockchain-based isotopic database compiling 34,815 isotopic fingerprints of global atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and its emissions from 1,890 pollution events is presented, enabling tracing of the ‘intervention−emissions−PM’ pathway."

 A photodetector’s sensitivity is conventionally quantified by specific detectivity, which balances responsivity and noise. However, we reveal that the turn-on threshold power is fundamentally governed by photo-carrier injection rather than detectivity. In conventional phototransistors/diodes, incident light cannot generate photocurrent via thermionic injection until its intensity saturates the surface potential. To overcome this limit, we design a photo-tunneling transistor with a partially dual-gated black phosphorus channel. This device breaks the injection barrier, achieving a temperature-independent subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec up to 250 K and reducing the threshold power by over an order of magnitude. At 80 K, it detects mid-wave infrared light with a minimum power of ~35 pW, outperforming conventional phototransistors with higher detectivity by ~30-fold. Our work redefines the sensitivity criteria for photodetectors and highlights the potential of steep-slope transistors in low-power optoelectronics, offering a pathway to ultrasensitive infrared sensing and imaging technologies.

 Social norms effectively reduce household energy use, yet research often focuses on moderate climates. Extreme heat could hinder energy-saving behaviors, potentially requiring extra motivational triggers. Here, we examined whether eliciting attachment security—a psychological mechanism triggering bonding and empathy—combined with a social norm message is linked to reduced energy consumption in extreme heat. In a preregistered field experiment in the United Arab Emirates (100 households, 26,400 observations over 9 months, from September 2019 to May 2020), we compared a standard social norm message against one enhanced with secure attachment priming (vs a control group) in the campus housing of an international university. Results showed that households receiving the combined message saved more electricity (9.98%) than those receiving the standard message (6.11%), showed greater efficacy in already efficient households, had heightened effectiveness on hotter days, and the follow-up effect lasted twice as long post-intervention. During the study’s final months, the COVID-19 lockdown occurred, revealing no significant usage differences between experimental groups from lockdown onwards. Given that this study was conducted in only one location with particular characteristics, results may not be generalizable and should be interpreted with caution.

 Mountain regions are among the most sensitive and vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change. In this study, we systematically assess the observed impacts of climate change in the Andes and use expert review and model-based methods to identify the role of anthropogenic climate change. Impact detection and attribution assessments showed that anthropogenic climate change has had at least a minor role in the observed changes while non-climate factors also interfere. Our results confirm that the observed rapid melting of glaciers, increasing number of droughts and floods and reduced water availability in all Andean regions have led to a widespread cascading of impacts through natural and human systems and that these detected impacts can be attributed to human interference in the climate.

 Landfast ice, sea ice fastened to coastal land or ice shelves, generally undergoes distinctive thermodynamic growth and less active dynamic deformation due to its prolonged attachment to the land, resulting in a thicker and smoother surface compared to drifting pack ice. In 2019, large landfast ice floes were detached from the Ronne Ice Shelf, and the broken pieces started to drift into the Weddell Sea. This study employs a random forest (RF) machine learning model to detect these ex-fast ice floes using six key variables from the ICESat-2 ATL10 sea ice freeboard product: freeboard, Gaussian width of photon height distribution, standard deviation of freeboard, floe length, modal freeboard, and sea ice concentration. The RF model achieves an overall accuracy of 99 % in detecting ex-fast ice, effectively capturing the drift, freeboard distribution, and size distribution of ex-fast ice floes across the western Weddell Sea in 2019. Among six variables, freeboard, standard deviation of freeboard, and Gaussian width of photon height distribution contribute over 94 % to the model performance. Furthermore, the detection of ex-fast ice improves the quantification of sea ice topographical features derived from ICESat-2, including modal freeboard, ridge fraction, and surface roughness.

 Integrating passive microwave (PMW) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing to generate all-weather land surface temperature (LST) is essential for effective land thermal monitoring. Previous studies have attempted to adapt TIR-interactive kernel-driven downscaling techniques into the PMW-TIR integration process. However, large-scale spans often introduce significant uncertainties in the generated LST, potentially leading to spatial streaks. To address these challenges, it is critical to introduce a reliable temperature representation at the target resolution to generate accurate all-weather LST. In this study, we propose an integrated pre-temperature description model (ITDM) comprising three modules. The first module is a machine learning-based bias correction-driven generation module (BCDM), which generates relatively precise LST, particularly during the daytime, though it may smooth some spatial textures in certain regions. The second module, a spatial detail-aware generation module (SDAM), utilizes an annual temperature cycle model-based LST as a temperature description, ensuring spatial consistency in the generated LST. The third module integrates the two previous modules, addressing their differences to optimize the final output. Validation results based on MODIS LST indicate that the proposed method achieves a daytime root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.20 K and a standard deviation of bias (STD) of 3.08 K. For nighttime, the RMSE and STD are 2.24 K and 2.15 K, respectively. Additionally, ten in-situ measurements reveal an average RMSE of 3.90 K in the daytime and 3.34 K in the nighttime. Comparative results with two other advanced methods based on MODIS LST and in-situ LST show that the proposed approach reduces RMSE by 0.04–0.91 K and mitigates streaking phenomena more effectively. The study also discusses feature importance, module performance, and the extendibility of the method. The proposed model significantly contributes to the generation of high-quality all-weather LST."

 The coherence estimation errors in phase linking can be mitigated through the weighted alignment of interferometric pairs and the intermediate filtering of data subsets. The Sequential Estimator (SE) serves as a representative method. It divides the coherence-weighted matrix into smaller subsets, using image compression and recursive estimation to enhance phase linking. However, the SE method has inherent limitations due to its dependence on fixed subset size and manual parameter setting, which hinder its application in complex, natural scenarios. In such environments, the distributions of coherent and low-coherence signals are often unpredictable. To address such limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Sequential Estimator (ASE) method. First, an adaptive coherence-weighted matrix partitioning method is proposed. Utilizing Otsu’s algorithm and a local subset merging algorithm, it adaptively generates data subsets which are dynamically tailored to the coherence distribution. Second, a modified sequential estimator is proposed. It selects the optimal subsets from the list with multiple merging degrees, to guide image compression and recursive phase estimation. Based on these, the ASE method adaptively prioritizes coherent information while minimizing the impact of decorrelation noise, thereby improving phase estimation accuracy. Experimental evaluation is conducted using 30 Radarsat-2 SAR images with VV polarization, including the quantitative and visual comparisons between the ASE method and existing methods. The results indicate that the ASE method outperforms other methods, and is particularly well-suited to handling the variable coherence matrix in natural scenarios. Compared to SE, the ASE method increases the distributed scatterer point density with 7%."

 Effective measurement and monitoring of habitat fragmentation are essential for achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, especially given the ongoing global expansion of urbanization. However, current researches primarily address habitat connectivity or landscape dissection separately, while neglecting the impact of landscape dissection on habitat pattern. In this study, we adopt Road network tiles (RNTs, created through the dissection of the landscape by road networks) as analytical units and develop an integrated index of effective habitat network area to assess habitat fragmentation (structural connectivity), with particular emphasis on landscape dissection. Furthermore, a connection efficiency index is proposed to quantify the ratio of current habitat connectivity to its maximum potential. Collectively interpreting these indices reflects both the adverse effects of road expansion on habitat patterns and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts in spatial planning. These indices were applied to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China. The results show that the effective area of habitat networks in the BTH region declined from 887.66 km2 to 488.50 km2 from 2007 to 2018, despite an overall increase in total habitat area. Nevertheless, connection efficiency for most cities in the BTH region has improved, suggesting that habitat connectivity in 2018 was more efficient and closer to its maximum value compared to 2007, potentially due to effective landscape management practices. By incorporating urban permeation into the joint analysis with RNTs, key zones for habitat conservation and restoration can be identified. This study offers a novel and efficient approach to quantifying habitat fragmentation, providing valuable insights for decision-making aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization on habitat pattern."

 Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is vital for the global carbon cycle, agricultural sustainability, and climate change. Process-based models like Rothamsted carbon model (RothC) simulate SOC dynamics, but their accuracy relies on revisited soil samples for calibration, which are often scarce, especially in environmentally heterogeneous regions. This study proposes a novel approach to generate pseudo revisited samples using environmental similarity, addressing the lack of revisited samples. For each intervening-year sample, pseudo SOC stocks in unsampled years were constructed by calculating environmental similarity with existing samples and applying weighted averaging. These pseudo SOC stocks served as revisited samples for model calibration. Bayesian optimization was used to adjust RothC’s microbial activity parameters. Validation results showed the approach significantly improved predictive accuracy, with an RMSE of 5.28 t/ha (31.6 % lower than global parameter optimization and 10.7 % lower than spatiotemporal Random Forest) and an R2 improved from 0.319 (spatiotemporal Random Forest) to 0.456. The approach enhances SOC model accuracy by leveraging environmental similarity and parameter optimization, offering a practical solution for regions lacking revisited samples and improving long-term SOC dynamics simulations. This approach not only addresses data scarcity but also provides more reliable predictions for climate and agricultural management."

Multivariate linear regression model and stratified analysis were used to evaluate separate and interactive effects of annual PM2.5 and maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 exposures on typical coagulation parameters.ResultsWe found that both long-term PM2.5 and MDA8 O3 exposures were associated with increases in prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR), and decreases in prothrombin activity (PTA), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and D-Dimer. The effect estimates of both PM2.5 and MDA8 O3 on PTA, INR, and APTT were generally stronger at higher percentiles of co-pollutant strata (all Pdifference<0.05). For example, the percent changes in PTA associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 were −0.68 % (95 %CI: −0.97 %, −0.38 %), −1.04 % (95 %CI: −1.30 %, −0.78 %) and −1.36 % (95 %CI: −1.80 %, −0.91 %) in the low (≤25 %), medium (25 %–75 %) and high (>75 %) MDA8 O3 strata, respectively; and the percent changes in PTA associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in MDA8 O3 were −1.63 % (95 %CI: −1.96 %, −1.30 %), −1.67 % (95 %CI: −2.03 %, −1.30 %) and −2.30 % (95 %CI: −2.78 %, −1.82 %) in the low, medium and high PM2.5 strata, respectively.ConclusionsOur study provides novel evidence that long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposures synergistically impair the function of coagulation, which may lead to the adverse prognosis in IHD patients, highlighting the advantage of implementing integrated management approaches for both air pollutants."

In North America, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses related to the goose/Guangdong 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin phylogenetic clade have infected wild birds, poultry, and mammals. Our genomic analysis and epidemiological investigation showed that a reassortment event in wild bird populations preceded a single wild bird–to-cattle transmission episode. The movement of asymptomatic or presymptomatic cattle has likely played a role in the spread of HPAI within the United States dairy herd. Some molecular markers that may lead to changes in transmission efficiency and phenotype were detected at low frequencies. Continued transmission of H5N1 HPAI within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations."

We report the realization of a generalizedt-Jmodel with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods."

The biophysical properties that these polymeric scaffolds require for signal transduction are not clearly defined. Here, we engineered single-component DF signalosomes. We found that functionality depends on the stability provided by the DF polymer, which could also be achieved with a bacterial DF domain, a synthetic filament-forming domain, and amyloid-like sequences. This demonstrates the importance of polymer stability and inducibility irrespective of the motif’s origin. By varying the number of included TRAF6 interaction motifs, we demonstrate that avidity is a tunable property that can control the amplitude of signaling outputs. This work lays out a reductionist framework to elucidate the required signaling properties through polymeric scaffolds by adjusting their assembly kinetics, stability, and avidity."

However, both farming systems comprise highly variable management practices. In this study, we show that in organic and conventional arable fields, the multifunctionality of soils decreases with increasing agricultural management intensity. Soil organic carbon content and bacterial biomass, respectively, were the strongest abiotic and biotic predictors of soil multifunctionality. Greater soil multifunctionality was associated with less-frequent inversion tillage and higher frequency of grass-legume cover cropping, and organic farming did not outperform conventional farming. Our results suggest that reducing management intensity will enhance soil multifunctionality in both conventional and organic farming. This implies that, in contexts where high-yielding, high-intensity agriculture prevails, the paradigm of sustainable intensification should be replaced by “productive deintensification.”"

To investigate the basis for treatment failure, we examined spontaneous mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with either an inflamed T cell–rich or a noninflamed T cell–deprived tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) secreted by tumor cells determines tumor immunotype. Tumor-derived EPO autonomously generates a noninflamed TME by interacting with its cognate receptor EPOR on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). EPO signaling prompts TAMs to become immunoregulatory through NRF2-mediated heme depletion. Removing either tumor-derived EPO or EPOR on TAMs leads to an inflamed TME and tumor regression independent of genotype, owing to augmented antitumor T cell immunity. Thus, the EPO/EPOR axis functions as an immunosuppressive switch for antitumor immunity."

Whereas cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we reveal a bacterial antiphage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine triphosphates (dITPs) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates a downstream effector to mediate depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular deoxyadenosine monophosphate, the precursor of dITP messengers.

10.1126/sciadv.adv2052,False,Science Advances,这篇论文主要关注的是如何通过超可编程关节来模拟动物的身体控制能力，实现具有机械智能的机器人。论文介绍了弹性滚动凸轮（ERC）的设计和应用，通过调整ERC的刚度来实现不同的运动功能，例如双足机器人在不平坦地形上的稳定行走和四轴飞行器的形态转换。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Rui Wu;Luca Girardi;Stefano Mintchev,Encoding mechanical intelligence using ultraprogrammable joints,"Animal bodies act as physical controllers, with their finely tuned passive mechanical responses physically “encoding” complex movements and environmental interactions. This capability allows animals to perform challenging tasks with minimal muscular or neural activities, a phenomenon known as embodied intelligence. However, realizing such robots remains challenging due to the lack of mechanically intelligent bodies with abundant tunable parameters—such as tunable stiffness—which is a critical factor akin to the programmable parameters of a neural network. We introduce an elastic rolling cam (ERC) with accurately inverse-designable rotational stiffness. The ERC can closely replicate 100,000 randomly generated stiffness profiles in simulation. Prototypes ranging from millimeters to centimeters were manufactured. To illustrate the mechanical intelligence encoded by programming the ERC’s stiffness response, we designed a bipedal robot with optimized ERC passive knees, achieving energy-efficient, open-loop stable walking across uneven terrain. We also demonstrated a quadcopter drone with ERC joints encoding an impact-activated, dual-state morphing."

With the demand of REE being met by a few giant deposits such as Bayan Obo, decoding controls of ore formation is vital. Yet, after nearly a century of study, the genesis of Bayan Obo remains debated. Here, we demonstrate that two stages of carbonatites emplaced at Bayan Obo at 1320 and 430 million years ago (Ma). The effusive nature of the 1320 Ma carbonatite suppressed brine/fluid exsolution; hence, mineralization at this stage is limited, but its subsequent deformation created an ideal environment for water-rock interaction induced mineralization. The 430 Ma carbonatites exsolved voluminous brine/alkaline fluids rich in REE, with mineralization being promoted as veins and along beddings of the deformed Mesoproterozoic carbonatites via metasomatism. This stage contributed >70% REE. Our study highlights that multistage carbonatites emplaced at one locality could be a controlling factor for REE mineralization and explains the scarcity of giant deposits."
