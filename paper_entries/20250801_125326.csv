Financing improvements to water-related infrastructure access is primarily dependent upon utility revenue or assistance from government agencies and non-governmental organizations. In the United States (US), the State Revolving Fund (SRF) is the single largest government program for communities to obtain funding to improve their water-related infrastructure challenges. The program is funded annually by the US Congress through the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and was bolstered by an influx of funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ($50 billion) and the American Rescue Plan Act ($350 billion). For the Federal fiscal year 2024, the US Congress allocated and the USEPA distributed $11.5 billion to the SRF programs among States, Territories, Tribes and SRF initiatives at USEPA. However, accessing the SRF program is complicated and can prove insurmountable for the millions of residents living in rural, small, or otherwise disadvantaged communities (DACs) without reliable and affordable access to clean piped drinking water and functioning wastewater treatment systems. This study analyzed the $3.3 billion in funding requests to Alabama’s SRF to reveal that 69.6% of drinking water utilities and 70.3% of wastewater utilities have sought SRF funding for infrastructure upgrades since 2022. In Alabama, DACs comprise 55.4% of census tracts (2.2 million people) and 84.7% of SRF applications could potentially be serving DACs, yet only 24.6% of the funds awarded through recent Intended Use Plans (IUPs) are intended for DACs. This novel analysis seeks to provide a greater understanding of key infrastructure funding mechanisms, analyze how Federal funds are being delivered to communities and encourage decision-makers to shift funding programs to better reach DACs."

Young,Opinion: The role of AerChemMIP in advancing climate and air quality research,"The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) aimed to quantify the climate and air quality impacts of aerosols and chemically reactive gases. We review its contribution to AR6 (Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and the wider understanding of the role of these species in climate and climate change. We identify challenges and provide recommendations to improve the utility and uptake of climate model data, detailed summary tables of CMIP6 models, experiments, and emergent diagnostics. 
 The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) was endorsed by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and was designed to quantify the climate and air quality impacts of aerosols and chemically reactive gases. AerChemMIP  provided the first consistent calculation of effective radiative forcing (ERF) for a wide range of forcing agents, which was a vital contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It supported the quantification of composition–climate feedback parameters and the climate response to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), as well as enabled the future impacts of air pollution mitigation to be identified, and the study of interactions between climate and air quality in a transient simulations. Here we review AerChemMIP in detail and assess the project against its stated objectives, its contribution to the CMIP6 project, and  the wider scientific efforts designed to understand the role of aerosols and chemistry in the Earth system. We assess the successes of the project and the remaining challenges and gaps. We conclude with some recommendations that we hope will provide input to planning for future MIPs in this area. In particular, we highlight the necessity of sufficient ensemble size for the attribution of regional climate responses  and the need for coordination across projects to ensure key science questions are addressed. Summary data for CMIP6 and AerChemMIP models such as model components, model configurations, and emergent quantities are included."

The moisture transport divergence is the main driver of local moisture change over time. Surface precipitation and evaporation are rather weak when averaged over extended AR sectors, although considerable heterogeneity of precipitation within the AR is observed. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are essential for the Arctic water cycle, but observations quantifying the moisture processes of individual Arctic ARs are sparse. This study quantified the evolution of the moisture budget components of an Arctic AR derived from airborne observations from two research flights on consecutive days. We investigated how poleward transport of warm and moist air masses by ARs generates precipitation near the sea ice edge and how advection and evaporation affect the local moisture amount during the dissipation of the AR. Using observations from the High-Altitude and LOng-Range Research Aircraft (HALO), we derived the atmospheric moisture budget components (local tendency of moisture, evaporation, moisture transport divergence, and precipitation) within an Arctic AR during the HALO-(𝒜𝒞)3 aircraft campaign. The budget components were quantified in sectors ahead of the AR-embedded cold front using airborne observations from dropsondes, radiometers, and a radar device and compared with values derived from reanalyses and numerical weather prediction simulations.We found that the observed moisture budget components in the pre-cold frontal sectors contribute up to ±1mmh-1 to the local moisture amount. The moisture transport divergence primarily controls the local moisture amount within the AR, while surface interactions are of minor importance. Precipitation is heterogeneous but overall weak (<0.1mmh-1), and evaporation is small. As the AR dissipated, the budget components changed from drying to moistening, mainly due to moisture advection. We demonstrated the feasibility of closing the moisture budget using single aircraft measurements, even though we found significant residuals that model-based comparisons attribute to subscale variability."
10.5194/acp-25-8271-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文探讨了使用TROPOMI和TEMPO卫星探测二氧化氮（NO2）分布的能力，并将其与美国环保署（EPA）的地面监测数据进行了比较。研究发现，卫星在远离道路的区域表现最佳，TEMPO卫星由于其小时级数据，在中午时分与地面监测数据最为吻合，优于每日测量的TROPOMI卫星。这些结果表明，卫星可以有效补充现有的地面监测网络，并具有应用于监测站选址、法规制定和公共健康领域的潜力。该研究通过Jensen-Shannon散度（JSD）量化了卫星和地面监测数据分布的相似性，并分析了不同季节和监测点位置的数据。,"['nitrogen dioxide', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'TROPOMI', 'TEMPO', 'ground-based monitors', 'vertical column density', 'diurnal patterns', 'regulatory applications', 'public health applications']",Summer Acker;Tracey Holloway;Monica Harkey,Satellite detection of NO2 distributions using TROPOMI and TEMPO and comparison with ground-based concentration measurements,"We studied how well satellites detect nitrogen dioxide, a harmful air pollutant, compared with the EPA's ground monitors across the US. Both satellites performed best in areas far from roads, where pollution is lower and more uniform. The newer TEMPO satellite, with hourly data, agreed most closely with monitors at midday and performed better than TROPOMI, a satellite with daily measurements. These findings highlight the ability of satellites to complement existing ground-based monitors. 
 In this study we assess the capability of current-generation satellites to capture the variability of near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) monitoring data, with the goal of supporting health and regulatory applications. We consider NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) over the United States from two satellite instruments, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO), and compare them with ground-based concentrations as measured by the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) monitors. While TROPOMI provides a longer-term record of assessment (2019–2023), TEMPO informs diurnal patterns relevant to evaluating peak NO2. We analyze frequency distributions and quantify their similarity using the Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD), where smaller values indicate better agreement. Satellite and ground monitor NO2 distributions are most similar at non-roadway monitors (JSD =0.008) and are most different at interstate (JSD = 0.158) and highway (JSD =0.095) monitors. Seasonal analysis shows the greatest similarity in distributions in winter (JSD =0.010) and the greatest difference in summer (JSD =0.035). Across seasons and monitor locations, the calculated 13:30 LT TEMPO consistently exhibits JSDs that are better than or comparable to TROPOMI (TEMPO: 0.005–0.151; TROPOMI: 0.012–0.265). TEMPO's agreement with monitors, in both December 2023 and July 2024, is found to be best around midday, with non-road monitors in July having the best alignment (JSD =0.008) at 16:00 UTC (≈11:00 LT). These findings highlight the ability of TROPOMI and TEMPO to complement existing ground-based monitors and demonstrate their potential for monitor siting, regulatory, and public health applications."

Samset;Victoria A. Sinclair;Jennie L. Thomas;Annica M. L. Ekman,"Polar winter climate change: strong local effects from sea ice loss, widespread consequences from warming seas","The effects of warmer sea surface temperatures and decreasing sea ice cover on polar climates have been studied using four climate models with identical prescribed changes in sea surface temperatures and sea ice cover. The models predict similar changes in air temperature and precipitation in the polar regions in a warmer climate with less sea ice. However, the models disagree on how the atmospheric circulation, i.e. the large-scale winds, will change with warmer temperatures and less sea ice. 
 Decreasing sea ice cover and warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) impact the climate at both poles in uncertain ways. We aim to reduce the uncertainty by comparing output of 41-year-long simulations from four atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). In our “Baseline” simulations, the models use identical prescribed SSTs and sea ice cover conditions representative of 1950–1969. In three sensitivity experiments, the SSTs and sea ice cover are individually and simultaneously changed to conditions representative of 2080–2099 in a strong warming scenario. Overall, the models agree that warmer SSTs have a widespread impact on 2 m temperature and precipitation, while decreasing sea ice cover mainly causes a local response (i.e. the greatest warming occurs where sea ice is perturbed). Thus, decreasing sea ice cover causes greater changes in precipitation and temperature than in warmer SSTs in areas where sea ice cover is reduced, while warmer SSTs dominate the response elsewhere. In general, the response in temperature and precipitation to simultaneous changes in SSTs and sea ice cover is approximately equal to the sum due to individual changes, except in areas of sea ice decrease where the joint effect is smaller than the sum of the individual effects. The models agree less well on the magnitude and spatial distribution of the response in mean sea level pressure; i.e. uncertainties associated with atmospheric circulation responses are greater than uncertainties associated with thermodynamic responses. Furthermore, the circulation response to decreasing sea ice cover is sometimes significantly enhanced but sometimes counteracted by the response to warmer SSTs."

We deliberately released methane in different environments and calibrated the response of different methane analysers when they transected the plumes in a vehicle. We derived an improved statistical function for consistent emission estimations using different instruments. Repeated transects reduce the uncertainty in emission rate estimates. 
 Mobile real-time measurements of ambient methane provide a fast and effective method to identify and quantify methane leaks from local gas distribution systems in urban areas. The objectives of these methodologies are to (i) identify leak locations for repair and (ii) construct measurement-based emission rate estimates, which can improve emissions reporting and contribute to monitoring emission changes over time. Currently, the most common method for emission quantification uses the maximum methane enhancement detected while crossing a methane plume. However, the recorded maximum depends on instrument characteristics, such as measurement cell size, pump speed, and measurement frequency. Consequently, the current approach can only be used by instruments with similar characteristics. We suggest that the integrated spatial peak area is a more suitable quantity that can eliminate the bias between different instruments. Based on controlled release experiments conducted with various devices in four cities (London, Toronto, Rotterdam, and Utrecht), emission estimation methodologies were evaluated. Indeed, when different analysers were measuring in the same vehicle and from the same air inlet, the integrated spatial peak area was found to be a more robust metric across different methane gas analyser devices than the maximum methane enhancement. A statistical function based on integrated spatial peak area is proposed for more consistent emission estimations when using different instruments. On top of this systematic relation between actual emission rate and recorded spatial peak area, large variations in methane spatial peak area were observed for the multiple transects across the same release point, in line with previous experiments. This variability is the main contributor to uncertainty in efforts to use mobile measurements to prioritize leak repair. We show that repeated transects can reduce this uncertainty and improve the categorization into different leak categories. We recommend a minimum of three and an optimal range of five–seven plume transects for effective emission quantification to prioritize repair actions."

Turner;Luc Rochette,The Atmospheric Sounder Spectrometer by Infrared Spectral Technology (ASSIST): instrument design and signal processing,"The Atmospheric Sounder Spectrometer by Infrared Spectral Technology (ASSIST) is a commercially available ground-based infrared spectroradiometer. It is designed for automated and passive measurement of the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere, providing information about the vertical distribution of temperature and humidity, trace gases, clouds, and aerosols in the boundary layer. In this paper, we outline the key characteristics of the ASSIST hardware and signal processing algorithm that yields downwelling radiance spectra in near real-time. 
 The Atmospheric Sounder Spectrometer by Infrared Spectral Technology (ASSIST) is a Fourier-transform spectrometer designed, fabricated, and sold by LR Tech Inc., which operates in the thermal infrared. When attached to its automated radiometric calibration module, it functions as an infrared spectroradiometer (IRS) that passively measures the absolute spectral radiance within a 46 mrad full field of view and over the 525 to 3300 cm−1 (3 to 19 µm) spectral range. For atmospheric studies, the ASSIST IRS is integrated into a mobile enclosure enabling autonomous and reliable operation across a range of environmental conditions. It is typically configured for downwelling radiance measurements (zenith view) at 0.5 cm−1 bin spacing, 0.6 cm−1 resolution, and 4 min−1 sampling rate, closely replicating the behavior of the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI, in rapid-sampling mode), a similar but older IRS. Atmospheric variables affecting the shape of the downwelling thermal infrared radiance spectrum at ground level can be retrieved from the ASSIST high-resolution measurements using dedicated inversion algorithms. This includes the properties of some aerosols and simple clouds, the mixing ratios of trace gases, and the vertical distribution of temperature and water vapor (thermodynamic profile) in the lower troposphere above the instrument. Due to the form of the radiative transfer equation, thermodynamic profiles can only be retrieved with low to moderate vertical resolution but with sufficient accuracy and temporal resolution to help fill the current boundary layer observational gap. This paper provides a detailed description of the ASSIST design and near-real-time processing algorithm producing the calibrated radiance spectra that are useful in a variety of applications."

New strategies for assessing the risks posed by chemicals are needed, and omics technologies, including proteomics, have proven to be powerful tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms of these metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs). A potential MDC is the plasticizer DINCH─an alternative to legacy phthalates like DEHP, whose primary metabolite MINCH has been linked to the induction of adipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Here, global proteomics was complemented with insights into protein thermal stability and the profiles of post-translational modification (PTM) acetylation and phosphorylation to provide a profound understanding of chemical-induced metabolic disruption in adipocytes. We demonstrate the utility of advanced proteomics approaches in assessing the effects of potential MDCs by using the human SGBS adipocyte cell line. Adipose tissue PTM data from dietary DINCH-exposed mice were assessed as an in vivo model, and in vitro data shed light on DINCH’s molecular effects, including protein interactions beyond its primary target PPARγ.

This study employs the framework of climate policy stringency assessment to examine fisheries subsidy reform through a carbon pricing lens. Using emissions, political, and economic data, this study proposes the Objective Fisheries Carbon Pricing Intention (OFCPI) index for the 19 largest fishing nations. Supported by a Monte Carlo simulation, the results reveal that except for Denmark and Iceland, potential carbon revenues seldom offset the scale of harmful subsidies, frequently resulting in substantial shortfall. The findings suggest that policy change is primarily constrained by inadequate driving forces and objective limitations rather than by overt resistance. To address these challenges, we propose a fishery carbon pricing framework based on downstream emissions trading and individual transferable quotas, which offers a promising strategy for gradually eliminating harmful subsidies while promoting sustainable fisheries, mitigating climate impacts, and reconciling economic realities with environmental imperatives."

We targeted enterobacterial coliphages because they are better than fecal indicator bacteria in tracking environmental persistence of viral pathogens and their fate in wastewater unit operations. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of intact/damaged P1 and enumeration of infective virions by plaque assays demonstrated control via both removal and inactivation. Cryo-single particle analysis was coupled with cryo-electron tomography to generate 3-dimensional electron density maps to visualize and analyze untreated and coagulated capsids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cryo-EM to visualize structurally damaged viruses with environmental relevance. Viruses were intrinsically enmeshed in precipitates consistent with sweep coagulation. Direct evidence of multiple inactivation mechanisms was obtained including (i) capsid breakage leading to leakage of viral genome and other components, (ii) deformation and thinning of capsid proteins, (iii) severance/damages to the neck region where the tail is attached to the capsid, (iv) removal, fragmentation, and splintering of tail sections, and (v) baseplate damage (including receptor-binding proteins). Conformational alterations to proteins, changes to secondary structures, and specific interactions with flocs were inferred from infrared spectroscopy for both coagulation approaches.

Inspired by collective behavioral patterns in bird flocks, we developed a “bird-like flock” time-domain sensing method through the utilization of functional long afterglow nanomaterials (AGNPs) for ClO– detection. Particularly, by translating avian aggregation-separation-alignment behaviors into an algorithmic framework, we presented a new sensing mode based on simplifying time decay curves into interpretable temporal metrics. In light of dual-emission AGNPs with impressive luminescence performance, ClO–-stimulated responsiveness, and derived metrics, our approach accurately distinguished ClO– concentrations down to 95 nM, resulting from the well-refined six temporal parameters. Furthermore, by integrating a portable aerosol generation device via pneumatic atomization and an aerosol-enriched hydrogel sensing matrix, we demonstrated that this time-domain analysis method maintained superior detection accuracy, outperforming traditional methods that often falter with complex water samples. This advancement paves the way for high-contrast sensing while enabling deeper exploration of atmospheric targets. Inspired by the dynamic evolution of avian flock behavior patterns, we developed a high-fidelity analytical method based on time-resolved long-afterglow spectral partitioning for qualitative and quantitative investigation of hypochlorite (ClO–) in atmospheric aerosols."

Herein, layered FeOCl with coordinatively unsaturated Fe sites were fabricated and used to activate Fe(VI) for the efficient ARB/ARG removal in the present study. We found that highly reactive Fe(IV)/Fe(V) intermediates were generated in the FeOCl/Fe(VI) system, rapidly disinfecting 1 × 107 CFU mL–1 ARB to below the limit of detection within only 6 min. Via the combination of in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we revealed that Fe(VI) was preferentially adsorbed onto Fe sites on the (010) plane of FeOCl and subsequently activated to produce reactive Fe(IV)/Fe(V) through direct electron transfer. Meanwhile, O2•– generated from O2 activation on the FeOCl surface enhanced Fe(VI) conversion to Fe(IV)/Fe(V). During the disinfection process, intracellular/extracellular ARGs and DNA bases were simultaneously degraded, inhibiting the potential horizontal gene transfer process. The FeOCl/Fe(VI) system could effectively disinfect ARB under complex water matrices and in real water samples including tap water, lake water, and groundwater.

Conventional chemical processes often suffer from high-energy input, poor selectivity, and limited sustainability. Meanwhile, standalone biocatalyst systems are restricted by their low stability, narrow substrate scope, and inefficient solar energy utilization despite having high specificity under mild conditions. PBSs overcome these limitations by coupling the high selectivity and biocompatibility of enzymatic and microbial systems with the stability and tunable photophysics of the synthetic components. However, the charge transfer and interface mechanisms between the biotic and abiotic components in PBSs remain elusive, and comparative analyses across PBS types are rare, hindering the integrated design and scalability. This review systematically compares enzyme- and microbe-based PBSs, establishing a multidimensional framework to evaluate their quantitative performance, including product yield, solar-to-chemical energy efficiency, selectivity, turnover frequency, and operational stability. Additionally, we highlight key advances in interface engineering and identify specific performance bottlenecks. Further, we explore the dual functionality of PBSs in energy generation and environmental remediation and propose integrative optimization strategies informed by techno-economic and life cycle assessments to guide future innovation and industrial translation."

To address this issue, this study reports a dual-iron-site single-atom nanozyme (SAN, FePc@FeNOC) electrocatalyst, resembling the natural cytochrome c-dependent nitric oxide reductase (cNOR). The FePc@FeNOC electrocatalyst exhibits a NO3– removal efficiency as high as 96.1%, accounting for N2 selectivity of 93.3% and Faradaic efficiency of 82.8% at a reaction time of 10 h. The theoretical results reveal that the potential-determining step of ECDN to N2 is more thermodynamically favorable than that to NH3 by FePc@FeNOC, as indicated by the lower free energy barrier for *NO to *N2O2 (0.82 eV) compared with that for *NO to *NOH (0.87 eV). The *N2O2 intermediate demonstrates enhanced charge separation compared with *NOH. The charge redistribution strengthens the electrostatic coupling between FePc@FeNOC and *N2O2, which not only stabilizes the intermediate structure but also creates a thermodynamic driving force for N2 formation. We further demonstrate that the superior N2-selectivity (90%) of FePc@FeNOC can offer a promising electrocatalyst for removing nitrogen from realistic photovoltaic wastewater with a low energy consumption of 9.8 kWh kgN2–1. This work provides a proof-in-concept demonstration of mimicking cNOR toward the sustainable treatment of nitrate-contaminated wastewater."

The sites were analyzed during winter 2017 under two dominant wind regimes: East and West. These sites were directly linked to each other, which was supported by cross-correlation analysis, with a typical time lag of −2 h in East and +4 h in West. Eastern winds brought higher concentrations (Melpitz: 35.50 μg m–3, Eiba: 37.47 μg m–3), while Western winds led to cleaner conditions. After being corrected for time lag, the Urban Increment (UI) was estimated, showing that during Eastern wind, only ∼9% of PM1 mass measured at Eiba was attributed to urban sources, highlighting the dominant contribution of regionally transported aerosol. Furthermore, source apportionment of organic aerosol (OA) identified five major factors─three primary OA and two oxygenated OA─at both sites.

Marine sediment is recognized as the final sink for marine microplastics and has therefore received increasing scientific attention. Currently, limited research has focused on microplastic pollution in the marine sediments of Hong Kong, China. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation across Hong Kong to assess the abundance, polymer composition, and morphological characteristics of microplastics in marine sediments. Spatial pattern, risk assessment, and potential source analysis were further performed based on the field data. Our findings reveal that microplastics were unevenly distributed in Hong Kong’s marine sediment with abundance ranging from 402.12 to 1507.96 items/kg (dry weight). The spatial pattern indicates higher microplastic accumulation in the western waters, with three hotspots at Deep Bay, Tai O, and Victoria Harbour. The dominant shapes of the observed microplastics were fibers and fragments. The major polymer types identified include polypropylene (PP), chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), and polyethylene (PE). The overall pollution load index (PLI) and pollution hazard index (PHI) were found to be at moderate levels. Notably, green PP was observed at 70% of sampling sites and accumulated in fishing farming areas and Victoria Harbor. It may be associated with regional intensive fishing and diverse anthropogenic activities.

Specifically, O3 well exceeded the normal values in the middle‐to‐lower troposphere due to the stratospherically intruded airmasses (SIA), but was sharply reduced in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region because of convectively lofted air transported from the Tibetan Plateau. Guided by the discovery of such a vertical O3 structure, we further assess the SIA contribution to tropospheric O3 using multi‐year AIRS satellite observations, and find that SIA appear frequently during summer and lead to short‐term O3 enhancements 35% above the normal values at 500 hPa.

We show that the ground velocity envelope recorded after several Mw6+ foreshocks exhibits an anomalous sawtooth pattern, distinct from typical post‐mainshock signals. This pattern suggests the presence of rate‐weakening fault patches approaching instability, promoting stress transfer and aftershock migration into neighboring critically stressed regions.

Using a thunder database recorded in the (1–100) Hz frequency range during two observation campaigns in Southern France in 2012 and 2018, the vertical repartition of thunder power is investigated statistically over a significant number of flashes, with a majority of negative cloud‐to‐ground (CG−) events. This repartition is also discussed per sound frequency band. Rare positive cloud‐to‐ground (CG+) events having lead to sprites (transient luminous events above the cloud in the mesosphere) and a few, entirely intracloud discharges, are also analyzed. Acoustic data are complemented by electromagnetic very high frequency (EM‐VHF [60–66] MHz range) detections by Lightning Mapping Arrays for the same events. Vertical localizations of sound and EM‐VHF powers within the different thundercloud charged layers are compared. For CG− discharges however, most of the sound power is shown to be emitted along the cloud to ground plasma channels, at an average altitude around 1 km only well below the cloud."

Martin Ralph,"Characteristics and Predictability of Extreme Precipitation Related to Atmospheric Rivers, Mesoscale Convective Systems, and Tropical Cyclones in the U.S. Southeast","The Southeastern United States (SEUS) region has lower extreme quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) skill compared to the northeastern or western United States. Previous studies have reported that the extreme precipitation events (EPEs) with high integrated vapor transport (IVT) have higher QPF skill than those with low IVT in the SEUS. We hypothesize that this extreme QPF skill is influenced by different storm types, such as atmospheric rivers (ARs), mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), and tropical cyclones (TCs), occurring within various synoptic patterns. This study investigates pattern‐wise QPF skill and the contribution of storm types to EPEs in the SEUS. Six synoptic patterns associated with EPEs were identified from 2001 to 2019. These patterns exhibited a distinct seasonality: three occurred in the cool season, two in the warm season, and one in the transition season. Approximately 35% of the EPEs in the cool season, 24% in the transition season, and 29% in the warm season are associated with coincident ARs and MCSs. Pattern‐wise QPF skill derived from the GEFS reforecast dataset illustrated that the cool season pattern, characterized by high IVT and frequency of ARs, has higher QPF skill. In contrast, the warm season pattern with high convective available potential energy and integrated water vapor has lower QPF skill across multiple lead times. In addition, patterns with higher frequency of ARs or coincident ARs and MCSs have better predictability than those with isolated MCSs. These results provide insight into the contribution of storm types to EPEs and their predictability in the SEUS."

However, the influence of historical agricultural management practices on soil properties is often overlooked in current SOM digital mapping studies. Crop rotation, a critical agricultural practice, significantly influences the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOM. This study investigates the cumulative effects of dynamic crop rotation changes on SOM using digital soil mapping in a multi‐cropping region in southeastern China, where 202 topsoil samples were collected. Annual crop rotations from 2019 to 2023 were mapped by integrating Sentinel‐2 data with expert knowledge, enabling the extraction of historical crop rotation changes. The added value of these legacy changes in SOM digital mapping was assessed by combining traditional environmental covariates. Results showed that integrating historical crop rotation changes significantly enhanced SOM prediction accuracy, with the coefficient of determination (R2) increased by 14.86% and the root mean square error reduced by 26.43% compared to models using traditional covariates and annual crop rotations alone. Notably, five‐year changes in crop rotation emerged as the dominant factor in SOM prediction. The spatial distribution of SOM exhibited distinct heterogeneity, with high‐value regions primarily located in regions under relatively stable crop rotation change frequency. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance and effectiveness of incorporating historical crop rotation changes into SOM mapping. The findings highlight the impact of historical agricultural practices on SOM distribution and provide a scientific foundation for enhancing agricultural strategies that promote ecosystem services."

 Ecosystem restoration is increasingly recognized as a means of climate change mitigation. Recent global-scale studies have suggested that ecosystem restoration could offset a substantial fraction of human carbon emissions since the Industrial Revolution. However, global carbon sequestration potential remains uncertain due to the tree-centric view of some models and difficulties in modelling restoration across different ecosystem types. Here we applied a model-based prediction workflow to estimate the carbon capture potential of restoring forest, shrubland, grassland and wetland ecosystems until 2100. We found that the maximum sequestration potential is 96.9 Gt of carbon, equivalent to 17.6% of the anthropogenic emissions to date, or 3.7–12.0% if taking into account future emissions until 2100. Our results suggest that ecosystem restoration has limited potential for climate change mitigation even if orchestrated with a pervasive shift towards sustainable, low-emissions economies globally. In addition, if we plan restoration targets to match future climatic conditions and consider state transitions of currently natural ecosystems due to climate change, the potential for natural climate solutions related to ecosystem restoration is close to zero. Therefore, we recommend that ecosystem restoration is pursued primarily for restoring biodiversity, supporting livelihoods and resilience of ecosystem services, as the climate mitigation potential will vary depending on the state transitions that occur between vegetation types. The maximum carbon sequestration potential from global terrestrial ecosystem restoration efforts until 2100 is 96.9 Gt, which is equivalent to 3.7–12.0% of anthropogenic emissions until then, according to model projections."

 Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of healthcare-associated pneumonia, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide. As a ubiquitous colonizer of the upper respiratory tract, S. aureus must undergo substantial metabolic adaptation to achieve persistent infection in the distinctive microenvironment of the lung. We observed that fumC, which encodes the enzyme that converts fumarate to malate, is highly conserved with low mutation rates in S. aureus isolates from chronic lung infections. Fumarate, a pro-inflammatory metabolite produced by macrophages during infection, is regulated by the host fumarate hydratase (FH) to limit inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that fumarate, which accumulates in the chronically infected lung, is detrimental to S. aureus, blocking primary metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This creates a metabolic bottleneck that drives staphylococcal FH (FumC) activity for airway adaptation. FumC not only degrades fumarate but also directs its utilization into critical pathways including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gluconeogenesis and hexosamine synthesis to maintain metabolic fitness and form a protective biofilm. Itaconate, another abundant immunometabolite in the infected airway enhances FumC activity, in synergy with fumarate. In a mouse model of pneumonia, a ΔfumC mutant displays significant attenuation compared to its parent and complemented strains, particularly in fumarate- and itaconate-replete conditions. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of immunometabolites in promoting S. aureus pulmonary adaptation.

METTL9 loss in cells leads to Golgi fragmentation. 
 METTL9 is an enzyme catalysing N1-methylation of histidine residues (1MH) within eukaryotic proteins. Given its high expression in vertebrate nervous system and its potential association with neurodevelopmental delay, we dissected Mettl9 role during neural development. We generated three distinct mouse embryonic stem cell lines: a complete Mettl9 knock-out (KO), an inducible METTL9 Degron and a line endogenously expressing a catalytically inactive protein, and assessed their ability to undergo neural differentiation. In parallel, we down-regulated mettl9 in Xenopus laevis embryos and characterised their neural development. Our multi-omics data indicate that METTL9 exerts a conserved role in sustaining vertebrate neurogenesis. This is largely independent of its catalytic activity and occurs through modulation of the secretory pathway. METTL9 interacts with key regulators of cellular transport, endocytosis and Golgi integrity; moreover, in Mettl9KO cells Golgi becomes fragmented. Overall, we demonstrate a developmental function of Mettl9 and link it to a 1MH-independent pathway, namely, the maintenance of the secretory system, which is essential throughout neural development.

 Understanding N-P interactions is crucial for co-limitation in ecosystems but remains unclear due to oversimplified frameworks. Here, a large-scale N and P addition experiment in early soils revealed four key processes driving nutrient coupling, emphasizing carbon’s central role. N addition significantly increases P availability. P availability drives biological N fixation. Both nutrients stimulate carbon fixation, with N having a stronger effect. N addition also intensifies ammonia nitrification, further reducing pH; P has no significant effect on nitrification. Based on these findings and prior research, we establish two models: one depicting P-driven N availability, the other N-driven P availability. These models highlight carbon-related processes as central to N-P coupling, enhancing nutrient availability in early soils. The results reveal a synergistic pathway where nutrient enrichment boosts co-availability rather than intensifying limitation. This framework clarifies the driving mechanisms of N-P bioavailability interactions that support positive ecosystem succession during soil development.

 Gene editing technologies have revolutionized therapies for numerous genetic diseases. However, in vivo gene editing hinges on identifying efficient delivery vehicles for editing in targeted cell types, a significant hurdle in fully realizing its therapeutic potential. A model system to rapidly evaluate systemic gene editing would advance the field. Here, we develop the GFP-on reporter mouse, which harbors a nonsense mutation in a genomic EGFP sequence correctable by adenine base editor (ABE) among other genome editors. The GFP-on system was validated using single and dual adeno-associated virus (AAV9) encoding ABE8e and sgRNA. Intravenous administration of AAV9-ABE8e-sgRNA into adult GFP-on mice results in EGFP expression consistent with the tropism of AAV9. Intrahepatic delivery of AAV9-ABE8e-sgRNA into GFP-on fetal mice restores EGFP expression in AAV9-targeted organs lasting at least six months post-treatment.

In mice, the authors show that centro-medial thalamic neurons detect threat-related sounds and selectively trigger awakenings during NREM, but not REM, sleep. 
 Sleep involves a relative disconnection from the environment, yet sensory stimuli can still trigger awakenings. The mechanism underlying sensory vigilance and stimulus discrimination during sleep remains unclear. Here, we showed that neutral auditory stimuli evoked responses across parallel auditory and non-auditory pathways, including the auditory cortex and thalamus, the hippocampus and centro-medial thalamus (CMT). Using a convolutional neural network, we identified CMT activity as the most discriminant hub for auditory-evoked sleep-to-wake transitions among all recorded structures. Furthermore, we found that prior associative learning of auditory cues with danger (conditioned stimulus, CS+) resulted in increased awakening upon CS+ exposure during NREM, but not REM, sleep. These sleep-to-wake transitions were blocked by optogenetic silencing of CMT neurons during CS+ exposure in sleeping mice. Altogether, these results suggest a central role of the CMT neurons in the residual processing of behaviorally-relevant information in the sleeping brain functioning as one of the major hubs for awakening in response to danger. The extent to which the sleeping brain can discern safety from danger is poorly understood.

Here the authors show that global warming causes a shift in hotspots of such clusters towards the North Atlantic. 
 Multiple tropical cyclones can be present concurrently within one ocean basin, and these clusters can induce compound hazards within a short time window. While the western North Pacific has historically been home to most tropical cyclone clusters, how climate change might affect this is unclear. Here we use observations and high-resolution climate model simulations to develop a probabilistic model, assuming that tropical cyclones are mutually independent and occur randomly. Against this baseline, we identify outliers as clusters with dynamic interactions between tropical cyclones. We find that the recent global warming pattern induces major shifts in tropical cyclone cluster hotspots from the western North Pacific to the North Atlantic by modulating tropical cyclone frequency and synoptic-scale wave activity. Our probabilistic modelling indicates a tenfold increase in the likelihood of tropical cyclone cluster frequency in the North Atlantic, surpassing that in the western North Pacific, from 1.4 ± 0.4% to 14.3 ± 1.2% over the past 46 years.

Here the authors develop a solar-driven method for recovering ammonia from ammonium-containing wastewater, using a floatable amino-grafted MXene-based sponge. 
 Recovering ammonia (NH3) from ammonium (NH4+)-containing wastewater simultaneously achieves resource recovery and wastewater treatment. Given that NH3 recovery involves a reversible NH4+ hydrolysis reaction, traditional strategy requires alkaline reactants for promoting the reaction forward and energy-intensive heating for recovering NH3, resulting in substantial cost and energy consumption. Here we propose a solar-driven NH3 recovery strategy enabled by floatable amino-grafted (‒NH2) MXene (Ti3C2)-based sponge that possesses local alkaline environment and interfacial heat on water surface. Both H+ trapping via ‒NH2 groups and NH3 evaporating via interfacial solar heating thermodynamically facilitate efficient and sustainable NH3 recovery. Taking ammonia chloride (NH4Cl) wastewater for example, a NH3 recovery rate of 0.6 mol m−2 h−1 with a purity of 99.8% is obtained under 5 sun without extra reagents and energy consumption, and the recovered NH3 can be directly used as nitrogen fertilizer. Besides, the amino-grafted MXene-based sponge is also capable of being fully regenerated to its initial performance under 15 sun, and hydrochloric acid, a valuable by-product, can be obtained during this process. Life-cycle and techno-economic assessments highlight the advantages of solar-driven NH3 recovery in terms of environmental benefits and economic potential. Ammonia recovery from ammonium-containing wastewater not only promotes the circularity of nutrients but also prevents water pollution.

 The Tarim Basin, the largest inland arid basin in the world, is characterized by limited precipitation due to the blocking effect of surrounding mountain ranges. Glaciers in these mountains play a crucial role in regulating the region’s hydrological system. Significant spatial variability in glacier dynamics around the High Mountains Surrounding the Tarim Basin (HMTB) has been documented, with accelerated thinning in the north, moderate thinning in the west, and anomalous mass gain in the south before 2015. However, the temporal dynamics of glacier changes and regional contrasts in the HMTB remain poorly understood due to the scarcity of continuous and consistent observational data. This study investigates glacier changes in the HMTB during 2003–2023 using merged multi-mission satellite altimetry data (ICESat GLAH14, CryoSat-2 L2I, and ICESat-2 ATL06), processed with Seasonal-Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL) to extract long-term trends from seasonal signals. A comparison between 2003–2009 and 2018–2023 reveals a recent weakening of spatial heterogeneity, characterized by accelerated thinning in the southern and western HMTB (e.g., East Kunlun from −0.11 ± 0.04 m yr−1 to −0.22 ± 0.02 m yr−1; Pamir from −0.23 ± 0.05 m yr−1 to −0.35 ± 0.02 m yr−1), reduced elevation gains in “Karakoram Anomaly” regions (e.g., West Kunlun from +0.19 ± 0.02 m yr−1 to +0.06 ± 0.01 m yr−1), and decelerated thinning in the northern HMTB (e.g., East Tien Shan from −0.60 ± 0.06 m yr−1 to −0.52 ± 0.03 m yr−1). This decrease in spatial heterogeneity may drive by declining winter-spring snowfall and intensified summer warming in the south and west, coupled with a slowdown autumn warming and increased spring snowfall in the north. However, the coarse spatial resolution of CryoSat-2 limits the construction of a continuous glacier monitoring time series at finer grid scales, hindering further detailed analysis of small-scale dynamics.

 It remains uncertain whether and when rewetting of drained fen peatlands contributes to climate change mitigation by reducing carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Recolonization by emergent macrophytes is considered a key factor in this process. We present 5 years of carbon dioxide and methane emission data from a rewetted fen peatland in northeast Germany. Four automatic chambers were installed along a transect perpendicular to the shoreline of a lake formed after rewetting, capturing three stages of plant succession: open water (1), initial recolonization by emergent macrophytes (2), and a stable emergent macrophyte community (3). Net carbon dioxide fluxes decreased progressively throughout the successional stages, while methane emissions exhibited a wave-like pattern, with a pronounced short-term increase during stage 2. Excluding this emission peak can lead to considerable underestimation of net emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for all successional stages to accurately assess the climate effects of rewetting.

 Planktonic foraminifera are key contributors to the oceanic carbon cycle. In pelagic environments, carbonate production by planktonic biomineralizers regulates ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange and exports surface carbon to the deep ocean. Here we compare shell traits of three planktonic foraminifera species from the central Atlantic with a suite of environmental parameters to discern the factors underlying their variations. Our analysis revealed that calcification in foraminifera is associated with seawater density and depends on species habitat depth, whereas foraminifera bulk shell densities may serve as a seawater density proxy, regardless of species. We observe that their shell weights increased with habitat depth, enabling the living cells to adjust their overall density to match that of the surrounding liquid. This suggests that calcification in nonmotile organisms has a buoyancy regulatory function and will respond to the anthropogenically driven reductions in ocean density (oceanic rarefication), with potential consequences for the carbon cycle.

 The association between soil heterotrophic nitrification and plant nitrogen (N) uptake remains poorly understood. Here, we used 15N isotope tracing and numerical analysis to quantify the rate of ammonification (organic N to ammonium), heterotrophic nitrification (organic N to nitrate), and autotrophic nitrification (ammonium to nitrate) in soils, based on 104 lab observations across 11 plant species. Our results showed that plant cultivation stimulated heterotrophic nitrification while suppressing autotrophic nitrification, with effects varying by species and N preference. However, this stimulation disappeared rapidly after plant removal. Heterotrophic nitrification was strongly driven by labile substrates and positively associated with plant N uptake. In contrast, autotrophic nitrification, which was pH-driven, was negatively correlated with plant N uptake. Structural equation modeling further revealed that heterotrophic nitrification and ammonification promote total plant N acquisition. Plant-driven stimulation of heterotrophic nitrification demonstrates a critical mechanism by which plant-soil interactions regulate N cycling.

 River flow path relocation primarily driven by socioeconomic goals has rarely been considered its potential ecological benefits as a natural process-based restoration strategy. We therefore proposed an integrated numerical simulation framework to simulate multiple natural processes in a river-dominated delta driven by flow path relocation scenarios, demonstrated by the case study in the Yellow River Delta. We found that intertidal wetlands initially formed and evolved into supratidal wetlands over time, and vegetation habitats emerged as an across-shore distribution of tidal wetlands. Reusing the historical river channel of the Diaokou achieved the best ecological benefits by accelerating sediment deposition and mitigating coastal wetland loss. Our research highlights the need to combine natural process-based and pattern-based restoration strategies.

 The conversion of intrinsic lands to anthropogenic uses has increased nutrient inputs for lake microbes, profoundly influencing biogeochemical processes, particularly carbon cycling. Microbial carbon utilization is crucial in lake carbon sequestration, but its general changes under anthropogenic disturbances remain controversial. We combined carbon utilization assays with Biolog EcoPlates and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to examine microbial carbon utilization and carbon loss in lakes along a 3369 km gradient of land-use intensities spanning the Yangtze River and its front basin across China. Our results demonstrated that >30% land-use conversions from intrinsic to anthropogenic lands (farmland and built areas) resulted in >50% carbon loss in lakes. The large carbon loss was primarily driven by elevated nutrient concentrations, which stimulated microbial carbon utilization. Microbes in water were more responsive to environmental changes than those in sediment. We further identified distinct preferences of microbial carbon utilization driven by compositional shifts in core species. Specifically, nutrient-sensitive species (Roseomonas and Methylocystis) were replaced by nutrient-preferential species (Desertimonas and Clostridium sensu stricto), which collectively enhanced the utilization of substrates such as itaconic acid, phenylethyl-amine and glycerol, thereby accelerating carbon loss. This study quantifies the relationship between microbial carbon utilization and carbon loss, emphasizing the importance of regulating land-use changes and nutrient inputs to mitigate their impacts on lakes.

Here we analyzed 219,000 tree-ring widths from 4880 globe sites, encompassing 246 species, to investigate tree longevity patterns. Gymnosperms exhibited significantly greater average longevity (366 ± 240 years) than angiosperms (216 ± 81 years), with the oldest individual exceeded 3000 years. Globally, gymnosperm longevity was negatively correlated with precipitation. Arid-adapted trees exhibited significantly higher longevity, likely due to their conservative growth strategy, characterized by slow growth rates and enhanced drought resilience. Trees in harsh environments defined by high altitude, nutrient-poor soils, and minimal human impact were more likely to attain greater longevity.

 The Campi Flegrei caldera is a large volcanic complex, with a long history of volcanic activity, located beneath the metropolitan area of Naples, Italy. It is characterised by an intense hydrothermal activity, episodes of localised ground deformation and earthquake swarms. The ongoing unrest, which began in 2005, triggered by a degassing magma source and subsequent magmatic-hydrothermal interactions, reached an uplift of ~1.4 m. The seismicity increased exponentially, with maximum magnitudes of Md 4.4–4.6 in 2024–2025, the largest ever recorded.

 The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission carries on-board the first L-band radiometer launched in late 2009 to retrieve global-scale Soil Moisture (SM) and Vegetation Optical Depth (L-VOD). SMOS-IC version-2 is the latest retrieval algorithm of SMOS over the land surfaces, and it outperforms other existing SMOS retrieval algorithms. Research is underway to improve it by refining the surface roughness parameters, which significantly affect the retrieval performance of SM and L-VOD. This study presents a new version (Version 2.1) of SMOS-IC SM and L-VOD retrievals featuring novel calibrations of global soil roughness. First, SM and surface roughness (Hr) were retrieved over bare soils using the SMOS-IC algorithm. A Random Forest (RF) model was then trained on the retrieved Hr values based on soil (soil textural properties and soil temperature) and terrain data. The trained model was subsequently applied globally to estimate Hr across all land surfaces for improved soil roughness parameterization.The predicted Hr from the RF model demonstrated good correspondence with the retrieved Hr over bare soils (R2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.031). The observed dominant influence of soil properties, particularly soil organic content (SOC), indicated the impact of litter content on the modelling of Hr. The newly developed global Hr map of SMOS-IC V2.1 indicated a high spatial variability of Hr within each MODIS land cover type. Intercomparison using in-situ SM data from international soil moisture network revealed the improved performance of SMOS-IC V2.1 vs SMOS-IC V2 and CCI, with higher correlation R (R_SMV2.1 = 0.69, R_SMV2 = 0.67, and R_SMCCI = 0.62) and lower ubRMSE (ubRMSE_SMV2.1 = 0.056 m3/m3, ubRMSE_SMV2 = 0.060 m3/m3 and ubRMSE_SMCCI = 0.059 m3/m3). Moreover, the intercomparison with ECMWF-modelled SM as a reference dataset yielded improved performance of SMV2.1 over SMV2 in most regions of the globe, especially for ubRMSE. Triple collocation analysis evaluations also depicted that SMV2.1 outperformed SMV2 in 34.32 % of the evaluated pixels in terms of R and 49.85 % in terms of RMSE (m3/m3). In terms of L-VOD, the VODV2.1 product outperformed VODV2 showing: (i) improved spatial correlation with reference above-ground biomass products and (ii) improved temporal correlation with MODIS NDVI over low to moderate vegetated regions. The approach presented here offers a novel framework for calibrating global surface roughness in both current and future microwave remote sensing missions such as SMAP and Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR)."

 The presence of foliage tends to cause occlusion, reducing the capacity of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to capture the complete architecture of trees. While leaf-off conditions are typically preferred for detailed reconstruction of deciduous trees, evergreen coniferous trees common to boreal forests present a particular challenge. TLS often adopts a laser scanning technique where each emitted laser pulse is assigned a single return only, which can limit information retrieval through dense foliage. This study explores the advantages of using multi-return TLS, which records returns also beyond the first echo, for improved tree characterization. We hypothesize that this approach enhances the ability to characterize both stem and crown compared to the conventional single-return approach. Multi-return TLS data were acquired across 55 sample plots and 1974 trees using a Riegl VZ-400i scanner capable of recording up to eight returns per pulse. Two datasets were generated: one including all returns (‘multi-return’) and another including only the first or single returns (‘single-return’). Comparison of these datasets revealed that including points beyond the first returns increased the number of 3D observations by 48.4% on average (median 39.0%). Specifically, the stem point count increased by an average of 22.7% (13.1%), while the crown points count rose by 72.4% (60.1%). This improvement translated into enhanced tree characterization capacity, with an average increase of 6.5% (0.66 m for an average-sized tree) in the height of stem taper curve measurements, 1.5% (0.2 m2) in crown projection area, and 39.5% (8.5 m3) in voxelized crown volume. These enhancements were generally more pronounced in Norway spruce, while Scots pine and deciduous trees exhibited similar levels of improvement. These findings suggest that despite the rather small TLS laser footprint (beam diameter of 14 mm at a 20 m), adopting a multi-return approach significantly benefits boreal trees characterization and should be preferred in future TLS data acquisition campaigns."

Cook,Toward a near-lossless image compression strategy for the NASA/USGS Landsat Next mission,"•NASA’s Landsat Next mission will carry enhanced imaging instruments in the 2030s. •The greater data volume will necessitate near-lossless image compression. •The CCSDS 123.0-B-2 standard allows control over the added compression noise. •Testing on proxy datasets show added compression noise is within requirements. •Near-lossless compression expected to not impact Landsat Next image quality. 
 As orbiting Earth imaging platforms carry more complex and capable instruments, efficient methods are needed to reduce the time and cost associated with storing and downlinking greater volumes of image data. The upcoming NASA/USGS Landsat Next mission, with an increase in spatial and spectral resolution over previous Landsat missions, is no exception. Landsat Next will produce nearly six times the amount of image data per day over either of the current Landsat 8 or Landsat 9 observatories. Near-lossless compression, where the image after compression is not identical to the original image, allows for the efficient storage and transmission of all image data while meeting the mission’s global coverage, temporal revisit frequency, and science measurement and performance requirements. Although the Landsat user community is understandably cautious about lossy compression, it is possible to constrain the maximum loss, or error, introduced during compression, ensuring that any added error remains within the intrinsic noise level of the instrument. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems image compression standard, CCSDS 123.0-B-2, was chosen for the Landsat Next mission because it is an internationally supported standard suited for integration with space hardware, and it allows control over the magnitude and distribution of compression error. Using several proxy datasets as a surrogate for Landsat Next image data, an investigation was performed to determine a preliminary set of parameter values that would keep the added compression error within acceptable limits. The results of these studies demonstrate that near-lossless image compression can be utilized by the Landsat Next instruments to store and downlink all science data without compromising image quality or mission requirements."

 Long-term records from optical remote sensing are commonly used to monitor forest change but have limited capacity to measure the vertical distribution of tree canopy. This study integrated spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Lidar data with disturbance histories from Landsat time series and active fire detections from VIIRS and MODIS to assess changes in aboveground biomass density (AGBD) associated with fire and non-fire disturbance and forest canopy recovery. The study was conducted in four tropical forest zones in Ghana. We summarized changes and patterns of forest disturbances and their effects on AGBD. We then generated smoothed time series graphs of AGBD against time since the last event (forest loss, degradation, or canopy recovery) and compared them to AGBD in undisturbed forests in each zone. The results showed that biomass accumulation in tropical forests of Ghana was associated with their disturbance and recovery histories. Locations that experienced forest loss in the past had the lowest amounts of biomass and average biomass steadily increased along a continuum from loss to degradation to recovery to undisturbed across all four forest zones. Forest biomass did not increase within the first 16 years following the last degradation event. This suggests that degraded forests might be facing ongoing low-severity disturbances, which lead to further tree mortality and hinder regeneration and growth. Biomass was lower than in undisturbed forests even after canopy recovery was detected with Landsat, taking 5–16 years to reach pre-disturbance levels in the various zones. Our study demonstrates the utility of integrating optical remote sensing data with GEDI Lidar data to monitor these changes more comprehensively. Such information can aid in planning the sustainable use and effective rehabilitation of tropical forests in Ghana and similar tropical regions."

 Urban areas are typically located on anthropogenic soils that have been heavily modified or created by human activities. However, many cities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are exceptionally built directly on frozen ground. Therefore, geospatial analysis of frozen ground is indispensable for understanding the geographic environment of these cities. Existing research, however, is limited to mapping and predicting frozen ground distribution, lacking exploration of the direct and indirect driving factors that influence it. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates geovisualization, causal discovery, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Within this framework, we perform recursive decomposition modeling of XAI values based on causal relationships to quantitatively characterize both direct and indirect drivers of frozen ground distribution. Our findings reveal that climatic-geographic factors are the primary drivers of frozen ground. The 30.41 °N latitude watershed demarcates distinct frozen ground conditions, while thresholds of 2,662 m in elevation and 935.70 mm of precipitation define the nonlinear responses of frozen ground systems to altitudinal and hydrological gradients. We also found that human-environment interactions have limited influence on frozen ground. Transportation infrastructures, such as railways and highways, induce an Euclidean-distance distribution pattern on frozen ground. Localized disturbances of frozen ground are observed within approximately 1 km of major watersheds. These findings suggest the importance of accounting for frozen ground degradation patterns in infrastructure planning of urbanization on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau."

 The limited availability of training samples presents a major challenge in using remote sensing images for large-scale winter wheat mapping. Currently, several countries have published long-term land-cover products that offer dependable accuracy and comprehensive spatial distribution information of crops. Given that crops within similar latitudinal ranges exhibit analogous temporal growth patterns, we propose a Cross-Regional Sample Generation (CrossRS) method utilizing the Cropland Data Layer and time-series images. A three-step strategy is used to generate pure winter wheat samples. The first step involves applying the Random Forest algorithm to transfer the mapping rules from the source area to the target area while determining the probability similarity of each pixel in the target area to winter wheat in the source area. During this process, a winter wheat pixel pool is initially created by defining a probability interval. The second step involves extracting phenological information of crops during critical growth periods based on field samples gathered from the target area. This information is then used to further exclude other winter crop pixels from the winter wheat pixel pool. The third step involves applying a spatial filter to the winter wheat pixels to eliminate easily confused pixels near boundaries. In this study, we choose the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in China as the target area and Kansas in the United States as the source area. In comparison, the winter wheat map obtained using the CrossRS method significantly outperforms existing products in terms of accuracy and spatial detail."

 Ozone (O3) is a major photochemical pollutant that harms crops and reduces yields. While its impact on open-field crops is well-documented, research on O3 levels in agricultural greenhouses is limited. This study provides the first real-time measurements of O3 concentrations inside and outside a lettuce-growing tunnel greenhouse in Kunming, China, revealing an average indoor/outdoor (I/O) O3 ratio of 0.55 ± 0.15. We assessed Accumulated Ozone exposure over a Threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40) and relative yield losses (RYLs) for lettuce as an example, estimating the benefits of greenhouse cultivation across China. In ten major greenhouse farming regions, outdoor O3 levels consistently exceeded the AOT40 threshold, while indoor levels remained mostly below it. Over five lettuce growing seasons (1.5 months each) from March to October, with I/O ratios of 1.0, 0.70, 0.55, and 0.40, AOT40 values were 7.21 ± 2.71, 2.16 ± 1.15, 0.67 ± 0.46, and 0.03 ± 0.05 ppm h, respectively. Corresponding RYLs were −0.08 ± 0.03, −0.02 ± 0.01, −0.01 ± 0.00, and −0.00 ± 0.00. Greenhouses prevented a 6–8 % yield reduction by lowering internal O3 levels. This mitigation translated into an economic benefit of 4.9–6.5 billion USD, equivalent to 103.2–147.6 USD per person for China's 55 million greenhouse farmers in 2019, or 3.4–4.6 % of annual greenhouse vegetable production benefits, assuming planting lettuce. This single-crop approximation introduced merely 8.3 % ± 0.7 % overestimation versus Monte Carlo simulations with 17-crop combinations (2–16 species). Our findings show that greenhouses significantly reduce O3-induced crop damage and offer substantial economic advantages. With rising O3 levels and the rapid growth of facility agriculture globally, this study underscores the importance of adopting greenhouse cultivation practices."

 Anthropogenic dust is often enriched in heavy metals and limiting nutrients, exacerbating the consequences of dust deposition and human exposure to dust. Dust composition varies depending on the anthropogenic source activity, but questions remain about the seasonal and spatial variability of anthropogenic dust. At four sites along an urban-rural transect in central Ohio, US, we collected weekly dust samples and analyzed their geochemical composition and stable Pb isotopes. We focused our seasonal analysis on the rural site, and found that dust deposited in the summer and fall had the highest concentrations of metal pollutants. Our results across the land-use transect indicated a clear distinction in the geochemical and isotopic signatures of urban, suburban, and rural dust. Urban dust contained more Ca, Mg, Pb, and Sb, and had low 208Pb/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb values, while rural dust contained more P, K, Zn, and Sn, and had high 208Pb/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb values. Suburban dust had lower concentrations of crustal elements compared to dust collected at the urban and rural sites, where activities such as construction and agriculture likely enhanced the mineral dust fraction. Back-trajectory analyses supported the geochemical results, showing that dust sourced from developed land uses had an urban geochemical signature. Back-trajectories revealed that urban dust was more likely to be deposited at the rural sites when air masses traveled across the city. This study demonstrates the tight connection between land use and anthropogenic dust composition in a region like many around the globe where development is rapidly encroaching into farmland."

 The South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) exerts a profound influence on precipitation over Tibetan Plateau (TP), yet the impact of its recently advanced onset of the SASM (SASMO) on pre-monsoon TP precipitation remains unclear. Using observational, satellite, and reanalysis datasets, this study investigates how interannual variability in the SASMO affects May precipitation over the TP, based on moisture and dynamical budget analyses. Results show that the SASMO explains 45 % of interannual variability in May precipitation over the TP, with an advanced (delayed) onset corresponding to increased (decreased) precipitation. This relationship is linked to an anomalous Rossby wave train, characterized by an anticyclone over the western TP, a cyclone over the Indian subcontinent, and another cyclone over the eastern TP. These circulation patterns promote the northwestward expansion of the South Asian High and the intensification of the India-Burma trough in May. As a result, lower-level westerlies over the monsoon region during advanced SASMO years intensify to twice the climatological mean. Accordingly, net water vapor transport, moisture convergence, and ascending motion over the TP are enhanced by 123 %, 28 %, and 22 %, respectively, ultimately leading to a 14 % increase in May precipitation over the TP. Dynamic diagnostics indicate that vertical motion over the TP is primarily driven by vorticity advection processes. Moisture budget analysis suggests that the increase in May precipitation over the TP is dominated by dynamic processes induced by anomalous wind convergence associated with SASMO anomalies. These findings improve our understanding of the monsoon–precipitation relationship over the TP."

To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change."
10.1126/science.adt5354,True,Science,该研究论文利用35年的卫星数据，研究了北半球中纬度地区云顶相态（冰相或液相）与沙尘气溶胶之间的关系。研究发现，在-15°C至-30°C之间，沙尘气溶胶的浓度与云顶冰相频率（ITF）在时间和空间上都存在很强的相关性。进一步的研究表明，ITF对温度和沙尘的敏感性比率与液滴冻结的实验室测量结果一致，表明ITF可以归因于沙尘气溶胶。这项研究对于理解云的辐射强迫和降水过程具有重要意义，并且使用了卫星观测数据，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['cloud phase', 'ice formation', 'dust aerosol', 'satellite data', 'cloud-top temperature', 'radiative forcing', 'Northern Hemisphere']",D.

The cloud-top ice-to-total frequency (ITF) quantifies the occurrence of clouds with an ice top relative to total cloud occurrence, but the factors controlling ITF are poorly understood. Using 35 years of satellite data, we show that in the Northern Hemisphere, between −15° and −30°C, dust aerosol is strongly correlated with ITF in both time and space. Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol."

Although directed movement on the molecular scale has been achieved, using it to impose specific—especially energetically disfavored—shapes on molecules and construct mechanically interlocked structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules."

However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO2- ZrO2bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG."

Detecting behavioral drive in the fossil record is challenging because it is difficult to measure behaviors independently from corresponding morphologies. To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution."

We capitalized on electrically driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We placed gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultraconfined geometries."

In this study, we used a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrated the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities.

The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except that 18% of IAVI G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development; and elicited antibodies exhibited precise bnAb structural mimicry.
