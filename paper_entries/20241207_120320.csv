10.1088/1748-9326/ad928f,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了美国西部日益严重的野火与特定天气模式之间的关系。研究人员使用k-means聚类方法识别出五个天气状况，发现其中一种模式（WR-2）的频率自1980年以来有所增加，并且这种模式与野火天气指数（如蒸汽压差和加拿大森林火灾天气指数）的上升趋势密切相关。研究表明，WR-2模式的平均火灾指数在塑造野火天气指数上升趋势方面比其频率起着更重要的作用。人为因素导致的气候变化可能是通过调节天气模式和野火天气指数的行为，加剧了美国西部野火危险。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测和气象数据来分析野火天气模式及其与气候变化的关系，并涉及到空气质量监测和大气成分分析（例如蒸汽压差）。,"['Vapor Pressure Deficit', 'Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index', 'Satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'wildfire', 'climate change', 'weather pattern']",Wei Zhang;Simon S-Y Wang;Yoshimitsu Chikamoto;Robert Gillies;Matthew LaPlante;Vittal Hari,A weather pattern responsible for increasing wildfires in the western United States,"The western United States (U.S.) has been experiencing more severe wildfires, in part due to climate change, but the underlying synoptic patterns and their modulation in driving fire weather is unclear. Here we investigated the relationship between weather regimes (WRs) and fire weather indices, specifically vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index. By identifying five singular WRs using k-means clustering, we found that a particular regime (WR-2), one characterized by a distinct tripolar wave train pattern over the continental U.S., has exhibited an increased frequency since 1980. The ascribed WR-2 regime was found to be mainly responsible for rising trends in the fire weather indices, especially VPD. Further, the average fire indices of the WR-2 regime played a more important role than the frequency in shaping the rising trends in the fire weather indices. The increased frequency of the WR-2 WR was mainly attributed to anthropogenic forcing and, the year-to-year variation of the frequency was associated with sea surface temperature anomalies over the subtropical eastern Pacific. Human-induced climate change might have furthered the exacerbation of wildfire danger in the western U.S. by modulating the behaviors of WRs and fire weather indices."

However, current synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based methods face challenges related to extensive labeled training data, compromised classification accuracy, and limited applicability across different satellite systems and resolutions. In response to these challenges, our research introduces a pioneering unsupervised SAR-based flood mapping algorithm, inspired by artificial general intelligence principles. Notably, the innovative method demonstrates flexibility, performing effectively across various SAR satellites with differing resolutions and sensors, eliminating the need for satellite-specific algorithms. Our algorithm enhances processing speed and scalability by eliminating labor-intensive labeling of training data and manual intervention. To validate its performance, we conducted tests in three distinct regions using meter-level imagery from HISEA-1, Gaofen-3, and Sentinel-1 satellites. Consistently outperformed prevalent unsupervised techniques like Kmeans and Otsu, and even a Supervised-convolutional neural network segmentation algorithm by AI-Earth, with F1-scores exceeding 0.91. This outstanding performance showcases its accuracy, irrespective of the satellite systems or regions utilized. Furthermore, the seamless integration of our algorithm with high-performance cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine enhances its adaptability and scalability, enabling continuous monitoring of global floods. This is crucial in understanding flood trends, assessing their impacts, and formulating effective disaster mitigation strategies."

However, evidence for this proposed tipping is sparse and relies heavily on observations on short time scales from remote sensing data and space-for-time substitutions. Here we make use of an extensive pollen data set including 239 records of large lakes to investigate the existence of alternative stable forest cover states in the boreal forest and its adjacent biomes during the last 8000 years. By using a multimodality measure on time series of reconstructed tree cover we find very little multimodality in pollen data. To test whether this lack of multimodality is caused by limitations in the paleo data set we perform surrogate experiments. Surrogate data with alternative stable states based on the paleo vegetation–climate relationship were generated and significant multimodality was found more often than for the pollen-based tree cover (24.7% and 5.3% respectively). The response of tree cover to climate may, therefore, be more gradual and not as abrupt as would be expected from remote sensing analyses on stability. The apparent alternative stability hypothesized in the analyses of climate–vegetation relationships could be due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors and vegetation responses as an artifact of space-for-time substitutions. Even though current and upcoming shifts in the boreal forest are indisputable and a reason for strong concern, these changes could happen gradually without going through large-scale tipping between alternative stable states. To aid adaptation and conservation measures, more knowledge is needed about boreal forest drivers and their spatial heterogeneity."

Here, we use qualitative and quantitative content analysis to identify bias in AI chatbot characterizations of the issues, causes, consequences, and solutions to environmental challenges. By manually coding an original dataset of 1512 chatbot responses across multiple environmental challenges and chatbots, we identify a number of overlapping areas of bias. Most notably, chatbots are prone to proposing incremental solutions to environmental challenges that draw heavily on past experience and avoid more radical changes to existing economic, social, and political systems. We also find that chatbots are reluctant to assign accountability to investors and avoid associating environmental challenges with broader social justice issues. These findings present new dimensions of bias in AI and auger towards a more critical treatment of AI’s hidden environmental impacts."

While physics-driven approaches are able to dynamically simulate temporally and spatially varying compound flooding generated by multiple drivers with correlations between some of them, computational burdens limit their capability to explore the full range of conditions that contribute to compound coastal hazards. Data-driven statistical approaches address some of these computational challenges; however, they are also unable to explore all possible forcing combinations due to short observational records, and projections are typically limited to a few locations. This study proposes a hybrid statistical–dynamical framework for compound coastal flooding analysis that integrates a stochastic generator of compound flooding drivers, a hydrodynamic model, and machine learning-based surrogate models. The framework was demonstrated in San Francisco Bay (SF) over the past 500 years with accuracy similar to the physics-driven approach but with much higher computational efficiency. The stochastic generator of compound flooding drivers is developed by coupling a sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction model with a climate emulator, weather generator, and model of the hydrological and reservoir system. Using reconstructed SSTs as input, the generator of compound flooding drivers is employed to simulate time series of the forcing factors contributing to compound flooding (e.g. surge, waves, river discharge, etc) in SF Bay. A process-based hydrodynamic model is built to predict total water levels varying in time and space throughout SF Bay based on stochastically generated drivers. The machine learning-based surrogate models are then developed from a relatively small library (several hundred) of hydrodynamic model simulations to efficiently predict water levels for compound flooding analysis under the full range of stochastic drivers. This study contributes a hybrid statistical–dynamical framework to better understand the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of compound coastal-fluvial flooding, along with the relative contributions of drivers in complex nearshore, estuarine, and river environments for centennial timescales under past, present, and future climates."

By tracing water masses from the mixed layer into the deeper ocean in late winter, we identified the newly-subducted North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water (NPSTMW) and therefore investigated its temperature changes. The temperature of newly-subducted NPSTMW showed significant warming during 1981–1999, but the warming was suppressed during 1999–2017. The newly-subducted NPSTMW temperature generally agreed with the March–April mixed layer temperature in the subduction region, but was half a degree lower. A mixed layer heat budget analysis indicates that the suppressed warming was caused by the combination of reduced warming effects of shortwave radiation due to the deepened mixed layer, strengthening of sea surface latent heat loss due to the warmer sea surface and enhanced cooling effects of vertical entrainment due to the strengthened subsurface stratification in the subduction region. Our results imply that the oceanic response to global warming can exert a cooling effect on the newly-subducted NPSTMW through these three mechanisms.

A time-stratified, bidirectional case-crossover design was used to control for confounding by individual-level, long-term and cyclic weekly characteristics. We fitted conditional logistic regressions with an interaction term between PM2.5 and extreme temperature events to investigate the potential interactive effects on mortality. Ambient PM2.5 exposure has the greatest effect on mortality by all internal causes in the 2 d moving average exposure window.

Changes in crop yields can destabilize the global food system and pose challenges to food security. Moreover, crop production is crucial, as biofuels are becoming increasingly important contributors to climate change mitigation measures aimed at limiting global warming. This study uses the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment integrated assessment model framework to analyze different indicators related to food security and climate change mitigation under varying climate change impacts on crop yields. Twelve spatially explicit crop productivity projections were taken from the full archive of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison of 120 climate-crop model combinations, forced by CMIP6-based climate scenarios. The selection includes two average-performing climate-crop model combinations, two pessimistic combinations that perform one standard deviation below the mean, and two optimistic model combinations that perform one standard deviation above the mean. To single out the effect of climate change on productivity changes, we drew samples from two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). These productivity projections were applied within an otherwise uniform scenario (SSP2) and analyzed for their effect on total calorie demand, crop prices, and number of people at risk of undernourishment to quantify food security. Risks to climate change mitigation targets were explored by modeling the total bioenergy supply, emissions, and global mean temperature. The results revealed significant differences in the risk of food security and mitigation potential between different regions and climate change scenarios. Across scenarios, the crop area extent can vary up to 2 million km2 due to changing crop yields. The projected change in global hunger ranges from 60 to 160 million undernourished people, indicating uncertainty between climate and crop model combinations. Low-income regions are especially impacted because of their high sensitivity to changes in food prices. Global climate change mitigation ambitions can also deviate by the latter part of the 21st century, as changes in yields will impact biofuel production as well as agriculture, forestry and other land use emissions. The quantitative insights generated by this study highlight the need for global policy efforts to make the agricultural system more adaptive to climate change to handle potential negative impacts."

Chou,"On the atmospheric budget of 1,2-dichloroethane and its impact on stratospheric chlorine and ozone (2002–2020)","DCE (1,2-dichloroethane) is an industrial chemical used to produce PVC (polyvinyl chloride). We analysed DCE production data to estimate global DCE emissions (2002–2020). The emissions were included in an atmospheric model and evaluated by comparing simulated DCE to DCE measurements in the troposphere. We show that DCE contributes ozone-depleting Cl to the stratosphere and that this has increased with increasing DCE emissions. DCE’s impact on stratospheric O3 is currently small but non-zero. 
 The chemical compound 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), or ethylene dichloride, is an industrial very short-lived substance (VSLS) whose major use is as a feedstock in the production chain of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Like other chlorinated VSLSs, transport of DCE (and/or its atmospheric oxidation products) to the stratosphere could contribute to ozone depletion there. However, despite annual production volumes greatly exceeding those of more prominent VSLSs (e.g. dichloromethane), global DCE observations are sparse; thus, the magnitude and distribution of DCE emissions and trends in its atmospheric abundance are poorly known. In this study, we performed an exploratory analysis of the global DCE budget between 2002 and 2020. Combining bottom-up data on annual production and assumptions around fugitive losses during production and feedstock use, we assessed the DCE source strength required to reproduce atmospheric DCE observations. We show that the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model (CTM) reproduces DCE measurements from various aircraft missions well, including HIPPO (2009–2011), ATom (2016–2018), and KORUS-AQ (2016), along with surface measurements from Southeast Asia, when assuming a regionally varying production emission factor in the range of 0.5 %–1.5 %. Our findings imply substantial fugitive losses of DCE and/or substantial emissive applications (e.g. solvent use) that are poorly reported. We estimate that DCE's global source increased by ∼ 45 % between 2002 (349 ± 61 Gg yr−1) and 2020 (505 ± 90 Gg yr−1), with its contribution to stratospheric chlorine increasing from 8.2 (± 1.5) to ∼ 12.9 (± 2.4) ppt Cl (where ppt denotes parts per trillion) over this period. DCE's relatively short overall tropospheric lifetime (∼ 83 d) limits, although does not preclude, its transport to the stratosphere, and we show that its impact on ozone is small at present. Annually averaged, DCE is estimated to have decreased ozone in the lower stratosphere by up to several parts per billion (< 1 %) in 2020, although a larger effect in the springtime Southern Hemisphere polar lower stratosphere is apparent (decreases of up to ∼ 1.3 %). Given strong potential for growth in DCE production tied to demand for PVC, ongoing measurements would be of benefit to monitor potential future increases in its atmospheric abundance and its contribution to ozone depletion."
10.5194/amt-17-6875-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究的是利用G波段毫米波雷达改进云和降水微物理参数反演的方法。文章指出，与传统长波雷达相比，G波段雷达能够更准确、更频繁地反演垂直风速，并且能够反演低降水率和更小雨滴尺度的云特性。这主要得益于G波段雷达在较小雨滴尺度上米氏散射最小值的位置。通过与Ka波段或W波段雷达联合使用，G波段雷达能够提高液水含量和降水率的反演精度，尤其是在弱降水情况下，G波段雷达的衰减作用更为显著。研究结果表明，G波段雷达的应用提高了对云和降水微物理过程的观测能力，这对于改进云和降水参数化方案具有重要意义。总的来说，该研究属于大气环境遥感技术范畴，利用先进的雷达技术提高了对大气成分（云和降水）的观测能力。,"['cloud properties', 'precipitation', 'droplet size distribution', 'liquid water content', 'G-band radar', 'millimeter-wavelength radar', 'remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition', 'vertical wind speed']",Benjamin M. Courtier;Alessandro Battaglia;Kamil Mroz,Advantages of G-band radar in multi-frequency liquid-phase microphysical retrievals,"A new millimetre-wavelength radar is used to improve methods of retrieving information about the smallest droplets that exist within clouds. The radar is shown to be able to retrieve the vertical wind speed more accurately and more frequently and to retrieve the cloud properties for clouds with lower rainfall rates and smaller droplets than would be possible using longer-wavelength radars. 
 Radar-based microphysical retrievals of cloud and droplet properties are vital for informing model parameterisations of clouds and precipitation, but these retrievals often do not capture the details of small droplets in light rain or drizzle. A state-of-the-art G-band radar is used here to demonstrate improvements to microphysical retrievals in a case study featuring light rain. Compared to W-band radar, improvements are seen in the retrieval of vertical wind speed due to the location of Mie minima at smaller droplet sizes with the G-band radar. This, in turn, has an impact on the retrieval of the drop size distribution, allowing for better accuracy in the retrieval of the characteristic drop diameter and for improvements in the retrieval of the particle number concentrations of small droplet sizes. The dual-Doppler velocity (DDV) between the Ka- and G-bands shows increased dynamic range compared to the Ka–W pairing, particularly for instances presenting small characteristic drop diameters. The increased attenuation experienced at G-band enables improved retrievals of liquid water content and precipitation rate when paired with W-band or Ka-band compared to the W-band and Ka-band pairing. This is particularly noticeable in periods of light rain when the W-band and Ka-band radars receive negligible attenuation, while the attenuation at G-band is much greater."

Understanding and resolving these differences are critical for future analyses linking satellite, ground-based remote sensing, and in situ observations in air quality monitoring. It shows that the meteorological conditions (wind directions, speed, and boundary layer conditions) will strongly affect the agreement between the two measurements. 
 Ground-based remote sensing instruments have been widely used for atmospheric research,  but applications for air quality monitoring remain limited. Compared to an in situ instrument that provides air quality conditions at the ground level, most remote sensing instruments (nadir viewing) are sensitive to a broad range of altitudes, often providing only integrated column observations. These column data can be more difficult to interpret and to relate to surface values and hence to “nose-height-level” health factors. This research utilized ground-based remote sensing and in situ air quality observations in Canada's Athabasca oil sands region to investigate some of their differences.Vertical column densities (VCDs) of SO2 and NO2 retrieved by Pandora spectrometers located at the Oski-Otin site at Fort McKay (Alberta, Canada) from 2013–2019 were analyzed along with measurements of SO2 and NO2 surface concentrations and meteorological data. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations by a CIMEL sunphotometer were compared with surface PM2.5 data. The Oski-Otin site is surrounded by several large bitumen mining operations within the Athabasca oil sands region with significant NO2 emissions from the mining fleet. Two major bitumen upgraders that are 20 km south-east of the site have total SO2 and NO2 emissions of about 40 and 20 kt yr−1, respectively. It was demonstrated that remote sensing data from Pandora and CIMEL combined with high-vertical-resolution wind profiles can provide information about pollution sources and plume characteristics. Elevated SO2 VCDs were clearly observed for times with south and south-eastern winds, particularly at 200–300 m altitude (above ground level). High NO2 VCD values were observed from other directions (e.g., north-west) with less prominent impacts from 200–300 m winds. In situ ground observations of SO2 and NO2 show a different sensitivity to  wind profiles, indicating they are less sensitive to elevated plumes than remote sensing instruments. In addition to measured wind data and lidar-observed boundary layer height (BLH), modelled wind profiles and BLH from ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) have been used to further examine the correlation between column and surface observations. The results show that the height of emission sources (e.g., emissions from high stacks or near the surface) will determine the ratio of measured column and surface concentration values (i.e., could show positive or negative correlation with BLH). This effect will have an impact on the comparison between column observations (e.g., from the satellite or ground-based remote sensing instruments) with surface in situ measurements.This study explores differences between remote sensing and in situ instruments in terms of their vertical, horizontal, and temporal sampling differences. Understanding and resolving these differences are critical for future analyses linking satellite, ground-based remote sensing and in situ observations in air quality monitoring and research."

Our work developed the models by the hybrid scheme that integrates machine learning and spatial kriging for reconstructing the product of all-sky hourly estimates of surface air temperature for global land areas. The models for the product were fully validated and analyzed. The scheme for generating the product has the general practicability of applications. 
 Spatially continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is critically important for a wide range of fields such as eco-environmental assessments and hydrology. Remotely sensed estimation models based on satellite-derived thermal infrared data provides a structurally different approach for reconstructing SAT compared to spatial interpolation of ground observations of SAT and numerical modelling, which are mainly limited by the coverage of stations and coarse spatial resolutions, respectively. However, the data products of remotely sensed estimates of SAT developed in previous studies are only available at daily or monthly resolutions, and are primarily restricted for local regions. In this study, we generated the first hourly dataset (GHRSAT) of all-sky remotely sensed SAT estimates for the global land areas except Antarctica between 2011 and 2023. The hourly estimates in GHRSAT were reconstructed from land surface temperature using the hybrid estimation models that integrate random forest (RK) models and kriging techniques. The hybrid models were developed for different regions on a monthly basis. We adopted ordinary kriging (OK) and fixed rank kriging (FRK) in the modelling of the site residuals from the RF models for regions with low-density and high-density stations, respectively. Our results show that the hybrid models for generating GHRSAT have the predictive performance between 1.48 °C to 2.28 °C in overall cross-validation RMSE. The mean RMSE for estimating hourly SAT can be significantly reduced by 0.18–0.41 °C by the hybrid models compared to the RF models. We analyzed the variability in the predictive errors of estimating hourly SAT across regions, months and sites. The variability is apparently decreased when using the hybrid models. We found that the RF models are less sensitive to the parameter tuning of the RF models, which greatly impacts the hybrid models. Improving the RF models by parameter tuning can drastically improve the hybrid models based on the RF models. Additionally, we found the performance difference between OK and FRK in developing the hybrid models for regions with large amounts of stations is slight with the mean RMSE of 0.05 °C. In summary, the scheme of the hybrid models can result in satisfactorily higher performance for estimating SAT, and has the general practicability of applying to regions at various scales. The GHRSAT dataset is publicly available at http://doi.org/10.11888/RemoteSen.tpdc.301540 (Zhang, 2024)."

The model reproduced the temporal variation in and spatial distributions of electricity consumption and temperature well in summer and winter. The partial air conditioning was the most critical factor, significantly affecting the value of anthropogenic heat emission. 
 We propose a simple dynamic anthropogenic heat (QF) parameterisation for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM). The SLUCM is a remarkable physically based urban canopy model that is widely used. However, a limitation of SLUCM is that it considers a statistically based diurnal pattern of QF. Consequently, QF is not affected by outdoor temperature changes, and the diurnal pattern of QF is constant throughout the simulation period. To address these limitations, based on the concept of a building-energy model (BEM), which has been officially introduced in WRF, we propose a parameterisation to dynamically and simply simulate QF from buildings (QFB) through a physically based calculation of the indoor heat load and input parameters for BEM and SLUCM. This method allows users to simulate the dynamic QF and the electricity consumption (EC) as the outdoor temperature, building insulation, and heating and air conditioning (HAC) performance change. This is achieved via the simple selection of certain QF options among the urban parameters of WRF. The new parameterisation, SLUCM+BEM, was shown to simulate temporal variations in QFB and EC for HAC (ECHAC) and broadly reproduce the ECHAC estimates of more sophisticated BEM and ECHAC observations in the world's largest metropolis, Tokyo."

In this study, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was chosen as a proxy for marine surfactants to investigate its impact on aqueous nitrate photolysis for the first time. Remarkable increases in HONO and NO2 production rates by factors of 3.3 and 5.6, respectively, along with a 1.9-fold rise in NO2– concentration, were observed at a very low SDS concentration of 0.01 mM, strongly illustrating the promoting effect on nitrate photolysis. Furthermore, at an SDS concentration of 2 mM, intriguingly aligned with the critical micelle concentration, there was an additional 41.7% increase in HONO production rates. Vertically resolved Raman measurements indicated that SDS anions at the aqueous-air interface attracted NO3– closer to the aqueous surfaces, increasing the amount of incompletely solvated surface nitrate. Importantly, the anionic surfactant exhibited a greater promoting effect on HONO production compared to other typical nitrate photochemistry systems with the addition of a marine dissolved organic matter proxy, halogen, photosensitizer, or OH scavenger. These findings offer new insights into marine-derived HONO sources and should be considered in model simulations concerning the budgets of NOx, OH, and O3."

The direct photolysis of pollutants is regraded to be their major removal mechanism by a sole UV222 treatment. However, this paper reports the important roles of reactive oxidative species (ROS) generated from dioxygen and water under only UV222 radiation. Multiple ROSs are identified, including hydroxyl radical (HO·), singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical anion (·O2–), and ozone (O3). HO· is the major ROS for the degradation of 18 organic micropollutants under UV222 radiation, with an observed quantum yield of 0.447 and the concentration of 10–13 M at pH 7. Dioxygen is the initial source of ROS, while water mainly serves as a medium to react with the photolytic intermediate of O3 (i.e., O(1D)) to form HO·. Water matrix components of HCO3– and natural organic matter can inhibit the HO· concentration, whereas NO3– significantly enhances it. In drinking water, UV222 alone removes 18 micropollutants more efficiently than the typical UV254/H2O2 AOP (150 μM), with reduced energy consumption.

In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning model to analyze the HONO budget using two years of summer urban supersite observations. By integrating chemical mechanisms and feature engineering into our machine learning model, we assessed the contributions of different sources to HONO and inferred the kinetic parameters for the primary HONO formation pathways, thereby partially addressing the limitations associated with predetermined rate coefficients. Our findings revealed that the primary source of daytime HONO in the summer was the photolysis of nitric acid adsorbed on both aerosol and ground surfaces, accounting for over 40% of its unknown sources. This was followed by the photoenhanced heterogeneous conversion of NO2 and the photolysis of particulate nitrate.

Interestingly, Fe(III)-assisted strain ES2–1 consolidated the opening of rings A and B in E2 by reinforcing the expression of estO1 and estN1 genes, consequently enhancing E2 metabolism. Compared to Fe(III) starvation, the biodegradation half-life of E2 was sharply reduced from 1.35 to 0.59 d after Fe(III) supplementation. Simultaneously, the transcription of estO1 and estN1 genes increased clearly from 4.3 to 47.5 times and 6.6 to 246.8 times after Fe(III) induction, respectively, accompanied by remarkable improvement in the abundance of ring-A/B cleavage products and their pyridine derivatives.

Smoke composition, aerosol liquid water content, effective density (ρeff), and other properties can change significantly as smoke travels through areas under different ambient conditions and over time. During this study, we measured changes in smoke composition and physical properties due to oxidative aging and exposure to humidity. We found that smoke aging led to SOA formation and increases in ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon. Aerosol liquid water content increased with increasing relative humidity (RH), and aged smoke took up more water than fresh smoke at all humidity levels, likely due to a combination of changes in aerosol surface polarity at low and medium RH and increases in surface area with aging at high RH. Growth factors ranged from 1.06 ± 0.08 for fresh smoke at low RH to 1.32 ± 0.08 for aged smoke at high RH. Oxidative aging and exposure to humidity led to increases in ρeff. For 100 nm particles, ρeff ranged from ∼1.2 for fresh smoke at low RH to ∼1.6 for aged smoke at high RH.

The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Here we investigate this transition by monitoring the slip displacement of clayey soil during fluid‐injection creep experiments. This transition is discontinuous in the first run but becomes continuous in the initially pre‐sheared sample. Using a regularized rate‐and‐state friction model, we explicitly examine the relationship between the exponent and the frictional properties of the soil. This model describes the dynamic transition, with the exponent evolving from 1 to 2 across a broad range of frictional parameters. Furthermore, by incorporating idealized shear localization processes, the model qualitatively reproduces the shear‐history‐dependent transition. Our study demonstrates that a combination of structural evolutions and frictional properties may explain slow and fast slips observed in various shear systems."

This study offers the first field‐based quantitative assessments of fault damage zones along the surface rupture generated by the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in China over eight profiles with 254 outcrops. The width and mean tectonic fracture intensity of the damage zones exhibit pronounced variations along the fault strike. We introduce the damage index as a proxy to quantify the extent of pre‐existing damage. We find a statistically significant anti‐correlation between the damage index and coseismic on‐fault slip. We thus infer that pre‐existing off‐fault damage plays a significant role in dissipating rupture energy, thereby reducing coseismic on‐fault slip.

We assess the extrapolation capabilities of a deterministic Convolutional Neural Network baseline and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with this baseline, trained to predict daily precipitation simulated by a Regional Climate Model (RCM) over New Zealand. Both approaches emulate future changes in annual mean precipitation well, when trained on historical data, though training on a future climate improves performance. For extreme precipitation (99.5th percentile), RCM simulations predict a robust end‐of‐century increase with future warming (∼5.8%/° $\mathit{{}^{\circ}}$C on average from five simulations). When trained on a future climate, GANs capture 97% of the warming‐driven increase in extreme precipitation compared to 65% in a deterministic baseline.

The focus is on an in‐depth understanding of the atmospheric dynamical processes that influence the HC subsiding edge. Two sets of experiments were performed: one utilizing the default OSA, and the other employing the comprehensive OSA that accounts for realistic physical mechanisms. The results show that implementing the comprehensive OSA simulates an El Niño‐like warming pattern in reference to the default experiment, which leads to an HC contraction. Examination of zonal mean momentum dynamics in the upper troposphere reveals that variations in meridional winds, crucial for determining the HC extent, are primarily driven by the differences in the horizontal eddy momentum flux derivative. The findings indicate that the equatorward shift in meridional temperature gradients enhances subtropical zonal winds and baroclinicity along their equatorial flanks, amplifying equatorward‐propagating Rossby waves. This, in turn, alters the eddy momentum flux, reshaping the pattern of the derivatives of horizontal eddy momentum flux, constraining meridional winds, and resulting in the equatorward movement of the HC subsiding edge. A scaling theory further supports the results of the HC contraction, showing that the increased subtropical zonal winds and the equatorward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) elevate the atmospheric angular momentum and eventually limit the expansion of the HC."

These maps show the spatial distribution of earthquake magnitude required to reach a specific level of nuisance and damage, considering human exposure and surficial geological conditions. We rely on population distribution for the human exposure factor while utilizing Vs30 derived from surficial geological modeling to approximate site amplification effects. By including the trailing seismicity factor, the iso‐nuisance and iso‐damage maps provide the base for the Magnitude Threshold for Acceptable Seismicity maps, which can set a guideline for the upper magnitude boundary, or largest magnitude event permissible, related to industrial activities causing seismicity. The trailing seismicity factor refers to the subsequent seismicity after a substantial change or end of the seismogenic operations; for instance, the cessation of seismogenic hydraulic fracturing activities under a traffic light protocol after a magnitude threshold event (red‐light event). Considering variations in the trailing seismicity factor, we derive different Magnitude Threshold for Acceptable Seismicity maps for various injection‐induced activities, including hydraulic fracturing and fluid disposal activities. Extended versions of the Magnitude Threshold for Acceptable Seismicity maps could allow for safety factors pertinent to critical infrastructure in a particular area, incorporating other factors beyond the population distribution and warranting a different tolerance level. These maps help to define the magnitude threshold from induced seismicity, maintaining the same tolerance levels throughout a region.

Some of the latest‐generation models have high effective climate sensitivities (EffCS). It has been argued these “hot” models are unrealistic and should therefore be excluded from analyses of climate change impacts. Whether this would improve regional impact assessments, or make them worse, is unclear. Here we show there is no universal relationship between EffCS and projected changes in a number of important climatic drivers of regional impacts. Analyzing heavy rainfall events, meteorological drought, and fire weather in different regions, we find little or no significant correlation with EffCS for most regions and climatic drivers. Even when a correlation is found, internal variability and processes unrelated to EffCS have similar effects on projected changes in the climatic drivers as EffCS.

Assessments that quantify these aspects of future hazards are critical for adaptation planning under a changing climate and can reveal new insights into the drivers of coastal hazards. In particular, probabilistic simulations of future hazard impacts can improve these assessments by explicitly quantifying uncertainty and by better simulating dependence structures between the complex multivariate drivers of hazards. In this study, a regional‐scale probabilistic assessment of climate change induced coastal hazards is conducted for the Cascadia region (Northern Washington to Northern California), USA during the 21st century. Three co‐produced hazard proxies for beach safety, erosion, and flooding are quantified to identify areas of high hazard impacts and determine hazard uncertainty under three sea‐level rise scenarios. A novel chronic coastal hazard hotspot indicator is introduced that identifies areas that may experience significant increases in hazard impacts compared to present day conditions. We find that beaches near the California‐Oregon border and in Northern Washington have larger hazard impacts and hazard uncertainty due to their morphologic setting. Erosional hazards, relative to beach safety and coastal flooding, will increase the most in Cascadia during the 21st century under all sea‐level rise scenarios.

 The generation of plausible crystal structures is often the first step in predicting the structure and properties of a material from its chemical composition. However, most current methods for crystal structure prediction are computationally expensive, slowing the pace of innovation. Seeding structure prediction algorithms with quality generated candidates can overcome a major bottleneck.

Trained on millions of CIF files, CrystaLLM focuses on modeling crystal structures through text. CrystaLLM can produce plausible crystal structures for a wide range of inorganic compounds unseen in training, as demonstrated by ab initio simulations. Our approach challenges conventional representations of crystals, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs for learning effective models of crystal chemistry, which will lead to accelerated discovery and innovation in materials science.

 Cellular target engagement technologies enable quantification of intracellular drug binding; however, simultaneous assessment of drug-associated phenotypes has proven challenging. Here, we present cellular target engagement by accumulation of mutant as a platform that can concomitantly evaluate drug-target interactions and phenotypic responses using conditionally stabilized drug biosensors. We observe that drug-responsive proteotypes are prevalent among reported mutants of known drug targets. Compatible mutants appear to follow structural and biophysical logic that permits intra-protein and paralogous expansion of the biosensor pool. We then apply our method to uncouple target engagement from divergent cellular activities of MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) inhibitors, dissect Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15)-associated thiopurine metabolism with the R139C pharmacogenetic variant, and profile the dynamics of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP1/2) binding and DNA trapping by PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Further, PARP1-derived biosensors facilitated high-throughput screening for PARP1 binders, as well as multimodal ex vivo analysis and non-invasive tracking of PARPi binding in live animals. This approach can facilitate holistic assessment of drug-target engagement by bridging drug binding events and their biological consequences.

10.1038/s41467-024-54903-w,False,Nature Communications,这篇论文研究了大西洋经向翻转环流(AMOC)的减弱情况。文章指出，尽管自20世纪80年代中期以来，人为因素导致的AMOC减弱已经开始，但在21世纪10年代初期以来，自然和人为信号之间的相互作用导致AMOC减弱几乎停滞。研究利用多种气候和表面强迫海洋模型模拟以及直接观测数据，分析了历史AMOC的年代际变化中人为和自然信号的贡献。结果表明，2000年代AMOC大幅减弱，这主要由人为强迫引起，并可能受到自然变率的影响。然而，自21世纪10年代初期以来，由于北大西洋涛动增强，AMOC的自然分量显著增强，抵消了人为减弱信号，导致AMOC减弱几乎停滞。进一步分析表明，未来几年自然和人为信号之间的相互作用可能持续存在。总的来说，该研究关注的是海洋环流变化，而非大气环境遥感技术。,"['Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)', 'ocean circulation', 'climate models', 'ocean model simulations', 'natural variability', 'anthropogenic forcing', 'North Atlantic Oscillation']",Sang-Ki Lee;Dongmin Kim;Fabian A.

However, a tug-of-war between the natural and anthropogenic signals led to a near stalling of the weakening since the early 2010s. 
 The current state-of-the-art climate models when combined together suggest that the anthropogenic weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has already begun since the mid-1980s. However, continuous direct observational records during the past two decades have shown remarkable resilience of the AMOC. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, here we attempt to attribute the interdecadal variation of the historical AMOC to the anthropogenic and natural signals, by analyzing multiple climate and surface-forced ocean model simulations together with direct observational data. Our analysis suggests that an extensive weakening of the AMOC occurred in the 2000s, as evident from the surface-forced ocean model simulations, and was primarily driven by anthropogenic forcing and possibly augmented by natural variability. However, since the early 2010s, the natural component of the AMOC has greatly strengthened due to the development of a strong positive North Atlantic Oscillation. The enhanced natural AMOC signal in turn acted to oppose the anthropogenic weakening signal, leading to a near stalling of the AMOC weakening. Further analysis suggests that the tug-of-war between the natural and anthropogenic signals will likely continue in the next several years.

 Groundwater systems play a pivotal role in ensuring food and water security while maintaining vital ecosystem functions. The depletion of numerous global aquifers, however, raises concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and environmental flows. Despite efforts to mitigate this decline, there remains a striking gap in proving the effectiveness of these measures. Our research focuses on the karstic Edwards Aquifer system in Texas to assess how effectively current mitigation strategies are protecting groundwater levels and spring flows, which are essential for biodiversity and water security. Using counterfactual artificial intelligence, we address the critical question: ‘What would have happened and may happen in the absence of the mitigation measures?’. This approach offers deep insights into both historical impacts and future projections under intermediate- and high-emission climate scenarios. By simulating what might have happened and could happen in the future without these mitigation measures, our approach provides a robust analysis of the real-world benefits of groundwater management strategies, highlighting their role in enhancing climate resilience and ensuring the sustainability of aquifers.

In the Cerrado biome, clearing of native vegetation has led to shortfalls of staple crops due to a delayed agricultural rainy season. 
 Deforestation not only contributes to global warming but also induces changes in the regional climates that impact agriculture. Here, we analyse the effects of deforestation-induced climate change on the soy–maize double cropping of the Cerrado biome. Since the 1980s, there has been an average delay of 36 days in the start of the agricultural rainy season, a 36.7% reduction in total rainfall over the period and a 1.5 °C rise in the temperature in the biome. Of the 8.1 million ha of soy–maize double cropping, 99% experienced delays in the agricultural rainy season and 61% faced reduced rainfall. Those changes have contributed to more frequent and severe soybean and maize crop shortfalls. Delays in the onset of the agricultural rainy season, reductions in rainfall and increases in maximum air temperatures occur more frequently in areas with extensive native vegetation loss. To sustain agricultural productivity in the Cerrado, it is crucial to conserve and restore its native vegetation. Deforestation has the potential to alter regional precipitation cycles.

However, there is not yet enough understanding of the future extreme climate challenges at global natural world heritage sites.

 Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments capture the daily crustal 3D deformation responding elastically to terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations, providing a powerful tool for hydrological studies. Here, we further expand the application of GPS in flood potential assessment. GPS vertical and horizontal crustal deformation are inverted into TWS variations using a 3D-Inversion model, and then a novel GPS-based modified flood potential index (GMFPI) is developed to assess and attribute the spatiotemporal patterns of flood potential in Brazil. The 3D-Inversion-derived TWS estimates show more spatial details compared to those derived from vertical deformation (1D-Inversion), with annual water thickness amplitudes of about 900 mm in the middle Amazon River, which is consistent with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Mascon solutions but is greater than the 1D-Inversion estimates. The comparison between in-situ discharge data and GMFPI indicates that GMFPI performs well in monitoring flood potential, showing Accuracy (ACC) values greater than 0.8 at basin scales. In four reported flood events, the spatial patterns of GMFPI and discharge show that the locations of those floods are accurately characterized by GMFPI. The attribution analysis of flood dynamics shows that precipitation in coastal regions can rapidly increase flood potential, while a large amount of precipitation in inland regions first replenishes unsaturated soil water and groundwater. Additionally, the daily GMFPI exhibits good consistency with daily discharge, demonstrating a capacity for monitoring floods at a sub-monthly scale. Our study highlights the improvement of 3D-Inversion to TWS estimates and the novel application of GPS in flood potential assessing with high spatiotemporal resolution, providing valuable insights for flood early warning and prevention."

 Vegetation carbon sequestration is a fundamental process that supports ecosystem biodiversity and ecological services. It is a key factor in shaping ecosystem state and energy flow. Global climate change has intensified in recent years. Frequent drought events affect the stabilization of carbon cycle. In this study, we used correlation analysis method to explore the relationship between standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and gross primary productivity (GPP). Our study found that the global drought degree is decreasing, and drought sensitivity of global surface vegetation decreased. The drought index value increased 91.3% and the sensitivity decreased 35.71% during the 2010–2020 period (P2) compared to the 2000–2010 period (P1). Our study also found that the global area of drought decreased by 4.03% in P2, but the global area with high drought frequency increased by 0.21%. The drought response time scale shortened by 5.19%. GPP showed an increasing trend, with the largest increase in agricultural land.

10.1016/j.jag.2024.104298,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文提出了一种名为准HSL的方法，用于估算植被生态系统中阳光照射和阴影部分的分数覆盖率。该方法利用近红外、绿光和红光波段，避免了受大气影响较大的蓝光波段，通过计算色相、饱和度和亮度，构建了三角空间模型来估算不同组分的覆盖率。研究使用了无人机数据对该方法进行了验证，结果表明该方法能够有效地区分阳光照射和阴影下的绿色和非绿色植被，并能准确估算植被覆盖率。该研究主要关注植被生态系统中不同组分的覆盖率估算，与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,"['vegetated ecosystem', 'fractional cover', 'sunlit and shaded components', 'remote sensing', 'satellite imagery', 'unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)']",Jia Tian;Qingjiu Tian;Suju Li;Qianjing Li;Sen Zhang;Shuang He,Quasi-HSL color space and its application: Sunlit and shaded component fractional cover estimation in vegetated ecosystem,"•Quasi-HSL method is proposed for shadow fractional cover estimation in vegetated area. •The qHSL uses green, red, and NIR without blue band, decreasing atmospheric influence. •Two indices, HLI and SLI, are proposed based on hue, saturation, and lightness. •Fractional cover is estimated on a S2 MSI image and validated with UAV data. 
 Sunlit and shaded components are commonly present in both airborne and satellite remote sensing images. In vegetated ecosystems, shaded component often result from sunlight being obstructed by topographic relief or canopy structures, and shaded component may impact plant growth, leaf photosynthesis, and ultimately carbon sequestration. To accurately estimate the fractional cover of the shaded and sunlit components, including both green and non-green vegetation within vegetated ecosystems, a novel method called the quasi-Hue-Saturation-Lightness (quasi-HSL) method is proposed in this study. Inspired by the RGB to HSL conversion, this method utilizes near-infrared, green, and red bands to compute hue (and normalized hue), saturation, and lightness. Subsequently, two indices, namely Hue-Lightness Index (HLI) and Saturation-Lightness Index (SLI), are introduced to construct a triangular space for estimating the fractional cover of the three components. Through unmanned aerial vehicle field experiments conducted in two forested areas, the accuracy of fractional cover estimation for three components reaches an R2 value of 0.50–0.67. Furthermore, this fractional cover estimation approach can be extended to a four-component estimation, including sunlit green vegetation, sunlit non-green vegetation, shaded green vegetation, and shaded non-green vegetation. With this detailed fractional cover estimation in vegetated area, the fractional vegetation coverage can be retrieved. Cross-validated with the fractional vegetation coverage retrieved by NDVI, the accuracy reaches R2 = 0.92. The advantages of the proposed method are (1) estimating fractional cover of shaded component without blue band, which is easily impacted by atmospheric conditions and sensor performance, and (2) differentiating the sunlit green and non-green vegetation components in the vegetated ecosystem."
10.1016/j.jag.2024.104305,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文主要研究气候变化对中国东北地区土壤侵蚀时空动态的影响。它利用修正的通用土壤流失方程 (RUSLE) 和深度学习模型，结合遥感技术和未来气候情景，模拟了1980年至2020年期间土壤侵蚀的历史变化，并预测了未来不同气候情景下的土壤侵蚀趋势。研究发现，短期气候变化比长期气候变化更能准确模拟土壤侵蚀；土壤侵蚀随降水量增加而增加，而与温度关系不大；深度学习模型可以模拟土壤侵蚀的时空变化；中国东北地区的土壤侵蚀有随着气候恶化而加剧的趋势。虽然研究用到了遥感技术，但这主要用于获取土地利用、土壤类型等数据，并非直接针对大气环境遥感，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测大气成分等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['precipitation', 'temperature', 'climate change', 'soil erosion', 'remote sensing', 'deep learning', 'spatial and temporal variations']",Ziwei Liu;Mingchang Wang;Xingnan Liu;Xiaoyue Lyu;Minshui Wang;Fengyan Wang;Xue Ji;Xiaoyan Li,Spatiotemporal simulation and projection of soil erosion as affected by climate change in Northeast China,"•Short-term climate change can accurately simulate soil erosion than long-term change. •Soil erosion increases with precipitation while temperature did not. •Deep learning models can simulate spatial and temporal variations in soil erosion. •Soil erosion in northeastern China has a tendency to increase with deterioration of climate. 
 Long-term climate change significantly affects the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil erosion. To explore this, remote sensing technology, future climate scenarios, and deep learning are combined to model the historical and future variations in soil erosion, investigating its spatiotemporal dynamics influenced by climate change. This paper uses the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to assess the historical changes in erosion in northeast China from 1980 to 2020. A soil erosion simulation (SES) model was developed, incorporating deep learning models, to forecast future trends in soil erosion under various climate scenarios. The SES model achieves an R-squared (R2) value of 0.7513. The SES model can simulate the Spatiotemporal dynamics of soil erosion influenced by long-term climate change. Soil erosion from 2001 to 2020 is lower than that from 1980 to 2000, indicating a decrease in soil erosion under natural variability conditions. Unlike historical trends, future soil erosion demonstrates significant variation across three scenarios: SSP1-RCP1.9 (SSP119), SSP2-RCP4.5 (SSP245), and SSP5-RCP8.5 (SSP585). The simulation results show that the SSP119 climate scenario has a minor impact on soil erosion, whereas the SSP245 scenario leads to a gradual increase in soil erosion. The SSP585 scenario, characterized by high social vulnerability and substantial radiative forcing, exacerbates the risk of soil erosion. The study provides valuable references for maintaining soil stability and managing surface runoff."

 Mineral aerosols are one of the most important ice nucleating particles (INPs) because their efficiency in nucleating ice, wide transport and largest mass contribution to particulate matter in the atmosphere. They are sourced from the arid regions of the world. In this context, this work evaluates the INP potential of fourteen topsoil samples collected from subtropical South American deserts, the major source of mineral aerosols in South America, in the immersion freezing mode. Samples were obtained from three distinct regions located in the South American Arid Diagonal and recognized as potential dust source areas: the Puna-Altiplano Plateau in the north, the central-west of Argentina, and Patagonia in the south. In general, results reveal that samples from the Puna-Altiplano and Patagonia regions, and the central-west of Argentina region exhibit the highest and lowest INP abilities, respectively. The active sites per unit surface area for a given temperature were calculated and compared with previously reported values. The results demonstrate that soil mineral particles from the region of study exhibit ice nucleating abilities comparable to the inorganic fraction of agricultural soils of central Argentina. No direct relationship was identified between INP ability and the major minerals observed in the samples. This study is the first to analyze the ice nucleation properties of soil samples collected along the South American Arid Diagonal and one of the few in South America. Since the analyzed topsoil particles were collected from potential dust source regions, this work contributes to understanding the role of aerosols in initiating atmospheric ice formation, providing valuable data for empirical parameterizations. This could contribute to the improvement in the performance of climate models, as the obtained results suggest that the underestimation of coarse and super-coarse aerosols at altitudes relevant for cloud formation may lead to underestimations in INP concentrations, particularly in regions near to the emission sources."

 Snowfall plays a crucial role in the mountainous cryosphere cycle and is significantly influenced by climate change. This study utilizes the global climate models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) with multivariate bias correction (MBC) to explore potential future variations in snowfall and its elevation dependency across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Findings indicate a consistent decline in annual snowfall across the majority of the TP by the end of the century, except for certain high-elevation regions in the northwest. The decreasing trend is projected to intensify with strengthen Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and exhibits elevation dependency below 5000 m. Specifically, under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, snowfall over the TP is expected to decrease by 39.74 % in the far future (2071–2100), with the elevation zone below 2000 m experiencing the most intense decline of approximately 62 %. This trend is largely attributed to the significant warming, which reduces the snow fraction as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow. This shift is evidenced by the identification of turning points in snow fraction in the mid-2040s to 2050s, coinciding with rapid temperature increases. Furthermore, substantial decreases in future (heavy) snowfall days contribute to the overall reduction in snowfall. However, complex interplay between increased precipitation and temperature effects results in a slight increase in snowfall over high elevation areas in the northern edge. Uncertainty analysis indicates model uncertainty as the dominant source in snowfall projections, accounting for over 50 % of total variance. The projected declines in snowfall and snow fraction, as well as shortened snowfall days could considerably impact the cryosphere, hydrological and ecological systems of the TP."

 Aerosols hygroscopicity and CCN activity in coastal area is influenced by continental-marine air interaction, probably exerting a profound climate effect. In this study, combining field measurement at a coastal site in Shenzhen with a back trajectory model, we have identified an externally-mixed sea salt mode in accumulated particles, where the hygroscopic parameter (κ) ranges from 0.97 to 1.14. The sea salt mode, however, was not observed for ultrafine particles in nucleation/Aitken modes. Nonetheless, the.hygroscopicity of the particles across all sizes under the influence of marine air were remarkably enhanced by 49 %–64 % compared to the continental air masses. Moreover, we reveal a considerable transport of marine-sourced sulfate aerosols when the marine air dominated, explaining the enhanced hygroscopicity. We attribute the absence of externally-mixed sea salt in nucleation/Aitken modes to that the ultrafine marine-sourced aerosols are generally with lower quantity and tend to be collided and internally-mixed during transport. We finally made a global review using observations at 21 sites, deriving the κ of 0.21–0.25, 0.23–0.32, and 0.51–0.60 categorized by continental, coastal, and oceanic respectively.

 Defining regions with similar characteristics for extreme precipitation is crucial for understanding the impacts of climate change, planning and managing water resources, and designing hydraulic structures. However, studies on the regionalization of extreme precipitation for Türkiye are limited, and regional extreme precipitation characteristics are not well defined. In this study, motivated by the need to contribute to this field, homogenous regions for extreme precipitation across Türkiye were determined using the latest version (V07) of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG). We initially validated IMERG V07 estimates using data from 214 ground-based stations and compared the results with its predecessor V06. The results revealed that IMERG showed some notable improvements from V06 to V07 for all seasons, especially in winter. During this season, the correlation coefficient increased from 0.57 to 0.64, the mean absolute bias decreased from 78.22 % to 69.27 %, and the RMSE decreased from 11.10 mm/day to 9.70 mm/day. In V07, while the trend of decreasing accuracy with increasing elevation observed in V06 continues, it has been shown that some notable improvements were achieved in continuous and categorical metrics. We then applied widely used non-hierarchical (K-means) and hierarchical (Ward's method) clustering techniques. To perform this, we first applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables related to extreme precipitation (e.g. amount, frequency, standard deviation, and seasonality) and geographic characteristics to identify the most significant variables for analysis. The K-means method delineated Türkiye into eight extreme precipitation regions, while the Ward's method resulted in six distinct extreme precipitation regions. We evaluated the results based on the existing extreme precipitation climatology literature for Türkiye and by associating them to known precipitation dynamics, and as a result, we recommended eight precipitation regions determined by the K-means. The identified precipitation regions are expected to contribute to future studies analyzing the effects of climate change and to regional studies on natural disasters resulting from extreme precipitation."

However, no clear guidelines have been established to regulate their hybrid characteristics owing to limited understanding of their adsorption mechanism. This study investigates the effects of the particle size of a flexible-robust MOF on its adsorption and structural transition behaviors. The robust nature originates from the structural transition of a metastable guest-free structure, while its flexible nature arises from another guest-free structure. The type of guest-free structure is predominantly determined by the particle size; particles below the critical size are trapped in the metastable guest-free structure. Notably, the critical size varies with the type of guest molecule to be removed; consequently, the difference in critical size results in guest-memory characteristics, enabling guest-free structure switching. These results underscore the importance of controlling the particle size to fine-tune hybrid adsorption characteristics of flexible-robust MOFs."
