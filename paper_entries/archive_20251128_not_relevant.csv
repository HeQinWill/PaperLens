Meteorological data is critical for assessing heat stress, and localized microclimate data provide more precise measurements of heat hazards than traditional weather station data. Our study explored microclimate patterns in space and time in tropical cities with rapidly growing urban populations and warming climates. We established a microclimate monitoring network with sensors measuring air temperature and relative humidity throughout two large cities in Gujarat, India. We collected hourly microclimate data on temperature and humidity from April 2023 to May 2024 from paired indoor/outdoor sensors at 48 homes in Ahmedabad and 45 homes in Surat. We summarized dry bulb (T) and wet-bulb (Tw) temperatures at indoor and outdoor locations, compared temporal patterns across seasons and times of the day, and investigated relationships with urban land cover. Indoor and outdoor microclimates had different diurnal variations, with distinctive patterns during the monsoon compared to other seasons. Building volume had warming effects and vegetation had cooling effects on minimum T and Tw, particularly at outdoor locations. In contrast, building volume had cooling effects and vegetation had warming effects on maximum T and Tw, particularly at indoor locations. Temperatures were consistently cooler at locations with higher albedo, and relationships with water were weaker and more variable. A model comparison found significant differences in land cover effects for indoor versus outdoor locations. Given the increasing occurrence of heat waves and climate-related health threats in western India and other tropical areas, it will be essential to account for the different spatial and temporal patterns of indoor and outdoor microclimates to more precisely identify locations and timings of temperature extremes."

This paper delves into the water-energy-food-ecosystems (WEFE) nexus, a scientific framework that supports the integrated assessment and management of the interconnected resources. Shifting from sectoral to cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary perspectives, the WEFE nexus addresses interdependencies and interactions among water, energy, food, ecosystems, and climate. This paper focuses on the extended nexus, incorporating ecosystems as a fourth pillar, underscoring the importance of considering ecosystems on an equal footing with water, energy, and food sectors. In addition, the paper emphasizes the significance of monitoring and modelling techniques, laying the foundations for understanding the nexus complexities and assessing uncertainty. The paper offers an overview of integrated nexus modelling, system analysis and socio-economic modelling, bridging the gap between nexus science and practice. It highlights the role of multifaceted stakeholder engagement methods, policy assessment, and institutional analysis in nexus models. Quantifying the nexus through indicators, and its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, EU Green Deal, and EU Blue Deal are also key focal points. Finally, the last part of the paper addresses challenges in existing nexus modelling attempts, advocates for the integration of transdisciplinary information, and presents lessons learned. The paper concludes with recommendations for the future of the WEFE nexus, emphasizing its potential in fostering transformative change toward sustainable resource management and inclusive policymaking."

Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD)+ projects generate carbon credits by reducing forest loss within the project area compared with a counterfactual area that faces similar pressures (known as ‘additionality’). Several methods are available for constructing counterfactuals, but comparing their reliability is challenging. Here, we present an evaluation approach based on the creation of placebo projects, where there are no REDD+ activities and in which we would not expect project and counterfactual outcomes to diverge. We compare four methods based on pixel matching that estimate counterfactual deforestation rates. Using 27 placebo projects spread across the tropics, we found that pixel-matching is a reliable way of estimating a key element of additionality (i.e. deforestation in counterfactual areas) when based on data gathered at the end of an evaluation period after project start (i.e. ex-post estimation). However, forecasting counterfactual deforestation rates from information available at the start of a project (i.e. ex-ante estimation) is much less reliable, reinforcing existing concerns about ex-ante crediting mechanisms. We argue that systematic application of the placebo approach can accelerate the development and adoption of more credible counterfactual-estimating methods. As counterfactuals are the basis which underpins the validity claims of most nature credits, strengthening the credibility of counterfactuals will enhance the effectiveness of conservation finance, helping REDD+ and other nature-based solutions realise their full potential in delivering real, measurable benefits."

Examining intellectual hegemony in climate research,"Analysing a dataset of 5432 journal articles (1986–2023) using bibliometric techniques, we investigate the conceptual framing, thematic evolution and publication trends of just transition—a concept seeking to reconcile climate action with social and economic justice but the scope and application of which fuel intense debate between the Global South and North. Our findings reveal that a small cadre of scholars and core journals exert disproportionate influence, steering the discourse towards technological fixes at the expense of structural political change, societal transformation, inclusive sustainable development, and addressing global inequality. This intellectual hegemony underscores age-long significant challenges around the politics and ethics of knowledge production in the discourse of global sustainability, not least the grave risk of marginalising the experiences and perspectives of the most vulnerable, who remain under-represented in both scholarship and policy-making. We conclude by calling for the integration of diverse viewpoints to ensure just transition strategies are both effective and equitable across varied global contexts—an imperative made all the more urgent by the resurgence of fractured climate politics and weakened global solidarity."

Quantifying nutrient retention in freshwaters is important for basin management, but difficult as retention depends, among other things, on the spatial and temporal scales of interest. This study aimed at assessing freshwater nutrient retention in contemporary Europe at continental scale with an ensemble modeling exercise. We used the conceptual model GREEN, changing lake retention according to alternative formulations, generating six model versions for total nitrogen (TN), and seven for total phosphorus (TP). All versions were calibrated independently in six European regions, defined by the sea to which land drained to. Parameter sets that performed well in overall calibration and at stations downstream lakes formed the ensembles that were used to quantify freshwater retention over a decade (2012–2021). Ensemble median river retention was about 10% of incoming TN load and 6% TP load. Median lake retention was about 4% for TN and 6.5% for TP. Median freshwater retention amounted to 170 kg N yr−1 and 7.2 kg P yr−1 per km2 of drainage area. European freshwaters retained about 16% of incoming nitrogen and 13% of incoming phosphorus loads, preventing about 1066 kt N yr−1 and 49 kt P yr−1 to reaching the coastline. Nitrogen retention mostly occurred in rivers, whereas phosphorus retention occurred predominantly in lakes, however important regional differences were noted. The assessment likely underestimates the overall role of freshwater nutrient retention, as secondary streams, wetlands, and ponds were not considered explicitly. Nevertheless, it provides quantitative references for accounting of freshwaters ecosystem services at continental scale."

This world region has been strongly affected by natural hazards, political disruptions and historically diverse attempts to establish effective water management principles. Drawing on historical and contemporary evidence, we establish a game theoretical baseline model of a user community in which irrigation is efficiently governed by group sanctions. By allowing for drift in the evolutionary equilibrium, we model how a loss of traditional authorities over water management can erode established group norms. We then analyse a hypothetical scenario of privatised water rights, inspired by historical and current policy debates in Central Asia. Under the assumption that such rights can be technically implemented, we show that they can restore an efficient water use equilibrium of owners that is egalitarian and evolutionary stable. We discuss how future climate change scenarios or conflicts over transboundary water allocation may affect the model results, focusing on the effects of increased uncertainty and of decreasing water productivity on system resilience. Productivity shocks may make low-performing equilibria unsustainable and thus lead to disruptive change or extinction of certain equilibria. Policy should focus on local interaction as an arena of institutional change. We suggest empirical research questions emerging from our analysis and highlight the benefits of uncontested property rights as an institutional solution to water governance."

Due to the high-altitude and cold-climate conditions, the QTP is highly vulnerable to climate change. Understanding the relative importance of the drivers of grassland degradation is essential for developing adaptive management strategies. While numerous studies have explored these drivers, the impacts of large-scale ecological restoration efforts since 2000, particularly across different grassland types and degradation-recovery phases, remain underexplored. This study analyzes 40 years of grassland vegetation dynamics on the QTP, identifying key inflection points and classifying regions into four ‘degradation-restoration’ trajectory types. The effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers across distinct temporal phases are quantified. The results indicate that 6.56% of grasslands are in continuous degradation, while 28.97% are at risk of potential degradation risk. Drought and grazing emerge as the primary drivers of vegetation change, while restoration and afforestation programs play a significant role in enhancing recovery. Our findings underscore the spatiotemporal variability of grassland responses and emphasize the need for targeted grazing management and integrated water resource planning to optimize restoration outcomes. This study provides a framework for differentiated grassland management in the face of climate change and human pressures on the QTP."

While it is known that substantial opportunity exists for further development, a key question has been where wind energy is best suited compared to other technologies. This study leverages an immense dataset of parcel-resolved technoeconomic potential for the contiguous United States, focusing on distributed wind (DW) energy—a configuration where one or more turbines, typically 30–60 m in height are used to satisfy nearby energy needs. The analysis is conducted at multiple spatial scales and considers land use, crop land, census, and incentive program data to determine the most opportune areas for market development. The results show that rural, agricultural and residential areas are most suited to DW. Connection type (in front of, or behind the meter) and regulations determine the best application, while siting constraints, economics, demand and the wind resource determines the optimal size of turbine."

The research questions addressed are: (1) what effects might compound heatwaves have under climate change scenarios? (2) How are compound heatwaves expected to impact the population in the future? The outcomes indicate that the compound HWs may increase by 4.6 events annually in Northwest India (NWI) under the SSP585 scenario. In contrast, daytime-only HWs are expected to decline after 2060, except in the Himalayan region, possibly due to changes in monsoon patterns and increased evaporative cooling. It is anticipated that nighttime-only heatwaves will uniformly increase across all regions and scenarios, with the most substantial rises observed in the Central Northeast India (CNI) and NWI. Under the SSP370 scenario during 2061–2100, the population exposure to compound heatwaves and nighttime-only heatwaves is projected to increase substantially across all regions. Specifically, exposure to compound heatwaves is anticipated to exceed historical levels by more than 30 times in most regions. Both the CNI and NWI regions show the highest rise in compound and nighttime-only heatwave extremes.

A neural network-based suitability model was trained on coffee occurrence data derived from national statistics on coffee-growing areas. Bias-corrected regional climate models, adjusted to reduce systematic deviations from observed patterns, were used for two climate change scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP2.6) to assess changes in suitability for three future time periods (2038–2048, 2059–2069, 2060–2070) relative to the 2009–2019 baseline. Average expected losses in suitable areas were 62% and 27% for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. The loss in suitability due to RCP8.5 is particularly pronounced after 2060. Increasing mean minimum temperature during the harvest (October–November) and growing season (March–September), and decreasing precipitation during the late growing season (July–September) mainly determined the loss in suitable areas.

However, the spatial resolution of these datasets is substantially coarser than the typical area of PV farms, which can lead to potential inaccuracies in power generation estimates. Despite this limitation, the associated errors have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we comprehensively assess the misestimations in power generation potential arising from the application of three widely used reanalysis datasets—ERA5, ERA5-Land and MERRA2—using observational data from twelve PV farms in China. Moreover, the key drivers and mechanisms underlying these inaccuracies are revealed. We find that the relative errors in annual power generation potential estimates were approximately −17%, −12% and 7% for ERA5, ERA5-Land and MERRA2, respectively. Notably, these errors escalated with increasing temporal resolution of estimation; at the hourly scale, they were amplified by approximately twofold and threefold for ERA5/ERA5-Land and MERRA2, respectively. Mechanistic analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between estimation errors and near-surface air temperature, suggesting that cloud conditions and terrain may be the primary drivers contributing to these inaccuracies. The results of our study underscore the importance of accounting for these errors when using reanalysis data for PV power generation potential estimation, particularly at monthly and hourly scales.

This study developed a quantitative method for separating the anthropogenic and natural contributions of total gaseous mercury. The underlying impacts on the sea–air exchange fluxes of mercury are evaluated. The new method developed in this study can be reproduced in other regions, and the findings are innovative in the field of mercury sources and biogeochemical cycles. 
 Mercury in the atmosphere is a crucial environmental concern due to its toxicity and its ability to travel long distances. In the marginal seas, the contributions of terrestrial anthropogenic vs. natural sources on atmospheric mercury have rarely been quantified and their roles in mercury sea–air exchange are not well understood. To address this issue, this study integrated observations from island, cruise, and inland campaigns. The mean concentrations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) were 2.32 ± 1.02 ng m−3 (Bohai Sea), 2.55 ± 0.55 ng m−3 (Yellow Sea), and 2.31 ± 0.81 ng m−3 (East China Sea), respectively, with coastal regions exhibiting significantly higher values than open ocean areas due to continental outflows. Positive correlations were observed between TGM concentrations and environmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, indicating the significant influence of natural sources on atmospheric mercury in the marine environment. By utilizing a receptor model and linear regression analysis, a robust method was developed to quantitatively estimate the contribution of anthropogenic and natural sources to TGM. Anthropogenic sources accounted for an average of 59 %, 40 %, and 27 % of TGM over the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, respectively. The sea–air exchange fluxes of mercury were estimated as 0.17 ± 0.38, 1.10 ± 1.34, and 3.44 ± 3.24 ng m−2 h−1 over these three seas, respectively. Stronger anthropogenic mercury emissions in northern China partially explained the suppressed sea–air exchange fluxes of mercury in the Bohai Sea. This study elucidated the role of anthropogenic emissions in shaping the marine atmospheric mercury and the sea–air exchange fluxes, thereby informing valuable assessments regarding the influence of future reduced anthropogenic mercury emissions on the marine mercury cycle and ecosystems."

The results showed that the joint effect of the considered tropical oscillations, originating in low latitudes, significantly affect the structure of planetary waves, not only in the regions of their climatic maximum but also throughout the middle atmosphere and thermosphere of both hemispheres. 
 We performed a series of numerical experiments to study the main patterns of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation phase of the zonal wind in the equatorial stratosphere (QBO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence on stationary and westward travelling atmospheric planetary waves (PWs) with different zonal wave numbers and periods. The simulation was carried out for boreal winter conditions using the Middle and Upper Atmosphere Model (MUAM). The results showed that the joint effect of the considered tropical oscillations can significantly up to tens of percent change the amplitudes of the PW in the areas of their maxima. Under the El Niño regardless of the QBO phase the amplitude maxima of the stationary PW with wave number 1 (SPW1) shift toward high latitudes. The amplitude structure of SPW2 is basically opposite to the SPW1 structure. Increases of the upward wave activity fluxes of quasi- 5, 10, 7 d PWs, as well as the amplitudes of 10 and 7 d PWs are modelled when easterly QBO phase is superimposed on El Niño phase. Conversely, attenuations of the individual PW amplitudes and wave activity fluxes are typically observed under the westerly QBO, as well as under La-Niña/westerly QBO conditions combination in special cases, such as SPW1. The PW study is important due to their significant influence on the middle and upper atmosphere circulation, including the configuration of the stratospheric polar vortex whose deformation can influence the occurrence of extreme weather events, in particular, in the Arctic and Asia-Pacific region during the boreal winter."

This includes temperature, salinity, pressure, and currents recorded by instruments deployed in icy, challenging conditions. Our analysis highlights the dominance of tidal currents and separates these from other patterns to study regional energy distribution. This unique dataset offers a foundation for future research on Antarctic ocean dynamics and ice interactions. 
 Continuous moored time series of temperature, salinity, pressure and current speed and direction are of great importance for understanding the continental shelf and under-ice-shelf dynamics and thermodynamics that govern water mass transformations and ice melting in and around Antarctic marginal seas. In these regions, icebergs and sea ice make ship-based mooring deployment and recovery challenging. Nevertheless, over decades, expeditions around the fringe of Antarctica sporadically deployed and recovered hundreds of moored instruments, including those facilitated through ice shelves boreholes. These datasets tend to be archived in a wide range of data centres, with, to our knowledge, no clear format standardisation. As a result, systematic analysis of historical mooring time series in the marginal seas is often challenging. Here we present the first version of a standardised pan-Antarctic moored hydrography and current time series compilation, with broad international contributions from data centres, research institutes and individual data owners. The mooring records in this compilation span over five decades, from the 1970s to the 2020s, providing an opportunity for a systematic study of the pan-Antarctic water mass transport and shelf connectivity. As a demonstration of the utility of this compilation, we present spectral analysis of the compiled current velocity time series, which unsurprisingly shows the dominating presence of tidal variability within most records. This component of the variability is fitted using multi-linear regression to tidal frequencies, and the tidal fit is removed from the original time series to leave de-tided variability. Given the limited record durations to months to years, de-tided variability is dominated by synoptic (3–10 d period), intraseasonal (10–80 d) and seasonal (∼6 months–1 year) signals. The spatial distribution of the kinetic energy integrated within frequency bands is presented and discussed within respective regional contexts, and future avenues of research are proposed.

Our study introduces HDNTL, a daily NTL dataset for 653 major cities (population >1 M by 2025) from 2012–2024, enhancing NASA's VNP46A2 accuracy by correcting spatial mismatches, angular effects, and filling small data holes via spatiotemporal interpolation. Validated against high-resolution NTL datasets and ground-truth records, HDNTL enables precise monitoring of nighttime human activities. 
 Nighttime light (NTL) data at daily scales presents an innovative foundation for monitoring human activities, offering vast potential across various research domains such as urban planning and management, disaster monitoring, and energy consumption. The daily moonlight-adjusted nighttime lights product (VNP46A2), sourced from Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS), has been providing globally corrected daily NTL data since 2012. However, persistent challenges, such as fluctuations in the daily NTL series due to spatial mismatch and angular effects, as well as data holes, have significantly impacted the accuracy and comprehensiveness of extracting daily NTL changes. To address these challenges, a dataset production framework focusing on error correction, interpolation, and validation was developed. This framework led to the creation of a high-quality daily NTL (HDNTL) dataset from 2012 to 2024, which specifically targets 653 cities with populations predictably exceeding one million in 2025. A comparative analysis with the VNP46A2 dataset revealed promising results in spatial mismatch correction for two sample areas – the airport and highway (angular effect can be ignored). These areas exhibited reduced fluctuations in HDNTL time series and enhanced spatial consistency among pixels with homogeneous light sources. Furthermore, the correction of angular effects across various urban building landscapes demonstrated sound improvements, mitigating angular effects in different directions and reducing periodicity from the angular impacts. The spatiotemporal interpolation of data holes shows high similarity with the reference data, as indicated by a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99, and it increased the valid pixels of all cities by about 2 %. The HDNTL dataset exhibited enhanced consistency with high-resolution Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) NTL data regarding the NTL change rate. Also, it showed high alignment with ground truth data of power outages, showcasing superior performance in short-event detection. Overall, the HDNTL dataset effectively mitigates instability in daily series caused by spatial mismatch and angular effects observed in VNP46A2, improving data comparability across both time and space. This dataset enhances the ability of the NTL to reflect the ground events, providing a more accurate reference for daily-scale nighttime light research. Additionally, the dataset production framework facilitates easy updates from future VNP46A2 products to HDNTL. The HDNTL is openly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17079409 (Pei et al., 2025)."

 Measurements of stable water isotopes in the atmospheric water vapour can be used to better understand the physical processes of the atmospheric water cycle. In polar regions, the atmospheric water vapour isotopic composition is a key parameter to understand the link between the precipitation and snow isotopic compositions and interpret isotope climate records from ice cores. In this study we present a novel 2.5-month accurate record of the atmospheric water vapour isotopic composition during the austral summer 2023–2024 (6 December 2023 to 14 February 2024) at Concordia Station (East Antarctica), from two laser spectrometers based on different measurement techniques, which are independently calibrated and both optimised to measure in low humidity environments. We show that both instruments accurately measure the summertime diurnal variability in the water vapour δ18O, δD, and d-excess, when the water vapour mixing ratio is consistently higher than 200 ppmv. We compare these measurements to outputs of the isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ6-iso and show that the model exhibits biases in both the mean water vapour isotopic composition and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, consistent with previous studies.

Harvesting dates are retrieved using the novel Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI) to capture spectral transitions from senescent crops to crop residues. CropPlantHarvest is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16967482. 
 As key components of agricultural management, planting and harvesting schedules have strongly influenced crop production by defining the length of the crop growing season and shaping the environmental conditions crops experience. Accurate knowledge of these management data is crucial for enhancing crop yield estimates by capturing the timing of crop development relative to weather and soil conditions, assessing climate adaptation by tracking shifts in farming practices over time, and supporting agricultural carbon accounting. Yet, existing planting and harvesting date datasets are largely based on state-level statistics or rule-based calendars that overlook intra-regional variability and the influence of human decision-making. The absence of long-term, high-resolution planting and harvesting date information hinders our ability to reconstruct historical agricultural practices and assess their agronomic and environmental consequences. In this study, we introduce CropPlantHarvest, the first dataset of annual corn and soybean planting and harvesting dates across the U.S. Midwest at 500 m resolution from 2001 to 2024. Planting dates are estimated using CropSow, an integrative remotely sensed crop modeling system that aligns simulated crop growth trajectories with satellite observations to retrieve field-level planting dates. Harvesting dates are retrieved using the Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI), a novel index that integrates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance to detect harvesting events by capturing the distinct spectral transition from senescent crops to exposed crop residues. Validation against USDA crop progress reports and field-level dataset demonstrates high accuracy of CropPlantHarvest, with a mean absolute error of approximately 5 days for both crop species. This large spatial and temporal dataset captures management-driven variability in crop season timing and duration, supporting improved modeling of crop yields, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource use. It could also serve as a benchmark for refining remote-sensing phenology products and evaluating the agro-environmental impacts of evolving crop management decisions.

 This paper introduces REMO2020, a modernised version of the well-known and widely used REgional climate MOdel (REMO). REMO2020 has undergone fundamental changes in its code structure to provide a more modular, operationally focused design, facilitating the inclusion of new components and updates. Here, we describe the default configuration of REMO2020, which includes the following updates compared to the previous version, REMO2015: (i) the FLake lake model, (ii) a state-of-the-art MACv2-SP aerosol climatology, (iii) a newly developed three-layer snow module, (iv) a prognostic precipitation scheme, (v) an updated time filter, and (vi) a new tuning approach. Additionally, we describe some optional modules that can be activated separately, such as the interactive MOsaic-based VEgetation model iMOVE. REMO2020 outperforms its predecessor REMO2015 with regard to nearly all evaluation metrics used to evaluate simulations of Europe's climate. The persistent warm-temperature bias over central Europe and the cold-temperature bias over northern Europe have been significantly reduced in REMO2020. Similarly, the previously modelled dry bias in central Europe has been nearly eliminated, and the extent of the wet bias in eastern Europe has been reduced. The precipitation distribution in REMO2020 is much more realistic, especially in terms of heavy-precipitation extremes. Statistically, REMO2020 aligns better with long-term measurements than with older versions. Mountainous areas still present a challenge in REMO2020, especially with a higher vertical resolution.

 Tensor fields, as spatial derivatives of scalar or vector potentials, offer powerful insight into subsurface structures in geophysics.

We present a physics-informed spatial neural network that treats tensors according to their nature as derivatives of an underlying scalar field, enabling consistent, high-fidelity interpolation across the entire domain. By leveraging the differentiable nature of neural networks, our method not only honours the physical constraints inherent to potential fields but also reconstructs the scalar and vector fields that generate the observed tensors.

Validation has been performed under idealized atmospheric conditions by benchmarking the coupled model with a fine-scale numerical model. Subsequently, the improvements and limitations are investigated aided by observations in real case simulations. 
 Understanding and modeling the turbulent transport of surface layer fluxes are essential for numerical weather forecasting models. The presence of heterogeneous surface obstacles (buildings) that have dimensions comparable to the model vertical resolution requires further complexity and design in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. In this study, we develop a numerical method to couple a recently validated PBL scheme, TKE-ACM2, with multi-layer Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Subsequently, the performance of TKE-ACM2+BEP is examined under idealized convective atmospheric conditions with a simplified building layout. Furthermore, its reproducibility is benchmarked with a state-of-the-art large-eddy simulation model, PALM, which explicitly resolves the building aerodynamics. The results indicate that TKE-ACM2+BEP outperforms another operational PBL scheme (Boulac) coupled with BEP by reducing bias in both the potential temperature (θ) and wind speed (u). Following this, real case simulations are conducted for a highly urbanized domain, namely the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China. High-resolution wind speed LiDAR observations suggest that TKE-ACM2+BEP reduces overestimation in the lower part of the boundary layer compared with the Bulk method, which lacks an urban scheme, at a LiDAR site located in a densely built environment. In addition, the surface temperature and relative humidity given by TKE-ACM2+BEP at surface stations in urbanized areas are more accurate than those given by TKE-ACM2 without BEP. However, it is revealed that BEP does not always improve the accuracy of the surface wind speed, as it can introduce excessive aerodynamic drag."

Our thorough review of the urban parameterizations implemented in WRF version 4.5.2 highlighted a handful of parameters that may introduce discontinuities in simulations: (i) in the SLUCM, a 1 mm h−1 rain rate threshold is employed to switch between two minimum moisture availability parameterizations, thus impacting latent heat flux calculations; (ii) in the SLUCM a threshold is used to partition shortwave radiation into direct and diffuse components; (iii) in all three urban schemes, the bulk Richardson number is employed to select the similarity function, which influences the vertical distribution of heat and momentum. We also identified a highly simplified treatment of the radiative balance on roof surfaces. The implications of these simplifications can be assessed through targeted observations across relevant conditions, including varying precipitation rates, cloud cover, and transitions between stability regimes. Furthermore, the widespread application of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in these urban schemes warrants model evaluation under highly stable and unstable conditions and in heterogeneous urban settings with variable land cover and building heights on scales finer than model resolution. To address these challenges, we offer guidance on observational strategies, emphasizing the need for multi-parametric measurements to capture potential compensating biases and multi-height measurements that align with the levels where quantities are diagnostic and prognosed in the model (i.e., the lowest atmospheric level of the WRF model). Finally, our inspection of the code revealed implementation bugs that have now been corrected in WRF versions 4.6.0 and 4.6.1. Sensitivity tests over the Atlanta urban area show that these corrections affect surface temperatures, underscoring the importance of performing rigorous documentation and verification of the implementation of parameterizations in model code."

De Pondeca,Multigrid beta filter for faster computation of ensemble covariance localization,"Covariance localization to mitigate sampling error of ensemble-based forecast error covariances is one of the main parts of the calculation in ensemble-variational data assimilation for the atmosphere. This study clarifies that the multigrid beta filter-based localization makes it several times faster than the conventional recursive filter-based one without significantly changing the analysis if a coarser filter grid is applied and filters except for the coarsest resolution are omitted. 
 This study applies a multigrid beta filter (MGBF) for covariance localization in ensemble-variational (EnVar) data assimilation instead of the conventional recursive filter (RF) to achieve faster computation in a large number of processors. The parallelization efficiency of the MGBF is higher than that of the RF because all-to-all communication to change the computational region of each processor is not necessary. However, the MGBF-based localization additionally requires horizontal variable exchange between processors; its computational cost is proportional to the number of grid points and to the ensemble size, and is generally more expensive than the RF. In this study, we implement the MGBF-based localization both for the single-scale localization and for the scale-dependent localization in the regional atmospheric EnVar data assimilation system. In addition, we clarify that applying a coarser filter grid and omitting filtering except for the coarsest resolution make the computation of the MGBF-based localization several times faster than that of the RF-based one without significantly changing the EnVar analysis."

Mørk;Tor Nordam;Siren Rühs,Handling discontinuities in numerical ODE methods  for Lagrangian oceanography,"A common task in applied oceanography is to calculate the trajectories of floating objects in the ocean. We propose an alteration to some common numerical methods to improve their performance in such computations, and compare results with and without this alteration. This will help researchers to ensure they obtain a higher accuracy in their results without compromising on computer resources. 
 In Lagrangian oceanography, numerical methods for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are used to model particle transport. In many common applications, the velocity field driving the particle transport is provided as output from ocean models, on a discrete grid of points. Hence, the velocity field must be interpolated. Depending on the choice of interpolation, the velocity field or its derivatives may have discontinuities. These discontinuities have implications for the accuracy of the numerical ODE methods employed.We demonstrate that by using information about the location of the discontinuities, we can take these into account, and improve numerical accuracy over standard integration methods that do not take discontinuities into account. The commonly used combination of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and linear interpolation of the velocity field, in fact, only yields second-order accuracy with the standard method. By accounting for discontinuities, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy with the same timestep. The implementation makes use of a combination of known methods from the field of numerical integration of ODEs. The implementation is quite flexible, agnostic to grid layout and order of interpolation, and contributes only modestly to the code complexity. Hence, the proposed technique for handling discontinuities in interpolated velocity fields could easily be adopted to a range of applications where numerical accuracy or efficiency is of importance.As an example where numerical accuracy is important, we run a backtracking case for particles with known initial conditions, and show that the method with discontinuity handling is to a larger degree able to recover the correct initial positions of the particles, compared to standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta."

Tree‐ring reconstructions, often used to quantify temperature variations over the Common Era, contain multiple uncertainties that affect estimates of the magnitude of recent trends and past variability. The use of maximum latewood density (MXD) proxy mitigates many biases, but intra‐annual measurement resolution remains a limitation. We develop a quantitative wood anatomy (QWA)‐based temperature reconstruction from the Firth River in northeastern Alaska from 1150 CE to 2021 CE to improve regional past temperature estimates and to test the sensitivity of MXD‐based climate reconstructions to measurement constraints. We find that high‐resolution wood‐anatomy measurements reduce biological noise and enhance the representation of low‐frequency variability, resulting in stronger temperature signals and a larger magnitude of preindustrial to modern change.

Additionally, the jet axis in GCMs is too straight in the vertical compared to reanalyses. Both biases have posed a long‐standing challenge to GCMs. Here, we use a development version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with different horizontal resolutions. The high‐resolution simulations exhibit a smaller bias in the representation of the SH polar vortex. Motivated by these results we introduce a gravity wave source parameterization to represent frontal gravity waves that have been missing in CAM. In this parameterization fronts are represented by their vorticity. Both, the amplitude and the phase speed of the launched waves are dependent on characteristics of the frontal systems.

Using radar observations and a 1‐D model, the results reveal that microphysical properties, namely geometric mean diameter (Dg) and raindrop concentration, primarily control evaporation processes under conditions of limited thermodynamic variability. Thermodynamic factors like cloud base height and relative humidity exert a smaller influence due to their narrow observed ranges. Small Dg leads to rapid increases in rain evaporation fraction (REF), as small drops evaporate completely, while larger Dg yields slower, more gradual REF changes. Frequent weak‐rain cases reduce the mean evaporation flux, whereas infrequent intense‐rain events substantially enhance it. These findings highlight the pivotal role of microphysical variability in shaping sub‐cloud evaporation in this trade cumulus regime, while thermodynamic effects may be more important in other environments."

Previous work also noted a fast‐get‐faster response and connected it diagnostically to the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Here we derive a moist adiabatic scaling that explains the upper‐level jet stream wind response. Given the daily surface air temperature distribution and assuming a moist adiabatic atmosphere, the upper‐level mean and fast jet stream wind increase by ∼ ${\sim} $2%/K and the jet stream shear increases by ∼ ${\sim} $4%/K across a climate model hierarchy. The scaling shows the increase of the surface moisture gradient following the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation dominates the response. The scaling connects the increasing surface moisture gradient to the upper‐level temperature gradient thereby reconciling dry and moist perspectives. The results show record‐breaking upper‐level jet stream wind and increased clear‐air turbulence are tied to the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation and are therefore robust and well‐understood consequences of climate change."

Unlike typical northwest‐southeast alignment in quiet conditions, the EMSTID exhibited an unusual northeast‐southwest orientation. Challenging Minisatellite Payload neutral wind and ROCSAT‐1 ion drift measurements showed significant thermospheric wind and electric field variations from quiet‐times. The study reveals a unique disturbance dynamo‐driven electrodynamical mechanism that triggers Perkins instability, generating unusually aligned nighttime EMSTID. Notably, low electron density and weak inhomogeneity in sporadic‐E layers in both locally (Wakkanai, Japan) and over conjugate regions (Townsville, Australia) reveal that Perkins instability can be enhanced sufficiently to generate EMSTIDs, even with weak E‐F regions coupling within or across hemispheres.

Tropical Anvil Peak Is Captured by GCMs,"Tropical anvil clouds peak near 200 hPa and significantly impact Earth's climate, yet its physical realism in coarse‐resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs) remains debated. We examine anvil cloud formation by performing simulations with a GCM with a hierarchy of cloud fraction schemes ranging from a complex prognostic Tiedtke scheme to a simple binary scheme. All schemes consistently reproduce the anvil peak. The robust anvil peak arises because extremely cold temperatures at the upper troposphere facilitate frequent saturation events, producing clouds that disproportionately influence mean cloud fraction. Sensitivity experiments with enhanced evaporation of cloud condensate unexpectedly show increased anvil coverage, highlighting how slight evaporative moistening reinforces local saturation in cold upper‐tropospheric conditions. These results demonstrate that the tropical anvil cloud peak emerges from fundamental thermodynamic constraints, rather than specific cloud fraction parameterization choices."

Magnetofossils, produced by magnetotactic bacteria, are sensitive to redox conditions in various environments. However, the relationship between magnetofossils and BWO has not been well‐established. Here, we present the first calibration of the magnetofossil‐hosted BWO proxy using surface sediments along oxygen gradients in the Southeast Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. Our results show that magnetofossil dimensional features and magnetic properties are linearly correlated with known BWO profiles (60–230 μmol/kg). Specifically, higher proportions of cuboctahedral magnetofossils coupled with more biogenic soft components are associated with higher BWO levels, and vice versa. These findings confirm that magnetofossils can serve as a valuable proxy for quantifying past oxygen concentrations globally, expanding the application of BWO proxies for paleoclimate reconstructions."

However, how the global change affects smaller‐scale ionospheric phenomena remains unclear. This study investigates for the first time the impact of increasing CO2 on the formation of sporadic‐E layer, a key space weather element links to HF/VHF communications. Using the Ground‐to‐topside model of Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy (GAIA), simulations were conducted for normal (315 ppm) and doubled CO2 (667 ppm) levels to evaluate changes in the vertical ion convergence (VIC). Simulation results reveal that the VIC is enhanced in the 100–120 km altitude range globally. Furthermore, VIC hotspots shift downward by approximately 5 km and exhibit changes in their diurnal pattern. The reduction of the ion‐neutral collision frequency alongside changes in the zonal wind shear contributes significantly to these changes. Our study suggests that, as CO2 concentrations continue to rise, future Es layers may become more intense, last longer, and form at lower altitudes compared to present‐day conditions. These changes could potentially challenge the reliability of HF communication systems in the future."

In contrast, reintensifying ERC storms can achieve higher intensities when moving over warmer seas with greater ocean heat content and reduced vertical wind shear. The scarcity of storms at intermediate intensities (85–105 kt) arises from rapid intensification (RI), which drives systems quickly through this range.

This study shows that the smaller moons—Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel—are the most viable candidates and should support thick oceans through a process of “self‐tuned resonance.” In self‐tuned resonance, a system dynamically adjusts both its resonance conditions (maximizing stored energy) and its dissipation efficiency (approaching critical damping), resulting in increased dissipation/heating and long‐term stabilization against secular trends (in this case, freezing.)

Analysis of TC genesis and landfall indicates that CHAZ reasonably captures the spatial distribution of TC activity during the Northern Hemisphere TC season in the tropical western Pacific, eastern Pacific, and Atlantic Ocean basins. The CHAZ simulation of TC genesis, track distribution, and landfall latitude is most accurate in the North Atlantic, where interannual variability is also best represented. Observed interannual correlation coefficients between TC genesis and landfall generally exceed 0.5 in the western Pacific and North Atlantic, but are lower in the eastern Pacific; CHAZ simulates higher correlations across all three basins than observations. Further analysis examines the influence of seven climate modes: El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM), Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), Tropical Upper‐Tropospheric Trough in the Pacific (TUTT_Pac) and Atlantic (TUTT_Atl), Western Pacific Subtropical High, and North Atlantic Subtropical High. In the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean basins, heightened TC activity is observed during positive PMM and negative TUTT_Pac phases. In the Atlantic, La Niña, positive AMM, and negative TUTT_Atl phases enhance TC activity. Interactions between modes can amplify or dampen their individual effects; notably, the combination of negative TUTT_Atl and positive AMM phases increases TC landfall occurrence in the Atlantic by over 50% relative to climatological norms in both observations and CHAZ."

For all Rossby modes, except for the s = 1 first symmetric Rossby mode, GPH amplitudes exhibit enhancement in the pre‐ and post‐summer solstice periods. It is inferred that the enhancements of the s = 3 and s = 4 Rossby‐gravity modes around the summer solstice as well as those of Rossby modes in the post‐summer solstice share a common feature: Eliassen‐Palm (EP) flux divergence is positive near the critical line over the region with a negative latitudinal gradient of potential vorticity q‾y ${\overline{q}}_{y}$. This feature strongly suggests that dynamical instability commonly plays a key role in the excitation and/or amplification of these modes. In contrast, characteristics of the Rossby modes in the pre‐summer solstice suggest a common but different mechanism from the above‐described acting to their enhancement: strong upward EP fluxes are observed from the middle stratosphere to the upper mesosphere on the equatorward side of the negative q‾y ${\overline{q}}_{y}$ region at high summer latitudes in the mesosphere.

Although our results overall confirm the lack of robust response, one model, HadGEM3‐GC31‐MM, has a statistically significant equatorward shift in vortex latitude, deceleration of vortex winds, and increase in sudden stratospheric warmings. Its response is found to be highly state‐dependent, significant only in the easterly phase of the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO).

Based on the correspondence of fire incidence and burned areas to QFWI, we proposed a classification scheme indicative of low‐, medium‐, and high‐fire dangers in China, and further examined the historical variability of wildfire dangers accordingly. The results show that China's wildfire risks did not increase monotonically with warming, but exhibited an inter‐decadal variability modulated synergistically by changes in multiple climate variables. From 1961 to 1990, the high‐risk days decreased at −0.98 ± 0.71 days yr−1 primarily driven by the slowdown of daily maximum wind speed (WSmax). After 1990, broad swathes of the country experienced significant increases (0.64 ± 0.54 days yr−1) in high‐risk days, particularly in southwest China, contributed mainly by warming of daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) and drying of daily minimum relative humidity (RHmin).

This behavior is elegantly described by Maxwell's equations, which account for material‐specific permittivity and permeability. According to the principle of superposition, the net electromagnetic wave within a dielectric medium results from the combination of the incident wave and secondary waves generated by the medium's interaction with the incident wave. Notably, both the incident wave and the secondary waves propagate at the speed of light in a vacuum. The Ewald‐Oseen extinction theorem explains that secondary waves, emitted by atoms in the dielectric medium, interfere with the incident wave in such a way that they cancel the original wave and produce a resultant wave propagating at a reduced speed determined by the dielectric constant of the medium.

Here, we perform a waviness metric comparison, focusing on their association with extreme daily temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Using a probability ratio, we quantify the association between high waviness and colocated extreme temperatures. We find large differences in association strength across different metrics, highlighting that different metrics are associated with very different aspects of waviness, and are not all equally associated with extremes.

We find that the local wave activity (LWA) metric has the strongest associations with temperature extremes, particularly when separated into its cyclonic and anticyclonic components. We also conduct similar analysis using a neural network model to simulate links between metrics and temperature anomalies. We find that probability ratios can be increased through this method of including nonlinear, and not just colocated, connections, but the result of the LWA metric providing the strongest connection to extremes holds. We also show that a simple geopotential height zonal anomaly method provides overall very high associations and may be sufficient for many studies connecting waviness to extremes."

In this study, the impact and corresponding mechanisms of tropical Pacific SSTAs on compound extreme high temperature and drought events (CHTDE) and related wildfire are investigated based on the observed and reanalysis data sets. The results indicated that the relationship between the boreal summer tropical Pacific SSTAs and a Eurasian quadrupole atmospheric teleconnection has been enhanced since the mid‐1980s. After the mid‐1980s, the warm SSTAs in central‐eastern Pacific lead to the extremization of CHTDE and increasement of wildfire in Western Europe and Northern Central Asia, while cold SSTAs have similar effects in Eastern Europe and East Asia. This is primarily related to the westward shift of tropical Pacific SSTAs, which could trigger enhanced poleward and eastward propagation of Rossby waves and accelerate the circumpolar jet over the Kara Sea and the Laptev Sea and subtropical jet over southeastern Europe, leading to an intensification of the summer double jets event. The double jets could create favorable dynamic modulation of thermodynamic and water vapor transport in Eurasia. Therefore, this ocean‐atmosphere coupled mode results in a quadrupole pattern of disaster in Eurasia, which also has been verified by climate models. This study underscores the enhanced influence of the summer tropics on extreme events in Eurasia, offering valuable references for extreme events and wildfire early warning in Eurasia."

The retrievals are based on Meteosat thermal infrared observations. Therefore, rain can be monitored constantly, minutes after input data dissemination. Despite this low latency, RoA accuracy is comparable to estimates requiring hours or more to obtain. Consequently, RoA is of particular interest where a rapid response is critical, such as for disaster preparedness. RoA retrievals employ a convolutional and quantile regression neural network: the latter enables detailed case‐specific descriptions of the retrieval uncertainty. Four years of data from the calibration satellite in the GPM mission were used as training and evaluation labels. With this setup, limitations in earlier near‐real‐time retrievals for Africa were overcome. Moreover, the RoA network runs on regular workstations. With a 30‐km effective resolution, RoA retrievals over land are more timely and detailed than the established IMERG precipitation estimates. RoA is also applicable over the surrounding ocean regions, maintaining a similar performance. However, there IMERG exhibits a better effective resolution, at least for its more favorable conditions. Additionally, RoA's probabilistic nature enables addressing the inherent uncertainties of satellite precipitation retrievals by using probabilities of exceeding precipitation thresholds. Further assessment reveals similar diurnal cycles between RoA and IMERG, although IMERG shows some instability. Visual inspection of rain evolution patterns also indicates that RoA is more consistent. Finally, an annual mean analysis including CHIRPS estimates shows regional differences among the three, with no clear outlier behavior for RoA."

Hetao irrigation district, a 769,333‐ha wide World Heritage Irrigation Structure in Inner Mongolia, China, illustrates how humanity's biggest hydraulic engineering project becomes a storm generator through enhancing vegetation contrast with its adjacent extensive deserts. Based on radar data collected during warm seasons from 2012 to 2023, this study explores the evolution, diurnal variation, organization, and movement of convective systems (CSs) initiated by boundary layer convergence lines that formed due to vegetation contrast between the irrigated oasis and adjacent Kubuqi and Ulan Buh deserts in different synoptic patterns in the Hetao area. A total of 228 CSs formed primarily along vegetation contrast lines in arid areas under synoptic patterns featuring adequate moisture and substantial instability, with ∼35% exhibiting linear organization and ∼20% propagating far downstream. These features were also compared across the borders between the Oasis and the Kubuqi Desert versus the Ulan Buh Desert, which have different sharpness of vegetation heterogeneity. Due to the sharper vegetation contrast, CSs over the Kubuqi Desert were nearly 11.7 times more prevalent with a higher prevalence of stronger linear organizational mode, greater intensity, and more frequent downstream propagation than those over the Ulan Buh Desert with a less sharp vegetation gradient, where stronger cellular organizational mode was dominant. These findings hold important implications for the nowcasting of severe weather in the semiarid Inner Mongolia and potentially in other desert‐oasis border regions worldwide."

The climatology and variability of spring cold front frequency show the highest center in the mid‐low reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR), based on the objective identification method. The spring cold front frequency over the MLRYR is strongly associated with the variation in U.S. east coast trough axis during preceding winters. During the winters with eastward‐shifted U.S. east coast trough axis, the positive (negative) geopotential height anomalies are detected over the high‐latitudes and tropics (mid‐latitudes) in North America and the North Atlantic. Such atmospheric circulations can induce tripole SST anomalies in the North Atlantic via altering surface heat fluxes. The tripole SST anomalies persist well from the preceding winter to spring and induce a meridional tripole circulation mode over the North Atlantic, further triggering a wave train which propagates downstream and induces negative geopotential height anomalies over Northeast China, intensifying the East Asia trough. The enhanced East Asia trough favors more southward cold and dry flow, consequently enhancing the equivalent potential temperature gradient over the MLRYR. Such atmospheric changes correspond to more cold front activities over the MLRYR. Leave‐one‐out cross‐validation shows that the preceding winter U.S. east coast trough axis might act as a potential predictor for the spring cold front frequency over the MLRYR."

Owing to their exposed coastal locations, ports are expected to face increasing climate‐related risks, such as sea‐level rise (SLR) and changes in storminess. However, there is a gap in current literature evaluating how ports are addressing climate‐related risks through implementation of adaptation actions. This study explores if, and how, some of the largest commercial ports in the UK are adapting to risk in practice. Evidence of implemented adaptation action is extracted from Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP) reports, as mandated under the UK Climate Change Act 2008. Evidence of incremental adaptation was identified, in response to an increasingly diverse range of perceived climate‐related risks. However, uncertainty around future changes in some climate‐related risks, and different risk perceptions, meant ports were also coming to different judgments on when and how they should adapt. A discord between short and longer‐term planning was also identified. Consequently, there remains the need to shift thinking from business‐as‐usual toward a more systematic and integrated consideration of short‐ and longer‐term climate risks, adaptation and wider benefits to support decision making. This would align with a more transformational adaptation approach. This could include exploiting the renewal and investment cycle so new port infrastructure is climate‐proofed when constructed. The framework presented here, to identify, catalog and evaluate implemented adaptation actions in the UK, could be applied to other regions. This would provide a more comprehensive picture of how ports are implementing adaptation globally."

However, the changing roles of glacier and snow melt in the future TFFs and their socio‐economic impacts remain unclear. Here, combining a high‐resolution state‐of‐the‐art cryosphere‐hydrology model with observations and the latest climate projections, we project significant increases in annual‐maximum TFFs across all TP basins from 1981 to 2100. By 2100, even under the intermediate‐emission scenario (SSP245), the frequency of peak‐over‐threshold TFFs is projected to rise by 1.2 ± 1.1 to 13.5 ± 4.1 times compared to historical levels (1981–2020) in TP, with intensity increases ranging from 23% ± 30%–106% ± 39%. Although this increase is primarily driven by more frequent rainfall extremes, meltwater will still contribute over 20% to at least one peak‐over‐threshold TFF in 7 of 10 TP basins. For the Indus basin that has the largest glacier area, the number of peak‐over‐threshold TFFs with meltwater contribution exceeding 20% will increase by 3.2 ± 2.2 times by 2100 under SSP585; particularly in the years with heavy snowfall and less rainfall, the meltwater contribution could reach 80%. Moreover, the future ranges of meltwater contributions to the TP's TFFs become much wider than historical levels. By 2100, the exposed population and GDP to TP's TFFs are projected to increase by 6.2 ± 3.2 and 18.0 ± 12.6 times under SSP245, respectively, due to rising flood risk and socio‐economic development. Further, increasing TFFs will threaten over 120,000 km2 cropland downstream. These findings call for timely preparedness and close collaboration to cope with increasing TFFs among riparian Asian countries."

Here, we report a direct deaminative strategy through the formation of N-nitroamines, allowing the direct conversion of inert aromatic C−N bonds into an array of other functional groups, C−X (C−Br, C−Cl, C−I, C−F, C−N, C−S, C−Se, C−O) and C−C bonds. This operationally simple, general protocol establishes a unified strategy for one-pot deaminative cross-couplings by integrating deaminative functionalization with transition-metal-catalyzed arylation, thereby streamlining synthesis and late-stage functionalization. The key advantages of this transformation over other deaminative functionalization methods lies in its versatility across nearly all classes of medicinally relevant heteroaromatic amines, as well as electronically and structurally diverse aniline derivatives, regardless of the position of the amino group. Mechanistic studies, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, suggest that the aryl cation equivalent reactivity of N-nitroamines is generally favoured in this deaminative process.

 Non-radiative recombination loss at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface in the narrow-bandgap (NBG) subcell constrains the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-perovskite tandem solar cells 1,2. Minimizing charge recombination at the buried interface of lead-tin (Pb-Sn) based NBG perovskite solar cells have proven particularly challenging, as conventional long-chain amine-based passivation strategies often induce carrier transport losses, thereby limiting both the fill factors (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) 3–5. Here, we developed a dipolar passivation strategy that reduces the trap density at the buried interface of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite while simultaneously enabling precise energy level alignment at the HTL/perovskite interface. This dipolar-induced passivation enhances ohmic contact, facilitating efficient hole injection into the HTL and repelling electrons from the HTL/Pb-Sn perovskite interface. This approach extends the carrier diffusion length to 6.2 μm and enables a substantial enhancement in the PCE of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving 24.9% along with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.911 V, a Jsc of 33.1 mA cm-2 and a high FF of 82.6%.

 A phytoplankton bloom spanning 1 million km2 is consistently observed in the western Indian Subantarctic Zone. This oceanic region between the Subtropical and Subantarctic fronts in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean contributes 20–40% of Southern Ocean carbon export to the deep ocean. However, aeolian inputs of iron, the key limiting nutrient for primary production, support only half of the phytoplanktonic iron demand of this bloom. Here we show that primary production in the western Indian Subantarctic Zone is sustained by long-range transport of iron via the Agulhas Current, one of the strongest ocean currents, which flows southwestward along the southern African coast. Float trajectories and high-resolution model diagnostics indicate that these waters, enriched with iron over the African margin, cross the Subtropical Front via the region’s intense mesoscale eddy variability. Removing the African sedimentary iron source in the model decreases surface iron concentrations in the western Indian Subantarctic Zone by 55%, reducing annual primary production and carbon export by 25% and 26%, respectively. Strengthening of the Agulhas Return Current over the past 130 kyr may therefore have increased iron supply and palaeoproductivity in the Indian Subantarctic Zone, potentially leading to enhanced atmospheric CO2 drawdown.

Here, authors develop thick, dense electrodes with synthetic boundaries, improving mechanical robustness and specific, areal, and volumetric capacities as high as 497 mAh cm−3. 
 High energy density lithium-ion batteries are essential for sustainable energy solutions, as they reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing electrode thickness is an effective strategy to raise energy density at the device level, but it poses inherent scientific challenges. Thick electrodes typically require a highly porous structure (over 40% porosity) to maintain sufficient charge transport. Such porosity sharply lowers volumetric energy density, limiting use in space-constrained applications. Conversely, direct densification of thick electrodes intensifies charge diffusion limitations and exacerbates mechanochemical degradation. To overcome these trade-offs, we explore a geology-inspired, transient liquid-assisted densification process that produces dense, thick electrodes with multifunctional synthetic secondary boundaries. These boundaries provide three key benefits: (1) strain resistance that mitigates mechanochemical degradation, as demonstrated by operando full-field strain mapping; (2) enhanced charge transport across boundary phases in thick and dense electrodes (thickness > 200 μm, relative density > 85 %), leading to improved comprehensive electrochemical performance with a volumetric capacity of 420 mAh cm−3, an areal capacity of 23 mAh cm−2, and a specific (gravimetric) capacity of 195 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2; and (3) tailored conducting phases that increase active material content to 92.7 % by weight, further elevating volumetric capacity to 497 mAh cm−3.

 Van der Waals (vdW) magnets provide a rich landscape for innovative spintronic applications at atomic thickness. Among them, chromium sulfide bromide (CrSBr) stands out as a semiconducting antiferromagnet with the potential for magnetoelectric manipulation. However, the detection and electrical control of 2D magnetism in CrSBr are constrained by its centrosymmetric structure and in-plane antiferromagnetism. To address this challenge, we construct heterostructure devices composed of trilayer CrSBr and monolayer graphene, where interfacial charge transfer breaks the inversion symmetry of both magnetic order and crystallographic structure. The inversion symmetry breaking by charge transfer thus allows a full discrimination of the otherwise degenerate magnetic states using optical second harmonic generation, including the charge transfer induced intermediate magnetic states that consist of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic vdW interfaces. Furthermore, gate voltage enables the tuning of charge transfer, effectively modulating the interlayer magnetic coupling and magnetic transitions. Our findings deepen the understanding of optospintronic interaction and magnetoelectric manipulation in vdW magnets, paving the way for electrically tunable 2D spintronic devices.

 As epithelial cells polarize in the tissue plane, the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling module segregates two distinct molecular subcomplexes to opposite sides of cells. Homodimers of the atypical cadherin Flamingo form bridges linking opposite complexes in neighboring cells, coordinating their direction of polarization. Feedback is required for cell polarization, but whether feedback requires intercellular and/or intracellular pathways is unknown. Using novel tools, we show that cells lacking Flamingo, or bearing a homodimerization-deficient Flamingo, polarize autonomously, indicating that functional PCP subcomplexes form and segregate cell-autonomously. Furthermore, we identify feedback pathways and propose an asymmetry amplifying mechanism that operate cell-autonomously. The intrinsic logic of PCP signaling is therefore more similar to that in single cell systems than was previously recognized.

 The passive membrane permeation of small-molecule drugs and small hydrophobic peptides is relatively well understood. In contrast, how long polar peptides can pass through a membrane has remained a mystery. This process can be achieved with permeation enhancers, contributing significantly to the oral transcellular absorption of important peptide drugs like semaglutide — the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic, which is used as Rybelsus in a successful oral formulation. Here we now provide a detailed, plausible molecular mechanism of how such a polar peptide can realistically pass through a membrane paired with the permeation enhancer salcaprozate sodium (SNAC). We provide both simulation results, obtained with scalable continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations, and experimental evidence (NMR, DOSY, and DLS) to support this unique permeation mechanism. Our combined evidence points toward the formation of permeation-enhancer-filled, fluid membrane defects, in which the polar peptide can be submerged in a process analogous to quicksand.

 Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2 homobilayers at filling ν = − 1, considerable interest has arisen in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model.

 Wave reflection and refraction at a time interface follow different conservation laws compared to conventional scattering at a spatial interface. This study presents the experimental demonstration of refraction and reflection of flexural waves across a temporal boundary in a continuum-based mechanical metabeam, and unveils opportunities that emerge by tailoring temporal scattering phenomena for phononic applications. We observe these phenomena in an elastic beam attached to an array of piezoelectric patches that can vary in time the effective elastic properties of the beam. Frequency conversion and phase conjugation are observed upon a single temporal interface. These results are consistent with the temporal Snell’s law and Fresnel equations for temporal interfaces. Further, we illustrate the manipulation of amplitude and frequency spectra of flexural wave temporal refraction and reflection through multi-stepped temporal interfaces. Finally, by implementing a smooth time variation of wave impedance, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capabilities of the temporal metabeam to realize waveform morphing and information coding. Our findings enable precise control over wave amplitude and frequency through temporally modulated mechanical systems, providing a concrete framework for designing time-mechanical metamaterials and time-phononic crystals.

 Children born to women living with HIV (WLWH) suffer increased morbidity and, in low-income settings, have two to three times the mortality of infants born to women without HIV. The basis for this increase remains elusive. In low-income settings, breastfeeding is recommended because health benefits outweigh the risk of transmission, especially when maternal antiretroviral therapy is provided. We profile the milk metabolome of 326 women with and without HIV sampled longitudinally for 18 months postpartum using global metabolomics. We identify perturbations in several metabolites, including tryptophan, dimethylarginine, and a recently discovered antiviral ribonucleotide, that are robustly associated with maternal HIV infection. Quantitative tryptophan and kynurenine levels in both milk and plasma reveal that these perturbations reflect systemic depletion of tryptophan and alterations in tryptophan catabolism in WLWH. Finally, we validate these signatures of maternal HIV infection in an independent cohort of healthier WLWH. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that milk tryptophan content and availability decrease among WLWH, which may indicate perturbations in milk tryptophan catabolism. The link between this perturbation and the increased morbidity and mortality of children born to WLWH merits further investigation.

 Pure iodide formamidinium (FA) based-perovskite has emerged as highly promising candidates for perovskite photovoltaics, but it remains challenging to achieve long-term phase-stabilized FA-based perovskites. Herein, we present a physics-driven strategy of interfacial ferroelectricity, achieved by the integration of ferroelectric CsMnBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) into FA-based perovskites. The ferroelectric field generated by these NCs promotes FA+ cation ordering, modulates Pb–I framework, and enhances the structural regulation of the perovskite lattice. This synergistically increases the kinetic barrier for the undesired Pb-I octahedral transformation and raises the energy barrier for ion migration. The resulting perovskite materials exhibit high structure stability, enabling perovskite solar cell (PSC) minimodule to retain 99% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours’ stability testing under 85% relative humidity at 85 °C. Owing to the improvement at the interface, the PSCs yield an efficiency of 26.62% (certified 26.40%), and the minimodules reach 24.67% (certified 23.23%).

 The transition to a circular plastics economy is critical for mitigating plastic pollution and advancing global sustainability goals. As one of the most widely used synthetic polymers worldwide, the recycling of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) remains impeded by inefficient dechlorination and toxic chlorinated by-product formation. Here we show that a tailored LaFe0.3Al0.7O3 catalyst significantly enhances peroxymonosulfate activation to achieve stepwise PVC depolymerization. This system achieves complete conversion of PVC into CO2 and liquid organic products. Thus, valuable hydrocarbon compounds are obtained in high yields exceeding 90% among these liquids. Mechanistic studies reveal a cascade process: preferential chlorine removal mediated by singlet oxygen (1O2) followed by hydroxyl radical (⋅OH)-driven polymer backbone oxidation. The synergistic effect of 1O2 and ⋅OH resolves the key challenge of toxic by-products generated during dechlorination. A life-cycle assessment confirms that the process reduces carbon emissions by 45–99% and eco-costs by 51–99% across impact categories compared with conventional PVC waste treatment methods.

 Substantial ecological ramifications of moisture stress in ecosystems is called ecological droughts, and are largely unexplored for India. Here, we investigate ecological droughts, their drivers and implications in Indian Summer Monsoon during 2000–2019 based on remote sensing and machine learning. Ecological droughts are increasing in the ecologically fragile pristine forests and croplands that decline vegetation health in India. Meteorological aridity (23.9%) and ocean warming (18.2%) primarily drive the ecological droughts, as suggested by the Random Forest model. Causal analysis reveals that ocean warming indirectly triggers ecological droughts in India. The human intervention in forests also leads to their degradation. The rising ecological droughts due to changing vegetation-climate-human nexus in a shifting monsoon system is a concern for sustainability, food security and climate change mitigation in India. It is thus imperative to consider the ecological repercussions of droughts in policy making and combat their threats through judiciously engineered nature-based solutions.

 Ecosystem resilience represents the capacity to withstand and recover from perturbations, an important property for ecosystem function in an era of escalating disturbances. Whilst studies relate large-scale forest resilience to abiotic factors, knowledge gaps remain regarding the link to aspects of functional diversity, such as forest structural diversity (FSD), a factor controllable through management. Here we use spaceborne lidar-derived FSD to quantify its role in determining resilience in Southern and Central European forests. A random forest isolates the FSD-resilience interplay by disentangling confounding environmental factors. Results show a positive FSD-resilience relationship in 80% of forests. Canopy complexity is a better predictor of resilience than spatial variability in canopy height. This emergent relationship is explored as an adaptation measure to preserve resilience under warming scenarios, with the decline associated with 1 ∘C of warming compensated by a 10% increase in canopy complexity. The findings suggest that management promoting canopy complexity potentially compensates warming-driven declines in resilience.

 Volcanic eruptions are major perturbations to Earth’s biogeochemical cycles, yet their long-term effects on nutrient dynamics and ecosystem recovery remain unclear. Here we present high-resolution geochemical records from Late Ordovician marine and Middle Triassic lacustrine successions to investigate how airborne volcanic ash influenced carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our results reveal that volcanic ash deposition triggered contrasting redox responses in marine and lacustrine systems. In marine systems, ash input promoted persistent anoxia, suppressed nitrogen cycling, and delayed ecosystem recovery for millennia, and was further amplified by enrichment in toxic elements. In lacustrine systems, ash enhanced water-column oxygenation, reduced toxic stress, which stimulated nitrogen fixation and the growth of cyanobacteria, facilitating ecological recovery within decades. These findings demonstrate that volcanic ash drives contrasting biogeochemical responses in marine and lacustrine ecosystems, provide mechanistic insights into past ecosystem resilience, and offer a framework for predicting recovery under future volcanic and climatic disturbances.

 Achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals of holding global temperature rise well below 2 °C with efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C requires rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The built environment embodies substantial emissions, posing a challenge to meeting these goals. We quantify the carbon cost of constructing the global built-environment over the past three decades and project it to 2050. Our findings indicate that the global construction carbon footprint has doubled over the past three decades and is projected to more than double by 2050. In 2022, over half of the construction industry’s carbon emissions stemmed from cementitious materials, bricks, and metals, while glass, plastics, chemicals, and bio-based materials contributed 6%, and the remaining 37% arose from transport, services, machinery, and on-site activities. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the construction carbon footprint alone will exceed the per-annum carbon budget for the 1.5 °C and 2 °C goals in the next two decades. It will use up all remaining carbon budget for the 1.5 °C goal by 2050, as our analysis highlights. Therefore, we advocate for a material revolution, such as replacing traditional materials with biobased materials, which leverages economies of scale and paves the way for a transformative and sustainable future in construction.

 The high-quality global wave mode (WV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vignettes routinely collected by Sentinel-1 are today extensively exploited for various oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Yet, these observations remain largely untapped for iceberg monitoring in the Southern Ocean. As a follow-up to our previous work, a dedicated SAR image classifier is built to detect icebergs of sizes from meters to kilometers in length that are commonly underrepresented in current recording systems. It has been fine-tuned from the Inception-v3 deep convolutional neural network using a curated dataset of 2,062 iceberg and 15,338 non-iceberg cases. Independent evaluations, based on three additional datasets, achieve high precision and recall rates of over 90%. Applied to all WV images acquired between 2016 and 2018 unveils iceberg occurrences around Antarctica. About ∼7.5% of the detected icebergs drift into 40°S to 50°S latitudes, while the majority are concentrated poleward of 55°S. The seasonal patterns of SAR icebergs are generally consistent with altimeter-detection estimates and exhibit advances over the sea ice regions. Linking these WV SAR icebergs to the reported large icebergs reveals that the former are more likely to be located to the east of larger iceberg trajectories, suggesting that the primary driver of their drift is the underlying ocean currents. Although precise identification of the shape and position of these km-sized icebergs remains challenging, WV SAR vignettes provide added value to iceberg investigations at scales beyond current operational reports. Not only relevant for the precise monitoring of icebergs across a wider range of sizes, but it can also become instrumental for our understanding of iceberg tracking, associated dissolution, along with freshwater transport, and their broader impact on global and local climate processes."

 Tropical peatlands storing ∼18–25 % of global peat volume contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. To balance preservation and protection of tropical peatlands requires assessment of their ecohydrological conditions and continuous monitoring through seasons. This is challenging to achieve using in situ sampling, but there is a great promise to use C-band Sentinel-1 data for this due to its weather-independence, and particularly its increased acquisition capacity and spatial/temporal resolution compared to L- and P-band current sensors. Acknowledging that Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometry using C-Band Sentinel-1 data has been shown previously to be useful for retrieving peatland surface displacement, but also that the amplitude and phase of the SAR signal are dependent on surface hydrology; there remains a critical question about the extent to which the efficacy of SBAS approaches is themselves sensitive to surface hydrological conditions. This is a particular methodological concern in tropical peatlands due to the dynamically changing hydrological conditions arising from significant rainfall events, which can cause groundwater level (GWL) to vary from 1 m to −2 m. The research area was situated in lowland Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the 2017–2022 period. We used SBAS-derived ground displacements and compared to groundwater level (GWL) and peat surface elevation acquired from local networks of monitoring sites. Our work shows that the prevailing hydrological condition affects the area efficacy of the SBAS approach using C-band SAR data. When surface water significantly floods above the ground surface during the wet season, the coherence is not sustained for a long time. This is the opposite of the dry season, when coherence is preserved in longer intervals between acquisitions. Additionally, the range of correlation values between SBAS-derived displacements and in-situ peat surface and ground water table measurements is higher for the dry season than for the wet and whole hydrological year. We show that the SBAS approach can retrieve surface displacement for 34.4 % to 59.8 % on the peat soils of the tested area (391 to 826 km2), excluding areas of dense forests and open water, due to C-band SAR limitations, i.e. volume scattering mechanism and/or loss of signal coherence on water bodies. We show that appropriate hydrological conditions must be met to determine the change in water level above the ground surface. Too large fluctuations in water level may not be detected because of wavelength limitations, and outliers from the assumed linear model may be filtered out or removed due to the specific properties of this approach. These findings underpin the application of Sentinel-1C-band SAR for monitoring tropical peatlands' ecohydrological conditions."

 Groundwater is a critical resource for supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Mongolian Plateau (MP), which accounts for over 82 % of total water usage in Mongolia; however, its spatiotemporal dynamics remain underexplored. In this study, aiming to enhance the connection between the Groundwater Storage (GWS) and local SDG implementation, we established an integrated analytical framework encompassing groundwater change detection, driving force analysis, and groundwater sustainability assessment. This framework quantifies groundwater storage changes across the MP from April 2002 to December 2023. Results reveal an overall groundwater change rate of −2.96 mm/yr in the MP, which increases in the west and north and decreases in the east, center, and south. The Gobi area has shown increase trends in GWS. Attribution analysis reveals that areas with increasing GWS are more influenced by climatic conditions such as higher precipitation and lower evapotranspiration, while regions with significantly decreasing GWS are associated with insufficient natural recharge and stronger human activity intensity. By contrast, winter precipitation recharge played a crucial role in slowing down the decrease in groundwater storage. In the five major basins of the MP, the dominant factors leading to groundwater depletion varied and were driven by various social factors, such as population, livestock, agriculture, and mining. A dual-index classification combining precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P−ET) and GWS trends provides a convenient, interpretable and objective approach to assessing groundwater sustainability, offering strong correspondence with the Reliability–Resilience–Vulnerability (RRV) framework. This combined strategy not only captures groundwater trends but also enhances interpretability by linking local sustainability levels to both environmental and anthropogenic drivers, underscoring the need for targeted management to support SDG 6.6. The findings of the present study provide an accurate assessment framework and valuable scientific evidence for groundwater resource management in arid and semi-arid regions."

 The world is facing increasing land scarcity due to growing demand for agricultural products and urban expansion. At the same time, farmland abandonment is emerging as a widespread global land-use change phenomenon. Remote sensing plays a critical role in identifying abandonment across diverse farming systems. Here, we synthesized current knowledge through a systematic literature review of 131 publications to assess progress in remote-sensing-based monitoring of farmland abandonment. Our review highlights the growing use of remote sensing techniques and the increasing utility of multisource satellite data. However, research remains primarily skewed toward publicly available optical Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, with limited integration of other sources and a lack of global-scale assessments. We propose research directions to guide future studies, focusing on underrepresented land-use types, such as grasslands, terraces, and plantations, as well as regions like Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and South America. We emphasize the importance of diversifying data sources and integrating ancillary information, including cadastral data and historical land-use records, to better understand abandonment processes and associated vegetation changes. We advocate for multi-scale, temporally explicit analyses to improve scalability and enable the development of regional and continental products. As most studies focus on biophysical changes, future work should also consider socio-economic contexts and integrate remote-sensing-based proxies of land-use change. Finally, we recommend improving communication by clearly defining abandonment, providing visual examples, validating with diverse reference data, documenting uncertainty, and sharing data, code, and outputs."

 The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is widely used in forest ecosystem research. Photon cloud classification is crucial for ICESat-2's application in sub-canopy topography and forest structure parameter estimation. However, steep topography, complex canopy structure, and dense canopy cover are important error factors affecting the results of photon cloud classification in forest areas. The existing basic photon cloud classification methods classify ground and canopy photons based on the spatial distribution of photons in the elevation direction. However, in areas of steep topography, it is difficult for the existing photon cloud classification methods to distinguish ground photons from canopy photons because ground photons and some canopy photons will have the same elevation, making their characteristics unclear. In addition, the complex canopy structure and dense canopy cover cause the distribution of photons in the elevation direction to have complex multi-peak characteristics, increasing the difficulty of distinguishing ground photons from canopy photons. In this paper, we propose a novel photon cloud classification method coupling slope and complex canopy structure to account for the abovementioned error factors in photon cloud classification. The proposed model describes the spatial distribution of photons under various slopes and canopy structures based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the photon cloud elevation. The proposed model generates PDFs with simple or complex canopy structures under every slope to characterize the photons' spatial distribution in the elevation direction. A slope lookup table is then introduced to find the most appropriate PDF based on the constructed essential criteria with physical meaning. Finally, the coupling of the proposed model is solved by the most appropriate PDF, and the slope and photon cloud classification results can be obtained. The proposed model was tested in 130 forest plots covering various topographies and canopy structures. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved slopes, the RMSE of the classified ground photons, and the F-value of the ground photons classified by the proposed model reach 1.95°, 1.4 m, and 0.82, respectively. These accuracy indicators illustrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing basic models in the case of steep topography and complex forest structure. This study will substantially improve the accuracy of ground elevation and forest structure parameter estimation through the use of ICESat-2 data worldwide."

 Over the past four decades, forests have experienced major disturbances, highlighting the need for Near Real-Time (NRT) monitoring. Traditional optical-based detection is cloud-sensitive, whereas Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based frameworks enable all-weather observation. Yet, SAR monitoring has mainly focused on humid tropical forests, with reduced performance in regions showing strong seasonal backscatter variation, such as tropical savannas. Detecting small-scale forest loss also remains difficult due to the spatial resolution loss from speckle filtering. This paper presents an unsupervised SAR-based disturbance detection method with NRT capabilities, using Bayesian inference. Building on an existing methodology, the approach processes single-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR time series through Bayesian conjugate analysis. Forest disturbance is framed as a changepoint detection problem, where each new observation updates the probability of forest loss using prior information and a data model. The algorithm uses a hidden Markov chain to adapt recursively to seasonal variation and bypasses spatial filtering, preserving native data resolution and enhancing small-scale forest loss detection. Additionally, a methodology accounts for proximity to past disturbances. The method is tested on two 2020 reference datasets from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado savanna. The first covers small validation polygons (0.1–1 ha, excluding selective logging), totaling 2,650 ha in the Amazon and 450 ha in the Cerrado. The second includes larger clearings totaling 11,200 ha in the Amazon, and 12,700 ha in the Cerrado. A further comparison is conducted with operational NRT forest loss monitoring approaches. Results show substantial gains in detecting small-scale disturbances with reduced false alarms. In the Amazon, the method achieves an F1-score of 97.3% versus 93.1% for the current leading NRT approach. In the Cerrado, it reaches an F1-score of 97.4%, far exceeding the 33.3% of the optical-based method. For larger clearings, performance matches existing SAR approaches in the Amazon. While combined optical-SAR monitoring increases true positives, it also raises false alarm rates. In the Cerrado, the proposed method clearly outperforms optical monitoring, and in both regions it improves timeliness relative to individual operational approaches."

 Glaciers serve as sensitive indicators of climate change, influencing both regional water supplies and global sea-level rise. Contrasting to the global tendency towards retreat, glaciers in the Karakoram exhibits an unusual pattern of stability and modest thickening. However, the spatial variability and underlying causes of the mass balance anomalies remain insufficiently understood, primarily due to the limitations in previous measurement methods. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive geodetic analysis of glacier elevation changes in the central and eastern Karakoram, covering 681 glaciers of over 10,000 km2 between 2011 and 2019. The elevation was measured exclusively with TanDEM-X InSAR data to reduce penetration bias and temporal ambiguities.

In this framework, the first module generates high-quality InSAR DEM with an iterative approach to address the challenges of mountainous terrain for InSAR processing; the second module employed an innovative voids filling method using Gaussian Process Regression for robust elevation change mapping; and the third module incorporates a non-stationary uncertainty analysis for rigorous uncertainty quantification.

The spatial patterns of elevation change display pronounced heterogeneity and clear differences between surge-type and non-surge glaciers, reflecting the complex interplay of dynamic, climatic, and morphological factors in the region. This study demonstrates the capability of high-resolution TanDME-X InSAR DEM for accurate geodetic mass balance analysis in challenging mountain environments.

 Long-term time series of global leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) are required for characterizing vegetation dynamics in global change studies. The recently developed Copernicus Land Monitoring Service GEOV2-CLMS products were demonstrated to outperform other existing LAI and FAPAR products in terms of completeness, temporal smoothness, consistency across variables and accuracy. However, these GEOV2-CLMS products are derived from the SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V constellation with temporal coverage from 1999 to 2020 which limits its applicability for global change studies. We present here an adaptation of the GEOV2-CLMS algorithm to AVHRR to extend these time series and generate long-term global vegetation products from July 1981 to December 2022. The GEOV2-AVHRR algorithm was specifically designed to maximize the temporal consistency over the successive AVHRR sensors on board NOAA and MetOp-B satellites while keeping high agreement with GEOV2-CLMS products. Neural networks first transform AVHRR surface reflectance into LAI and FAPAR values at the daily time step. The daily estimates are then filtered, smoothed, gap filled and composited every 10-day.GEOV2-AVHRR showed accuracy error between −0.2 and 0.3 LAI and ∼ −0.03 FAPAR and uncertainty <1 LAI and ∼ 0.10–0.15 for woody and non-woody sites of both DIRECT2.1 and GBOV V3 datasets. GEOV2-AVHRR agreed well with GEOV2-CLMS (MODIS): 92 % (76 %) of land pixels are within ±max(20 %, 0.5) LAI and 71 % (34 %) within ±max(10 %, 0.05) FAPAR uncertainty requirements. The gap filling and temporal filters applied in GEOV2-AVHRR proved effective in improving the completeness (only 1 % of missing data) and temporal precision (smoothness) of LAI and FAPAR time series as compared to MODIS. The intra-annual consistency of GEOV2-AVHRR highly agree with GEOV2-CLMS, indicating it is mostly driven by the algorithm. On the contrary, the inter-annual consistency of LAI and FAPAR datasets appears to be very sensitive to the consistency of the input surface reflectance. GEOV2-AVHRR showed high stability as evaluated with MODIS LAI/FAPAR and improves the stability of GEOV2-CLMS. Some residual inter-annual inconsistencies from the transition to sensors are observed for GEOV2-AVHRR as well as for other long term AVHRR datasets (i.e. GIMMS, GLASS and C3S). GEOV2-AVHRR shows overall greening trends in ∼70 % (∼50 % significant at p < 0.05) of land pixels, and the magnitude and spatial pattern of trends highly agree with those of GIMMS."

 The Arctic Ocean constitutes a globally significant carbon sink, where carbon sequestration is predominantly mediated by the biological carbon pump (BCP). Quantifying BCP magnitude and efficiency persists as a key challenge in marine carbon cycle research. Net community production (NCP) serves as a critical proxy for quantifying carbon export fluxes and assessing carbon sequestration efficacy. This study introduces the Nitrate-based Semi-Analytical Model (NSAM), an innovative framework advancing Arctic NCP quantification through synergistic integration of satellite-based observations, biogeochemical model and hydrodynamic processes. By integrating seasonal nitrate budgets derived from satellite-based observations and reanalysis data using a machine learning algorithm, the NCP is computed by applying Redfield stoichiometry (C: N = 6.6) to convert seasonal nitrogen changes into carbon export estimates. Results demonstrate strong agreement between satellite-derived NCP and in situ measurements (RMSD = 9.52 mmol C m−2 d−1), underscoring the utility of NSAM for quantifying the Arctic BCP. Satellite-based NCP provides unprecedented pan-Arctic spatial coverage, overcoming the limitations of ship-based methods constrained to discrete cruise tracks. This advancement enables refined assessments of the Arctic Ocean's contribution to global carbon sequestration dynamics."

 Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images has become increasingly popular for a wide range of natural resource and urban application, yielding promising results. To an operational semantic segmentation mapping project, having more samples generally enables the model to better extract target features, achieving higher accuracies. However, annotating remote sensing image samples for model training is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Strategic sampling aims to minimize the efforts in collecting new training samples for a mapping project, which has been not well studied yet for semantic segmentation. To approach this topic, we employed a hybrid way for combining meta-analysis and case studies to investigate the best practices for strategic sampling. Three factors relating to strategic sampling will be investigated: sample size, distribution and transferring methods. We first reviewed 334 recently published papers that adopted semantic segmentation for operational mapping projects to summarize the current status of training sample design from various mapping scenarios. Subsequently, we constructed a large dataset of over 12,000 high-quality annotated image patches for cropland parcel mapping across five study sites, and evaluated various sampling strategies using a baseline segmentation model. We also proposed a novel balanced sampling method, which leveraged patch-based entropy and edge complexity to classify sample diversity. Our findings revealed that (1) both meta-analysis and the case studies suggested that ∼4 % of the total mapping patches were the optimal training sample size under random sampling, i.e., the minimum size to reach accuracy saturation; (2) compared to random sampling, the newly proposed balanced sampling was superior due to its decreasing the required sample size from ∼4 % to 2.5 % of the total patches in mapped areas; (3) sample transfer and model transfer present identical performance for relaxing the average local sample demand from 2.5 % to 0.5 % of total patches, with sample transfer being slightly more accurate than model transfer (Global Total-Classification errors: 0.298 vs 0.308). This study offers a heuristic framework for applying strategic sampling in semantic segmentation, providing valuable practical guidance for implementing deep learning in an operational scenario."

 Urban environments are characterized by continuous transformation, with new buildings, innovative infrastructures, evolving landforms, and emerging vegetation constantly reshaping the urban fabric. These dynamic changes create previously unannotated land cover classes that modify surface albedo, alter drainage patterns, and influence carbon storage, thereby affecting local climates, resource flows, and ecosystem services. Therefore, traditional land cover mapping methods based on static semantic labels are inherently limited. Even the most meticulously annotated datasets cannot comprehensively account for the full spectrum of urban classes. As urban environments continue to evolve, these static methods fail to capture the continual appearance of previously unannotated classes. This limitation leads to maps that quickly become outdated, incomplete, and imprecise, thereby impeding accurate environmental monitoring. To address this critical challenge, we propose Land Cover Discovery Mapping (LCDM), which integrates novel class discovery with land cover mapping, and we present an innovative end-to-end hybrid supervision framework, 3DLCDM, to implement LCDM in 3D remote sensing. The system has been tested on two high-resolution 3D point cloud datasets: one acquired via airborne LiDAR in Canada and the other obtained primarily using UAV-based LiDAR in Germany. Experimental results reveal that our 3DLCDM framework increases the mIoU for novel classes by up to 16.95% on the DALES dataset and up to 24.43% on the H3D dataset compared to baseline methods, demonstrating effective discovery capabilities under evaluation conditions that are procedurally equivalent to encountering genuinely novel urban features in practice. The proposed 3DLCDM framework demonstrates the potential to enable the continuous generation of up-to-date land cover maps that capture dynamic changes in urban morphology, thereby significantly advancing land cover discovery mapping. Furthermore, strong generalization across multiple datasets and urban feature types demonstrates the robustness of the framework’s discovery mechanisms and its capability to deliver high-fidelity maps that scale across diverse urban environments."

 Accurate topographic phase removal in Differential InSAR (DInSAR) processing relies on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), yet limitations in DEM accuracy and currency hinder precise surface displacement measurement. Although modern SAR satellites feature a relatively narrow orbit tube, the phases induced by DEM errors cannot be safely ignored especially in areas under rapid urbanization. Current Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) methods, which estimate DEM errors alongside deformation, suffer from potential biases due to inaccurate deformation models and high computational cost from per-point processing. We present here a novel detection-and-estimation strategy for efficient DEM error mitigation. Our key innovation is a phase gradient direction consistency (GDC) criterion, which provides a direct and intuitive visualization of pixels affected by DEM errors (PEEs)—a capability not previously available. This is a significant advancement as it allows targeted correction instead of exhaustive estimation. We further develop a generalizable framework for DEM error retrieval applicable to various scenarios. Validation with simulated and real-world data from urban and mountainous environments demonstrates effective separation of DEM errors from various spatiotemporal deformation signals. In addition, the proposed method achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in processing efficiency compared to conventional approaches. By directly identifying and estimating DEM errors from wrapped phases, our approach streamlines deformation retrieval and is readily integrated into existing MT-InSAR workflows."

 Crown base height (CBH) is essential for characterizing forest vertical structure over time for sustainable forest management and serves as a key input in fire model and growth model. At plot level, the average CBH (CBHa) is mainly used to assess tree growth and construct biomass models while the minimum CBH (CBHmin) can indicate the fire risk and fire behaviour. However, there are currently few CBH products available at a national or global scale. Close-range light detection and ranging (Lidar) has shown great potential in collecting plot-level forest structure parameters and can be easily scaled up to national or global scale. But considering the integrity of point clouds, CBH estimation utilizing airborne Lidar data would be always overestimated compared with other close-range Lidar data such as TLS data or backpack data. This is mainly because of the significant difference in density between the upper and lower point clouds, as well as lacking considering the tree shape. By filling the point clouds with the same density and lowering the CBH condition which considers the tree shape, we proposed an improved CBH estimation method to reduce the overestimation when using airborne Lidar data. Verified by field-measured data in six plots, the proposed method improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by nearly 50 % compared with the original method. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.694 m, R2 was 0.777 and the RMSE was 1.039 m for the validation trees. Facing different sensors and point densities, this method generally generates stable CBH estimation results. Then, we developed a newly tree-based framework that uses machine learning and multiple source remote sensing data for generating CBH products across China. We collected over 1117 km2 close-range Lidar data and used the proposed method for estimating CBH. The CBH estimation results were converted to average value and minimum value in a 1 km × 1 km plot and served as training data to generate CBH maps across China at 1 km resolution. To our best knowledge, this is the first CBH map across China, and also the first national-scale average and minimum CBH maps around the world. The results showed that the average CBHa and CBHmin were 6.76 m and 2.70 m with standard deviations of 1.59 m and 0.85 m. The methods and maps would provide a new dimension in monitoring changes in forest structure, assessing fire risk and constructing biomass models in future studies."

 The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Global Land Surface Phenology (GLSP) product (VNP22Q2 C2) has been operationally produced since 2013, and is designed to provide annual measurements of the phenologies of vegetated land surfaces at the global scale, succeeding the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product (MCD12Q2 C61), which was first produced in 2001. Although separate validations have been conducted locally to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the detected phenometrics for each product, a comprehensive understanding of the differences between these two operational products is important for downstream applications. Therefore, this study conducted critical analyses and cross-comparisons of the land surface phenology (LSP) products to ensure long-term continuity in the global phenological dynamics. Specifically, we compared five LSP products at 500 m spatial resolution: two NASA operational products of MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2, as well as three other LSP products that were generated by applying the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm to different time series from NOAA-20 VIIRS only, both SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, and MODIS on Aqua and Terra. First, we cross-validated the five products at 500 m using a high-quality reference LSP dataset at 30 m that was generated by fusing the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with near-surface PhenoCam time series across diverse ecosystems in North America, Europe, and Japan. Second, cross-comparisons were conducted between the five LSP products at 500 m across 12 golden tiles. Third, the long-term comparability and continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and the VNP22Q2 C2 products were assessed globally. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that the VNP22Q2 C2 product provides overall global continuity for the MCD12Q2 C61 record. Compared to independent reference data from the HLS-PhenoCam LSP product, the four LSP products derived from the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm produced highly comparable results with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of ∼ 11 days and mean systematic bias (MSB) of ∼ 7 days. The cross-comparisons indicated a strong agreement among the five 500 m LSP products in the 12 selected golden tiles with MADs < 7 days; however, their agreement with the MCD12Q2 C61 was slightly lower with MADs ∼ 9–10 days. The global-scale evidence of continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2 products was an absolute difference of < 15 days, except in arid/semiarid, tropical, and high-latitude ecosystems. Finally, it is suggested that (1) the continuity from MODIS to VIIRS LSP products would be enhanced if the same phenological detection algorithm was applied to the MODIS data, and (2) the quality of the VIIRS GLSP product could be improved by integrating data from multiple VIIRS sensors."

 Sand ripples, shaped by fluid flow like wind or water, are common on dunes on Earth and Mars. Their patterns reveal local transport conditions, offering insights into wind regimes where direct observations are lacking. Since manual mapping is slow and subjective, automated methods are essential for consistent large-scale analysis.

Tested on 42 barchan dunes across six Martian regions, the U-Net showed reliable ripple classification (F1-score 79 %), while the variogram method achieved high accuracy for ripple spacing (R2 = 0.78) and orientation (R2 = 0.98).

 Timely and reliable building damage assessment is essential for effective disaster response and humanitarian assistance. However, the diversity of disaster types, geographic regions, and data distributions poses significant challenges to transferring building damage assessment models to new disaster scenarios (i.e., target domains). In addition, limited availability of post-disaster training imagery in target domains further hinders progress. Recent approaches, such as single-temporal change adaptation, enable adaptation using only target pre-disaster images by constructing pseudo bitemporal damage samples at an unexplainable embedding level. While effective, these methods produce representations that are difficult for human experts to interpret, inspect for errors, or adjust categorical distributions to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we propose Neural Disaster Simulation (NeDS), a deep disaster generative model that synthesizes realistic post-disaster image from pre-event image and customizable disaster information (i.e., disaster types and disaster intensity). Thanks to damage data generation based solely on pre-event imagery, NeDS enables adaptation at any time, effectively bypassing the limitation of post-disaster training image availability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling disaster effects at the image level, NeDS mitigates distribution shifts between historical training data and unseen disaster events, enhancing both model transferability and visual interpretability. Extensive experiments conducted on both global-scale and local-scale study areas demonstrate that NeDS adaptation outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving a 4.3% improvement in average performance on a global dataset, as well as 3.6%, 7.9%, and 18.5% gains in damage classification performance for the 2025 Eaton fire, the 2025 Palisades fire in Los Angeles, and the 2025 Nigeria flooding, respectively."

 The VIIRS was designed in recognition of the need for long-term observations in support of global-change science and to provide MODIS observation continuity. The NASA MODIS burned area (BA) product (MCD64A1) has been generated systematically for nearly 25 years and maps globally the approximate day of burning at 500-m resolution. We describe the follow-on NASA Collection 2 VIIRS BA product (VNP64A1) that became available in October 2024 and provides global BA mapping from 2012 into the next decade. The product is derived using an adaptation of the Collection 6.1 MCD64A1 BA mapping algorithm and using the same sinusoidal grid and 500-m reporting resolution. Annual and monthly intercomparisons of the VPN64A1 and MCD64A1 products at global and continental/regional scales indicate high product BA reporting consistency. Approximately 2.6 % of the land surface was mapped as burned annually; VNP64A1 mapped slightly more than MCD64A1 but with 0-day median burn-date reporting differences. A global (Stage-3) product validation, using 561 interpreted Landsat image pairs, was undertaken and the VNP64A1 product had estimated 36.7 % commission and 72.4 % omission errors, compared to MCD64A1 34.2 % commission and 71.5 % omission errors. Product accuracies were also characterized using metrics derived from the weighted regression (to incorporate sample inclusion probabilities) between 5-km BA proportions in the products and the Landsat data. The omission and commission errors observed at 30-m were largely compensated at 5-km, with coefficient of determination (0.70), slope (0.83), and intercept (−0.0006) terms for the VNP64A1 product nearly identical to those of MCD64A1.

 Models to simulate solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are widely used to interpret fluorescence observations across scales. However, leaf fluorescence spectra models often mix-use the plate model and Kubelka-Munk (KM) model, which differ in their assumptions in the internal scattering within a leaf and brings in uncertainty in explaining SIF observations. Additionally, fluorescence photons are not conserved in spectral models due to their use of a sigmoid function to adjust the fluorescence emission spectrum dependent on excitation wavelength. To resolve these problems in SIF simulation, we present a new spectral model, Platespect. It is based on the plate model that can compute backward and forward leaf fluorescence spectra and also rescales the raw fluorescence emission spectrum to conserve fluorescence photons. We theoretically compared the fluorescence simulations from Platespect and Fluspect, which adopts the commonly used KM model, at the leaf and canopy scales; we also evaluated them with leaf-level backward fluorescence observations. At the leaf level, although Platespect predicted fluorescence magnitudes similar to those of Fluspect, it showed substantial differences in the backward and forward fluorescence spectra. Accounting for scattering among leaf plates in Fluspect helps reduce the difference. Platespect predicted a higher far-red fluorescence due to the rescaled fluorescence spectra emitted by longer wavelength light. When fitted against leaf-level observations, Platespect performed slightly better in the red fluorescence region, but all models showed a systematically biased fluorescence spectrum. Assessed at the canopy level, Platespect-based simulations predicted a higher SIF and higher sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll content. Our results highlight the necessity of better representing the scattering among plates, improving the raw fluorescence emission spectrum, and conserving emitted fluorescence photons to improve the simulation of SIF across scales."

 The timing of harvesting is crucial for determining crop yield potential as it influences the final stages of the crop growth cycle and affects crop grain quality. Early harvesting can lead to yield losses from excessive moisture and insufficient dry matter, while delayed harvesting can degrade grain quality due to over-maturation and increased susceptibility to weather, pests, and diseases. Accurate monitoring of harvest timing is essential to assess yield gaps, support profitable and sustainable farming practices, and optimize agricultural supply chains. However, remote sensing-based harvesting date detection methods often suffer from biases due to the inconsistent relationship between end-of-season (EOS) metrics in vegetation index (VI) time series and actual harvesting dates. This inconsistency occurs because harvesting decisions are often influenced by human factors such as equipment availability, labor constraints, and fuel costs, rather than plant condition alone. In this study, we develop a novel Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI) that integrates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance to accurately monitor whether fields of corn and soybean have been harvested. Leveraging the distinct separability of NIR reflectance for corn and soybean before harvesting (senescent plants) and after harvesting (crop residue), combined with the contrasting trends between NIR and NDVI during this transition, the NIR-to-NDVI ratio amplifies the harvesting signal in its time series, making it a robust indicator of harvesting events. As the first spectral index designed for scalable identification of crop harvesting stage, the developed NHPI is applied to map harvesting dates for corn and soybean fields across the U.S. Midwest from 2020 to 2023 using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery via Google Earth Engine (GEE). At the field level, the NHPI-based harvesting date estimation method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4 days and an R2 of 0.85 when compared against field-recorded harvesting dates, significantly outperforming all advanced harvesting date estimation benchmarks (i.e., EOS phenometric-based method, shape model fitting method (SMF), and shape model fitting by the separate phenological stage method (SMF-S). The NHPI-based harvesting date mapping also shows strong alignment with the state-level cumulative distribution of harvesting dates of the USDA crop progress reports, achieving an average MAE of 3 days. Further analysis of NHPI values before and after harvesting events reveals its strong adaptability to diverse weather conditions at large scales, highlighting its efficiency and robustness."

 The prediction of fire-induced tree mortality is important for evaluating potential timber volume losses, replanting costs, and for assessing how mortality will impact long-term yield and carbon dynamics. However, current methods do not provide spatially explicit predictions, limiting the use of this data for proactive forest management, such as thinning and reducing fuel load to reduce tree mortality. In this study we assess whether the incorporation of individual tree inventory data derived from airborne laser scanning and modeled and observed fire intensity data can provide accurate spatially explicit tree mortality predictions. Specifically, tree-level mortality was predicted for over 1.9 million trees within six wildfires in mixed coniferous forest in northwestern Montana, USA, and validated using high resolution imagery for each segmented tree crown. Random forest classification models utilizing observed fire intensity metrics derived from VIIRS observations were the most accurate (overall accuracy: 77.2 %), followed by random forest classification models utilizing modeled fire intensity (64.5–66.1 %) and those that utilized existing logistic regression relationships (55.7–59.0 %). The random forest tree mortality models also produced lower RMSE (6.3–10.2 %) and bias (1.7–3.7 %) compared to the logistic regression approach (RMSE: 38.4 %, bias: −29.6 %) when mortality accuracy was assessed across tree size class. The predictor variable importance quantification showed that fire intensity metrics were more important than species and structural variables in the mortality classification. Ultimately, this study contributes to the remote sensing of fire effects and fire science fields by developing a remote sensing-based methodology for predicting spatially explicit individual tree mortality across large spatial extents."

 Moisture content is a critical parameter for estimating the strength of partially saturated sand for engineering challenges such as beach trafficability. A framework for estimating the volumetric moisture content of sandy beaches using satellite-based HH-polarized X-band synthetic aperture radar imagery is presented and used to test the applicability of three theoretical scattering models: Oh, Dubois, and the Integral Equation Model (IEM). The developed framework relies on the measured backscatter coefficient, soil surface root-mean square (RMS) height, and the geometric characteristics of the image. Models for estimating the RMS height were developed based on field measurements for two distinct sites composed of predominately quartz sand and approximately uniform beach slopes: Duck, North Carolina and Cannon Beach in Yakutat, Alaska. The models were developed and tested for incidence angles of 23.3°-54.2° using data obtained from the Cosmo-SkyMED and TerraSAR-X satellites. Four sets of RMS height models were tested: Oh with moisture contents greater than 0 %, Oh with moisture contents greater than a very dry threshold, Dubois, and the IEM. Unique RMS height models, specific to a moisture content model, were developed for incidence angles ranging from a single incidence angle to a range of consecutive incidence angles. Applying the RMS height models, the root mean square error (RMSE) of moisture content was 0.7–6.9 %. Images with incidence angles of 30°- 46° and 40°-50° resulted in the best estimates of moisture content when compared to other ranges of incidence angles for the models tested. Deviations generally represented underestimates of the moisture content (0.1 %–1.3 %), with greater underestimates observed for the IEM. Spatial estimates of moisture content resulted in two distinct zones, one with low moisture contents and a second with slightly elevated moisture contents for all models except the IEM. Challenges associated with differences in scattering mechanisms, a lack of data with high moisture content, and sensitivity of models to small changes in RMS height are discussed."

 Phenolics are a rarely quantified plant biochemical trait that plays a vital role in plant physiology and ecosystem functioning, contributing to plant's chemical defence and influencing nutrient cycling and soil microbial compositions. Spatially continuous information on foliar phenolics is essential for assessing plant health and ecosystem functional diversity. However, previous efforts to predict and map phenolics have been confined to aircraft-based hyperspectral data in limited biomes. The potential of next-generation imaging spectroscopy, whether airborne- or spaceborne-based, for mapping phenolics remains underexplored, particularly in structurally complex and heterogeneous ecosystems such as European mixed temperate forests. Furthermore, much is still unknown about the consistency and uncertainties of predicting forest canopy phenolics across different acquisition levels (airborne vs. spaceborne), limiting our ability to generalise and upscale local trait estimates to broader spatial extents. In this study, we sampled sunlit top-of-canopy leaves from three dominant tree species across mixed temperate forests in southeast Germany. Leveraging next-generation airborne (AVIRIS-NG) and spaceborne (PRISMA) imaging spectroscopy (400–2400 nm), we modelled two ecologically important phenolics (total phenol and tannin) expressed in three forms (foliar mass-based, foliar area-based, and canopy-based). The predictive accuracy of two data-driven approaches, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR), was compared to assess performance across different spatial scales. Our results demonstrate that phenolics in sunlit canopy leaves can be accurately estimated from both airborne and spaceborne data, with foliar area-based phenolics showing the strongest relationship with spectral reflectance (total phenol: R2 = 0.64–0.69, NRMSE = 13.28%–15.65%; tannin: R2 = 0.49–0.65, NRMSE = 15.86%–21.29%). We observed several similar patterns in model coefficients across airborne and satellite levels, with informative wavelengths aligning with known phenolic features. While the model accuracy declined slightly when scaling from canopy to landscape scale, phenolic maps derived from AVIRIS (aggregated to 30 m) and PRISMA showed good spatial agreement and linearity (GPR: r = 0.68, slope = 0.86; PLSR: r = 0.57, slope = 0.49). These maps successfully captured inter- and intra-species phenolic variability across the test site with low prediction uncertainty. Our findings provide valuable insights into mapping canopy traits across different observational scales, demonstrating how next-generation imaging spectroscopy can characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant phenolics. This research paves the way for improved global monitoring of ecosystem functioning, as well as the pattern of phenolics across forested landscapes and trees' potential ‘chemical’ defences against herbivory and other environmental stressors."

 Reliable flood inundation modelling in complex river systems that are poorly instrumented is often limited by inaccuracies in open source DEMs, particularly near river channels and vegetated regions. This study proposes a methodology to correct and enhance resolution of satellite based DEMs in floodplain areas with ICESat-2 land elevation, Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, and a simple artificial neural network (ANN). FabDEM (30-m) is selected as the base DEM, and the ANN is trained to correct elevation errors at 10-m resolution using spectral bands from Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 ATL03 elevation. The corrected ANN DEM reduces the mean squared error by 7 cm on average and up to 38 cm in the areas closer to the main river channel. MIKE 21 is used to simulate 2D flood extent maps for four different events, that consider in-situ discharge values at high, medium and low flow, comparing modelled flood extent with observed surface water extent (SWE) maps derived from Sentinel-2 at the selected dates. To ensure that improvements are attributed to DEM corrections rather than hydraulic parametrization, simulations are performed with different uniform values of the Gauckler-Strickler coefficient Ks, which are kept consistent across FabDEM and ANN DEM based scenarios. The critical success index (CSI), F1- score and bias are calculated for simulations with FabDEM and ANN DEM. Across all events, the ANN DEM improves flood simulation accuracy, increasing the Critical Success Index (CSI) and F1 score by up to 19 % and 13 %, respectively, and reducing bias by up to 25 %. This workflow demonstrates a scalable and efficient approach to improve hydraulic model inputs in data-scarce floodplain environments, offering valuable insights for flood risk assessment and water resource management in remote regions."

 This paper investigates a crossover adjustment method for spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) phase altimetry and demonstrates its capability for precise surface elevation mapping through a case study of Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe and exhibits unmodeled gravitational effects on its water surface. GNSS-R phase altimetry measures relative surface height with a constant but unknown offset and may also include errors in the retrieved surface gradients due to factors such as the residual atmospheric propagation error after model correction. The crossover adjustment method estimates the offsets between multiple GNSS-R tracks and each track’s surface gradient errors by formulating and solving a constrained least-squares problem to minimize differences at intersections. Additionally, this method evaluates the accuracy of GNSS-R altimetry retrievals by comparing the consistency of each track with others, enabling the identification of measurement outliers with respect to stable geophysical features. In the case study, we utilize 871 sets of Spire grazing-angle GNSS-R data collected from 2020 to 2023, containing signals coherently reflected off Lake Ladoga, to map the unmodeled gravitational effects on the lake’s water surface.

 Mangroves play a crucial role in coastal ecosystem, providing indispensable benefits such as sustaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and supporting global productivity. Nevertheless, the long-term survival of these critical habitats is jeopardized by a combination of anthropogenic pressures and natural disturbances. Accurate monitoring of vegetation functional traits, specifically Leaf Area Index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (CHL), is imperative for evaluating the physiological condition of mangrove stands. However, the interaction between LAI and spectral resolution (Spr) in CHL retrieval remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study developed a first-order derivative-weighted spectral angle mapping (FWS) method to quantify the relationships of spectral reflectance across three CHL grades (CHL-Low, CHL-Middle, CHL-High) and three LAI gradients (LAI-Low, LAI-Middle, LAI-High). Our results revealed that spectral reflectance in the 400–800 nm range was negatively correlated with CHL, which stood in contrast to its positive correlation with LAI. We subsequently optimized a mean resample correlation analysis (MRCA) method to identify CHL-sensitive spectral domains, and our results confirmed that these domains were predominantly distributed in the ranges of 466–780 nm (CHL-L), 520–776 nm (CHL-M), and 520–779 nm (CHL-H). To identify optimal wavelengths, we applied the central wavelength matching method (CWMM). Results confirmed that these optimal wavelengths matched the central wavelengths of SDGSAT-1 and Sentinel-2 spectral bands, and we subsequently constructed 84 inversion schemes. This study constructed two mechanism-guided active learning hybrid models (PROSAIL-AL-RF and PROSAIL-AL-NGB). These models achieved robust CHL estimation for the high chlorophyll content grade (CHL-H), with R2 values ranging from 0.441 to 0.894. Notably, PROSAIL-AL-RF exhibited more robust and consistent accuracy than PROSAIL-AL-NGB in most scenarios. Cross-regional inversion experiments for CHL showed that the hybrid models exhibited reliable performance, with R2 values of 0.748 for PROSAIL-AL-NGB and 0.740 for PROSAIL-AL-RF.

In addition, satellite-derived diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm [Kd(490)], which measures the water turbidity, is also found to be sensitive to the effect of mesoscale eddies. However, it has been found that a single parameter of SSH, SST or Chl-a is often not reliable to accurately detect ocean eddies. In this study, we propose a deep convolution neural network (CNN)-based model that incorporates three parameters, Chl-a, Kd(490), and SST, for eddy detection. In our implementation of neural networks, the image of each parameter of Chl-a, Kd(490), and SST runs through a separate encoding–decoding path to obtain its single-parameter based feature map of oceanic eddies. The three feature maps are then concatenated and convolved by a convolution layer, before the final “softmax” activation layer is applied to perform pixel-wise classification for eddy detection. The networks are tested in the Gulf of America (GoA) and the Gulf Stream Extension (GSE) region. It is found that the single-parameter of SST model does not always detect eddies in the GoA, while the single-parameter model of Chl-a or Kd(490) sometime misses eddy detections in the GSE region. However, three-parameter combined model is always reliable to accurately detect the anticyclone and cyclonic eddies of interests in the GoA and GSE. The eddy detection of the single-parameter models and the combined model are quantitatively evaluated, showing that the three-parameter combined model performed significantly better than all single-parameter models."

 Estimating landslide volumes remains challenging because of the limited availability of high-resolution terrain data. Traditional methods often rely on empirical area-to-volume conversion formulas, which introduce significant uncertainties due to terrain variability and simplified assumptions. This study proposes a deep learning framework that integrates multitemporal satellite imagery, LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), terrain attributes, and a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to simulate the DEM of Difference (DoD) and estimate landslide-induced volumetric changes. The input DEMs were resampled to 20-meter resolution for publicly available coverage exceeding 78,183 km2. A total of 2,881 map frames contained two DEM epochs, and 348 frames had three epochs, with time intervals typically ranging from 5 to 8 years. From these, 198 deep-seated landslide cases were extracted for analysis, covering approximately 7.12 km2, including 4.89 km2 of erosion area and 2.23 km2 of deposition area. The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 0.66, with F1-scores of 0.46 for erosion, 0.30 for deposition, and 0.78 for background. Volumetric estimations revealed a consistent underestimation trend, with median erosion errors of approximately − 50 % and deposition errors approaching − 100 % across the five-fold cross-validation. The framework effectively captures three-dimensional spatial distributions and enables accurate volumetric estimation without the need for post-event DEMs, offering a practical solution for data-scarce regions. Additionally, it enhances sediment volume assessments that are crucial for disaster prevention and sediment management, bridging the gap between empirical estimation and modern deep learning techniques."

 In 2024, China experiences frequent and severe hydrological extremes, including record-breaking rainfall and widespread droughts, reflecting the intensifying impacts of climate change. The significant changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) caused by these extreme precipitation events require more detailed analysis to assess short-term hydrological dynamics. Here, we first analyze precipitation anomalies (PA) and percentage of PA (PPA) across mainland China from April to August 2024. The results reveal that PA and PPA in most regions exhibit extreme values in different months, resulting in severe droughts, floods, and abrupt drought-to-flood transitions. To assess the associated water storage changes, we define and apply the terrestrial water flux (TWF), the differenceof GRACE/GRACE-FO-derived TWS anomalies in two adjacent months, as a diagnostic indicator of short-term hydrological variability. Relative to 2002–2024, the grids with TWF percentiles within the 0-10th and 90-100th ranges respectively account for 36.52%, 46.22%, 44.79%, and 46.48% of the total grids from April to August in China. Additionally, 19.89% of grids have the maximum TWF value in 2024. These extremes closely align with variations in precipitation, suggesting that intensified TWF is primarily driven by meteorological factors rather than GRACE-FO data uncertainties. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of TWF in capturing rapid hydrological changes under climate extremes. The findings provide critical insights into the impacts of climate change on regional hydrological processes and offer a valuable reference for future climate risk management and adaptation strategies at both national and global scales."

This study proposes a novel method combining statistical modeling with land cover data processed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate blast and thermal radiation effects.

 Snow and ice are among the most important components of the cryosphere; therefore, accurate identification of snow and ice is key to improve the understanding of the influence of various studies on global warming, e.g., studies on global water cycling, climate change and the radiation budget balance. The spectral information at single-view, e.g., the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) has been widely used in the recognition of snow cover at both local and global scales. However, special information sources related to the angular pattern of snow reflectance have rarely been considered in such applications. In this study, we proposed an angular index named the snow anisotropic reflectance index (SARI) based on the RossThick–LisparseReciprocal–Snow (RTLSRS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to achieve snow identification. The POLarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances (POLDER) database is one of the most widely-used multiangular database because of the abundant measurements and the pixels marked as “snow” are served as the data foundation in this study. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of multiangular information to differentiate these pixels over Arctic in various situations. First, we preprocess the POLDER snow database to select the pixels with a good BRDF sampling distribution. Then, the SARI is used to preliminarily classify these POLDER datasets as snow and nonsnow, together with the classification result derived by single-view reflectances as comparison in the red and NIR bands. Next, the classification result is validated by using the MODIS MOD10A2 product. Finally, further analysis of the BRDF variations, regarding the SARI, for the classification results is performed by using the ArcticDEM and the Arctic Vegetation Map, a more detailed snow BRDF database over Arctic is obtained. The main results are as follows: (1) The potential of multiangular information (SARI) in recognizing snow had been confirmed according to MOD10A2 product as indirect validation data, the overall accuracy can reach to 86.9%, higher than the conventional single-view method (81.7%). (2) Within–pixel variations in surface terrain and components have a significant influence on the variability in BRDF shapes in the forward and backward scattering directions; in turn, these variations can be easily captured by using several simple thresholds for subcategorization for this POLDER snow database in Arctic Circle. Finally, this study provides a detailed POLDER database over Arctic and explain BRDF variations in various situations, facilitates the future potential applications of the remote sensing community."

 Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for understanding land–atmosphere interactions, hydrology, and ecological dynamics. While thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has traditionally been used for LST retrieval, its effectiveness is limited by cloud cover and atmospheric interference. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing offers a significant advantage by enabling all-weather LST retrieval, as microwave signals can penetrate clouds and precipitation. However, PMW-based LST observations from a single satellite platform suffer from significant orbital gaps, particularly in middle and low latitudes, due to the limited swath width of current sensors. Additionally, the intraday revisit frequency of PMW LST is constrained to a maximum of two times per day (ascending and descending modes), which is insufficient for capturing rapid diurnal temperature variations or supporting high-temporal-resolution applications.In this study, therefore, we address these limitations by proposing an innovative framework for intraday LST estimation with enhanced spatial coverage. This is achieved by fusing PMW data from two polar-orbiting satellites, Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) and Fengyun-3F (FY-3F), which operate at different equatorial crossing times. A sophisticated gap-filling algorithm is introduced, leveraging temporally adjacent LST estimates from intraday brightness temperature (TB) observations. Results demonstrate that the gap-filled LST from the optimal data fusion scheme exhibits a minimal positive bias of approximately 0.1–0.2 K compared to the original LST retrievals, while achieving an intraday revisit frequency of up to four times per day in middle latitudes. This represents a significant improvement over the pre-gap-filling frequency of 2.5 times per day. The framework not only enhances the spatial coverage of PMW-based LST but also provides a foundation for future satellite missions to further improve global LST monitoring. By enabling all-weather, high-frequency LST observations, this framework advances our understanding of land–atmosphere interactions, supports climate modeling, and enhances environmental monitoring capabilities."

 The centimeter level deformation generated by small and medium-sized earthquakes contains rich information on tectonic activity, which is of great value for improving the coseismic deformation database and fault dynamics models. InSAR is an important means of observing coseismic deformation, but there is a problem of insufficient observation accuracy for centimeter level coseismic deformation in complex environments. Time-series InSAR advances achieve millimeter-scale deformation monitoring, yet detecting subtle coseismic signals from Mw 5.0–6.5 earthquakes remains challenging in complex environments by computational limits and step-like model discontinuities. We develop a method incorporating SBAS-InSAR and a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) step function to overcome these barriers.

(2) It enhances displacement field accuracy with 18–61 % noise suppression and the reliability of finite fault inversion. The model enables seconds deformation estimation for single earthquakes on standard hardware, advancing detection thresholds to sub-centimeter levels in high-coherence region.

 The concept of city image plays a pivotal role in urban branding, serving as a strategic tool for promoting sustainable urban development. A city’s image not only shapes its identity but also enhances its global competitiveness, attracting tourism, investment, and new residents. Traditional media such as newspapers and television offer limited perspectives on city image, whereas emerging platforms like short video apps provide richer and more diverse insights. Nevertheless, existing studies remain dominated by traditional media analysis, with insufficient examination of how short video platforms represent the spatial, landscape, social, and emotional dimensions of a city’s image. This study proposed a novel approach by leveraging the diverse and extensive short video data from Douyin to thoroughly deconstruct Shanghai’s comprehensive city image. We constructed a geotagged short video database, categorizing landscape and social images based on visual features and assessing emotional tones through audio-text analysis. The findings revealed distinct spatial patterns, with core areas highly concentrated and peripheral areas more dispersed. The analysis further identified nine core image areas, three major development axes, and ten prominent zones that defined Shanghai’s unique geographic and cultural identity. This approach could provide a quantitative characterization of city image, highlighting the potential for improved public space design and enhanced citizen engagement through short videos. Moreover, these results underscored the significant role of social media platforms, especially short video apps, in shaping public perception of cities.

 Accurate tree species mapping is essential for effective forest management but is often constrained by manual, labour-intensive workflows that limit scalability. While airborne laser scanning (ALS) supports large-scale forest attribute prediction, species classification remains difficult in complex, multi-species forests. To address this, we propose an automated, data-driven dual-stream deep learning framework that integrates ALS data with point-cloud metrics to identify individual tree species. Our framework incorporates an automated approach to individual tree segmentation and species labelling using existing forest inventory and field data, resulting in a dataset of 16,269 labelled individual tree point-clouds of four species across a 630,000 ha boreal mixed species forest in Ontario, Canada. Our dual-stream deep learning model integrates a Point Extractor to generate feature representations from raw ALS point-clouds and a complementary Metrics Network to process the point-cloud metrics. Results, based on the split test set of 2441 trees, showed that the inclusion of the Metrics Network improved tree species classification accuracy by approximately 11 % compared to models that rely solely on the Point Extractor. A weighted F1-score of 0.70 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 was achieved using this dual-stream approach, along with enhanced predictive probabilities for all species thus improving the reliability of the predicted results. This approach reduces the manual processing bottleneck of individual tree segmentation and labelling and demonstrates the value of combining raw point-clouds and point-cloud metrics into a deep learning framework, offering a scalable and operational solution for reliable species predictions."

Italy was selected as a representative case study as harvest statistics are missing or partially inconsistent, which is also the case for other European countries.We highlighted that no data source, considered individually, can provide a comprehensive estimate of the harvest level and its evolution in time.Between 2000 and 2023, total fellings ranged from a peak of 16.5 million m3 in 2006 to a low of 10.4 million m3 in 2014.A near real-time assessment of the harvest level, such as estimated within our study, is increasingly important to quantify the impact of human activities on forest ecosystems. According to our results, the fellings rate, i.e. the ratio between fellings and increment, was about 0.38 within the latest years. Nevertheless, considering the uncertainty of all input data, the total fellings ranged by about ± 50 %, and the corresponding fellings rate could be significantly larger.

Spatiotemporal data encompasses the locations, states, and interrelationships of objects within specific temporal and spatial contexts. It is characterized by dynamic properties, high dimensionality, and large data volumes, which pose significant challenges for storage, querying, and analysis. To address the challenges associated with managing large-scale spatiotemporal data, geospatial grid subdivision, grid encoding, grid indexing, and grid storage technologies offer essential support and have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. In the past, existing reviews have typically focused on a single aspect, such as the fundamental methods of grid subdivision, the implementation details of encoding and indexing techniques, or solely on spatiotemporal databases. Although these reviews provide in-depth discussions of specific technologies, they lack a systematic analysis of the interrelationships among multiple technical modules, resulting in an inability to fully reveal the collaborative potential between modules.

We developed an interpretable Random Forest model, incorporating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to map Opuntia stricta and co-occurring land cover types at 10  m resolution across heterogeneous arid and semi-arid lands in Laikipia County, Kenya. The model integrated monthly Sentinel-2 imagery, climate, topographic, landscape structural, and anthropogenic factors. Field surveys were combined with manual labeling using Google Maps and Street View to address annotation gaps in remote areas. Grid-based spatial blocking at multiple scales was used to reduce spatial autocorrelation and assess generalizability. The multi-temporal model achieved 0.91 overall accuracy and an F1-score of 0.92 for Opuntia stricta on the spatial validation set (100 m grid), and 0.86 accuracy with an F1-score of 0.85 on the independent test set, substantially outperforming single-month models (accuracy: 0.62–0.79; F1: 0.67–0.82), with February identified as the most informative single-time window. SHAP analysis identified July precipitation, population density and nighttime land surface temperatures as top predictors, linking invasion patterns to dry-season aridity, wet-season rainfall, and warm night conditions, underscoring the role of climate seasonality and human activity in shaping detectability and distribution. Invasion hotspots were concentrated near Dol-Dol and in degraded group ranches, with lower levels on private ranches and conservancies. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-temporal, context-integrated remote sensing for targeted invasive species management in dryland ecosystems."

 Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery plays a vital role in applications such as sustainable development, agriculture, forestry, urban planning, and climate change monitoring. Despite its importance, optimizing deep learning models for this task remains challenging. This study evaluates several advanced deep learning architectures UNet, LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, and a modified version, AE-DeepLabV3+ in combination with different backbone networks, including ResNet101, ResNet152, Xception, MobileNetV2 and, EfficientNetV2. The objective is to identify the most effective model for classifying satellite images into eight land cover categories: built-up areas, roads, water bodies, agricultural land, shrubland, forest, grassland, and others. A high-resolution dataset with corresponding segmentation masks was developed to support this analysis and serve as a resource for future research. Preprocessing steps included normalization and data augmentation techniques such as vertical and horizontal flipping and random brightness adjustments. Experimental results indicate that UNet with the Xception backbone, LinkNet with ResNet152, DeepLabV3+ with the Xception backbone, and AE-DeepLabV3+ with the Xception backbone achieved Dice coefficients of 85.7%, 86.7%, 90.4%, and 91.3%, respectively. Among these, AE-DeepLabV3+ with Xception demonstrated the highest segmentation accuracy. The findings are contextualized through comparison with recent studies, highlighting the model’s ability to generalize across diverse geographic regions. To enhance model transparency and interpretability, explainable AI (XAI) techniques Seg-Grad-CAM++ and Seg-Score-CAM are employed to visualize class-specific feature attributions and better understand the model’s decision-making process."

 The rapid urbanization of urban riverbank soft ground poses significant geotechnical challenges, particularly in densely populated coastal areas like the Yangtze River Delta. This study employs an enhanced multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) approach to reveal decadal deformation patterns (2015–2024) in soft ground along the Yangtze River in Nanjing, China. Leveraging 275 Sentinel-1 SAR images and improved data processing strategies, we reconstruct the subsidence dynamics and validate them against leveling measurements with an accuracy of 6.5 mm/a. Results reveal that while the overall Nanjing’s urban riverbank remains stable, localized deformations are concentrated in urban riverbank development zones: Jiangbei New Area (JBA) and Hexi New Town (HXT). The highest intensity of development in JBA shows a cumulative settlement of more than 600 mm over ten years. The soft ground deformation is driven by engineering activities, specifically (i) groundwater drawdown during foundation pit dewatering and (ii) consolidation under surcharge loads from riverbank urban infrastructure. The earlier-developed HXT provides a valuable reference for predicting surface deformation trends in JBA. Furthermore, decadal InSAR deformation analyses of critical urban riverbank infrastructure (river-crossing bridges) confirm the effectiveness of bedrock anchoring in mitigating soft ground settlement. Wavelet analyses reveal that temperature fluctuations primarily drive cyclic displacement in the metal truss main spans of the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. This work demonstrates the decisive influence of anthropogenic activities in accelerating subsidence and reveals the efficacy of InSAR in supporting adaptive risk mitigation strategies. The findings provide actionable insights for sustainable urban riverbank development in soft ground regions, emphasizing the need for integrated monitoring and ground improvement measures to enhance infrastructure resilience in global deltaic cities undergoing riverbank urbanization."

 Recent advancements in hyperspectral satellite technology, including sensors like EnMAP, are promising for monitoring grassland ecosystems at the landscape scale. These developments include detailed vegetation analysis capabilities, crucial for understanding plant traits and species composition. However, technical restrictions of recent hyperspectral satellite missions can hinder comprehensive coverage of research areas resulting in a temporal mismatch of field measurements and satellite data.Here we utilize hyperspectral data from the DESIS, PRISMA, and EnMAP mission, along with field measurements from 74 grassland plots of the German Biodiversity Exploratories in Schorfheide-Chorin and Hainich, collected in May 2020 and 2023. We focus on the impact of different satellite sensors and their acquisition timing grouped within five phenological seasons (early April to August) on the accuracy of biomass and species composition models using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Procrustes randomization tests. Additionally, we are evaluating the effectiveness of two spectral transformations in improving model accuracy and reliability.Our findings reveal significant differences in the relationship of hyperspectral satellite data with grassland biomass and species composition. Even though comparison of DESIS biomass models indicated that sensor data from the beginning of April achieved best results for biomass (R2 = 0.48), sensor data covering the SWIR from late April and June showed slightly better modeling results (EnMAP: R2 = 0.51, PRISMA: R2 = 0.53). Species composition was significantly related to spectral composition, with sensor data from late April showing the strongest relationships. The performance of sensors, including VNIR and VNIR-SWIR, was almost equal (e.g., DESIS: R2 = 0.54, PRISMA: R2 = 0.59). Overall, the results highlight the benefit of SWIR bands for biomass modeling, while their importance was minor in relation to species composition. A trend of improved model performance was observed with mean normalization for EnMAP and PRISMA data, while continuum removal led to a decrease in performance. Our study underscores the critical role of temporal and spectral data selection in improving grassland models, suggesting potential pathways for refining remote sensing approaches in ecological monitoring and management."

 Digital twin systems for transportation are widely regarded as a core technology for enabling full life-cycle management of traffic information and providing intelligent decision support, with the goals of improving traffic efficiency and reducing accident risks. However, existing research primarily focuses on simulation and prediction of traffic flow, lacking a unified framework that integrates static infrastructure, dynamic states, and microscopic behaviors. To address this gap, this paper proposes a lightweight behavior-cognitive architecture for high-definition (HD) maps to support multiscale information representation in transportation digital twin. It consists of three layers: (1) a global road network layer that models transportation infrastructure and static geographic features; (2) a dynamic target layer organizing the real time status and trajectory of traffic participants; (3) a behavioral cognition layer for behavior interpretation and understanding. Based on this architecture, a construction method for transportation digital twin systems is developed and validated through experiments conducted in real-world traffic scenarios and simulation environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high adaptability and accuracy, offering effective support for building digital twin systems in complex traffic environments."

 LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is the foundation of numerous practical applications. Recently, the Mamba, as a promising alternative to Transformer, has been getting intense attention in this field. However, the most of existing Mamba-based methods have to crop the input point clouds into patches, which limits its global modeling ability and hinders its further application in large-scale LiDAR point cloud processing. To this end, we thoroughly investigate the difficulties of Mamba in large-scale LiDAR point cloud learning and resolve this bottleneck by combining Mamba with convolution. Specifically, we introduce convolution as an information propagator to address the long-range collapse issue, which effectively enhances the global modeling ability of Mamba and enables it to handle the large-scale point clouds without patches. Besides, we redesign the bidirectional Mamba and serialization strategy to expand the receptive field of Mamba for point cloud semantic segmentation task. Furthermore, we further investigate the selectivity of Mamba, and exploit Mamba in the down-sampling stage for feature aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on two indoor and two outdoor public point cloud datasets.

 Mapping standing dead trees is critical for assessing forest health, monitoring biodiversity, and mitigating wildfire risks, for which aerial imagery has proven useful. However, dense canopy structures, spectral overlaps between living and dead vegetation, and over-segmentation errors limit the reliability of existing methods. This study introduces a hybrid post-processing framework that refines deep learning-based tree segmentation by integrating watershed algorithms with adaptive filtering to enhance instance separation and boundary precision. Leveraging a dual-task learning architecture with a Self-Attention U-Net, the framework simultaneously predicts segmentation masks, centroid heatmaps, and hybrid boundary maps, optimizing for both pixel-level accuracy and instance-level detection. Tested on high-resolution aerial imagery from boreal forests, the framework, compared to the U-Net baseline, improved instance-level segmentation accuracy by 41.5% (Tree IoU of 0.3810 vs. 0.2694) and reduced positional errors by 57% (centroid error of 3.70 pixels vs. 5.10 pixels), demonstrating robust performance in the densely vegetated boreal forest regions tested. By balancing detection accuracy (F1-score of 0.5895) and over-segmentation artifacts, the method enabled the accurate identification of individual dead trees, which is critical for ecological monitoring. The framework’s computational efficiency supports scalable applications, such as wall-to-wall tree mortality mapping over large geographic regions using aerial or satellite imagery.

 Deforestation is gaining increasing importance due to its strong influence on the surrounding environment, especially in developing countries where the population has a disadvantaged economic condition and agriculture is the main source of income. In Ivory Coast, for instance, where the cocoa production is the most remunerative activity, it is not rare to assist the replacement of portions of ancient forests with new cocoa plantations. To monitor this type of deleterious activity, satellites can be employed to recognize the disappearance of the forest.

 Extreme flood disasters are intensified by climate change, exposing an increasing share of the global population to flood hazards. Accurate monitoring of inundation extents during floods is crucial for disaster management and impact assessment. While remote sensing can provide strong support for flood monitoring, optical satellite images often face significant challenges due to weather conditions and infrequent revisits, particularly in cloudy and rainy regions. To address this limitation and achieve seamless flood mapping with cloudy satellite images, this paper proposes TerrainFloodSense, a novel method that fuses water occurrence with terrain data to enhance the reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas, especially under extreme and unprecedented flood scenarios. Specifically, TerrainFloodSense first generates enhanced water occurrence data by Bayesian fusion of terrain indices, including Digital Surface Model (DSM) along with Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), and historical water occurrence data. Then, enhanced water occurrence data are used to fill gaps caused by clouds in water maps derived from optical satellite images, guided by the submaximal stability assumption. The basic idea is that prior terrain information can be incorporated into the initial water occurrence data to enhance the ability to predict the inundation probabilities for both regular pre-flood water and extreme floodwater and to help reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas even under extreme flooding scenarios. Simulated experiments and applications in large-area flood mapping cases confirmed that TerrainFloodSense significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements of 2.95%–8.86% in overall accuracy and 0.038–0.087 increases in F1-Score under extreme flooding scenarios.

 Tree decline affects many perennial orchards with potentially heavy impacts on production. In five years 3 % of national production of kiwifruit orchards were lost in France, leading to economic issues and jeopardizing the value chain. Some specific management practices could help to mitigate kiwifruit decline, but rapid and simple tools are needed to assess the development of the decline in response to these practices. As kiwifruit decline is characterized by a low-vigor canopy along with changes in canopy color and density, Sentinel-2 images were used to detect vine decline over large areas. We first selected 28 orchards, with varying characteristics (e.g. row grass cover, hail protection nets, fertilization practices) and characterized each vine (14000 in total) according to its agronomic status (i.e. vigor and presence of decline symptoms). Sentinel-2 images are made up of 10 x 10 m pixels. To classify them we fitted two models using a random forest procedure. The spectral model (SM) used only spectral inputs, while the agronomic and spectral model (ASM) used both spectral inputs from satellite images and agronomic inputs obtained from orchard characteristics. Spectral inputs included raw spectral bands (e.g., red, near-infrared, green) and vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, GNDVI). Results show that vigorous and dead areas were well detected (more than 80 % of correct predictions). Declining areas were correctly detected when patches of decline were larger than 500 m2. Mixed pixels containing vines with different agronomic status were poorly predicted. Accuracy improves when agronomic information, such as soil texture, is incorporated into the model. Both models (SM and ASM) could enable growers to adjust their practices in real time according to the health status of their vines."

 Highly efficient and reliable monitoring of coral reef ecosystems is imperative for effective conservation and management under increasing anthropogenic and climatic pressures. However, current survey techniques either offer limited coverage and low efficiency or incur substantial manual costs for data processing. In this study, we propose a highly efficient towed optical camera array system, Speedy Sea Scanner version 2.0 (SSSv2), with an advanced electrical system supporting a stable power supply, reliable communications, and underwater illumination, which enables continuous video data collection and real-time monitoring. We also develop a semantic segmentation model, Coral-Lab, with high accuracy and robustness in coral identification task, which enables fully automated coral reef identification and coral coverage calculation. Coral-Lab model achieved an F-score of 0.802 and an mIoU of 0.665 on our test set. Leveraging SSSv2, we conducted field surveys off the northern coast of Kumejima Island, Okinawa, Japan, on July 14, 2024 and July 15, 2024 across seven sampling areas comprising 29 transect lines. Over two days survey, we collected video data covering a total seafloor area of 47,950 m2, which was converted into a georeferenced orthomosaic at an average spatial resolution of 2.5 mm via Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques. This approach achieved an effective survey efficiency of approximately 7200 m2 per hour. Applying Coral-Lab model to 25,658 orthomosaic tiles at a 0.25 m grid resolution, we generated detailed coral-cover distribution maps in under 75 min of inference time, processing each 512 × 512-pixel tile in ∼0.17 s. These results demonstrate the synergistic potential of integrating advanced imaging hardware with deep learning algorithms, enabling rapid, large-scale coral reef monitoring and assessments."

Mikelonis;Jonathan Sawyer,Evaluating Parsivel<sup>2</sup>'s raindrop data: A comparative study of different terminal drop velocity models on simulated and natural rain events,"•Determined drop velocity filters applied to simulated rain cause underestimation of rain rate. •Found different drop velocity filters reduced the total drop count to similar degrees. •Identified filters had more impact on the calculation ofDmcompared to log10Nw. •Recognized filters had a larger influence on convective rain compared to stratiform rain. 
 Rainfall measurement inherently contains uncertainty in the accuracy of the collected data. Theoretical terminal velocity models are used to filter drop size distributions (DSDs) collected by measurement devices to remove physically unlikely data. This filtration process decreases the number of drops and further influences the calculation of bulk rain parameters. This study compared the impact of different drop velocity models on the DSD and rain parameter calculations for both natural and artificial rain. A total of ten natural rainfall events were observed with a Parsivel2 disdrometer on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Triangle Park (RTP) campus in Durham, North Carolina, during June–July 2024. In addition, 732 min of artificial rainfall were generated using four nozzles at the U.S. EPA Fluid Modeling Facility (FMF) in Durham, North Carolina. The results showed that for artificial rainfall, the rain rate calculated from the instruments' ‘raw’ DSD data (terminal output %93) was on average 38.73 % higher across four nozzles compared to the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. The rain rate calculated directly from ‘raw’ data more closely matched the volume of water collected in a bin than the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. For natural rainfall, the research found that the investigated terminal velocity models performed similarly. The average reduction in drop count across the six drop velocity models tested was 0.14 %, with the highest reduction observed in the Atlas (1977) model at 0.36 %. For the accumulated DSD of ten rainfall events, the ranking of models by the number of filtered drops, from highest to lowest, was: Atlas (1977) > Uplinger (1981) > Atlas et al. (1973) > Beard (1976) > Van Dijk et al. (2002) > Gunn and Kinzer (1949). In contrast to artificial rain, both rain intensity and kinetic energy measured by Parsivel2 were higher than those calculated from the ‘raw’ DSD, and applying a filter reduced these values. The study also identified the microphysical characteristics of the natural precipitation, with peak values of liquid water content (W) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) observed at 0.6–0.7 g m−3 and 30 dBz, respectively. The average mass-weighted diameter Dm (normalized intercept parameter log10Nw) values for convective, mixed, and stratiform rain were 1.81 mm (5.40), 1.15 mm (4.18), and 1.35 mm (4.53), respectively. Filters had a more pronounced effect on the Dm values compared to the log10Nw values and appeared to have a larger influence on convective rain compared to stratiform rain. The study illustrated how various theoretical terminal drop velocity models used to filter the number of raindrops in a DSD affect the calculation of bulk rain parameters and how they are applicable to natural rainfall but not artificially produced rainfall. This research is valuable for gaining a deeper understanding of precipitation microphysics and improving the accuracy of rainfall assessments."

 Utilizing airborne measurements to investigate the response of microphysics to glaciogenic cloud seeding is instrumental in understanding and evaluating the seeding effect. In this study, the changes in microphysical characteristics of a supercooled liquid cloud induced by aircraft-based cloud seeding is analyzed. The data was collect in North China on Dec. 12, 2023, by using an S-band ground-based weather radar and airborne in-situ measurements. The results show that after cloud seeding, the cloud droplet number concentration and the supercooled liquid water content decreased by 48.5 % and 28.5 %, respectively, while the ice crystal number concentration increased from 0 to 100.8 L−1 on average, leading to a significant broadening of the ice particle spectrum. The ground-based weather radar observed distinct radar echo bands after the cloud seeding was completed. The enhanced radar reflectivity lasted for approximately 30 min before dissipation. A comparative analysis of five previous aircraft-based glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments in the same region revealed that the cloud seeding effect is sensitive to seeding-level temperature, cloud droplet number concentration, and supercooled liquid water content."

We found that values of an important radar variable (KDP) can be related to many different snow particle properties and number concentrations. We were able to constrain which particle sizes contribute to KDP by using computer models of snowflakes and showed which microphysical processes during snow formation can influence KDP. 
 Polarimetric radars provide variables like the specific differential phase (KDP) to detect fingerprints of dendritic growth in the dendritic growth layer (DGL) and secondary ice production, both critical for precipitation formation. A key challenge in interpreting radar observations is the lack of in situ validation of particle properties within the radar measurement volume. While high KDP in snow is usually associated with high particle number concentrations, only few studies attributed KDP to certain hydrometeor types and sizes. To address this, we combined surface in situ observations from the Video In Situ Snowfall Sensor (VISSS) with remote sensing data from a polarimetric W-band radar and an X-band radar, along with modeling approaches. Data were collected during the CORSIPP project, part of the ARM SAIL campaign (winter 2022/2023, Colorado Rocky Mountains). We found that at W-band, KDP > 2 ° km−1 can result from a broad range of particle number concentrations, between 1 and 100 L−1. Blowing snow and increased ice collisional fragmentation in a turbulent layer enhanced observed KDP values. T-matrix simulations indicated that high KDP values were primarily produced by particles smaller than 0.8 mm in the DGL and 1.5 mm near the surface. Discrete dipole approximation simulations based on VISSS data suggested that dendritic aggregates larger than 2.5 mm contributed 10 %–20 % to the measured W-band KDP near the surface. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting W-band KDP in snowfall and emphasize the need for combined in situ observations and radar forward simulations to better understand snowfall microphysical processes."

Froyd;Jonathan Dean-Day;Ari Laaksonen,Prior heterogeneous ice nucleation events shape homogeneous freezing during the evolution of synoptic cirrus,"This study uses Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to investigate synoptic cirrus clouds from NASA’s Mid-latitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) campaign. Results show that prior heterogeneous ice nucleation depletes ice nuclei, creating conditions for subsequent homogeneous freezing. The findings highlight limitations of ice residual analysis in capturing cirrus evolution and provide insights into aerosol-cloud interactions critical to atmospheric and climate processes. 
 In situ observations are currently used to classify synoptic cirrus as formed by homogeneous or heterogeneous ice nucleation based on ice residual analysis. We use UCLALES-SALSA to show the limitations of this method by demonstrating that prior heterogeneous freezing events can shape the thermodynamic conditions for homogeneous freezing to occur more likely in subsequent nucleation events.In a single-cloud case study of synoptic cirrus from NASA’s Midlatitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX), observations suggest homogeneous freezing as the dominant nucleation mechanism, despite the other mission days with synoptic cirrus showing generally heterogeneous freezing characteristics. Model simulations reveal that ice residual analysis cannot capture influence of earlier heterogeneous freezing events, where mineral dust acted as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These earlier events depleted INPs at cloud-forming altitudes, enabling homogeneous freezing at the time of observations. Cirrus cloud properties were simulated using measured meteorological and aerosol conditions and compared with observed cloud structures. Results show that modeling the impact of prior nucleation events on the vertical distribution of mineral dust and humidity in the model is necessary to reproduce the observed cloud characteristics. Heterogeneous freezing played a role in the removal of active mineral dust from cloud-forming altitudes well before arriving at the measurement location, while having limited role in forming ice crystals shortly before the time of measurements.Simulations also show that small-scale wave activity significantly influenced ice nucleation efficiency and cloud properties. Although large-scale atmospheric dynamics typically dominate synoptic cirrus formation, they alone were insufficient to replicate the observed cloud characteristics."

By refining temperature control, automating freezing detection, and rigorously testing, we demonstrated that this instrument can reliably measure immersion mode ice-nucleating particles across diverse conditions. 
 Heterogeneous ice nucleation initiated by atmospheric ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is a key microphysical process for cloud formation. Detecting the ice nucleation ability (INA) and concentration of INPs is essential for improving global climate models. Droplet freezing techniques (DFTs) are among the widely used tools for measuring the immersion freezing of INPs, which is a predominant ice nucleation process in mixed-phase clouds. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of DFTs, we developed a Freezing Ice Nucleation Detection Analyzer at Westlake University (FINDA-WLU) with an improved hardware setup, user-friendly software, precise droplet freezing detection, and rigorous temperature calibrations. The temperature uncertainty of FINDA-WLU is about ±0.60 °C, considering both vertical heat transfer efficiency and horizontal temperature heterogeneity. The system is tested with Milli-Q ultrapure water and reference materials like Arizona Test Dust and Snomax®, and the results are consistent with previous studies.

 Wind power serves as a vital zero-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, the vast expansion of wind turbine installation requires extensive terrestrial resources, raising wide concerns regarding land use competition and ecological impacts. Quantifying these effects necessitates near real-time geospatial data on wind turbine placement and density. However, current methods remain inadequate monitoring for the fast-growing wind turbine deployment. Here, we developed an integrated framework that combines OpenStreetMap (OSM) data with multi-source remote sensing images (Google Earth and Sentinel-1/2) and deep learning and traditional machine learning models (ResNet-18 and Random Forest) to map global onshore wind turbines. Our models achieve validation accuracy >97 % while enabling cost-effective, timely updates of global onshore wind turbines. Eventually, we established a geographical dataset covering a total of 379,595 wind turbines globally by 2024.

 Although edges and defects constitute only a small fraction of crystalline materials, they exert an outsized impact on a material′s properties. Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are promising next-generation semiconductor materials with superior cost effectiveness and interesting optoelectronic properties1–3. However, clear images of their edges have remained challenging to obtain owing to their extreme sensitivity4,5.

A majority methylammonium (MA) and iodine (I) edge termination is observed in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), and the damage rate of its edges and internal defects is found to depend on the concentration and type of vacancies present, with a preponderance of I vacancies in particular correlating with higher rates of damage.

 Each year, snakebite envenoming claims thousands of lives and causes severe injury to victims across sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom depend on antivenoms derived from animal plasma as their sole treatment option1. Traditional antivenoms are expensive, can cause adverse immunological reactions, offer limited efficacy against local tissue damage and are often ineffective against all medically relevant snake species2. There is thus an urgent unmet medical need for innovation in snakebite envenoming therapy. However, developing broad-spectrum treatments is highly challenging owing to the vast diversity of venomous snakes and the complex and variable composition of their venoms3. Here we addressed this challenge by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and a rinkhals, constructing phage display libraries, and identifying high-affinity broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We combined eight of these nanobodies into a defined oligoclonal mixture, resulting in an experimental polyvalent recombinant antivenom that was capable of neutralizing seven toxin families or subfamilies. This antivenom effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species and markedly reduced venom-induced dermonecrosis for all tested cytotoxic venoms. The recombinant antivenom performed better than a currently used plasma-derived antivenom and therefore shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids. A recombinant antivenom composed of eight nanobodies provides broad protection against venom-induced lethality and dermonecrosis in mice challenged with venoms from cobras, mambas and rinkhals snakes."

 Solid-state lithium metal batteries are facing huge challenges under practical working conditions1,2. Even when the ionic conductivity of composite solid-state electrolytes is increased to 1 mS cm−1, it is still difficult to realize long-life cycling of solid-state batteries above a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (ref. 3). The fundamental cause is the brittle nature of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish lithium-ion transport and the resulting lithium dendrites and severe side reactions. Here we report a ductile inorganic-rich SEI that retains its structural integrity while allowing easy ion diffusion at high current densities and areal capacities. The ductility of the SEI is ascribed to the Ag2S and AgF components, which are formed by a substitution reaction between Li2S/LiF in the SEI and AgNO3 in the dielectric composite electrolytes. Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 15 mAh cm−2, a symmetrical lithium cell with such an SEI has a long cycle life of over 4,500 hours. Furthermore, the ductile SEI also works over 7,000 hours at −30 °C, even under practical conditions of 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2.

 At more than 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all other mammals. The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth1, reaching over 80,000 kg. Despite its very large number of cells and long lifespan, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto’s paradox2. Here, to understand the mechanisms that underlie the cancer resistance of the bowhead whale, we examined the number of oncogenic hits required for malignant transformation of whale primary fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, bowhead whale fibroblasts required fewer oncogenic hits to undergo malignant transformation than human fibroblasts. However, bowhead whale cells exhibited enhanced DNA double-strand break repair capacity and fidelity, and lower mutation rates than cells of other mammals. We found the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRBP to be highly expressed in bowhead fibroblasts and tissues. Bowhead whale CIRBP enhanced both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair in human cells, reduced micronuclei formation, promoted DNA end protection, and stimulated end joining in vitro. CIRBP overexpression in Drosophila extended lifespan and improved resistance to irradiation. These findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, rather than relying on additional tumour suppressor genes to prevent oncogenesis3–5, the bowhead whale maintains genome integrity through enhanced DNA repair. This strategy, which does not eliminate damaged cells but faithfully repairs them, may be contributing to the exceptional longevity and low cancer incidence in the bowhead whale. Analysis of the longest-lived mammal, the bowhead whale, reveals an improved ability to repair DNA breaks, mediated by high levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein.   "

 We previously identified an embryonic shift in the corticospinal motor neuronal transcriptome after spinal cord injury associated with successful axonal regeneration1. Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature’, here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. In a new adult motor cortex neuronal in vitro screen2, thiorphan increased neurite outgrowth 1.8-fold (P < 0.001). We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function (P < 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration (P < 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human. These findings represent a new path for drug discovery, starting from in silico screens to proof-of-concept in adult human brain cultures.

 Close-in transiting sub-Neptunes are abundant in our Galaxy1. Planetary interior models based on their observed radius–mass relationship suggest that sub-Neptunes contain a discernible amount of either hydrogen (dry planets) or water (wet planets) blanketing a core composed of rocks and metal2. Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits3. Here we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm, dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that release silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing an appreciable amount of water up to a few tens of weight per cent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation4,5. Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.

 When electrons in metals act collectively, they enable emergent phenomena and electronic functionalities that transcend the behaviour of individual particles1. Coherent collective charge motion has so far been observed primarily in superconductors, in which it arises with the formation of Cooper pairs2,3. Here we report experimental evidence for coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV3Sb5, indicative of a distinct collective electronic state. The signature is a set of magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic crystalline pillars under in-plane magnetic fields, with a periodicity determined by the number of magnetic flux quanta h/e threading between adjacent kagome layers—effectively forming an interlayer Aharonov–Bohm interferometer. The cooperative nature of this phenomenon is evidenced by a non-analytic angular dependence characterized by abrupt transitions between discrete oscillation frequencies and its persistence over length scales that exceed the single-particle mean free path. Notably, the oscillation amplitude matches other anomalous electronic responses reported in CsV3Sb5, pointing to an underlying mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. These findings shed new light on the debated nature of correlated order in kagome metals and establish CsV3Sb5 as a platform for realizing long-range coherent charge transport in the absence of superconductivity—opening new directions for coherence in correlated electron systems beyond conventional models.

 Potato late blight, which is caused by Phytophthora infestans and was responsible for the Irish potato famine, remains a major threat to global food security1. Most late-blight resistance (R) genes encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), but many have been overcome by the rapid evolution of P. infestans2. Deploying R genes through hybrid potato breeding3–7 offers a promising solution to manage late blight. Here we construct a section-wide NLRome comprising 39,211 NLR genes from 31 wild and 21 cultivated potato genomes, representing Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade. This includes newly sequenced genomes of seven wild species with strong resistance to late blight. Phylogenomic analyses reveal asymmetric patterns of evolution that distinguish sensor and helper NLRs. Mining of the NLRome enabled us to clone Rpi-cph1, a homologue of which has previously been identified only in American black nightshade, and Rpi-cjm1, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing NLR against late blight. We show that non-canonical NLR integrated domains are widespread in the NLRome. Tracing their evolutionary trajectory enabled us to identify Rpi-brk1, an R gene that perceives a P. infestans effector through its heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domain. We find that incorporating the HMA domain into the potato NLR R1 broadens its resistance spectrum, suggesting that a domain ‘plug-in’ strategy could be used to engineer disease resistance. These findings provide a paradigm for R-gene discovery through comparative and evolutionary genomics, and a strategy for R-gene engineering.

 The disappearance of ice shelves, the floating margins of the Antarctic ice sheet that restrain the ice flow into the ocean1–3, would strongly accelerate the Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise4–6. Their viability in a warming world has motivated substantial work that focuses on the influence of the warming atmosphere7–10. Here we revisit the concept of ice-shelf viability in a holistic manner, taking into account mass loss due to both the atmosphere and the ocean to estimate when it becomes almost impossible for the ice shelves to maintain their present-day shape. We show that for a scenario in which global warming remains largely below 2 °C, only 1 out of 64 ice shelves will become likely non-viable by 2300. For a scenario in which global warming reaches nearly 12 °C by 2300, many ice shelves become non-viable once global warming exceeds 4.5 °C, loss that is mainly due to an increase in ocean-induced melt. By 2150 and 2300, 26 and 38 ice shelves, respectively, become likely non-viable. Loss of ice-sheet regions restrained by these 38 ice shelves represent a sea-level rise potential of 10 m. Our estimates are latest bounds for reaching non-viability, and ice-shelf collapse could occur even earlier, in particular owing to the synergy with hydrofracturing.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of SSU processome maturation, remodelling, disassembly and RNA quality control, and the transitions between states remain unknown owing to a paucity of intermediates1–3. Here we report 16 native SSU processome structures alongside genetic data, revealing how two helicases, the Mtr4-exosome and Dhr1, are controlled for accurate and unidirectional ribosome biogenesis. Our data show how irreversible pre-ribosomal RNA degradation by the redundantly tethered RNA exosome couples the transformation of the SSU processome into a pre-40S particle, during which Utp14 can probe evolving surfaces, ultimately positioning and activating Dhr1 to unwind the U3 snoRNA and initiate nucleolar pre-40S release. This study highlights a paradigm for large dynamic RNA–protein complexes in which irreversible RNA degradation drives compositional changes and communicates these changes to govern enzyme activity while maintaining overall quality control.

 Oat grain is a traditional human food that is rich in dietary fibre and contributes to improved human health1,2. Interest in the crop has surged in recent years owing to its use as the basis for plant-based milk analogues3. Oat is an allohexaploid with a large, repeat-rich genome that was shaped by subgenome exchanges over evolutionary timescales4. In contrast to many other cereal species, genomic research in oat is still at an early stage, and surveys of structural genome diversity and gene expression variability are scarce. Here we present annotated chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of 33 wild and domesticated oat lines, along with an atlas of gene expression across 6 tissues of different developmental stages in 23 of these lines. We construct an atlas of gene-expression diversity across subgenomes, accessions and tissues. Gene loss in the hexaploid is accompanied by compensatory upregulation of the remaining homeologues, but this process is constrained by subgenome divergence. Chromosomal rearrangements have substantially affected recent oat breeding. A large pericentric inversion associated with early flowering explains distorted segregation on chromosome 7D and a homeologous sequence exchange between chromosomes 2A and 2C in a semi-dwarf mutant has risen to prominence in Australian elite varieties. The oat pangenome will promote the adoption of genomic approaches to understanding the evolution and adaptation of domesticated oats and will accelerate their improvement.

 Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR. Ion-channel conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor."

 Muscular systems1, the fundamental components of mobility in animals, have sparked innovations across technological and medical fields2,3. Yet artificial muscles suffer from dynamic programmability, scalability and responsiveness owing to complex actuation mechanisms and demanding material requirements. Here we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing more than 10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of approximately 3,000 microbubbles per mm2, a low weight of 0.047 mg mm−2, a substantial force intensity of approximately 7.6 μN mm−2 and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micrometre to centimetre scale), exceptional compliance and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attaching to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments. The customizable artificial muscles could offer both immediate and long-term impact on soft robotics, wearable technologies, haptics and biomedical instrumentation.

 The neural basis of movement preparation has been extensively studied during self-initiated actions, in which motor cortical activity during preparation shows a lawful relationship to the parameters of the subsequent action1,2. However, movements are regularly triggered or corrected on the basis of sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body. Since such disturbances are often predictable, and since preparing for disturbances would make movements more prescise, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans or monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of future mechanical perturbations, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, and scales directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Using neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges only when sensory inputs signal that a perturbation has occurred, before resolving the direction of the perturbation. Thus, just as preparatory activity sets the stage for self-initiated movement, it also configures motor circuits to respond efficiently to sensory inputs. Experiments with human volunteers and macaques show that expectations produced by probabilistic cueing of future sensory inputs shape motor circuit dynamics in order to increase the efficiency of movement responses."

 The generation and maintenance of immunity is a dynamic process that is dependent on age1–3. Here, to better understand its progression, we profiled peripheral immunity in more than 300 healthy adults (25 to 90 years of age) using single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and flow cytometry, following 96 adults longitudinally across 2 years with seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting resource generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of more than 16 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 71 immune cell subsets from our Human Immune Health Atlas and enabled us to interrogate how immune cell composition and states shift with age, chronic viral infection and vaccination. From these data, we demonstrate robust, non-linear transcriptional reprogramming in T cell subsets with age that is not driven by systemic inflammation or chronic cytomegalovirus infection. This age-related reprogramming led to a functional T helper 2 (TH2) cell bias in memory T cells that is linked to dysregulated B cell responses against highly boosted antigens in influenza vaccines. Collectively, this study reveals unique features of the immune ageing process that occur prior to advanced age and provides novel targets for age-related immune modulation.

 A key challenge for ecological science is to understand how biodiversity loss is changing ecosystem structure and function at scales that are relevant for policy1. Almost all biodiversity metrics are challenging to disaggregate into animal-mediated ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersal, and predation. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics approach2 as a physically meaningful method of translating animal species composition into a suite of ecosystem functions. Drawing on new datasets that estimate biodiversity intactness and species population densities3–5, we quantify historical changes to energy flows through mammal- and bird-mediated ecosystem functions across sub-Saharan Africa. In total, trophic energy flows have decreased by more than one-third. The pattern of decreasing function varies by historical biome, driven by arboreal birds and primates in forests, terrestrial herbivores in grassy systems, and burrowing mammals in arid systems. Functions performed by megafauna in particular have collapsed outside protected areas. Compared with other biodiversity metrics, an energetics approach highlights the ecological importance of smaller animals and keystone species. The results can help practitioners conserve and restore functionally diverse, energetically intact ecosystems across land uses and biomes. By relating biodiversity intactness to energy and material flows, ecosystem energetics can also advance efforts to integrate animal-driven functions into biosphere and earth system models, helping us to understand possible regional or planetary boundaries6 for biodiversity.

 Infection by yellow fever virus (YFV), the prototype Orthoflavivirus, induces a febrile syndrome in humans that can progress to liver failure, haemorrhage and death1. Despite decades of study, the entry receptors for YFV remain unclear. Here, using a surface protein-targeted CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identified LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family member, as a candidate entry receptor for YFV. Genetic ablation of LRP4 impaired YFV infection of cells and, reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP4 increased infection. Related viruses in the YFV antigenic complex also showed LRP4-dependent infection. LRP4 promoted YFV entry into cells through LDLR type A (LA) domain binding to domain III of the YFV envelope protein. Soluble LRP4–Fc decoy receptors neutralized YFV infection in cell culture and reduced viral burden in vivo. As we observed residual YFV infection in LRP4-deficient cells, we evaluated whether other LDLR family members promote YFV entry. This approach identified LRP1 and VLDLR as additional receptors for YFV infection in cell culture. LRP1–Fc, LRP4–Fc and VLDLR–Fc decoys protected mice from YFV challenge, and LRP1–Fc decoys inhibited YFV infection and liver pathogenesis in mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. A genetic deficiency of LRP1 in primary human hepatocyte cultures also resulted in reduced YFV infection. Our findings establish a role for multiple LDLR family members in YFV entry, infection and pathogenesis, which has implications for receptor use and countermeasure development for multiple emerging orthoflaviviruses. The low-density lipoprotein receptor family members LRP1, LRP4 and VLDLR are entry receptors for yellow fever virus."

 The exact nature of crustal magmatic reservoirs is elusive as they cannot be sampled in situ. The traditional view that magma chambers contain essentially molten material has recently been replaced by the transcrustal magmatic system (TCMS), in which reservoirs are mostly composed of immobile magmatic crystals with a minute fraction of more mobile melt1–3, creating a ‘magmatic mush’3. Eruptions are possible if a significant portion of melt segregates into melt-rich lenses within the mush reservoir1–3. The TCMS concept is, however, a default model essentially justified by the absence of clear geophysical signatures of melt-rich magma chambers1,4, and by the rare and tentative estimates of the melt fraction in the crustal storage zones based on geochemical and textural analysis of eruptive products5,6. Here we image a bright electrical conductor at 23 ± 1 km below sea level beneath Mayotte island that we interpret as a magmatic reservoir, based on laboratory measurements of Mayotte’s melt conductivity. This large magmatic reservoir (more than 200 km3) contains a high melt fraction (22–42%). Such a crystal-to-liquid ratio matches the reconstructed differentiation paths7–9 producing the melts that recently erupted at Mayotte. This reservoir is possibly connected to the system that fed the large submarine eruption of Fani Maoré in 2018–201910.

 The iron and steel sector is central to national net-zero efforts but remains hard to abate1,2. Existing decarbonization roadmaps fail to guide technology choices for individual plants, given their heterogeneity and economic constraints3–5. Here, by integrating two global plant-level datasets and forecasted technology costs, we develop a model to identify the least-cost technology pathway for each plant worldwide in alignment with national carbon-neutrality targets. In the short term (pre-2030), energy efficiency improvements and scrap reuse are the cheapest decarbonization strategies, reducing cumulative global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 7.8 Gt and 7.2 Gt at average costs of –US$8.5 tCO2−1 and US$0.3 tCO2−1, respectively. In the long term (after 2030), smelt reduction with carbon capture is expected to become technically mature and economically viable, achieving approximately 6.0 Gt of CO2 reductions at costs of US$7–15 tCO2−1 in Chinese plants and US$26–75 tCO2−1 in plants across Japan, Korea and Europe. After 2040, green-hydrogen-based steelmaking is estimated to contribute an additional 0.3 Gt of CO2 abatement in European plants at costs of US$27–44 tCO2−1.

 Somatic chromosome instability results in widespread structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) during cancer evolution1–3. Although CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypia4–7, the underlying processes and rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells are underexplored. Here we introduce machine-learning-assisted genomics and imaging convergence (MAGIC)—an autonomously operated platform that integrates live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning on-the-fly and single-cell genomics to systematically investigate CA formation. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track de novo CAs over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as initiating events. We determine the baseline CA mutation rate, which approximately doubles in TP53-deficient cells, and observe that chromosome losses arise more frequently than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosome arms triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, coordinated segregation and amplification of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, as well as complex CA outcomes, influenced by the chromosomal break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The experimentation enabled by MAGIC advances the dissection of DNA rearrangement processes, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability.

 The electronic passivation of small-form-factor devices requires a fundamental change in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, transitioning from bulky metal cans to conformal thin films1–4. However, reducing the thickness induces poor shielding performance associated with the skin depth of shielding materials5,6. To overcome the performance limitations of thin-film shields, absorption during multiple internal reflections should be driven7. For absorption during multiple internal reflections, pores have been intentionally introduced into shielding materials such as metals8–12 and two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbides/nitrides (MXenes)13–19. However, these approaches involve insufficient thinness, non-uniformity and/or processing incompatibility. Here we propose embedding non-porous MXene film into metal thin films to achieve unprecedented shielding performance at a thickness of just 1 μm (about 70 decibels; about 80 decibels at 1.9-μm thickness) without the limitations associated with porous structures. This exceptional performance in simple-stacked metal/MXene/metal structures, which deviates from the typical thickness dependency, arises from the formation of electromagnetic wave confinement walls at the interfaces, driven by the conductivity mismatch between the metal and MXene. The confined electromagnetic waves within the MXene ‘well’ are effectively attenuated through polarization loss, primarily driven by dipoles at the metal–MXene interfaces. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields provide conformal EMI protection for portable USB (Universal Serial Bus) 3.0 flash drives and flexible Schottky diodes. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields may open new avenues in packaging technologies, enabling EMI-free ubiquitous electronics.

 Efficient conversion of mechanical energy into direct current remains a significant challenge for current energy-harvesting devices. In ionic tribomaterials, the displacement and polarization of mobile ions can dynamically control both the magnitude and direction of generated charges. This process shares similarities with semiconductor-based tribovoltaic systems but differs from conventional dielectric triboelectric devices, where electrical conductivity and charge retention are often in competition. While ionic tribomaterials are receiving increasing attention, their ability to generate direct current directly from mechanical motion has not been fully investigated. Here, we show that incorporating ionic components, such as plasticizers, into a common dielectric polymer (polyvinyl chloride) transforms the output from alternating to direct current. This process is driven by contact electrification combined with electrode polarization, enabling stable direct current generation across contact–separation, sliding, and rotary motions—modes that are typically difficult to unify in a single design. The resulting devices maintain stable output under extended operation and varying environmental conditions, demonstrating a robust and versatile route for mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion. This approach bridges the performance gap between polymer-based triboelectric devices and tribovoltaic systems, offering a broadly applicable strategy for sustainable energy harvesting technologies.

It predicts that the extension of the growing season will not be sufficient to compensate for the future drought-induced summer growth limitation. 
 The radial growth of temperate forests responds to climate change with remarkable variation across space and between species. However, there is limited understanding of how growing season extension and increasing drought stress contribute to long-term growth trends. Here, we calibrate the VS-Lite growth model using 2013 tree-ring chronologies from ten broadleaved and five coniferous genera in Central-Southeast Europe to predict intra-annual wood formation under four SSP climate scenarios through the 21st century. Results show that forecasted summer drought stress will be temporarily offset by an extended growing season, leading to stable or positive trends in tree-ring widths until a tipping point in the 2040s–2050s. During the second half of the 21st century, high-emission scenarios lead to growth acceleration in humid coniferous forests due to growing season extension and enhanced growth rate. In contrast, forecasted extension of the growing season is insufficient to compensate for declining summer growth rates at drier sites, resulting in significant growth reduction for all genera, particularly during dry years. Our results demonstrate that adjusting intra-annual wood formation to seasonal moisture availability may become crucial for tree survival in warmer climates. Furthermore, we highlight that only low-emission scenarios support non-declining stem growth in dry forests with current species composition. This study forecasts intra-annual forest growth towards the end of the 21st century under different scenarios of climate change. It predicts that the extension of the growing season will not be sufficient to compensate for the future drought-induced summer growth limitation."

 Densifying triboelectric layers benefits triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) by increasing output, improving spatial utilization, and reducing costs. However, structural densification imposes limitations that hinder further output enhancement. A charge dispatch strategy is developed in our proposed rattle drum inspired TENG, which mitigates charge cancellation via path diversion and alleviates electrostatic shielding through mode transformation, yielding over 6x output versus traditional models. Further structural designs to improve layer contact-separation efficiency, including laser etching and contact push pins, raise the triboelectric surface density to 2.76 cm-1. A comprehensive framework is established, encompassing theoretical modeling, engineering optimization, and extensive experimental validation. Furthermore, the generator can capture weak wave energy when equipped with a magnetic repulsion pendulum, boosting motion amplitude and output by 558% and 1662%, respectively, demonstrating scenario adaptability expansion.

 Electrifying heavy-duty trucks is crucial for decarbonizing transportation, but maximizing their potential requires minimizing the carbon footprint of timely deliveries. This complex optimization task involves strategic path, speed, and charging planning, which traditional methods struggle to optimize at scale. We present a stage-expanded graph formulation that reduces complexity and reveals a useful problem structure. Our formulation naturally decomposes the problem into more tractable subproblems, allowing efficient coordination between routing and charging decisions, and maintains a manageable graph size. We exploit these structural insights to design an efficient algorithm with performance guarantees. Simulations using real-world data over the U.S. highway system demonstrate that our method complements the 36% carbon reduction from electrification with an additional 25% decrease, totaling a 61% reduction. Moreover, our carbon-optimized strategy, applicable to various truck types, can achieve comparable carbon reductions 9 years sooner than zero-emission truck adoption alone. This approach accelerates transportation decarbonization, offering a powerful tool in the fight against climate change.

 Isolated atrial amyloidosis (IAA) is a localized cardiac disorder characterized by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) amyloids deposition in the atria, linked to aging and atrial fibrillation (AF). While monomeric ANP regulates blood pressure, its dimeric form is associated with cardiovascular conditions, including AF. The mechanistic link between ANP aggregation, IAA, and AF remains unclear. Here, we present the first high-resolution structural characterization of ANP fibrils extracted from AF patients, revealing two distinct fibril polymorphs. Both present covalent ANP dimers as building blocks but diverge in their structural architecture: one features antiparallel dimers stabilized by a single disulfide bond, while the other consists of parallel dimers bridged by two interchain disulfide bonds. These fibril morphologies were conserved across patients, suggesting a common aggregation mechanism in IAA. Overall, our findings ascribe to dimeric ANP a critical role in amyloid formation, offering promising directions for earlier detection and treatment of IAA.

The region’s extreme precipitation events have heightened lake outburst risks, while the retreating lake shores, which have triggered more frequent sandstorms since 2011, degrading habitats for Tibetan antelope. Climate projections indicate persistent hydrological and ecological instability through 2035.

It incorporates nitrogen oxides, water vapour, contrail-induced cloudiness, upstream emissions from in-flight services, and life cycle emissions from aircraft and airports, offering a complete carbon footprint assessment. Accuracy is improved through detailed modelling of flight distance, fuel consumption, and emissions allocation adjusted for passenger class, luggage, and cargo. Historical adjustment factors refine pre-flight estimates by integrating real-world variations. The tool outputs a full emissions breakdown by source, offering unparalleled granularity and clarity. Validated against over 30,000 historical flights, the historical adjustment factor model achieves ~0.5% mean squared percentage error and shows current methods underestimate emissions.

 Existing erosion models inadequately address geo-pedological controls governing landscape degradation. This research investigates these relationships across Tamil Nadu, establishing an integrated framework connecting geological conditions to vulnerability outcomes. Through multi-parameter spatial analysis integrating geological, geomorphological, and pedological data from 120 sampling sites, we identified distinct process domains with varying vulnerability patterns. Field validation using standard accuracy metrics (R2 > 0.71 for all soil properties, RMSE within acceptable thresholds) confirmed the reliability of SoilGrids predictions for regional-scale vulnerability assessment. The study reveals how lithological variations from Peninsular Gneiss to Quaternary deposits control pedogenic pathways. Soil properties including texture (sandy loam to clay), coarse fragment content from 27 to 263 cm3/dm3, and bulk density from 0.78 to 1.67 g/cm3 create distinctive hydrological regimes, while chemical properties like pH ranging from 5.1 to 8.8 establish biogeochemical environments with varying resilience characteristics. Soil erosion rates from 3.7 to 29 ton/ha·yr demonstrate pronounced spatial variability, with western highlands experiencing 3 to 4 times higher erosion than eastern plains. Below-ground carbon distribution from 0 to 10.8 kg/m2 emerges as a critical indicator of landscape functional capacity, with high‑carbon domains demonstrating significantly greater resilience to environmental stressors. The integrated spatial framework developed through this research provides a foundation for targeted conservation approaches addressing fundamental landscape processes rather than symptoms, with significant implications for sustainable land management across diverse tropical environments. Future research should enhance multi-parameter integration with socioeconomic variables and strengthen temporal analysis to better understand dynamic soil-landscape relationships."

 Monitoring land cover changes becomes increasingly vital in light of climate change and urban and industrial expansion. Land cover, however, is often expressed in discrete categories, which can oversimplify transitional and heterogeneous areas. Instead, by mapping land cover types as fractions, one can make a more accurate representation of not only the spatial distribution but also the temporal variability, which is crucial for pronounced change detection. However, current methods produce inconsistent time series or oversimplify change dynamics. At the same time, the promising potential of temporal deep learning and dense time series modelling has not been previously explored. Bridging this gap, this study compares novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and post-processing LSTM (PostLSTM) models with baseline Random Forest (RF) and Markov Chain models for multi-class land cover fraction regression and post-processing, respectively. Landsat-8 data were used to produce fraction time series at a 100-meter spatial resolution in both annual and, in a novel approach harnessing intra-annual characteristics, dense (16-day) time steps. The models were trained and validated using yearly land cover fraction records collected from globally distributed sample sites. The LSTM models performed better than the RF models when focusing on land cover classes predicted or validated to have a fraction of at least 1%. However, they did not outperform because of poorer handling of the remaining 0% fractions, which are naturally inflated in number since the majority of classes are commonly absent from a given area. Since the RF models produced fluctuating time series, the PostLSTM models achieved the highest yearly Overall Accuracy (OA) (>67%). Compared to the Markov Chain models constrained by their Markov property, the PostLSTM models stabilised time series while preserving actual change.

 Lianas play a crucial role in shaping the vertical structural complexity of tropical forests; however, their impact is not well understood. This study evaluates the influence of lianas on the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index, a measure of canopy heterogeneity, in a Neotropical tropical dry forest (TDF) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Using full-waveform LiDAR data and simulated Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) waveforms, we compared liana-infested and non-infested plots across early, intermediate, and late successional stages. Using Mann-Whitney U test with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction (95 % confidence level) our findings indicate that liana-infested plots exhibit significantly higher Lorenz-entropy index values in intermediate (P< 0.05, P < BH-threshold), and late (P < 3.33×10-2, P < BH-threshold) successional stages, while early-stage in non-infested plots showed significantly higher entropy values (P< 1.67×10-2, P < BH-threshold). Effect size analysis showed a moderate impact in the intermediate stage (Cliff’s δ = 0.35, 95 % CI: 0.07–0.61) and a moderate to large impact in the late stage (Cliff’s δ = 0.41, 95 % CI: 0.11–0.67). In early-stage plots, liana-infested stands had significantly lower LE index values than non-infested plots (Cliff’s δ = –0.50, 95 % CI: –0.78 to –0.19). These results demonstrate that the LE index effectively captures liana-driven increases in vertical canopy stratification and heterogeneity, particularly in more mature forest stages.The integration of airborne LiDAR and GEDI simulations offers an approach for assessing structural complexity at the plot level. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the long-term ecological consequences of liana abundance, in the context of forest monitoring."

 Cloud cover affects and reacts to climate change, and it obstructs optical observations. Despite the existence of historical Landsat scene cloud cover data, the image acquisition probability (IAP) of global Landsat has not yet been examined under a universal cloud cover threshold. The recently proposed coarse-and-fine thresholding (CAFT) method, designed to minimize cloud interference while optimizing imaging supply, shows potential for establishing such a threshold for studying sub-continental IAPs. Nevertheless, the CAFT’s feasibility and effectiveness in establishing a worldwide threshold have not been evaluated. With the 1984–2023 scene cloud cover of global (excluding Antarctica) Landsat-5/7/8 Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery (nearly six million), we explored a universal threshold among six continents using CAFT to derive global annual IAPs and then examined their geographic, temporal, and senor-based variations. We concluded that the pre-defined 24% can be a globally applicable threshold and the 40-year benchmarking IAP of global Landsat is estimated to be nearly 45%. ETM+ has higher global average IAPs (>47%) compared to OLI (45%) and TM (43%). Monthly and annual IAP variations are more pronounced at continental scales, with the highest in Africa and the lowest in Europe. Notably, climate explains the latitudinal and temporal differences, showing higher and lower IAPs in the Arid and Polar climate zones, respectively. Through the evaluation of Landsat 40-year scene cloud cover, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of global IAPs and suggests the necessity to examine the dynamics and mechanisms of pixel-based cloud cover."

 Cervid browsing influences forest ecosystems worldwide, stressing the need for wildlife management founded in accurate estimates of available forage. In this study, we developed the first national-scale models for Sweden to estimate the abundance of cervid forage by combining data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and different remote sensing (RS) datasets. We focused on six key forage tree species for cervids in Sweden: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), birch (Betula spp.), European aspen (Populus tremula), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), oak (Quercus spp.), and goat willow (Salix caprea).We combined airborne laser scanning and other auxiliary RS data with NFI data from 2016 to 2022 to model small tree abundance from 19 461 plots across Sweden in an area-based approach. We fitted generalized linear mixed models using likelihood-ratio tests to predict species-specific forage availability. Models were validated using an independent dataset of NFI data collected in 2023. Our models demonstrated moderate to strong predictive performance, with marginal R2 values ranging from 0.226 to 0.973. Model validation suggested higher RMSE and rRMSE values for tree species that are scarce throughout the country than for more abundant species.We provide maps for all six modelled tree species, both at a 1 ha and a 1 km2 spatial scale, with the aim for them to be used in wildlife management, forestry planning, and ecological research. Our map products can for example help stakeholders assess a region’s spatial distribution of cervid forage and thus inform habitat management and potentially mitigate browsing-related economic losses in forestry."

 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is a critical measure of ecosystem vitality. This paper examines the spatiotemporal variation in NPP across Africa during 1981–2018 using Theil-Sen slope estimation and wavelet analysis. Sustainable change characteristics in different regions are analyzed using the Hurst exponent, and the influence of driving factors on African NPP are quantified through a structural equation model (SEM). The analysis revealed that: (1) The annual variation curve of African NPP demonstrated a fluctuating upward trajectory (p = 0.001) throughout the study period. Wavelet analysis revealed a cyclical pattern with a primary period of about 20 years, characterized by two upward and downward transitions during 1981–2018. (2) Spatial analysis indicates the distribution of NPP across Africa is centered around the equator and gradually decreases towards higher latitudes, in which the NPP of tropical rainforest and its adjacent areas increases significantly, covering 40.2 % of Africa’s area. However, Hurst exponent analysis reveals that NPP in Africa generally exhibits anti-sustainability changes, with 52.8 % of the total area potentially shifting from growth to decline in the future. (3) SEM analysis shows that NPP in Africa is mainly regulated by natural factors, particularly cumulative precipitation and temperature extremes, which exhibit the highest impact coefficient of 0.89. While topographic factors also have a substantial overall effect, their impact is primarily indirect through climate, with minimal direct influence. These findings offer a scientific foundation and policy support for sustainable development of environmental and socio-economic systems in Africa."

 Studying and analyzing cropland is a difficult task due to its dynamic and heterogeneous growth behavior. Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named multi-modal or Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. Here, the literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all cases. Instead, a specific combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a standardized model schema for the exploration of crop classification through an MVL methodology. jn"

 This study investigated particle number size distributions (PNSD) at a high-elevation, subtropical mountainous site in East Asia using cluster analysis. Measurement was conducted for 3–4 weeks in each season at the Xitou Experimental Forest from winter 2013 to autumn 2014. PNSD was measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer and subsequently grouped into five distinct clusters using K-means clustering. Utilizing trace gases and particulate matter as supporting data, the clusters were classified into five categories: (1) background aerosols, (2) N25 burst events, (3) growth particles, (4) further growth particles associated with high PM2.5 pollution, and (5) aged polluted air, providing insights into sources and evolutionary processes of atmospheric particulates. Elevated N25 bursts in winter and summer coincided with higher H2SO4 proxy levels, suggesting nucleation involving sulfuric acid played a role in new particle formation in these seasons. In addition, the ages of air masses were estimated by using ΔCO/NO2. The results indicated that Clusters 1 (background) and 5 (aged polluted air) represented aged air masses, while Cluster 3 occurring near noontime reflected fresh emissions. Diurnal variations of occurrences and geometric median diameters of clusters showed new particle formation and growth processes presented in the early morning were followed by transport of urban pollution upon the rising of the mixing layer height in noontime.

 Accurate surface reflectance is fundamental to quantitative remote sensing. However, persistent dust retention on land surfaces is a major and understudied problem in global dust belt regions. This compromises the accuracy of vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and other quantitative applications. This study focuses on the Hotan region, located at the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert. A three-pronged approach was employed, including in situ experiments to measure dust retention amounts, laboratory spectral measurements and simulations to assess the impact of varying dust levels, and a long-term comparative analysis of dust-retained and dust-removed satellite imagery (Landsat and Sentinel-2, 2005 to 2024). Results show that vegetated surfaces retain significantly more dust than non-vegetated surfaces. Specifically, maize and Platanus orientalis retained 23.771 g/m2 and 15.522 g/m2, respectively. Non-vegetated surfaces like photovoltaic (PV) panels and painted metal rooftops retained only 4.608 g/m2 and 3.324 g/m2, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the observed changes in reflectance were highly significant. Laboratory spectral measurements and simulation results indicate that land surface reflectance systematically varies with increasing dust retention levels. In satellite imagery, dust retention universally alters the observed surface reflectance across widely distributed land surface types. For PV panels, maximum mean reflectance changes reached 4.8 % in the red band and 4.9 % in the NIR band. For vegetation, changes were even more pronounced, reaching 4.9 % in the red band and −6.7 % in the NIR band. Our findings demonstrate the pervasive and statistically significant impact of dust retention on observed surface reflectance. This highlights the critical need to account for dust interference to ensure the reliability of remote sensing applications in arid and semi-arid regions."

 New particle formation (NPF) is a fundamental process governing atmospheric aerosol production and, consequently, climate and air quality. Despite the extensive study of acid-base interactions in nucleation, the role of organic nitrogen compounds, particularly urea, remains inadequately explored. Here, we employ quantum chemical calculations and kinetic simulations via the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) to elucidate the mechanisms by which urea modulates nucleation processes. Our investigation reveals that urea, through its dual hydrogen-bonding capability and proton-accepting -C=O group, stabilizes clusters formed with methanesulfonic acid (MSA), sulfuric acid (SA), and nitric acid (NA). In binary systems, MSA-Urea clusters exhibit intermediate stability, higher than those of MSA-NH3 but lower than MSA-MA. Notably, in ternary MSA-MA-Urea systems, urea markedly enhances nucleation rates, particularly under low-temperature conditions. These results indicate that urea can compensate for the low ambient concentrations of more potent bases such as methylamine (MA), thus playing a pivotal role in atmospheric nucleation.

 Fine particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) can penetrate the respiratory system and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), posing a threat to human health. The ability to generate ROS can be represented by the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 in air. Herein, PM2.5 was collected from Kyoto and Suzu, Japan, which are downwind regions in East Asia. Kyoto represents a typical densely populated urban center situated in one of Japan's plains, and Suzu is a remote coastal town. This pairing provides a representative framework for assessing OP-related health risks across different environmental settings in Japan. Composite extraction using water and methanol as solvents was used to extract the chemical components of samples, and the OP values of their water-soluble (OPWs-DTT) and methanol-soluble (OPMs-DTT) fractions were assessed via dithiothreitol (DTT) assay.

The OPMs-DTT/OPWs-DTT ratio exceeded 30 % in both locations, indicating that methanol could effectively complement water in estimating the OP of PM2.5. Positive matrix factorization analysis revealed seven pollution sources in Kyoto and six in Suzu. Biomass burning and secondary sulfate with soil were the main OP contributors in both locations. Kyoto (inland) and Suzu (coastal) were both influenced by marine aerosols. Additionally, transboundary pollution from northeast Asia was observed in Suzu.

The mean diurnal variation of NCCN at supersaturations (SS) 0.2 %–1.0 % exhibits similar variation to the total number concentration of aerosols (N10-300) measured by the SMPS. Both exhibit higher concentrations during nighttime and lower during daytime, primarily influenced by atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. We have identified four NPF events during the study period. The new particle burst appeared below 25 nm, while the growth process sustained for 12 to 17 h at the growth rate from 4.5 to 7.2 nm h−1. The growth process begins with coagulation, followed by condensation, which becomes the dominant mechanism in the formation of CCN.

In this study, we examined the occurrence, morphology, and polymer type of MPs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 30 patients with respiratory issues in a health care setting in southwestern Iran, in relation to airborne MPs collected contemporaneously from the ambient environment. Individual MPs were separated by the use of chemical digestion and density gradient centrifugation; these were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Overall, 129 MPs were identified in BALF, with a corrected mean of 3.2 particles/10 mL in BALF; however, the majority were white or transparent fibers ranging from a diameter of 20–100 μm, and were predominantly polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). Air samples, collected using a high-volume OMNI sampler, ranged from 2.2 to 6.7 MP/m3, while in ambient air variation included shapes and colors with fragments, films, and spherules. Additionally, a statistically significant and strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.996 (p < 0.001)) was found between the weekly ambient MP concentration and the BALF MP counts, supporting inhalation as a likely route of exposure.

 Rare earth elements (REEs) are commonly used to trace sources and geochemical processes due to their coherent chemical properties and systematic variations. However, with the rapid expansion of their industrial applications, REEs have increasingly become emerging atmospheric pollutants, while their anthropogenic sources and associated health risks remain poorly understood. In this study, a year-long observation (April 2021–March 2022) of total suspended particles (TSP) and size-segregated aerosol was conducted in Nanchang, a major Chinese REE industry city. We found the average annual concentration of total REEs (ΣREE) was in the order of spring > winter > autumn > summer. Most REEs showed low enrichment factors (EFs), suggesting a primarily crustal origin. However, the elevated Ce and Eu EFs, combined with positive Ce and Eu anomalies pattern, indicated anthropogenic influence. A significant positive correlation of Ce and Eu EFs across both TSP and size-segregated samples further suggests a common anthropogenic source. Photoelectric industry emissions were identified as the primary contributors to the observed anomalies, accounting for 39 % ± 18 % of Ce and 24 % ± 11 % of Eu annually. Notably, both Ce and Eu anomalies showed comparable degree across fine and coarse PM, demonstrating the unique particle size distribution characteristics of photoelectric Ce and Eu. While Ce inhalation showed no significant non-carcinogenic health risks in Nanchang, concerns should be raised for workers and residents near photoelectric industry sites due to high Ce exposure levels. Furthermore, the urgent establishment of threshold values for REEs, particularly Eu, is necessary given its notable enrichment."

 In the Himalayan region of Nepal, the majority of households are single-cell houses (SCH) where families cook, heat, sleep, and perform daily activities in a single shared space. Firewood and other biomass fuels are commonly used for cooking and heating, especially during cold seasons. This combustion process releases harmful pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly degrading indoor air quality (IAQ) and posing serious health risks to residents. This study aims to assess indoor air quality and evaluate pollutant exposure and associated health risks among occupants of SCHs.Continuous real-time monitoring of IAQ parameters was conducted for 24 h over five consecutive days in each house under varying ventilation conditions. CO and PM2.5 concentrations were found to be 25.11 ± 14.24 ppm and 793.8 ± 117.36 μg/m3, respectively—exceeding international health guidelines by up to 3.6 times for CO and 32 times for PM2.5. Residents are exposed to elevated pollutant concentrations for up to 14 h daily due to extended fire use for both cooking and heating. Inhalation exposure modeling revealed average daily pollutant intakes of 248.59 mg of CO and 6849.74 μg of PM2.5 per person. The Air Quality Index (AQI) across monitoring scenarios ranged from 150 to 430, indicating unhealthy to hazardous levels.These findings highlight the urgent need for improved ventilation systems and cleaner cooking technologies to mitigate indoor air pollution and reduce health risks in firewood-dependent households in cold regions."

 Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from on-road vehicle fleets were investigated through tunnel tests conducted in 2014 and 2019 in Guangzhou, China, to assess the impacts of upgraded vehicle emission standards and changing fleet composition. The emission factors of PM2.5-bound PAHs (four-ring and above) significantly decreased by 76.4 %, from 45.22 to 10.66 μg km−1 veh−1 during this period. Although the diesel fleet share fell by ∼75 % from 13.0 % to 3.3 %, diesel vehicles remained the dominant source of PAHs, exhibiting emission factors 9–50 times higher than gasoline vehicles. Notably, emissions of some 5- and 6-ring PAHs declined much less and even increased, suggesting that non-exhaust emissions, particularly tire wear, have become increasingly significant sources of PAHs. The overall toxicity, expressed in terms of toxic equivalency quotients (TEQBaP), declined by 66.7 %, yet benzo[a]pyrene consistently dominated total toxicity (69–74 %). Persistent nocturnal emission risks associated with diesel-dominated freight traffic highlight the need for targeted emission control policies. These results reveal the effectiveness of stringent regulatory measures in reducing vehicle exhaust emissions and stress the emerging importance of mitigating non-exhaust emission sources in urban pollution control strategies."

 The adverse effects of air pollution on human physical health are well established, but potential links with behavioural and mental health problems are also suggested. However, evidence is limited, with few studies employing spatial life course methods or considering the effects of unmeasured and residual confounding factors. This study addresses the identified gap by using prospective longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study to examine associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and subsequent behaviour and mental health outcomes in adulthood. The study sample consists of a birth cohort of 1265 individuals born during 1977 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Individual-level residential address data were linked to air pollution estimates, including annual black smoke levels (micrograms per cubic meter of air or μg/m3) from during pregnancy to age 10 years (1976–1987), and PM10 (21–40 years), PM2.5 (30–40 years), and NO2 (40 years) in adulthood. Behavioural (i.e. nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit substance use disorders) and mental health outcomes (i.e. depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation) were prospectively assessed from age 21–40 years. Findings from unadjusted population-averaged GEE logistic regression models indicated only weak associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and some behavioural and mental health outcomes. In fully adjusted models, associations were fully attenuated, other than PM2.5 exposure and nicotine abuse/dependence (OR = 1.074 [1.0156, 1.136]).

 Despite being a leading cause of health issues, air pollution in smaller cities is often overlooked. To address this gap, annual monitoring of Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Black Carbon (BC), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) was conducted at a residential site in a semi-urban area and, for comparison, in an urban area. The sampling site was affected by multiple, co-located sources, including the National Highway (NH-19), traffic intersections, street vendor stalls, and other commercial areas, resulting in high exposure levels. The collected data were analyzed to understand the dynamics, variations, morphology, and chemical composition of particles; these levels were then assessed concerning passive cigarette smoke (PSC) exposure, evaluating potential health impacts. Four health outcomes—cardiovascular mortality (CM), lung cancer (LC), low birth weight (LBW), and decreased lung function (DLF) in school-aged children—were assessed to quantify the burden. The results indicate that even minimal concentrations can significantly affect human health, as a rise of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2, along with 1 μg/m3 in BC, is associated with mean increases and standard errors of 8.1 (3.98), 8.5 (4.48), and 3.03 (1.22) PSC per day across the four health outcomes, respectively. Seasonally, the post-monsoon period showed predominance due to extensive use of biomass and fossil fuels for heating and cooking in semi-urban regions, leading to an elevated prevalence of decreased lung function (DLF), with 18 passive cigarettes identified as the most significant risk factor among the various outcomes. This study emphasizes the need for population-based monitoring to issue public health advisories that protect vulnerable groups, especially in smaller cities such as Tundla, located in Northern India."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the important pollutant groups because of their tremendous emissions and distribution in different environmental media. This study presented comprehensive PAH concentrations from olive leaves and ambient air samples collected over one year. The average concentrations of Σ12PAH in olive leaves and ambient air were 565 ± 402 ng/g DW and 22.4 ± 3.4 ng/m3, respectively. During warmer months, both leaf and ambient air samples exhibited reduced PAH concentrations. The leaf exchange is essential for understanding the accumulation of organic pollutants in trees. Some models estimate the exchange of pollutants between the air and leaves to understand their transport paths. In this study, eleven different models with various parameters were incorporated into the data. Although the octanol/air partition coefficient (KOA) was found to be the most influential parameter in the employed models, the physical and chemical parameters of the plant, including moisture, air, and lipid content, were effective in the partition. The leaf/air partition coefficient (KLA) was used to determine the direction of PAH movement. Calculated logKLA values in the models ranged from 5.5 to 14. PAH compounds with log KOA values less than 10 showed a similar trend and were close to each other for all models evaluated in this study. However, PAHs with logKOA>10 yielded scattered results for the applied models. A best-fit model was suggested by using the data obtained in this study. The suggested model agreed well with the measured data and other models."

 Air pollution is one of the major public health issues worldwide. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to various health-related issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains elusive. The main focus of this study was to investigate the association between inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to indoor air pollution exposure. This study investigated the effect of indoor pollutants generated from biomass burning on biomarkers (i.e., Clara cell protein (CC16), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and 8-hydrox-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]). One hundred healthy rural women aged 25–65 were recruited to investigate their cardiopulmonary health, blood biomarkers, and pollution status inside their kitchen rooms. Pollutant concentrations were monitored indoors with the time-activity of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), and formaldehyde (HCHO). Serum samples were analyzed for biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to ensure precise measurements and enhanced sensitivity. Study results revealed higher particulate and gaseous pollutant concentrations in kitchen rooms of biomass users (p < 0.001). In unadjusted analysis, baseline serum levels of CRP (7.96 vs. 1.68 mg/L; p < 0.001), IL-8 (51.26 vs. 9.56 pg/mL; p < 0.001), 8-OHdG (71.74 vs. 26.23 ng/mL; p < 0.001) and LDH (335.1 vs. 227.65 U/L; p < 0.001) were increased in biomass-exposed vs. clean fuel users, respectively, whereas serum levels of CC16 (4846.68 ± 832.37 pg/mL; p < 0.001) were decreased. Study results revealed that particulate matter has strong positive correlations with CRP and IL-8 and a negative association with CC16 among biomass users. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to indoor pollutants may be associated with differences in markers of inflammation, lung epithelial injury, and oxidative DNA damage among tribal women. Further, this study may help explain abnormal cardiovascular and respiratory complications among rural tribal biomass fuel users."

 ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess indoor NO2 and SO2 levels in selected clinical and hospital dental units, identify sources linked to dental activities, and evaluate site and health risks from these gaseous oxides for students, professionals and patients, including immunocompromised.MethodTen different hospitals and clinical dental units were selected for this assessment.Key findingsAnnual average of 14.5 ± 4.6 μg/m3 of NO2 and 8.0 ± 1.7 μg/m3 of SO2 were recorded. A significant difference (<0.05) in NO2 and SO2 levels was found, while non-significant differences (>0.05) were observed between hospital and clinical units. Winter was more polluted due to higher gas levels, while spring was cleaner. Dunn's test showed a significant seasonal trend. Regression analysis revealed a robust (R2 = 0.9) to moderately strong (R2 = 0.6) correlation between the concentration of NO2 and SO2 except during winter (R2 = 0.4). The highest levels of nitrogen oxides were found during anesthesia performance, and higher sulfur oxides were observed during dental implantation and impression performance. Negligible site risk was found except during winter. Indvisual HQ-SO2 and HQ-NO2 did not present significant health risks to dentists except for HQ-NO2 to immunocompromised adult patients. Synergistic ΣHQ posed a significant HQ risk to immunocompromised patients at most dental units, but to adults at a few clinical sites.ConclusionIndoor and outdoor sources of pollutants should be closely monitored and controlled for patient safety and long-term exposure to dentists.

 Understanding the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from chemical reactions requires detailed knowledge of reaction products and their formation pathways. In this study, we investigated the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of chlorine-initiated trans-2-pentenal (T2P) reactions, including the decomposition of key intermediates and complexes, using the M06-2X/6-311+G(2df,2p) and CBS-QB3 computational methods. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were computed at the M06-2X level of theory, enabling the prediction of thermochemical properties for T2P, chlorine atoms, and the reaction products. For selected pathways, rate constants were determined over a temperature range of 300–3000 K at atmospheric pressure using conventional transition-state theory (CTST) and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory. At room temperature, the P2, P3, and P6 adducts emerged as the dominant kinetic products, with calculated rate constants aligning well with experimental data. At room temperature (300 K), the main kinetic products identified were P2 (CH3CH2CH(Cl)CHCHO), P3 (CH3CHCHCHCHO + HCl), and P6 (CH2CH2CHCHCHO + HCl). The calculated rate constants for these products were 2.91 × 10−10, 1.71 × 10−10, and 2.78 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for P2, P3, and P6, respectively, which agree well with experimental observations. Dynamic modeling showed that these adducts contribute significantly to SOA formation, with particle growth up to 50 μg m−3 within 1 h at 300 K. Additionally, volatility trends of the products were analyzed to understand their atmospheric persistence and contribution to aerosol mass. Finally, leveraging insights from dynamic studies, we examined SOA formation from the relevant adducts, observing growth within 1 h at 300 K. We also discuss SOA formation in the context of volatility and its broader atmospheric implications."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large class of pollutants widely present in the environment and are the earliest discovered and studied carcinogens.The oxidation of PAHs can generate oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), which are key precursors for the formation of SOA. However, the formation mechanism of OPAHs and NPAHs are unclear. Fluorene (FLN) is one of the most abundant PAHs discovered, and several studies have been conducted on the reaction of FLN. In this article, we investigated the oxidation mechanism of FLN initiated by OH radicals through high level quantum chemistry and chemical kinetics calculations. The oxidation starts by forming adducts FLN-n-OH (FLNn in short, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11) which then react with O2 and NO2 in the atmosphere. When the overall reaction rate coefficient of FLNn with O2 are slow, FLNn mainly react with NO2 to form n-nitrofluorene in the atmosphere. Effective reaction rates of FLN1 with O2 in the atmosphere are fast at of ∼1.90 × 104 s−1, suggesting the negligible reaction between FLN1 adduct and NO2. Therefore, the main fate of FLN1 is reaction with O2 followed by subsequent unimolecular isomerization routes, forming OPAHs only. The rate coefficient for reaction of FLN2, FLN4 and FLN10 with O2 are obtained at of 7.44, 26.4 and 1.07 s−1, respectively, suggesting the likely formation of 2-nitrofluorene 4-nitrofluorene and 10-nitrofluorene. In addition, the hydrogen atom abstraction from FLN and the generation of alkoxy groups from FLNn-i-OO resulted in formation of unsaturated compounds, which subsequently reacted with O2 to form a large number of unsaturated oxygen-containing compounds and further transform to highly oxidized products."

 As a part of Michigan's efforts to identify and address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination statewide, more knowledge of atmospheric PFAS concentrations is needed to better understand their atmospheric transport and impact on other environmental media. This research aimed to measure atmospheric concentrations of PFAS in Michigan's ambient air using low-cost and easy-to-use passive samplers and identify relationships with environmental factors. Passive samplers, consisting of polyurethane foam (PUF) discs and sorbent-filled polyethylene tubes (radiello-XAD samplers), were deployed for a month at 27 sites across Michigan and analyzed for both ionic and volatile, neutral PFAS. Short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), specifically perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA) (d.f. 60 %) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) (d.f. 96 %), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (d.f. 63 %) were the most frequently detected compounds, with the ∑3PFAS ranging from non-detect to 15.5 pg/m3 for the PUFs and from non-detect to 248 pg/m3 in the radiello-XAD samplers. 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol was also frequently detected (d.f. 45 %) and had a positive correlation with both population density (r = 0.52, p < .05) and industrial sites' density (r = 0.48, p < .05). Detection of specific compounds on each type of sampler provided insight into the preferential transport pathway of atmospheric PFAS. For example, PFOS was observed mostly in the gas-phase, predominantly captured by the radiello-XAD samplers, while PFBA was mostly in the particle-phase, predominantly captured by the PUFs. This study highlights the importance of developing detection tools for measuring atmospheric PFAS across a vast geographic area to identify contributing factors to ambient concentrations."

 To investigate the combustion characteristics of diesel/methanol in the engine cylinder, this study developed a chemical kinetics model for the diesel/methanol (DM) dual-fuel mechanism, comprising 288 reactions and 101 species. The simplified DM mechanism was optimized by adjusting the rate parameters of key reactions, combined with a sensitivity evaluation system for ignition delay time (IDT) and laminar flame speed (LFS). The model's predictions for IDT, LFS, and the concentrations of key species were verified experimentally using a zero-dimensional model. The effects of methanol substitution rate, and altitude on the formation of aldehyde pollutants were systematically analyzed. The results show that the DM mechanism can accurately predict the IDT, LFS, and the formation of key species for a single fuel within the temperature range of 318 K–2000 K, equivalence ratio range of 0.5–2.0, and pressure range of 0.1 MPa–2 MPa. Compared with existing mechanisms, the DM mechanism significantly improves prediction accuracy for these parameters, with R2 values greater than 0.96 and RMSE values below 0.05, demonstrating higher accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, increasing the methanol substitution rate significantly reduces CH2O emissions, while altitude lead to a marked increase in CH2O and CH3CHO emissions. Therefore, the proposed DM mechanism shows strong applicability and generalization capability in combustion characteristic prediction and pollutant emission control."

 This study employs the Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model to analyse air pollution in Bathinda, Delhi, and Kanpur within the Indo-Gangetic Plain of South Asia, contrasting a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with a Residential (RES) scenario that advocates for cleaner household energy use. It highlights the issue of ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, a common challenge in urban areas worldwide. The RES scenario's transition to cleaner fuels, including Liquefied Petroleum Gas, biogas, and renewable sources, forecasts significant emission reductions: a 26.76 % decrease in PM2.5 and a 10.67 % reduction in SO2 emissions. This adjustment leads to a 16.14 % improvement in average PM2.5 exposure, from 90.62 to 75.99 μg/m3, potentially preventing nearly one-third of premature deaths due to air pollution. By quantitatively evaluating residential emission control strategies and their health impacts using the GAINS model, this study offers a replicable framework for clean air planning in highly polluted regions.

 This study presents year-round observations of eleven atmospheric volatile phenolic compounds (VPCs) in Beijing (2023–2024) using high-frequency sampling and an optimized UPLC method. VPCs exhibited clear seasonal variability, with wintertime concentration peaks largely driven by background accumulation, while ΔCF analysis revealed true source- or chemistry-driven enhancements in specific species (e.g., phenol in autumn, 4-chlorophenol in summer). Phenol and cresols dominated ozone formation potential (OFP, 43 %) and OH radical loss rate (LOH, 37 %), respectively, with reactivity strongest in spring, underscoring their central role in photochemistry. Health risk assessment indicated that children faced 2.8 times higher exposure risk than adults, with nitrophenols and chlorophenols as the major contributors. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis identified both local anthropogenic emissions and regional transport from southern Hebei and Shandong as key sources. A springtime case study of high-pollution episodes further showed that stagnant meteorological conditions and strong emissions (traffic exhaust, pesticide volatilization) led to sharp VPC accumulation and enhanced secondary transformations, amplifying ozone and SOA formation. By integrating ΔCF diagnostics, OFP/LOH reactivity, PSCF attribution, and episode-based analysis, this study highlights the underestimated yet critical role of VPCs in urban air pollution and provides actionable evidence for joint O3–PM2.5 control strategies."

 This study investigated the impact of precipitation intensity (PI) on the near-surface wind characteristics during Super Typhoon Lekima (2019), through field measurements using two Doppler Wind Lidars at Zhoushan and Taizhou, China. Four theoretical wind profile models were evaluated in different atmospheric stratifications and PI, and PI- induced variations in turbulence intensity, gust factor, and wind spectrum were quantified. The results show that the strong wind exceeding 20 m/s predominantly occurred at the level of rainstorm and above (PI >12 mm/h), confirming that strong winds coincide with heavy rainfall in typhoon conditions. The Deaves-Harris model achieved best agreement with measured wind profiles under all atmospheric stability conditions (correlation coefficient > 0.97 and RMSE <0.6 m/s). Power law and log law models remained valid to describe the mean wind profile below 250 m for PI <600 mm/h. Wind power exponent (α) and turbulence intensity initially decreased then increased with increasing PI, whereas gust factors exhibited more stable trends. Although turbulence intensity and gust factor were linearly correlated, conventional power law model failed to describe their vertical profiles in heavy rainstorms (PI = 30–90 mm/h). Longitudinal wind spectra showed close agreement with the von Kármán spectrum at low frequencies (<0.1 Hz) across various PI conditions. However, the von Kármán spectrum failed to adequately represent the lateral wind spectrum, particularly in heavy rain (PI = 6–12 mm/h) conditions. This study provides a theoretical basis for optimizing the wind-resistant design of coastal structures under typhoon wind-rain coupled conditions."

 Heatwaves are multidimensional phenomena characterized by interacting attributes such as intensity, duration, frequency, and spatial extent. Most existing composite indices assume complete compensability among indicators, overlooking the imbalance between them and potentially misrepresenting heatwave magnitude. Here, we propose a Comprehensive Heatwave Magnitude Index (CHMI) that integrates Group Utility and Equilibrium Utility to jointly quantify both aggregate impact and indicator equilibrium. The CHMI introduces a reward-penalty mechanism that adjusts for disequilibrium, thereby improving sensitivity to events dominated by a single extreme characteristic. Additionally, on the basis of differences in indicator levels, we classify the heatwave magnitude into low-magnitude and high-magnitude categories, with a more detailed classification for the high-magnitude category. Using datasets from two contrasting climate regions—the arid Xinjiang (dry heatwaves) and the humid middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (wet heatwaves)—CHMI was validated at both grid and regional scales. Results show that high-magnitude heatwaves exhibit greater disequilibrium, and the spatial manifestation of disequilibrium varies systematically between dry and wet regimes: high-intensity events dominate in Xinjiang, whereas long-duration events prevail in the Yangtze region. By explicitly incorporating equilibrium into the quantification framework, CHMI offers a more balanced and comprehensive metric for evaluating heatwave magnitude, improving its applicability for regional analysis and comparative studies."

 A multiradar mosaic is a key solution to the insufficient detection range of a single radar. In the traditional grid-preprocessed mosaicking method (GPM), radar polar coordinate data are interpolated into Cartesian grids to compensate for vertically undersampled regions in radar volume scans. However, such interpolation fails to accurately reconstruct the polarization parameters in these regions. Therefore, this study presentss a polar coordinate direct-mosaicking method (PDM) for the high-density radar network in South China, which directly operates on polar coordinate data and avoids initial interpolation. Based on typical precipitation cases from May to August 2021, three key issues in the PDM are addressed: First, horizontal reflectivity (ZH) biases and differential reflectivity (ZDR) offsets are corrected; second, the number of radars in the mosaicking process is evaluated, with five radars determined to be optimal; and third, the weights of different radar data are optimized by considering vertical and horizontal distances, along with the melting layer position. Compared with the GPM, the PDM yields a more accurate representation of the melting layer, with a smaller mean height error (192 m compared with 470 m) and a more realistic estimation of thickness (661 m compared with 1507 m). It also improves the continuity of polarimetric parameters within convective core regions. The case studies indicate that the PDM enables earlier identification of ZDR columns and more accurate estimation of their heights. These results demonstrate that the PDM improves the accuracy of polarization parameter mosaics and offers potential for future applications in cloud microphysics research."

 The Indian-Burma Trough (IBT) can modulate winter precipitation across East and South Asia on various timescales, yet traditional climatological indices fail to capture its synoptic-scale variability. This study defines an event-based frequency index by objectively identifying the individual IBT events from 1981 to 2019, revealing an average of 18.3 events per winter that originate over the northern Bay of Bengal and propagate eastward along the subtropical westerlies. The interannual variability of IBT frequency is closely linked to a tripole pattern of the tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), showing significant positive correlations with the SSTAs in tropical western Indian Ocean and central-eastern Pacific Ocean, and a negative correlation with the equatorial SSTAs east of the Philippines. This SST configuration modulates IBT frequency through dual pathways.

 The southwesterly flow (SW) is a synoptic-scale strong wind system that transports warm, moist air toward Taiwan and plays a crucial role in Taiwan's precipitation during the mei-yu season (May 15–June 15). Using ERA5 data (fifth-generation reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and rainfall observations from surface weather stations in Taiwan, this study examines the flow and rainfall characteristics of prolonged SW (PSW) cases and their relationship with extreme precipitation events around southern Taiwan during the 1979–2022 mei-yu seasons. Statistical analysis reveals a strong co-occurrence between PSW and persistent heavy rainfall (PHR), with 75 % of PHR cases occurring during PSW and 60 % of PSW cases featuring PHR. Furthermore, 83 % of R99.9 events (the 99.9th percentile rainfall intensity) are associated with PSW. Composite analysis demonstrates that the formation and maintenance of PSW involve specific synoptic-scale flow patterns: a slight eastward migration of the western North Pacific subtropical high, sustained intensity of the South Asian high, and persistent low-pressure systems over East Asia. These pressure patterns collectively establish sustained southwesterly winds, leading to significant wind speed intensification and moisture accumulation around Taiwan over an extended period (84–126 h). These findings highlight the crucial role of synoptic-scale pressure patterns in maintaining PSW and facilitating PHR occurrence, offering quantitative criteria for forecasting PSW during the mei-yu season."

 Overshooting tops (OTs) are informative indicators of convective storm intensity and are widely utilized in meteorological analyses. This study presents an automated algorithm for OT detection and OT height estimation using convolutional neural networks applied to visible satellite imagery. The models are trained and validated on an extensive OT dataset comprising approximately 10,000 manually detected cases over Europe. The OTs were identified from high-resolution visible (HRV) channel of the SEVIRI instrument on board the MSG geostationary satellite, with the heights determined from the length of their shadows in the imagery. While conventional OT detection methods primarily rely on the identification of cold features in thermal infrared channels, our approach extracts information from visible channels, leveraging the ground truth data on OT shadow length provided by the training dataset. In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 97% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km. The performance is expected to further improve once the model is applied to polar and new generation geostationary satellites with increased spatial resolution."

 The physical mechanisms underlying sea-breeze (SB) conditions in the Palma basin (Mallorca island, western Mediterranean Sea) are analyzed using the Copernicus European Regional Reanalysis (CERRA) model outputs from 2009–2020. In this complex terrain region, SB is strongly influenced by the upslope winds generated at the mountains that close the basin. The comparison of model results with multiple sources of observations (automatic weather stations [AWS], satellite products and radiosondes) shows its ability to reproduce the main SB characteristics.Taking as reference the classification of SB conditions from a previous AWS-based study, a new methodology is now proposed that consists of the application of selecting filters to the CERRA data. The characteristics of the SB events show good agreement with those selected from the AWS. CERRA is able to reproduce the majority of SB patterns: the evolution from land breeze to SB, the cold and moist air advection from the sea during the steady state, the height and intensity of the SB maximum, the importance of the soil moisture and the horizontal and vertical temperature differences. CERRA has difficulties in reproducing SB events which are strongly conditioned by the topography of the basin, due to the insufficient spatial resolution to include the effect of surface heterogeneities, as is the case for upslope winds. However, this method is applicable to other complex terrain regions, and CERRA presents itself as a very useful tool for the study of the physical mechanisms that occur under SB conditions."

 Extreme precipitation events are among the most damaging hydroclimatic hazards, particularly in monsoon-dominated, topographically complex, and data-scarce regions of South Asia. Despite advances in global and regional climate modeling, accurate simulations of such extreme events remain challenging due to the nonlinear interactions between deep convection, orography, and large-scale circulation. This study evaluates the performance of the Regional Climate Model RegCM5, developed by the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), and reproduces two severe monsoon-driven precipitation events: July 2010 and August 2022. High-resolution simulations were conducted using convection-permitting (3 km) non-hydrostatic cores (MOLOCH and MM5) and are compared with coarser hydrostatic (12 km, MM4) simulations employing parameterized convection. Model outputs were validated against ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis, satellite-based GPM precipitation, the Gloh2 ensemble product, and in-situ observations. Results indicate that the 3 km MOLOCH configuration significantly improves the simulation of precipitation intensity, spatial distribution, and temporal variability relative to hydrostatic runs. Notably, RegCM5-MOLOCH effectively captures the 500 hPa geopotential height patterns associated with the extreme event of the 2010 Russian blocking ridge, underscoring its utility in resolving key synoptic drivers.RegCM5-MOLOCH reproduces the large-scale moisture transport while capturing terrain-induced convergence along the Sulaiman mountain ranges of Balochistan. Diagnostics of Moisture Flux Convergence (MFC) and Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) further reveal strong southwesterly moisture inflow from the Arabian Sea converging over Sindh and Balochistan during August 2022, consistent with the flood-affected areas. Furthermore, Spearman rank correlation analysis reveals robust linkages between simulated precipitation and sea surface temperature-related changes in La Niña and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This highlights the combined influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere modes on monsoon extremes. Whilst, overall, convection-permitting simulations reduce biases, some persistent wet biases remain, likely due to the unresolved uncertainties in cloud microphysics, land–atmosphere coupling, and moisture transport. These findings enhance the application of high-resolution regional modeling for enhanced flood risk assessment, improved early warning systems, and more effective climate adaptation strategies in monsoon-affected regions."

 Investigating atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) holds significant value for the understanding and numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Based on the 20 years (2003−2022) of radiosonde data and 10 years (2013−2022) of microwave radiometer observations, this study applied two methods to determine the ABLH and comprehensively investigated the ABLH characteristics over Hong Kong, a densely populated subtropical city strongly influenced by tropical cyclones (TC). The analysis includes the interannual and seasonal variability of ABLH, as well as its relationships with atmospheric stability and wind shear exponent (WSE) under both TC and non-tropical cyclone (NTC) conditions. The results indicate higher ABLH in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter, and higher ABLH under weakly unstable boundary layer conditions. Nevertheless, the interannual variation in the ABLH is insignificant. Notably, the relationships between ABLH, atmospheric stability, and WSE exhibit distinct differences under TC and NTC conditions. It is revealed that on NTC days, the ABLH increases with the WSE under neutral or weakly stable stratification, while this increase is not significant during TC days due to turbulence saturation.

The monsoon season had the highest cloud occurrence frequency (70.5 %), followed by postmonsoon (28.1 %), premonsoon (12.5 %), and winter (7.8 %). Single-layer clouds dominated (≈ 67.8 %) irrespective of seasons, and the multi-layer clouds were more prevalent during the monsoon. Most clouds occurred below 2 km, with noticeable bimodal distributions during the monsoon and premonsoon seasons. While the primary mode at 1–2 km is closely linked to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, the second prominent cloud vertical mode is associated with the 0 °C isotherm level. The diurnal variation of primary cloud mode closely follows the PBL evolution, especially during the monsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The cloud occurrence frequency also shows a strong diurnal cycle with high occurrence of clouds during the daytime in all the seasons, probably associated with daytime heating by insolation. The efficacy of reanalysis datasets in producing accurate cloud characteristics is assessed by comparing ERA5 products with long-term statistics obtained in the present study. It is noted that ERA5-derived CBH overestimates (underestimates) low (high)-level clouds."

 On 21 July 2021, extreme rainfall hit central and northern Henan, China, with Xinxiang recording an hourly rainfall of 149.9 mm and 10-h accumulations exceeding 400 mm (the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm). This rainstorm, a critical episode in the “21·7” Henan rainstorm event occurring one day after the high-impact 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm, was triggered by the development and merger of two meso-β-scale convective systems (NMCS and SMCS). Using convection-permitting ensemble simulations and targeted data assimilation, this study first examines the roles of key mid-to-lower tropospheric synoptic systems (which influenced the 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm) in the subsequent 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, then identifies and verifies critical mesoscale factors governing the two MCSs' development and merger. Results indicate that a mid-level low-pressure system (corresponding to a lower-level trough) and a high-pressure ridge extending from the southwestern periphery of the western Pacific subtropical high were critically important synoptic-scale systems influencing both consecutive rainstorm events. For the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, the low primarily governed the total precipitation amount, while the ridge mainly influenced the rainfall spatial pattern in central Henan by modulating the SMCS organization. Furthermore, two mesoscale shear lines are found to drive convection evolution. One, formed by the near-surface southeasterly flow ahead of the trough turning into a northeasterly barrier flow parallel to the terrain, influenced the southern tip of the NMCS. The other, from converging ridge-edge southwesterlies and southeasterlies, drove SMCS development. Radar radial velocity assimilation confirms that refining these pivotal shear lines can enhance convective and quantitative precipitation forecasts."

 Ascent–Drift–Descent Radiosonde System (ADDRS), China's independently developed third-generation radiosonde system, employs navigation satellite (Beidou and GPS) positioning technology to enhance the accuracy and reliability of wind measurements. Meanwhile, by using double sounding balloons nested inside and outside, it can conduct the three-phase observation of ascent–drift–descent, thereby achieving two vertical profiles and one stratospheric trajectory by releasing sounding balloons only once. Based on the data from the ADDRS GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) wind-finding radiosonde (hereafter ADDRS radiosonde) during the ascent and descent phases from field experiments conducted in Inner Mongolia and Guangdong Province, this study compared the observation-minus-analysis (O−A) statistics between the radiosonde data and the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5) dataset. Furthermore, the data were assessed according to the uncertainty specified in the Observing Systems Capability Analysis and Review Tool (OSCAR) requirements, which are derived from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Rolling Review of Requirements (RRR) for upper-air measurements. Meanwhile, the operational L-band radar wind-finding radiosonde (hereafter L-band radiosonde) data at the same stations were taken as a reference. The results show that the wind components at all levels, as well as the temperature during nighttime, can be used directly. By contrast, it is recommended that positive bias corrections be applied to the temperature in the lower stratosphere in the ascent phase during daytime and the relative humidity at upper levels; while negative bias corrections be applied to the temperature at all levels in the descent phase during daytime and the relative humidity across the lower to middle troposphere, prior to distribution on the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) to increase their utility. Except for the relative humidity between 800 and 550 hPa, all other variables from the ADDRS radiosonde data perform better than the threshold values of OSCAR requirements uncertainty, demonstrating their suitability for numerical weather prediction (NWP) application. The wind components at all levels and the temperature below 100 hPa achieve the breakthrough values, indicating potential improvements for NWP performance."

 The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a climate-sensitive region with profound implications for the atmospheric water cycle in both Asia and the globe. While global warming has increased precipitation and atmospheric water-holding capacity, energy constraints prevent a proportional relationship between atmospheric water content and global mean precipitation changes. In this study, we utilized multi-source precipitation datasets (ERA5-Land, CPC, CRU, CMAP, GPCP) and atmospheric water flux data (ERA5) to investigate the conversion of atmospheric water to precipitation, a fundamental water cycle process, across the QTP and its surrounding regions from 1979 to 2020 using the Capturability of Atmospheric Water (CAW) index. Our findings reveal a dipole evolution pattern in CAW, with strengthening in the north and weakening in the south. The QTP, a positive mismatch region with limited atmospheric water but efficient precipitation conversion, is highly sensitive to climate change. The evolution of CAW is driven by meteorological factors, with cloud cover and actual evapotranspiration enhancing CAW in the northeastern QTP, while potential evapotranspiration weakens CAW in the southeastern QTP. On a larger scale, CAW evolution is modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, where the East Asian summer monsoon enhances CAW in the northeast, while the South Asian summer monsoon weakens CAW in the southeast. Additionally, a qualitative assessment of atmospheric water resource potential, integrating CAW and water vapor transport flux, identifies four distinct development models. These findings provide critical insights for water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in the QTP."

A newly implemented contrail cirrus scheme in a double-moment cloud microphysics scheme in climate model realistically reproduces the contrail evolution and provides regional forcing estimates within the range reported by other models. The work highlights the importance of initial contrail characteristics and the need for detailed cloud particle representations in climate model contrail simulations. 
 Contrail cirrus is the largest contributor to aviation effective radiative forcing (ERF), but remains highly uncertain (∼ 70 %). Recent research has highlighted the critical role of cloud microphysical schemes in contrail cirrus climate modelling. In this study, we implement a contrail parameterisation in the double-moment cloud microphysics scheme, Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics (CASIM), within the regional configuration of the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). We first investigate a contrail cluster model experiment, showing that the simulated contrails retain a high ice crystal number concentration for several hours before declining. Ice water content increases during the early stage of the lifecycle before gradually decreasing. In addition, as the contrail cluster gradually sediments below flight levels, there is an increase in both contrail ice number concentration and water content. We also perform regional simulations over a European domain, estimating a regional annual mean contrail cirrus ERF of 0.93 W m−2, within the range of previous climate modelling estimates. Using a range of initial contrail width, depth and ice crystal size based on contrail observations, we estimate an annual mean European regional contrail cirrus ERF range of 0.19 to 2.80 W m−2. The seasonal cycle of contrail cirrus ERF is mainly driven by the background meteorology and the natural clouds vertical structure. Our study highlights the critical need for double-moment cloud microphysics in global climate models to realistically simulate contrail impacts. Future work should extend the simulation globally and investigate how the use of alternative fuels affects contrail microphysical properties, contrail lifetime, and climate impact."

This work demonstrates how field-to-cable coupling induces currents on the LLS sensor power supply cable shield, which are responsible for spurious (scattered) magnetic fields and, thus, cause errors in the estimation of the incident angle and amplitude, called ""sensor site errors"". 
 Lightning location system (LLS) sensors, which detect and locate atmospheric discharges, are typically powered by cables buried up to one meter underground. Within the LLS community, it is well known that these cables can create spurious magnetic fields, which can in turn adversely impact the sensor measurements and the resulting data. This issue arises from currents induced in the cable shield by the lightning electromagnetic fields that penetrate the ground. The magnetic field generated by these currents lead to “site errors”, causing inaccuracies in estimating the angle of incidence and the peak current of lightning strokes. Although these sensor-specific errors can be partially corrected, a better understanding of the coupling mechanism between the lightning electromagnetic field and the cable could help in minimizing the site errors. This study presents an analysis of the lightning electromagnetic field interaction with cables and examines the influence of various ground and cable properties on this interaction. This work represents a first step toward understanding the physical mechanism leading to LLS sensor site errors. Considering simplified scenarios involving a single insulated or bare conductor, this work provides practical insights that LLS operators can use to estimate worst-case site errors for a provisioned sensor site. Additionally, we show that some site errors observed in operational sensors can be successfully reproduced with good agreement using the proposed approach."

The radar will make 3D measurements of the ionosphere at 50–1000 km altitudes. We show that the so-called multipurpose radar modulations and optimal data analysis can improve the time resolution of the measurements by more than an order of magnitude, and they enable one to measure ion-neutral collision frequencies, which are proportional to neutral particle density, in the lower ionosphere. 
 EISCAT3D will be a high-power, high-duty-cycle, large-aperture multistatic radar system with digitally steerable aperture array antennas and solid-state transmitters. The advanced technology enables the system to form multiple simultaneous beams at each radar site and to use advanced transmission modulation techniques. Multipurpose transmission modulations that use the same radar pulses for probing all altitude regions of the ionosphere, as well as the lag profile inversion technique needed for deconvolving autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of the scattering process from the received signal at selected altitudes, have previously been developed for monostatic, single-beam radars. We generalize the concept of multipurpose modulations for multistatic, multibeam systems and introduce a lag profile inversion tool that can perform the ACF deconvolution with modest computing power. We also show that lag profile inversion is not needed for the analysis of remote receiver data or D region pulse-to-pulse correlations. We deconvolve incoherent scatter ACFs from synthetic radar signals that correspond to a possible EISCAT3D multipurpose mode by means of lag profile inversion and fit plasma parameters to the deconvolved ACFs using an analysis tool that makes optimal use of data from all receive beams of the multistatic, multibeam system. The results demonstrate that the multibeam remote receivers provide significant benefits: the remote receiver data have less incoherent scatter self-noise than the core transceiver site data, they enable one to fill gaps critical for E region plasma parameter fits in monostatic ACF data, the data are accurate enough for E region ion-neutral collision frequency fits, and they enable D region measurements with arbitrary transmission modulations. We benchmark computational requirements of the lag profile inversion analysis and use both synthetic radar signal and real measurements with the KAIRA radio receiver and EISCAT VHF incoherent scatter radar to demonstrate D region measurements with a multibeam remote receiver."

The distinct behaviour in the different basins of the Spanish waters is reflected, and the need for further investment in experimental observations due to its great usefulness is also evidenced. 
 The ocean and atmosphere communicate directly through air–sea interaction fluxes. These include heat exchange by latent (LHFL) and sensible (SHFL) heat and momentum (MOFL) by wind stress. These stand as the leading predictors of how the ocean influences atmospheric variability and vice versa. In this paper, meteorological and upper-ocean measurements collected during the period of 2011–2023 aboard four research vessels over Spanish waters and adjacent seas are used to study air–sea interaction fluxes.

Recorded data are sent daily to the IEO Data Center on land, where quality control procedures are applied. Heat and momentum flux products are derived using the bulk aerodynamic approximation and are stored within a MEDAR/MedAtlas format alongside the meteorological and ocean variables used in the calculation.

However, observational records of TWSA are limited to 2002 onwards. To overcome this limitation, we provide a long-term TWSA data set for the global land from 1984 to 2020 by combining a data-driven approach with time‑variable gravity observations from geodetic tracking data. The data set retains seasonal consistency and adds reliable long‑term signals due to the data combination. 
 The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission, GRACE-FO, have observed global mass changes and transports, expressed as terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA), for over two decades. However, for climate model evaluation, climate change attribution and other applications, multi-decadal TWSA time series are required. This need has triggered several studies on reconstructing TWSA via regression approaches or machine learning techniques, with the help of predictor variables such as rainfall, land or sea surface temperature. Here, we combine such an approach, for the first time, with large-scale time-variable gravity information from geodetic satellite laser ranging (SLR) and Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) tracking. The new reconstruction TWSTORE (Terrestrial Water STOrage REconstruction) is formulated in a GRACE-derived empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) basis and complemented with the Löcher et al.

RTSs are key features of abrupt permafrost thaw accelerated by climate change. Using satellite images and field data, we identified and classified over 6000 RTSs. This dataset helps scientists better understand how warming is changing Arctic landscapes and provides a trusted reference for training artificial intelligence to detect these landforms in the future. 
 Permafrost thaw disrupts ecosystems, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles, reinforcing climate change through a positive permafrost-carbon feedback loop. Thaw can be gradual, deepening the active layer, or abrupt, triggering thermokarst, thermo-erosion, or thermodenudation. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are a key manifestation of abrupt permafrost thaw. Yet, their distribution, scale, and environmental controls in the West Siberian Arctic remain poorly understood, further complicated by their rapid evolution. This study presents an extensive update of the West Siberian RTS inventory through manual mapping using high-resolution, multi-source, multi-year recent (2016–2023) satellite basemaps (ESRI, Google Earth, and Yandex Maps). We developed an RTS classification capturing key environmental parameters, including morphology, spatial organization, terrain position, and associated relief-forming concurrent processes. The dataset comprises 6168 classified RTS landforms, integrating newly mapped sites with previously reported occurrences to provide a comprehensive view of a 445 226 km2 region covering the Yamal, Gydan, and Tazovsky peninsulas. The collected data underwent manual filtering and verification, leveraging local field experience and observations from key sites to reduce uncertainty and minimize false positives. Accuracy analysis, performed by comparing the dataset with various field datasets collected across the peninsulas, confirmed high accuracy (>90 %) for RTS identification. The dataset likely underestimated the distribution of small RTSs due to the resolution limitations of remote sensing data, hence generally providing a conservative estimate. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for diverse research fields, including ecology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, climatology, permafrost science, and natural hazard assessment. Additionally, it provides a crucial reference dataset for machine learning applications, enhancing upcoming remote sensing classification and predictive modeling approaches.

M. Pugh,"Combining empirical and mechanistic understanding of spruce bark beetle outbreak dynamics in the LPJ-GUESS (v4.1, r13130) vegetation model","The European spruce bark beetle (SBB) has, in recent years, been the most important disturbance agent in many European forests. We implemented a SBB module in a dynamic vegetation model and calibrated it against observations from Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and France. The start and duration of outbreaks triggered by storm damage and the increased damage driven by recent warm and dry periods were reasonably well simulated, although the spread was reflected in uncertain parameter estimates. 
 For exploring forest performance in the future, dynamic vegetation models are important tools. Tree mortality is a crucial process in these models, but explicit representations of major agents of mortality have often been relatively underdeveloped. In needle-leaved forest in the temperate and boreal zones, bark beetles are often important for the mortality pattern. The European spruce bark beetle (SBB, Ips typographus) has, in recent years, replaced wind as the most important disturbance agent in European forests. Historically, SBB damage is typically triggered by wind storms as they create breeding material with no defences to overcome for the beetles. Drought can contribute to increased damage and prolonged outbreaks by lowering the defence of the trees, but it has also been the main ultimate driver of some of the European forest damage by bark beetles in the last decade. In this study we implemented an SBB damage module in a dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) that includes representation of wind damage and forest management, with the aim to present a general concept that can be used for other bark beetle species as well. The module was calibrated against observations of storm and SBB damage in Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and France. The model was driven by SBB phenology, drought, storm felled spruce trees and a dynamic beetle population density. The model was able to catch the start and duration of outbreaks triggered by storm damage reasonably well, but with discrepancies in levels which can be at least partly related to salvage logging of storm felled forest and sanitary cutting of infested trees. The model showed increased damage in the most recent years with warm and dry conditions, although below the level reported, which may suggest that the drought response of spruce in LPJ-GUESS is underestimated. The new model forms a basis to explore vulnerability of European forests to spruce bark beetle infestations."

While computationally affordable, it is able to capture key metrics of the climate system. By comparing simulations at low, intermediate, and high horizontal resolution, we demonstrate its utility for evaluating eddy parameterizations, in terms of both their effect on the mean state and diagnosis of the unresolved eddy fluxes they aim to represent. 
 Climate models are limited in resolution by computational constraints. The ocean component is currently resolved at spatial scales between approximately 10 to 100 km, which is too coarse to adequately capture the mesoscale. Eddies at these scales play a major role in the global energy cycle, and therefore it is crucial that they are accurately parameterized. In this context, we propose DINO (DIabatic Neverworld Ocean), an ocean-only model configuration of intermediate complexity designed as a test protocol for eddy parameterizations across a range of horizontal scales. It allows for affordable simulations, even at very high resolution, while crucial aspects of the global ocean such as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), subtropical and subpolar gyres, or the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) are maintained. We compare key metrics across eddy-resolving (1/16°), eddy-permitting (1/4°), and eddy parameterizing (1°) simulations to showcase the evaluation of eddy parameterizations in two ways: by testing their impact on the mean state and by directly diagnosing the missing eddy fluxes from coarse-grained high-resolution experiments."

FRIDA (Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments) v2.1 integrates these systems and generate results that suggest standard scenarios the shared socioeconomic pathways baseline scenarios may overestimate economic growth, highlighting the importance of feedbacks for realistic projections and informed policymaking. 
 The current crop of models assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to produce their assessment reports lack endogenous process-based representations of climate-driven changes to human activities, especially beyond the purely economic consequences of climate change. These climate-driven changes in human activities are critical to understanding the co-evolution of the climate and human systems. Earth System Models (ESMs) that represent the climate system and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that represent the human system are typically separate, with assumptions that create coherency coordinated through RCPs and SSPs in ScenarioMIP, the core scenario analysis protocol. This divide limits understanding of climate-human feedback. An alternative aggregated approach, which couples human and natural systems (CHANS) such as the one used to build the Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments “FRIDA” v2.1 IAM documented here, integrates climate and human systems into a unified global model, prioritizing feedback dynamics while maintaining interpretability. FRIDA represents the Earth's radiation balance, carbon cycle, and relevant portions of the water cycle alongside human demographics, economics, agriculture, and human energy use. Built using the System Dynamics method, it contains seven interconnected modules. Each subsystem is calibrated to data and validated to ensure structurally appropriate behaviour representation. FRIDA demonstrates that an aggregate, feedback-driven modelling approach, capturing CHANS interconnections with rigorous measurements of uncertainty, is possible. It complements conventional IAMs by highlighting missing feedback structures that affect future projections. Our work with FRIDA suggests SSP1-Baseline, SSP2-Baseline, and SSP5-Baseline are all overly optimistic on the prospects for future economic growth due to these feedbacks, while SSP3-Baseline and SSP4-Baseline, the SSPs with the highest challenges to adaptation, align more closely with our results. Future work will further refine climate impact representations, energy modelling, policy scenario creation, and stakeholder engagement for informed policymaking."

The best bias correction method for each grid is selected differently depending on the weighting case. The best bias correction method can vary depending on factors such as climate and terrain. 
 This study proposed a Comprehensive Index (CI) that jointly considers bias correction performance metrics and uncertainty to guide the selection of quantile mapping methods. This approach reveals not only a performance-based ranking of bias correction methods but also how optimal method choices shift as the uncertainty weight varies. This study evaluated daily precipitation performance from 11 CMIP6 GCMs corrected by Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM), and Detrended Quantile Mapping (DQM) using ten evaluation metrics and applied TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) to compute performance-based rankings. Furthermore, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used to quantify both individual model and ensemble prediction uncertainties. Moreover, entropy based weighting of the ten evaluation metrics reveals that error based measures such as RMSE and MAE carry the highest information content (weights 0.13–0.28 and 0.15–0.22, respectively). By aggregating TOPSIS performance scores with BMA uncertainty measures, this study developed CI. Results show that EQM achieved the best performance across most metrics 0.30 (RMSE), 0.18 (MAE), 0.98 (R2), 0.87 (KGE), 0.93 (NSE), and 0.99 (EVS) and exhibited the lowest uncertainty (variance = 0.0027) across all continents. QDM outperformed other methods in certain regions, reaching its lowest model uncertainty (variance = 0.0025) in South America. EQM was selected most frequently under all weighting scenarios, while DQM was least chosen. In South America, DQM was preferred more often than QDM when performance was emphasized, whereas the opposite occurred when uncertainty was emphasized. These findings suggest that incorporating uncertainty leads to spatially heterogeneous and parameter dependent changes in optimal bias correction method choice that would be overlooked by metric only selection."

 Water scarcity is one of the most critical global environmental challenges. Addressing this challenge requires implementing economically-profitable and environmentally-sustainable water management interventions across scales globally. This study presents the development of the global version of the ECHO hydro-economic model (ECHO-Global version 1.0), for assessing the economic and environmental performance of water management options. This global version covers 282 subbasins worldwide, includes a detailed representation of irrigated agriculture and its management, and incorporates economic benefit functions of water use in the agricultural, domestic and industrial sectors calibrated using the Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) procedure alongside with the water supply cost. We used ECHO-Global to simulate the impact of alternative water management scenarios under future climate and socio-economic changes, with the aim of demonstrating its value for informing water management decision making. Results of these simulations are overall consistent with previous studies evaluating the global cost of water supply and adaptation to global changes. Moreover, these results show the changes in water use and water supply and their economic impacts in a spatially-explicit way across the world, and highlight the opportunities for reducing those impacts through improved water management.

Arsenic here primarily results from reductive dissolution of iron minerals in anoxic conditions driven by organic carbon. Here, we used digital elevation model (DEM) data to investigate how drainage density and hierarchical recharge pathways influence arsenic distribution, supported by combined data set of 136 wells (81 new, 55 from a prior study)—up to 215 m deep—along a 170 km west‐to‐east transect across the delta. Findings indicate arsenic hotspots in the mid‐central region of the delta, where high drainage density appears to facilitate focused recharge, delivering organic carbon to underlying aquifers. Compared with other deltaic regions across Asia, the Ayeyarwady has fewer high‐arsenic wells, with only 21% of our data set exceeding the local 50 μg/l limit. National screening data from 123,962 wells indicate that while only 8% exceed the regulatory limit of 50 μg/l set by Myanmar, 71% exceed the 10 μg/l guideline recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). This highlights widespread exposure risk not addressed under the current national standard, particularly for rural communities. The observed variability in arsenic concentrations, driven by complex redox dynamics and groundwater flow patterns, indicates that contamination can occur even within short spatial intervals. A blanket‐screening program focused on hotspot regions is essential to ensure that at‐risk populations are not unknowingly exposed to unsafe drinking water."

 The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope. Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere."

 Tyrannosaurus rex ranks among the most comprehensively studied extinct vertebrates1 and a model system for dinosaur paleobiology1. As one of the last surviving non-avian dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus is a crucial datum for assessing terrestrial biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and biogeographic exchange immediately preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction —one of Earth’s greatest biological catastrophes. Paleobiological studies of Tyrannosaurus, including ontogenetic niche partitioning2-4, feeding, locomotor biomechanics,5,6and life history7-9 have drawn upon an expanding skeletal sample comprising multiple hypothesized growth stages—and yet the Tyrannosaurus hypodigm remains controversial10-13. A key outstanding question relates to specimens considered to exemplify immature Tyrannosaurus1,14-19, which have been argued to represent the distinct taxon Nanotyrannus11,13,20,21. Here, we describe an exceptionally well-preserved, near somatically mature tyrannosaur skeleton (NCSM 40000) from the Hell Creek Formation that shares autapomorphies with the holotype specimen of N. lancensis. We couple comparative anatomy, longitudinal growth models, observations on ontogenetic character invariance, and a novel phylogenetic dataset to test the validity of Nanotyrannus, demonstrating conclusively that this taxon is distinguishable from Tyrannosaurus, sits outside Tyrannosauridae, and unexpectedly contains two species—N. lancensis and N. lethaeus, sp. nov. Our results prompt a re-evaluation of dozens of existing hypotheses based on currently indefensible ontogenetic trajectories. Finally, we document at least two co-occurring, ecomorphologically distinct genera in the Maastrichtian of North America, demonstrating that tyrannosauroid alpha diversity was thriving within one million years of the end-Cretaceous extinction."

 As per de Gennes’ predictions, a superconducting layer placed between two ferromagnetic insulators can drive an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between them. Using two ferromagnetic insulating GdN layers having dissimilar switching fields sandwiching a superconducting Vanadium thin film, we demonstrate evidence of such exchange coupling. We demonstrate that such an exchange coupling promotes switching between zero and finite resistance states of Vanadium. Our devices hold either a finite resistance or a zero-resistance state at zero magnetic field, dependent on their magnetic field history. Moreover, we demonstrate the absolute switching effect, thus making such devices suitable for application at the lowest temperatures as non-volatile cryogenic memory useful for futuristic quantum circuits and for several other superconducting spintronic applications.

 Quasi-two-dimensional perovskite structures hold great potential as active layers in blue perovskite light-emitting diodes. However, they face challenges of limited emission efficiency and broadened spectra due to phase inhomogeneity. Here, we report an intermediate-direct-pinning method to develop a uniform-phase quasi-two-dimensional structure with a homogeneous energy landscape. By forming a strong cation-π interaction complex, we stabilize a metastable intermediate phase with retarded crystallization toward low-n phases (n ≤ 3), followed by a direct pinning process favouring crystallization of medium-n phases (n = 4 and 5) without further broadening. Additionally, introducing a surface-anchoring ligand during the pinning process effectively suppresses non-radiative recombination. The resultant structure shows efficient sky-blue emission and narrow linewidth (108 meV). Devices fabricated with this structure reach a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% at 489 nm, which is scalable to large-area (pixel size: 900 mm2) and passive matrix devices (30 × 10 arrays, active area = 200 μm × 600 μm).

Here, O-bridged Cu catalytic pairs boost acetylene hydrochlorination by tailored orbital coupling, shifting reaction pathways and lowering energy barriers. 
 Achieving specific orbital activation of C ≡ C by controlling the precise atomic architecture of supported metals is crucial for the selective transformation of alkynes. However, its physical mechanism remains a subject of debate. Herein, we construct a well-defined O-bridged CuN3-O-CuN3 integrative catalytic pairs (Cu ICPs) based on Kirkendall effect. As a result, Cu ICPs with mixed Cu2+-Cu3+ species demonstrate >99% conversion and >550 h stability in acetylene hydrochlorination (simulated industrial reaction conditions), showcasing unparalleled performance in the liquid-phase hydrochlorination of five alkynes as well. A combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal selective coupling between the dxz/dyz orbitals of Cu ICPs and the σ orbitals of C ≡ C in C2H2, leading to the formation of highly reactive di-σ-HC = CH intermediate. Additionally, the presence of the bridged-O species promotes HCl dissociation, altering the addition pathway from the classical Eley-Rideal (E-R) mechanism to a Cl•-trigged Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism, ultimately reducing the intrinsic energy barrier for addition, and breaking the universal standard electrode potential linear scaling relations.

 Gene discoveries in obesity have largely relied on homogeneous populations, limiting their generalizability across ancestries. Here, we conduct a gene-based rare variant association study of BMI on 839,110 individuals from six ancestries across two population-scale biobanks. A cross-ancestry meta-analysis identifies 13 genes, including YLPM1, RIF1, GIGYF1, SLC5A3, and GRM7, that confer about three-fold risk for severe obesity, are expressed in the brain and adipose tissue, and are linked to obesity traits such as body-fat percentage. While YLPM1, MC4R, and SLTM show consistent effects, GRM7 and APBA1 show significant ancestral heterogeneity. Polygenic risk additively increases obesity penetrance, and phenome-wide studies reveal additional associations, including YLPM1 with altered mental status. These genes also influence cardiometabolic comorbidities, including GIGYF1 and SLTM towards type 2 diabetes with or without BMI as a mediator, and altered levels of plasma proteins, such as LECT2 and NCAN, which in turn affect BMI.

 In recent years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing machine learning (ML) to investigate the predictability of shear-slip failures, known as laboratory quakes, in centimeter-scale rock-friction experiments. However, the applicability of ML to larger-scale laboratory quakes and natural earthquakes, where important timescales vary by orders of magnitude, remains uncertain. Here, we apply an advanced ML approach to meter-scale laboratory quake data, characterized by accelerating foreshock activity manifesting as increasing numbers of tiny acoustic emission events. We demonstrate that a trained ML model, using a network representation of the event catalog, can accurately predict the time-to-failure of meter-scale mainshocks, from tens of seconds to milliseconds before the upcoming main quakes. These timescales correspond to approximately decades down to weeks in the context of large earthquakes. By comparing our results with a dynamic model of shear failures that replicates the experimental data, we suggest that tracking the evolution of shear stress on creeping fault areas, rather than nominal shear stress, indirectly through the acoustic emission events, enables ML to predict both numerical and laboratory quakes. These findings provide critical insights into fault conditions that may facilitate short-term forecasting of earthquakes in nature. In this study, machine learning accurately predicts meter-scale laboratory quakes from tiny foreshocks, bridging the scale gap between laboratory and natural earthquakes and offering insights into short-term earthquake forecasting."

 Producing essential, widely used materials such as steel, cement, paper, plastics and rubber requires substantial freshwater resources, which may exacerbate water scarcity. Despite this, comprehensive research on freshwater embodied in material production remains limited. Here we assess the blue water footprint (WFblue) of 16 metallic and non-metallic material categories across 164 regions, using a multiregional input–output model and the hypothetical extraction method. Our findings indicate that the global WFblue of material production doubled from 25.1 billion m3 in 1995 to 50.7 billion m3 in 2021, raising its share in global blue water consumption from 2.8% to 4.7%. The East, South Asia and Oceania regions saw an alarming 267% surge in WFblue for material production, with China—already facing medium-high water stress—experiencing a dramatic ~400% increase.

 Earthquake stress drop (Δσ) may increase with depth and stress in the brittle lithosphere. However, the range of uncertainty in Δσ and the lack of constraints on absolute stress make it difficult to establish whether they are correlated. Here, we investigate Δσ dependence on depth and maximum shear stress (τmax) based on ~11 years of seismicity in the northeastern Japanese forearc following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki megathrust earthquake. We interpret Δσ estimates computed using both individual spectra and spectral-ratio methods and find that Δσ exhibits a clear depth dependence within the seismically active upper ~60 km of the forearc lithosphere ( ~ 0.8 MPa per 10 km). We further compare Δσ values with quantitative τmax estimates from finite-element models of force balance. We find that median Δσ values increase with τmax in the brittle forearc lithosphere and that earthquake stress release is proportional to τmax. The dependence of Δσ on τmax explains the apparent depth dependence of Δσ and suggests that average Δσ values provide a relative measure of the stress at failure. In the northeastern Japanese forearc, Δσ values remained roughly constant in the decade following the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, suggesting negligible changes in failure stress in the forearc since the mainshock.

 An important yet understudied factor in climate adaptation is information: are people informed about future climate-related risks, and does adaptation depend on this knowledge? Focusing on whether communication about projected sea level rise affects the stated likelihood of migration, here we developed a randomized information experiment implemented in a face-to-face survey of >7,000 respondents across Vietnam. We find that providing a text-based information treatment regarding Vietnam’s exposure to projected sea level rise increases respondents’ stated likelihood of migration, including respondents at low-risk. A map information treatment leads to a more targeted effect, only increasing the likelihood of migration among respondents in high-risk areas. Finally, adding doubt to the treatments, by mentioning an official repudiation of the information, does not reduce the treatments’ impact. Our findings are inconsistent with the assumption that people are fully informed about climate risks and highlight the importance of spatially precise information in facilitating climate adaptation.

 Rapid land use change, invasive species, and climate change are key drivers of the biodiversity crisis, creating an urgent need for high-quality satellite indices designed for biodiversity applications. The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are strongly correlated with species richness at global to landscape scales, and NASA has selected the DHIs as a future Earth data product. However, existing DHIs are outdated, rely on MODIS collection 5, and lack quality flags and uncertainty estimates. To address these limitations, we had four key objectives: (1) generate global DHIs based on all 500-m MODIS Collection 6.1 Terra/Aqua and VIIRS Version 2 vegetation products (NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and GPP), (2) create quality assessment layers and uncertainty metrics, (3) assess consistency between MODIS and VIIRS DHIs, (4) evaluate DHIs’ performance in predicting global species richness. Multi-year composite DHIs were calculated for 2013–2022 to ensure temporal consistency. Results showed that DHIs were effective proxies representing three aspects of vegetation productivity closely related to species richness. MODIS and VIIRS DHIs were highly correlated (cumulative: 0.98–0.99, minimum: 0.74–0.99, variation: 0.92–0.99). Quality and uncertainty assessments showed high reliability overall, though with some regional variations due to sensor differences in reflectance bands, cloud/snow masks, and seasonal patterns. The new DHIs predicted species richness well (RMSEs up to 9.12 % for amphibians, 11.36 % for birds, 12.21 % for mammals, 13.40 % for reptiles; R2 up to 0.59, 0.63, 0.63, 0.72, respectively). VIIRS DHIs generally outperformed MODIS, except for MODIS Terra GPP DHIs, which best predicted richness.

 Fusing LRHSI with HRMSI is a widely used strategy to generate HRHSI. Diffusion models, which progressively denoise input data, effectively capture both global structures and fine details, offering flexible modeling of complex spectral-spatial relationships. These models have shown strong generative capabilities for hyperspectral-multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion, with promising application potential. However, two main challenges persist: (1) insufficient guidance from physical priors during residual generation, leading to spectral and structural distortions; and (2) the simplistic injection of HRMSI as an auxiliary condition into the denoising network results in weak interaction between high- and low-frequency spatial features of HRMSI and LRHSI. In response to these challenges, our proposed Prior-Guided Fusion Diffusion Network (PG-FDN) enables HSI-MSI fusion. PG-FDN integrates a Prior-Guided Gradient Mechanism (PGGM) and a denoising model. PGGM embeds spectral-frequency priors into the gradient update process, guiding residual generation to reduce spectral distortion and preserve local textures. Additionally, the denoising model adopts a Bidirectional Progressive Decoder (BPD), which enables hierarchical integration of HRMSI spatial features via forward–backward feature interaction. Using two synthetic and three real-world datasets, experiments reveal that PG-FDN outperforms six representative methods. Component-wise ablation analyses validate the individual contribution of each module, and cross-domain evaluations further confirm its robustness and adaptability.

 The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) proposes that spectral heterogeneity (SH), derived from optical data, can serve as a proxy for estimating biodiversity. In this study, we tested the SVH across 42 forest plots in the Italian Alps using imaging spectroscopy data from the EnMAP satellite. We investigated the relationship between SH—quantified using two different metrics, Rao’s Q and the coefficient of variation (CV)—and tree species diversity (using Shannon’s H index and species richness). We applied three levels of spectral analysis: (1) SH calculated for each individual EnMAP band; (2) SH aggregated across broader spectral ranges (Visible -VIS-, Near Infrared -NIR-, and Shortwave Infrared -SWIR-) and (3) SH derived from vegetation indices (VIs). These analyses were performed under three spatial approaches: (A) a normal approach assigning equal weight to all four EnMAP pixels intersecting a plot; (B) a weighted approach based on the proportional overlap of each pixel with the plot area; and (C) a weighted canopy cover (CC)>70% approach, which included only plots with CC greater than 70% as derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) LiDAR data.Weak to moderate correlations were observed when SH was derived from single bands, with the strongest relationships in the NIR (R2 approaching 0.4), followed by the VIS and SWIR regions. A similar trend emerged when SH was aggregated across broader spectral ranges, with the highest correlations again found in the NIR (R2 up to 0.35). In contrast, lower R2 values were obtained when SH was computed from specific VIs.The weighted approaches, especially when restricted to plots with CC >70%, consistently yielded higher R2 values than the equal-weight approach in all three the spectral analysis. Results were consistent across both SH metrics (Rao’s Q and CV), with stronger correlations when species richness was used as the biodiversity metric. This work highlights how EnMAP hyperspectral data, despite inherent constraints, can provide valuable insights into forest biodiversity monitoring."

 Long-term exposure to ultrafine particles (PM0.1/UFPs) is proposed to be related with many diseases. Large-scale epidemic studies related with UFPs are scarce due to the lack of UFP spatial distributions. While existing research predominantly stressed the dominant influences of vehicular sources, the impact of cooking emissions might be significant in Chinese megacities, due to high-emitting cooking styles. This study performed high-density spatial measurements (0.40 km2/site) of UFPs using 3 electric motorcycles carrying 3 condensation particle counters (CPCs) at 153 sites in Wuchang District in the megacity Wuhan, central China. We analyzed particle number (PN) distributions across different types of sites, quantified distance-decay relationships between UFPs and cooking sources, and developed high-resolution (25 m × 25 m grid) land-use regression (LUR) models linking PN concentrations with geographic predictors. Key findings include: (1) Restaurant-adjacent sites exhibited the highest PN levels (significantly exceeding traffic-adjacent sites), one of the key reasons is that the density of restaurants is highly related with dense buildings which hinders dispersion; (2) PN concentrations decay exponentially with the distance from the nearest restaurant; (3) Traffic-adjacent sites have lower-than-average PN concentrations, benefiting from favorable ventilation conditions of the wide roads; (4) The most important buffer size for restaurant variables, traffic variables, and diffusion variables are ≤50 m, 100–200 m, and 500 m, respectively, reflecting the higher spatial heterogeneity caused by cooking emissions in typical Chinese megacities. Thus, to catch the hot spots caused by restaurants, the resolution of the LUR model needs to be ≤ 50 m. These findings provide novel insights into urban UFP source apportionment and emphasize the necessity of incorporating cooking emission dynamics in environmental exposure assessments for rapidly urbanizing regions."

Previous studies have found that increasing solar capacity in India’s coal belt may ameliorate the distributional consequences of electricity decarbonization, but we lack detailed assessments of the tradeoffs involved. Here, we evaluate the costs and emissions reduction benefits associated with building solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity on land currently used for opencast (OC) coal mining in India. We use 50 years of weather data to quantify the P10, P50, and P90 capacity factors and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for identically configured PV arrays at the 100 largest OC mines. At 97 mines, the expected LCOE is higher than at the Pavagada Solar Park in southern India that we use as a benchmark. When adjusted for the value of avoided emissions, 49 mines spread across Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh have lower social costs of solar generation than Pavagada. For the 50 largest mines, we compile acreage information and estimate that they can support up to 28 GW of new solar PV capacity, approximately one-third of India’s total solar PV capacity today. This capacity would avoid approximately 47 Mt , or US$2.4 billion in damages, per year at abatement costs between US$15–28/t . Mines expected to be depleted by 2025 may support annual abatement of up to 4.8 Mt  yr−1, with additional abatement of 6.5 Mt  yr−1 and 8.6 Mt  yr−1 possible at mines closing between 2025–30 and 2030–35, respectively. Our results show that depleted mine land in India’s coal belt can play a meaningful role in an electricity capacity mix that minimizes the combination of private costs and damages."

A New York State (NYS) legislative mandate requires net zero statewide GHG emissions by 2050 in part through decarbonizing electricity generation. However, increasing renewable energy capacity, including utility scale solar (USS), competes with land-uses such as agriculture and forestry. This case study evaluates USS historic land use to project future demand for land to meet NYS’s 2050 GHG goal. Data collected from open-source solar databases were combined with USS boundaries obtained through manual and automated digitization and Monte-Carlo and Maximum Entropy modeling were used to project the likely area and land use characteristics of future sites built to meet the projected 2050 demand for electricity. Demand for solar energy in NYS is projected to reach 116–125 terawatt hours per year by 2050, when electrification of current fossil-fueled heating and transportation sectors is taken into account. By analyzing the performance of over 300 existing USS sites across NYS, we project that approximately 100 GWDC of USS capacity can meet this demand. We found an average power density of 0.62 MWDC/ha of land for fixed axis sites and 0.59 MWDC/ha for single axis tracked sites. Stochastic modeling of power density trends over time indicates that the 2050 mandate will require between 71,072 and 128,784 hectares (ha) depending on siting variables. If trends continue, we project that between 21 386 and 27 233 ha of cropland and between 14,985 and 18,463 ha of forest could be converted to USS. For future scenarios in which conversion of annual row crop land and high-quality soils were limited, there was an increase in distance to transmission lines, number of parcels required, and complexity of site shapes, which would likely increase solar development costs. These results help bound the likely land use changes that will occur to meet electric sector GHG mitigation mandates. These results also provide information about the benefits and trade-offs of restricting the conversion of current agricultural land to solar energy production. Additionally, the approach we developed, combining analysis of fenced area, capacity factors, trends in power density over time, and projecting likely future locations for solar stochastically is applicable to many global regions with solar development on agricultural lands."

However, contradictory findings on post-fire flow regime changes have highlighted the complexity of this relationship. This study considers rich daily-resolution hydrological data on 898 burned catchments and over 8000 unburned control catchments to choose a set of 39 paired catchment experiments, along with 500 control pair experiments. We use these 500 control catchments to evaluate the extent to which the paired watershed approach accounts for hidden co-varying factors, finding that in most instances, it does not. We assess the influence of wildfires on flow magnitude, timing, and dynamicity. We also explore the effects of wildfire on water storage, evapotranspiration, and flood flows across the Western USA from 1984 to 2023. We find that percent changes in flow magnitude post-fire are not statistically significant and are uncorrelated with the percent of the catchment that burned, even when data are restricted to the critical first 5 years post-fire. However, linear regression analysis of 94 catchment variables found weak positive relationships between pre-fire forest cover and percent changes in flow magnitudes. Our results emphasize that the statistical uncertainty associated with even well-established methods may overshadow the magnitude of observed effects."

As climate-related flood events intensify globally, there is an urgent need to understand how social vulnerability is conceptualized and assessed to inform more equitable and effective risk reduction strategies. This paper reports the results of a systematic literature review on indicators and indexes used to assess social vulnerability to floods. Utilizing the PRISMA methodology, we identified and screened 1621 studies published between 2013 and 2023, selecting 36 peer-reviewed publications for examining how social vulnerability indices have been conceptualized, constructed, and applied, as well as the range of indicators, and methodological approaches used. We identified 78 indicator sets across 22 thematic domains. Results indicate that most attention has been given to a small set of indicators focusing on at-risk populations, socioeconomic factors, housing, and employment, while other factors such as health conditions, disaster preparedness, social connectedness, gender minorities, and sexuality are consistently underrepresented. Many studies rely on established frameworks without adapting them to local socio-cultural contexts and use census and secondary data sources, providing limited household-level and qualitative insights. Lack of methodological transparency, particularly regarding normalization and weighting, is common as is insufficient validation and ground-truthing. Greater attention to these issues, along with empirical case studies, is needed to provide in-depth insights into the root causes of social vulnerability and inform policies better tailored to local realities. This review highlights significant conceptual and methodological gaps, calling for more context-sensitive, mixed-method, and empirically validated approaches to improve the robustness and local relevance of social vulnerability assessments in flood-prone areas."

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the state of the art, we conducted a systematic literature review of 40 studies addressing sea level rise; flooding resulting from sea level rise or extreme weather events; and transformations in urban geography through adaptative policies in response to climate change. The findings indicate a steady growth in this area of research over the past decade. The reviewed interventions—primarily oriented toward fostering learning related to adaptative behaviors or directly aimed at behavioral change—have generally yielded positive outcomes. Specifically, gamification has been shown to enhance participants’ sense of accomplishment, promote social interaction, and create immersive learning environments. However, we also identified limitations in terms of intervention context, design, measured outcomes, and methodology. In response to these, we propose a set of recommendations for future research in this field. Among them, we highlight the importance of developing and deploying gamified experiences in emerging economies that are particularly vulnerable to climate risk; promoting social dynamics within digital interventions, thereby enhancing collective awareness and cooperation; considering the affective dimension of engagement within experimental designs by capturing emotional responses and their influence on behavior; and deepening and broadening the scope of results by grounding the studies’ execution and reporting more firmly on critical self-reflection and transparency."

However, their impact on the spatial variability of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality) is still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to explore how functional diversity and composition affect the spatial variability of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF-SV) under different environmental conditions in a temperate forest region. Regional communities representing specific spatial scales were established by assembling different numbers of sample plots. The EMF-SV was represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value of ecosystem multifunctionality within each regional community. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of functional diversity and composition on the EMF-SV at different spatial scales. Structural equation models were applied to explore the direct and indirect pathways of functional diversity and composition influencing the EMF-SV. Our results show that functional diversity and composition had significant effects on the EMF-SV, and these effects changed with spatial scales and environmental conditions. They affected the EMF-SV directly or indirectly through species asynchrony and population stability. Our results demonstrate the role of functional traits in regulating the EMF-SV across spatial scales and explore the main impact mechanisms. This will contribute to our understanding and protection of ecosystem multifunctionality in temperate forests."

In this study, we analyze projections of relative SL (RSL) rise in the Mediterranean Sea until the end of the 21st century. For the first time, we provide a detailed characterization of regional patterns of future SL change using an ensemble of three multi-decadal SSP5-8.5 scenario simulations with high-resolution fully coupled regional climate system models (RCSMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative and their driving global climate models (GCMs). At the basin-scale, RCSMs do not significantly modify the GCM-projected RSL changes by 2100, with a mean RSL change of 69 cm (60–93 cm, 17th-83rd percentiles) relative to 1995–2014. Among the RSL components, the sterodynamic (primarily driven by the global thermal expansion) and the surface mass balance drive the basin-scale RSL rise, with the latter being the largest source of uncertainty. We find that the RSL rise in the Mediterranean is expected to be 4%–12% lower than the global mean due to differences in the surface mass contribution, and 6%–15% lower than in the nearby Atlantic as a result of dynamic adjustments within the semi-enclosed basin. While dynamic SL drives the mean regional patterns, vertical land motion introduces the greatest local spatial variability along coasts, resulting in a projected local RSL rise by 2100 of −26 cm to +178 cm in GCMs and −39 cm to +170 cm in RCSMs. Furthermore, compared to GCMs, RCSMs incorporate local details that result in greater spatial variability, which is important to consider in risk assessments and adaptation planning."

Among the mass public, we find that support for DSM mining increases with the security frame only. However, among ENGO respondents, support for DSM does not change for any frame.

Focused on China’s Loess Plateau (LP), a typical arid to semi-arid region, this study quantified the dual effects of urbanization on both the size and quality of natural habitats (NHs) from 1990 to 2050 by multi-scenario land cover simulations with the system dynamics PLUS model, combining landscape indices and habitat quality (HQ) analysis. The study revealed that urbanization directly consumed 3470 km2 of NHs and indirectly resulted in the loss of 4706.4 km2 between 1990 and 2020. Under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, direct and indirect NHs losses are projected to increases of 7.75 and 7.39 times respectively, from 2020 to 2050. Nevertheless, LP’s landscape pattern exhibited an optimizing trend: the increasing aggregation index of urban patches, coupled with an enhanced largest patch index for forests and grasslands, indicates that intensified urbanization can mitigate the disordered encroachment on NHs, reduce landscape fragmentation, and preserve larger and more contiguous habitat patches, thereby improving overall HQ. The LP case demonstrates urbanization and NHs conservation are not inherently antagonistic; well-planned urbanization can catalyze NHs protection. We further proposed strategies including spatially concentrated urbanization to advance sustainable urbanization and enhance HQ, fostering synergies between social progress and ecological preservation in global arid regions."

We propose a framework using the Metastatistical Extreme Value Distribution that precisely defines the extremes being analyzed, and explores, through a large observational data set, their dependence on local thermodynamics and large‐scale atmospheric circulation at different temporal scales. Our results show that thermodynamics predominantly controls changes in hourly precipitation extremes and that their rate of increase must necessarily depend on the return period, in contrast with CC‐scaling arguments. On the contrary, daily precipitation is seen to be mostly controlled by large‐scale circulation, in ways that cannot be captured by CC‐based approaches.

This compensation reduces the stress response, especially along the GS. Seasonal coupling variations are driven by stronger TFB in summer and modulated by background wind conditions. Energy fluxes also exhibit strong seasonality: kinetic energy transfer to the atmosphere intensifies in winter, while, over the GS, potential energy gains can dominate in summer, partly influenced by CFB.

Turbidite 210Pb activity is low, and depositional ages align with major Columbia River floods. Turbidite organic matter is terrestrial and modern (−26‰ δ13Corg, 18 C:N, ∼6 mg lignin per 100 mg OC). These deposits provide the first direct evidence of modern non‐seismic turbidite deposition in northern Cascadia, with implications including that highstand stratigraphy preserves non‐seismic events, turbidite composition reflects sediment source, and turbidite deposition represents a significant component of sediment and carbon accumulation."

Here we show how high‐resolution measurements from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite can be used in conjunction with conventional nadir altimetry to drastically enhance detection of mesoscale processes in the Nordic Seas—a critical exchange region between the North Atlantic and the Arctic, where sea ice presents observational challenges. We developed 2‐km resolution maps of ocean topography, geostrophic currents, and relative vorticity from April 2023 to October 2024 by interpolating SWOT and nadir altimetry data in space and time. These maps enable the exploration of fine‐scale ocean processes (20–100 km) that were previously unresolvable by conventional altimetry.

In this study, inspired by the hyperarid Atacama Fault System in Chile, we use numerical models to investigate how landscapes that experience oscillatory dry and humid periods respond to strike‐slip faulting at variable slip rates. Our results show that riverbed aggradation from hillslope sediment flux during dry periods delays stream capture, increases deflection angles of fault‐crossing channels, and produces highly perturbed longitudinal river profiles. In some cases, these phenomena, as well as the thickness of aggraded sediment, are slip‐rate dependent. Lags in capture timing and/or fully missed captures that occur in landscapes with climatic oscillation have a profound impact on the long‐term evolution of strike‐slip landscapes. Our work also highlights the importance of hillslope contributions to landscape modification in arid and semi‐arid settings with ephemeral rivers."

The decline in precipitation aligns with decadal‐scale climate shifts: an intensification and westward expansion of the South Pacific Anticyclone toward Rapa Nui, along with a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere storm track. Both the trends and interannual variability in these phenomena closely track the hydroclimate of Rapa Nui and explain why fewer storms are reaching the island. We show that these dynamical and aridification trends have likely already exceeded natural variability and that they will continue through the 21st century under an intermediate greenhouse‐gas emissions scenario.

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease with a median survival of only 2 to 4 years from diagnosis. Improved tools are needed to shorten diagnostic delays and improve prognostication to benefit clinical care. Herein, we profiled whole blood gene expression by RNA sequencing in a large cohort of ALS participants (n = 422) versus controls (n = 272). Several machine learning classifiers trained on our detailed gene expression dataset accurately predicted case-control status, including in a fully independent external test cohort, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.894 with the best performing model. Integrating gene expression features with clinical variables improved our ability to discriminate ALS cases into shorter, intermediate, and longer survival in an external dataset. Finally, we identified ALS-relevant pathways in our blood transcriptomics dataset as well as “core genes” that overlapped with gene expression changes occurring in the primary disease tissue, facilitating a drug perturbation analysis that identified several candidates. Overall, our results highlight the potential diagnostic and prognostic applications of whole blood gene expression data, with important implications for improving ALS clinical care.

 Voluminous felsic continental crust is, as far as we know, unique to Earth, yet the timescales of its earliest growth remain debated. Archean mantle evolution is complementary to crustal growth but is largely unconstrained for strontium isotopes due widespread Rb-Sr disturbance. Here, we perform high spatial resolution radiogenic Sr and Ca isotope measurements in magmatic plagioclase megacrysts from 3.7–2.8 Ga Archean anorthosites and leucogabbros. We report mantle-like Ca isotope signatures and the most unradiogenic terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr ratio yet measured on Earth, in plagioclase (87Sr/86Srinitial = 0.700050 ± 0.000017, 95% confidence interval) from the 3.73 Ga Manfred Complex of the Narryer Terrane, Western Australia. These data are consistent with 87Sr/86Sr homogenisation between the Earth and Moon (87Sr/86Srinitial ≈ 0.699061) at ca. 4.515 Ga during the Moon-forming giant impact.

This fungi-specific structure allows Fzo1 to dimerize and remain locked after catalyzing GTP hydrolysis, enabling efficient mitochondrial fusion with minimal energy consumption. 
 The mitochondrion is a highly dynamic organelle, constantly undergoing fusion and fission, which are critical processes for the health of cells. Fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is mediated by the mitofusins belonging to the dynamin superfamily of GTPases. Most eukaryotic organisms possess two cooperatively functioning mitofusins, but yeast has only one mitofusin (Fzo1). How Fzo1 solely catalyzes OMM fusion is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of truncated Fzo1 (Fzo1IM) in different nucleotide-loading states and report a special mechanistic feature of Fzo1 through systematic functional studies. Differing from mammalian mitofusins, Fzo1 contains an extra latch bulge (LB) that is essential for the viability of yeast. Upon GTP loading, Fzo1IM dimerizes via the GTPase domain and prefers the closed conformation. This state is then locked by the subsequent trans interaction mediated by the LB of each protomer, so that Fzo1IM remains dimerized in the closed conformation even after GTP hydrolysis. This special mechanistic feature may be relevant to the previous observation that degradation of Fzo1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for mitochondrial fusion. Our study reveals how mitochondrial fusion in yeast is efficiently ensured with limited GTP consumption, which broadens current understanding of this fundamental biological process.

Here, the authors develop ClairS-TO, a deep learning method for long-read tumour-only somatic variant calling that outperforms similar algorithms and can also work with short-read sequencing data. 
 Accurate detection of somatic variants in tumors is of critical importance and remains challenging. Current methods typically require matched normal samples for reliable detection, which are often unavailable in real-world research and clinical scenarios. Without a matched normal sample, more proficient algorithms are required to distinguish true somatic variants from germline variants and technical artifacts. However, existing tumor-only somatic variant callers that were designed for short-read sequencing data are not able to work well with long-read data. To fill the gap, we present ClairS-TO, a deep-learning-based method for long-read tumor-only somatic variant calling. ClairS-TO uses an ensemble of two disparate neural networks trained from the same samples but for opposite tasks—how likely/not likely a candidate is a somatic variant. Benchmarks using COLO829 and HCC1395 cancer cell lines show that ClairS-TO outperforms DeepSomatic and smrest in ONT and PacBio long-read data. ClairS-TO is also applicable to short-read data and outperforms Mutect2, Octopus, Pisces, and DeepSomatic. Extensive experiments across various sequencing coverages, variant allelic fractions, and tumor purities support that ClairS-TO is a reliable tool for somatic variant discovery.

 The biology of individual lipid species and their relevance in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. To explore the lipidomic biomarkers associated with cognition function and neuropathological changes in AD, we utilize non-targeted mass spectrometry on 316 post-mortem brains from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) cohorts classified as control, asymptomatic AD (AAD), or symptomatic AD (SAD), and integrate the lipidomics data with untargeted proteomics from the same individuals. We find that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species are significantly lower in SAD than controls or AAD. Lipid-protein network analyses reveal that LPE/LPC modules are significantly associated with protein modules involved in MAPK/metabolism, post-synaptic density, and cell-ECM interaction pathways, and correlate with better antemortem cognition and reduced AD neuropathology. Particularly, LPE 22:6 [sn-1] is significantly decreased SAD and exerts a pronounced influence on protein changes relevant to neurotransmitter-driven post synaptic changes and plasticity compared to other lysophospholipids species.

 Gut microbiota have been implicated in severe malaria in murine models, but their contribution to the pathogenesis of severe malaria in children is unknown. Here we show through analysis of gut bacteria in stool samples from two separate African studies enrolling children with severe malaria, and children from local communities, that children with severe malaria have gut bacteria dysbiosis. Among children with severe malaria, there is increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae that associates with multiple clinical complications of severe malaria. Moreover, increased abundance of Escherichia coli was a predictor of post-discharge mortality. Metagenome analysis identify elevated metabolic pathways and genes supporting the utilization of host-derived molecules in children with severe malaria that have the potential to promote the survival and growth of Enterobacteriaceae.

 Micronutrient deficiencies from poor dietary diversity remain a global health challenge.

While process-based crop models effectively simulate plant nutrient (N, P, K) dynamics for productivity projections, they lack the ability to assess crop nutritional content. This Perspective proposes a framework for integrating nutrient dynamics into crop models for informing nutrition security strategies amid climate change. We delineate key biological pathways influencing nutrient uptake, translocation and density in response to elevated CO2, temperature and low precipitation.

 The coupling mechanisms and cascading effects among water, carbon, and ecosystem structure at the basin scale remain insufficiently understood. Here we take the perspective of ecosystem dynamic change, integrating the InVEST ecosystem process model and machine learning techniques, and propose a water-carbon-structure-function nexus analysis framework. We found that the overall ecosystem dynamism ranged from 2.3% to 5.3% across the basin. Spatial structural differentiation among the four major ecosystem types intensified. At the grid level, water-carbon showed predominantly synergistic behavior. The relatively low average water-carbon values in monsoon zones were key to limiting ecosystem gains. The structural thresholds constraining water-carbon interactions declined further in 2010 and 2022. Additionally, the water-carbon-structure-function nexus exhibits saddle-shaped, platform-shaped, and peak-shaped patterns spatially under water supply conditions. Once water utilization and structural characteristics reach their corresponding thresholds, the ecosystem’s productive function enters a steady state and no longer fluctuates significantly with changes in a single variable.

 Municipal solid waste incineration is increasingly used in China to balance urban growth with environmental and energy demands, yet challenges remain in pollutant control and by-product utilization. Here we compile operational data from 876 incineration plants across China and apply life cycle assessment models to systematically evaluate their environmental and economic performance. We find advanced flue gas treatment reduces harmful emissions but slightly compromises carbon benefits, whereas optimized leachate management achieves both emission reduction and carbon gains. Fly ash resource utilization can further improve environmental and economic outcomes, while waste classification and co-incineration strategies enhance plant viability. Our scenario simulations suggest that stricter emission standards, expanded classification, and targeted co-incineration can yield substantial carbon-negative and financial benefits.

 Bioplastic and polylactic acid production is expected to increase in the future to replace single-use traditional plastics. Here we investigated the effects of polylactic acid contamination in marine ecosystems by assessing its degradation over time in an experimental mesocosm, along with its impact on microbial abundance, microbiome diversity, viral infections, and rates of organic matter cycling. We report here that, as polylactic acid gradually lost its integrity, a microbial biofilm rich in Marinobacter sp. developed on the biopolymer, reshaping the marine microbiome, promoting polylactic acid-associated bacteria such as the Saccharospirillaceae, and in turn increasing viral activity and accelerating the degradation of organic matter. These effects, which were further amplified at the temperatures experienced during heatwaves, suggest that high levels of polylactic acid contamination might influence the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems, particularly during extreme temperature episodes.

 Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2)-targeted CAR-T cell therapies have shown promising clinical efficacy in gastric cancer. However, early-phase trials have reported gastrointestinal adverse events due to on-target off-tumor recognition of CLDN18.2 in the gastric mucosa. By leveraging shared CLDN18.2 epitopes and expression in humans and mice, we establish an in vivo model that replicates the on-target off-tumor toxicity of CLDN18.2 CAR-T. Our findings confirm that this toxicity is independent of the CAR construct’s design, co-stimulatory domain, and tumor model. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this model in testing strategies to mitigate on-target toxicity, such as Boolean-logic AND-gate approaches. Our results offer insights into the use of mouse models that recapitulate on-target off-tumor toxicities, with the caveat that although we are often concerned that models will undercall toxicities in humans, they may also overcall the incidence and severity of toxicities, prematurely discarding promising therapeutic agents from further clinical development.

 Successfully extending immunotherapies to solid tumors involves addressing several key challenges, importantly the “antigen dilemma”, the expression of a solid tumor target antigen on the normal tissue of tumor origin. Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) has emerged as an important target for upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer therapies (such as Zolbetuximab, a naked antibody, recently approved; or CT041, a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy with promising clinical data).

These microscopic organisms support Antarctic food webs and contribute to global carbon sequestration. Here, we analyse 24-years (1998–2021) of satellite and model data to understand spatial-temporal phytoplankton patterns and their environmental drivers. Using a clustering analysis, we identified three subregions with distinct phytoplankton patterns. The oceanic subregion, phytoplankton showed lower biomass and longer-lasting blooms driven mainly by winds. The coastal subregion, where polynyas occur, had high biomass and short blooms primarily influenced by sea ice and wind.

 The ongoing volcanic unrest at the highly populated Campi Flegrei caldera is accompanied by incremental seismic activity, ground uplift and geochemical anomalies that are raising severe public concern. Here we apply an unsupervised least root square method and a tailored Monte Carlo approach to the 2019-2024 earthquake hypocenter locations and show that since 2023 seismicity has progressively clustered along a preferential N249° ± 4°, 53° ± 1°plane near the center of the caldera, concentrating more than 50% of seismic events and most of the released seismic energy. This clustering is evidence for an internal process that drives the transition from diffuse micro-seismicity to the development of an extensional volcanotectonic fault in its initial stages. The nucleation (or reactivation) of this fault suggests that caldera rocks are experiencing conditions for critical failure and may have overcome elastic deformation resulted, until 2023, in an almost perfect axisymmetric uplift, thus representing an important change for volcanic and related hazards evaluation at Campi Flegrei.

 Ocean acidification, driven by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, has impacts on marine ecosystems. While elevated carbon dioxide concentrations have the potential to enhance Blue Carbon fixation and storage, the response of community photosynthesis in macroalgal-dominated ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of elevated carbon dioxide on macroalgal communities using volcanic carbon dioxide vents as a natural analogue of ocean acidification. Net community photosynthesis was assessed using chambers positioned on the seafloor as well as water mass dynamics monitoring. Despite a shift in algal community composition, only minimal differences in net community photosynthesis were observed between reference and high carbon dioxide sites. The high carbon dioxide site had a lower abundance of algal species with carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, based on δ13C isotope measurements. Carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms facilitate photosynthesis under present-day levels of carbon dioxide in seawater, resulting in a negligible effect of elevated carbon dioxide on macroalgal community photosynthesis. These results challenge the assumption that ocean acidification will enhance Blue Carbon uptake and storage, necessitating a reevaluation of this perspective.

 Simultaneous observations of directional and hemispherical reflectance and emission are valuable to understand canopy structural and physiological dynamics. However, employing both observation geometries concurrently to measure either reflectance or sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) remains challenging and therefore has rarely been explored with continuous observations. Here, we designed and implemented the enhanced RotaPrism system, an automated instrument that integrates a hyperspectral sensor for reflectance measurements and a hyperspectral sensor with much higher spectral resolution for SIF retrieval, enabling monitoring of both hemispherical and directional viewing geometries. We installed this system at a rice paddy and a mixed forest site, collecting spectral data continuously throughout the growing season. We assessed instrumental uncertainty through quality control protocols designed for our rotating system and evaluated radiometric uncertainty by analyzing radiometric consistency between the two sensors. Quality control metrics showed high pass rates, demonstrating the reliability of our system. The two spectrometers maintained high consistency in spectral data throughout the growing season. Our system revealed notable differences between the two viewing geometries at both sites regarding the seasonal variations of spectral reflectance and SIF, likely influenced by differences in canopy structure and spatial heterogeneity of spectral signals. Specifically, hemispherical measurements captured integrated canopy-scale responses including both sunlit and shaded components, while directional observations were more sensitive to the sunlit portion of the canopy. The relative difference between hemispherical and directional measurements varied systematically with vegetation phenology and canopy density. Our findings underscore the reliability and stability of the system for continuous monitoring of vegetation spectral variations using the two geometric view configurations, supporting potential applications in canopy photosynthesis assessment and hyperspectral satellite validations."

 Wetlands play a critical role in the global water and carbon cycles, yet monitoring their water extent remains difficult, particularly beneath dense vegetation. SAR-based techniques such as backscatter thresholding are limited by complex scattering mechanisms, while fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data capable of detecting double-bounce scattering is scarce. To address these challenges, this study evaluates the potential of Interferometric SAR (InSAR) for mapping water surfaces beneath vegetation using the Atrato floodplain in Colombia as a case study. We develop an automated workflow combining InSAR fringe detection with local phase homogeneity analysis to generate probabilistic flooded vegetation maps. Applied to ALOS PALSAR-1 L-band image pairs from 2007 to 2011, the workflow captures seasonal fluctuations in flooded extent ranging from 500 to 1500 km2. When compared to other L-band SAR inundation products, the InSAR-based maps identify broader flooded areas, with ∼70 % agreement in pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, around 84 % of detections align with existing wetland inventories and seasonal changes in water extent are found to follow terrestrial water storage anomalies. Finally, the PolSAR analysis shows that InSAR can complement backscatter-based methods by detecting inundation in areas with weak double-bounce signals. These findings suggest that combining InSAR with backscatter-based methods can improve detection of flooded vegetation, which is particularly relevant given that the new NISAR mission will provide frequent global L-band observations."

 Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from thermal infrared remote sensing is widely used for urban climate studies. However, varying sensor viewing angles introduce LST biases, complicating spatiotemporal comparisons and climate studies. While geometric models incorporating urban structure have been developed to simulate urban thermal anisotropy (UTA), their applications have primarily focused on theoretical inversion rather than operational angular correction. In this study, we propose an advanced angular correction framework (GUTA-ATCE) for MODIS LST in urban areas that integrates a Time-evolving Geometric UTA (GUTA-T) model with an Enhanced Annual Temperature Cycle (ATCE) model, which dynamically normalizes LST retrievals across different acquisition times using meteorological parameters and vegetation indices. The proposed GUTA-ATCE resolves temporal mismatches in multi-angle observations, and enables correction of view-angle-induced distortions in instantaneous LST retrievals. Quantitative evaluations indicate that GUTA-ATCE–simulated LST agrees closely with MODIS LST observations (R up to 0.98, RMSE ∼2.35 K). Applying GUTA-ATCE reduces the RMSE of MODIS LST against Landsat reference data from 5.09 K (uncorrected) to 4.71 K (corrected). Moreover, GUTA-ATCE's simulated anisotropy patterns align closely with the upscaled results from field measurements (R values of 0.86 and 0.80, RMSE values of 0.96 K and 0.78 K, respectively), confirming its robust capability to capture UTA. Stratified experiments also show that the model accurately captures the spatial heterogeneity of UTA induced by varied building density and height-to-width ratios, achieving RMSE values of 2.32–2.60 K and R values consistently above 0.97. Furthermore, the model robustly simulates moment-specific angular effects under variable meteorological conditions. Compared to the original GUTA-T model, the inclusion of dynamic meteorological parameters in GUTA-ATCE improves agreement with field-based simulations by ΔR = 0.51 (from 0.35 to 0.86) and reduces RMSE by 0.89 K (from 1.85 K to 0.96 K). Our approach provides a scalable and transferable solution for LST angular correction, and advances in utilizing satellite observations for high-resolution urban climate analysis at micro-scales."

 In China, tobacco production must strictly follow the yield plan set by the higher authorities. In this context, accurate and stable yield estimation is meaningful for effective production management. In this paper, we adopted a multi-source data fusion strategy to develop the yield estimation models for tobacco. The data used include unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral features (HF), biophysical parameters (BPP) collected in the field, and biochemical parameters (BCP) measured in the laboratory. Since the crop state at different growth stages both affect the final yield, we employed two typical recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), for modeling. The random forest (RF) algorithm was selected as the baseline scheme. In addition, we designed a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (AEC1D) to unify the input dimensions of raw data from different years. It was found that yield estimation performance from multi-source data was more accurate than using any single feature. The GRU model with the HF+BCP+BPP combination achieved the highest estimation accuracy, with an Rv2 of 0.705. The overall performance of LSTM and GRU models was also better than that of RF. We also quantified the contribution of each feature to the model, with HF, BPP, and BCP accounting for approximately 45%, 32%, and 23%, respectively.

 Monitoring changes in urban functional zones (UFZs) is vital for optimizing land use, improving urban management, and promoting sustainable development, as these changes reflect critical socio-economic dynamics. However, due to the complexity and diversity of UFZs, existing methods face challenges in effectively capturing these changes. Remote sensing (RS) imagery offers top-down views but often misses ground-level details, while street view (SV) imagery provides close-range perspectives. However, effectively integrating SV and RS data for comprehensive UFZs change detection remains a challenge. This paper presents a deep learning-based method that leverages SV and RS data to enhance UFZs change detection. The proposed method employs an attention mechanism to dynamically fuse RS and SV features along with temporal change information. Over 100,000 SV images were classified, and their spatial distribution frequencies were used as features in the Multi-Source Temporal Fusion Model (MSTFM). MSTFM integrates RS and SV data via the Multi-Source Fusion Module (MSFM) and incorporates temporal features through the Multi-Temporal Fusion Module (MTFM), enabling classification and change detection. The method was applied in a large-scale case study across Datong, Chengdu, and Nanjing, achieving 86 % overall accuracy and 82 % Kappa for single-period UFZs classification, and over 93 % accuracy for binary change detection. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in integrating SV and RS imagery and capturing UFZs dynamics, with strong potential for identifying urban renewal and supporting sustainable development."

 Rapid and reliable flood inundation mapping is essential for disaster response. While multi-temporal SAR analysis is widely used, suitable pre-event imagery is often unavailable in real disaster scenarios. This study proposes a method for extracting inundation areas from single SAR data by removing strong scattering components from SLC images using FFT. The method was tested with ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data from the 2018 Western Japan Heavy Rainfall in Mabi, Kurashiki City. Quantitative evaluation using SSIM confirmed that narrower Hann window sizes enhanced suppression of strong scatterers. Among three histogram-based binarization methods (Mean, Tsai, Otsu), the histogram mean achieved the highest Cohen’s Kappa (0.444). Accuracy assessment demonstrated that the proposed method significantly improved farmland inundation detection compared with conventional binarization, with Recall and F1 scores increasing by approximately 2.5%. In contrast, improvements for flooded buildings were limited due to inherently low baseline accuracy. Overall, the approach enables practical and reliable farmland inundation mapping using single-polarization, single-SAR imagery, even when no pre-event data are available; however, further validation across different conditions and frequency bands is needed."

 Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based models have improved the global modeling of spectral–spatial dependencies, their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain limited. In this work, we propose LoLA-SpecViT(Low-Rank Adaptation Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery. Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve adaptability, we integrate enhanced Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into attention and projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 70% fewer trainable parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation strength during training, improving convergence and generalization. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, Salinas, and QUH-Qingyun, demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics.

 L-band Vegetation Optical Depth (L-VOD) has emerged as a critical remote sensing proxy for monitoring global aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics. Persistent methodological ambiguities, including the absence of standardized protocols for deriving AGB from L-VOD and the use of space-for-time assumption underpinning temporal predictions, pose challenges to the reliability of AGB estimates. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the current methodology using the SMOS-ICV2 L-VOD dataset and five AGB reference datasets. We find that all the existing fitting methods generally capture the AGB spatial variation, achieving 69–77 % variance explanation. Yet integrating tree cover significantly improves the AGB predictions in regions with small and medium L-VOD values. However, all methods fail to capture the spatial variation of AGB references in dense rainforests with L-VOD > 1, where the AGB reference data also show large discrepancies. Testing on space-for-time assumption reveals that spatial AGB sensitivities to L-VOD tend to be larger than temporal sensitivities. We suggest incorporating long-term in situ observations and remotely sensed vegetation structural data to understand the discrepancy between the AGB-L-VOD sensitivities and to improve AGB predictions. By providing a comprehensive evaluation of fitting methods, our results offer a cautionary tale to the use of L-VOD data to infer AGB dynamics and the necessity of developing long-term field-based biomass change datasets for further constraining and evaluating AGB predictions from remote sensing observations."

 Semi-volatile organic substances (SVOCs) including flame retardants and plasticizers may emit from products during their life cycle and pose health risks, such as endocrine disruption and neurodevelopmental effects. Cars, as enclosed spaces with SVOC-emitting materials, can contribute significantly to human exposure, especially for toddlers and professional drivers who may have higher risk. This study assessed exposure to a selection of SVOCs in car cabins for various scenarios, considering car cabin temperatures (25 °C or 60 °C), user physiology (adult/toddler), and time spent in cars (average user/professional driver). Scenarios included cooling dynamics in warm cars, assuming ventilation reduces cabin temperature from 60 °C to 25 °C within 5 min. The highest total exposure dose was estimated for di-(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP) and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP). Inhalation and air-to-skin contact were the dominant exposure routes for compounds like 2,2′-methylenebis (4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol) (MBMBP), while ingestion of dust was significant for others like TDCIPP. Data collected from the literature on levels of SVOCs in private houses, offices and childcare facilities facilitated estimation of the contribution of cars to the total dose obtained throughout the day. Although toddlers and professional drivers had similar estimated exposure doses, despite differing times spent in cars, a first-tier risk assessment showed no immediate health concerns, with hazard quotients well below 1. However, refined models and further analysis for sensitive groups remain critical for a deeper analysis of risk."

Prasad,Representation of tropical convection in an advanced process-oriented diagnostic framework,"•GDI under CQE framework, outperforms common stability indices in capturing moist convection using IMDAA and ERA5 data. •Highlights use of PODs to understand moist convection processes, aiding model development and forecasts. •GDI exhibits smaller spatial biases than forecast rainfall, indicating its reliability for assessing instability-convection coupling. 
 This study explores the applicability of process-oriented diagnostics (POD) for accurately representing convection and understanding of moist processes, which leads to skillful prediction and model development, over tropical regions, focusing on the boreal summer monsoon over the Indian subcontinent. By utilizing the, indigenously developed NCMRWF's high-resolution regional reanalysis, IMDAA and validated using ERA5, the analysis examines large-scale variables such as moisture and temperature, focusing on the warm season (May to October) to understand the instability-convection coupling.The study employs the Gálvez–Davison Index (GDI) as a key tool to address the limitations of existing stability indices (KI, LI, TTI, CAPE, and CINE), which often exhibit discrepancies in accurately capturing the instability-convection coupling. Focusing on convective breeding grounds, such as Central India (CEN) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB), the results reveal that GDI exhibits a stronger and more coherent association with rainfall intensity and variability when compared with other widely accepted stability indices. While CAPE and KI show reasonable agreement with rainfall evolution, GDI proves to be more reliable in representing deep convection over both CEN and BoB. Further, this study highlights the significance of thermodynamic instability and free-tropospheric moisture in convective growth, emphasizing the role of moisture at lower levels and maximum equivalent potential temperature (θe). The study demonstrates that GDI, which is tightly linked to convective-quasi equilibrium (CQE) offers significant improvements in the evolution of convection, and its integration into forecasting models is recommended to enhance the representation of convective initiation and overall forecast accuracy. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the need for high-resolution reanalysis and coupled models for a better understanding of convection."

 Employing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based circulation classification technique, this study establishes a nonlinear relationship between circulation patterns and daily precipitation probability distribution during early summer (1961–1990) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). Based on this relationship, statistical downscaling models were developed at monthly and pentad scales to capture refined spatial structure of subseasonal precipitation. Following independent tests from 1991 to 2002, the models were driven by daily outputs from the NCEP CFSv2 climate model during 2015–2022 to assess prediction skill. Evaluation results indicate that the proportion of years with statistically significant spatial correlation coefficients between observed and predicted precipitation increased from 60 % (53 %) before downscaling to 95 % (92 %) after downscaling for monthly (pentad) predictions. The multi-year mean pattern correlation coefficients nearly doubled, rising by approximately 0.3 and 0.2 for monthly and pentad scales, respectively. Substantial improvements are also found in the normalized standard deviations and centered root mean square errors, indicating robust long-term predictive performance. Furthermore, the downscaling approach promotes consistency across lead times within two weeks for monthly precipitation predictions (within one month for pentad predictions), demonstrating extended predictable lead times. Overall, the SOM-based statistical downscaling models significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal predictability of subseasonal precipitation predictions during early summer in MLYRB, showing strong potential for operational regional climate prediction."

 The objective of this investigation was to uncover the underlying association between the Antarctic sea ice anomaly and the summer rainfall anomaly in East Asia on interannual timescales by employing observational analysis and model simulation methods. During the boreal early summer (from May to July), the leading pattern of sea-ice anomalies primarily shows an abnormal contraction within the Weddell Sea region, while an abnormal expansion occurs within the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea and East Antarctica regions. This pattern significantly influences the summer rainfall anomalies in East Asia and its adjacent seas. It results in a dipole-shaped precipitation pattern, with a reduced rainfall anomaly in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) and an increased rainfall anomaly in eastern China (EC). Sea ice anomalies can trigger meridional circulation and vertical motion anomalies via thermal and dynamic effects. These anomalies, at mid-to-high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, correspond to the positive phase of the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and then propagate from the southern to the northern hemisphere. This process leads to notable downdrafts over the TWP and updrafts over EC. Abnormal downdrafts and divergence suppress convection and precipitation in the TWP, whereas updrafts and convergence facilitate them in EC. Furthermore, the distinctive maritime continent conditions over the TWP, which are coupled with the suppression of convection, act to foster a teleconnection mode that closely resembles the reverse Pacific-Japan (PJ) mode. The reversed PJ-like mode further intensifies the strong dipole-like precipitation anomalies between the TWP and EC. Finally, numerical experiments verified the physical mechanism by which the Antarctic sea-ice anomaly affects the summer precipitation anomalies in East Asia and its adjacent seas."

 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology provides high-resolution time-series observation capabilities for monitoring surface slow-moving landslide deformation. Accurately identifying subtle yet critical change points (CPs)—acceleration, destabilization, or stagnation—remains a key challenge in improving the timeliness and reliability of geological hazard early warning systems. To validate the performance limits of CP detection methods under complex environmental conditions, this study integrates InSAR data with advanced Change Point Detection (CPD) techniques. Three slow-moving landslides (Xiongba, Sela, and Gongba) along the Jinsha River Basin were selected, with their subtle surface deformation histories from 2014 to 2022 reconstructed using SBAS-InSAR analysis. The first InSAR-based landslide critical point validation set was established, comprising 752 independently annotated deformation datasets from four geologists. Bayesian optimization was employed to quantitatively delineate the applicability boundaries of the three algorithms—Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST), Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal and Trend change (BEAST) and Parallel Autoencoder (PAE). The results reveal that BEAST achieves superior precision (0.93) in noise-free, seasonally dominated environments, whereas PAE demonstrates robust recall (0.62) under real-world. BFAST prioritizes sensitivity to trend breaks but exhibits higher false positive rates. By employing a multi-model consensus approach, we precisely identified deformation processes associated with seismic swarms and natural dam-break events, and confirmed that the dam-break-induced displacement threshold closely aligns with previous findings. Notably, this study provides the first evidence that local earthquake swarms (Mw 4.6–5.3) can trigger abrupt landslide displacement. Overall, integrating CPD with InSAR time-series effectively detects subtle nonlinear changes missed by threshold methods. Our hybrid validation (simulated data, expert annotations, geological records) shows method effectiveness depends on geodynamic context, requiring scenario-specific selection. Future integration of CPD with high-precision, real-time InSAR will greatly enhance landslide early warning."

 Soil salinization poses critical threats to agricultural sustainability in arid regions, while traditional monitoring approaches lack efficiency and single remote sensing platforms encounter inherent spatiotemporal resolution trade-offs. This study developed a comprehensive daily-scale soil salinity monitoring framework by systematically evaluating four spatiotemporal fusion algorithms: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Unmixing-Based Data Fusion (UBDF), Fit-FC, and Unmixing-Based Spatiotemporal Image Fusion Based on the Self-Trained Random Forest Regression and Residual Compensation (RERC), integrating 5-cm resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery with daily Plantscope satellite data across high-standard farmland and saline-alkaline farmland throughout cotton phenological stages. Four machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Network) were comparatively assessed for salinity inversion. RERC demonstrated superior fusion performance with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.055 (high-standard farmland) and 0.024 (saline-alkaline farmland), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) reaching 0.821 and 0.925, respectively. The optimal Random Forest-RERC framework achieved coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.94 during boll-opening stage, approaching actual UAV accuracy (R2 = 0.95). Generated daily salinity maps successfully captured fine-scale spatiotemporal dynamics, providing operational solutions for precision salinity management in arid agricultural systems."

 A single 2D image could encompass an endless number of 3D entities, making it difficult to detect changes automatically via visual interpretation, particularly in the context of remote sensing images that span vast regions of the earth under diverse imaging conditions. While elevation data can mitigate spurious changes induced by varying illumination, seasonal variations, and sensor viewing geometries, prevailing approaches rely heavily on high-quality 3D data, creating dependencies that limit their applicability in regions with limited access to such data. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel Depth-assisted Change Detection Framework (DaCDF) that extracts relative depth cues directly from monocular 2D images. By enforcing cross-temporal consistency on photometric features, our method learns an invariant representation without requiring absolute 3D ground truth. Specifically, we designed a multi-task network to jointly accomplish change detection (CD) and monocular depth estimation (MDE), where depth maps generated by foundation models (e.g., the Depth Anything Model) are employed as pseudo-labels for the MDE branch. An intra-task Progressive Multi-scale Fusion (PMF) strategy is incorporated to effectively integrate local details and global contextual information for the depth estimation task. Furthermore, a cross-task dual-phase fusion scheme is implemented to strengthen feature representations by leveraging complementary cues from the counterpart task, thereby enabling mutually reinforced co-adaptation of the two objectives. The proposed DaCDF demonstrates seamless compatibility with mainstream encoder–decoder architectures, including both CNN-based (e.g., FarSeg) and Transformer-based (e.g., Swin Transformer UPerNet) architectures for CD. Extensive evaluations were conducted on the binary change detection (BCD) datasets WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD, and the semantic change detection (SCD) SECOND dataset, revealing consistent performance gains. Specifically, DaCDF achieves 4–6% IoU gains over baselines on WHU-CD and 1–7% on LEVIR-CD. For SECOND, it obtains 1–3% mIoU improvement compared to baseline models. The method outperforms current SOTA methods in CD metrics."

 The transport sector is one of the main contributors to air pollution in Brazilian urban centers. To address this, the Brazilian government implemented the Air Pollution Control Program for Motor Vehicles (PROCONVE) and the Air Pollution Control Program for Motorcycles and Similar Vehicles (PROMOT), aiming to regulate emissions from light-duty vehicles (LDVs), heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), and motorcycles. This study evaluates the long-term effectiveness of these programs in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH), a highly urbanized and industrialized area in southeastern Brazil. Results show that, between 1999 and 2020, while total fuel consumption and the vehicle fleet expanded by approximately 52 % and 131 %, respectively, average pollution levels declined by 46 % over the same period. However, pollutant concentrations in the MRBH often exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines for long-term exposure, indicating ongoing public health risks. While the national programs have contributed to emission reductions through technological advances in vehicles and fuels, they have not been sufficient to ensure air quality levels that effectively protect public health. This study highlights the need for complementary measures focused on urban planning and transport management to reduce traffic volume and improve local air quality. Vehicle emission standards alone are insufficient to guarantee clean air in Brazilian urban centers. Broader progress requires integrated strategies combining cleaner technologies, fleet renewal, sustainable mobility policies, and climate-resilient transport systems."

 Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) represent a critical driver of global water cycling and extreme weather phenomena, playing a pivotal role in precipitation distribution and extreme event occurrence across mid-to-high latitude regions. Given the high-frequency presence of tropical cyclones within the East Asian research domain, this study proposes a novel Multidimensional Adaptive Atmospheric River Identification System (MAI) to facilitate a more focused analysis of AR filamentary structures and their associated atmospheric circulation systems. MAI integrates Breadth-First Search and Neighborhood Search methodologies to construct a Tri-directional Axis Search method, aimed at optimizing AR axis smoothness and enhancing the computational precision of AR length determinations. Simultaneously, a multi-parameter discrimination model is employed to distinguish TCs embedded within ARs. Climatological analyses of ARs within the study region reveal their most pronounced seasonal variability along a trajectory extending from southwestern low latitudes to northeastern mid-latitudes, with variations exceeding 75 % of the annual mean. Summer exhibits the highest AR frequency, with peak occurrences reaching 32 %. Moreover, ARs contribute approximately 20.06 % of the total regional precipitation annually. Further investigation into the influences of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) demonstrates their significant modulation of AR activities along the 30°N latitude in the Northwest Pacific. During El Niño and easterly QBO (EQBO) phases, AR frequencies increase, facilitated by enhanced 850 hPa southwesterly winds and elevated 500 hPa geopotential heights that promote moisture transportation. Conversely, La Niña and westerly QBO (WQBO) phases suppress AR activities, particularly evident in wind field reductions over Southeast China and Southern Japan."

However, their degradation routes are not clear. Here, we find a rapid route for the degradation of linear perfluoroaldehydes by hydroperoxy radical. The chemical processes are dominant over the corresponding oxidation processes by hydroxyl radical. The present findings are of great importance for elucidating the chemical transformation of linear perfluoroaldehydes in the atmosphere. 
 Linear perfluoroaldehydes are important products formed in the atmospheric oxidation of industrial fluorinated compounds. However, their atmospheric lifetimes are incompletely known. Here, we employ high level quantum chemistry methods and a dual-level strategy for kinetics to investigate the reactions of C2F5CHO and C3F7CHO with HO2. Our calculated results unveil almost equal activation enthalpies at 0 K for linear perfluoroaldehydes reaction with HO2, indicating that the carbon chain length negligibly influences reaction thermodynamics. The calculated kinetics reveal that vibrational anharmonicity enhances rate constants by a factor of 3–10, while torsional anharmonicity reduces rate constants by 34 %–55 %. Additionally, we also find that the reaction of C3F7CHO with HO2 exhibits significant pressure dependence, with transition pressures ranging from 0.026 to 2.3 bar across a temperature range of 190–350 K. Furthermore, atmospheric lifetimes of C2F5CHO and C3F7CHO are discussed based on the homogenous and heterogeneous processes. Our findings also reveal that the reactions of C2F5CHO and C3F7CHO with HO2 radicals dominate over those with OH radicals in Russia, Malaysia, and parts of Africa by the calculated results in combination with data based on global atmospheric chemical model simulations. Under nighttime conditions, HO2-initiated degradation represents a major atmospheric sink, comparable in magnitude to photolysis and Cl-initiated oxidation in gas phase, whereas hydrolysis at the air-water interface plays a critical role in the sink of linear perfluoroaldehydes. These findings establish chain-length-dependent pressure effects and conformational sampling as critical, previously unrecognized factors in kinetics calculations, providing a framework for modelling complex fluorotelomer transformations and guiding emission mitigation strategies."

It combines holographic imaging with environmental sensors to measure droplet size, movement, and surrounding air conditions. The system records hologram pairs to track droplet motion. While it can be used in the lab, it is mainly designed for in-flight use to measure cloud droplets in-situ. This paper presents the instrument’s design and evaluates its performance through testing. 
 We present HoloTrack, a novel, fully autonomous measurement system designed to capture three-dimensional (3D) cloud droplet data and provide detailed insights into droplet dynamics, their spatial distribution and velocity.  The HoloTrack system integrates a high-accuracy holographic imaging system with environmental sensors, including pitot tubes for airflow measurements, and a navigation system. Designed for deployment on airborne platforms like the CloudKite and hence having a compact and autonomous design, HoloTrack is also ideally suited for deployment in laboratory or ground-based environmental research. The system records up to 25 hologram pairs per second (50 holograms per seconds with the resolution of 65 megapixels), each of which provides two independent measurements of droplet position, size, and shape and measures individual droplet velocities. With laboratory tests we confirmed, that the holographic system reliably detects particles down to 10 µm, within a sample volume of 17 cm3 (1.84 cm × 1.84 cm × 5 cm) of each hologram. For a recorded hologram pair with mean displacement of 0.5 cm caused by e.g. an inter-frame time of 500 µs and a mean velocity of 10 m s−1, this results in 21.5 cm3 combined volume, where particle position and size is sampled and 12.3 cm3 overlapping volume where the two-frame particle velocimetry can be applied to resolve individual droplet velocities. Reliable sub-volumes for measuring droplets at different yaw angles, to account for the influence of the instrument body are further defined. The droplet velocity in longitudinal and vertical direction is measured with errors of less than 0.07 m s−1 for inter-frame times of 500 µs. The transverse velocity is less accurate with errors in the range of 0.1–0.5 m s−1, depending on the position of the particles in the sample volume. Nevertheless, the flexible timing allows the adjustment to different displacements to optimize the overlapping volume and 3D velocity uncertainties according to the needs of the experiment. A series of laboratory tests and a maiden flight tests validated the system's capabilities, characterizing the detection, robustness, automation and its ability to measure droplet dynamics. HoloTrack's unique combination of holographic particle measurements including capturing their velocities makes it a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of cloud microphysics, including droplet spatial distribution, collision-coalescence, entrainment, and turbulent mixing processes."

It includes detailed catchment attributes and represents diverse hydrological regimes. This open-access resource enables model evaluation and international comparisons and helps fill a key regional gap in global hydrological data. 
 We present the first large-sample catchment hydrology dataset for Aotearoa New Zealand with hourly time series: the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies – New Zealand (CAMELS-NZ). This dataset provides hourly hydrometeorological time series and comprehensive landscape attributes for 369 catchments across New Zealand, ranging from 1972 to 2024. Hourly records include streamflow, precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and potential evapotranspiration, with more than 65 % of streamflow records exceeding 40 years in length. CAMELS-NZ offers a rich set of static catchment attributes that quantify physical characteristics such as land cover, soil properties, geology, topography, and human impacts, including information on abstractions, dams, groundwater, or snowmelt influences, as well as on ephemeral rivers. New Zealand's remarkable gradients in climate, topography, and geology give rise to diverse hydroclimatic landscapes and hydrological behaviours, making CAMELS-NZ a unique contribution to large-scale hydrological studies. Furthermore, New Zealand's hydrology is defined by highly permeable volcanic catchments, sediment-rich alpine rivers with glacial contributions, and steep, rainfall-driven fast-rising rivers, providing opportunities to study diverse hydrological processes and rapid hydrological responses. CAMELS-NZ adheres to the standards established by most previously published CAMELS datasets, enabling international comparison studies. The dataset fills a critical gap in global hydrology by representing a Pacific Island environment with complex hydrological processes. This dataset supports a wide range of hydrological research applications, including model development and climate impact assessments, predictions in ungauged basins, and large-sample comparative studies. The open-access nature of CAMELS-NZ ensures broad usability across multiple research domains, providing a foundation for national water resource and flood management, as well as international hydrological research. By integrating long-term high-resolution data with diverse catchment attributes, we hope that CAMELS-NZ will enable innovative research into New Zealand's hydrological systems while contributing to the global initiative to create freely available large-sample datasets for the hydrological community.

Using satellite and street view imagery, we created an operational way to identify crop types and field boundaries without in-person surveys. This novel dataset provides reliable crop type ground truth with delineated field boundaries that can support large-scale crop monitoring and decision-making. The dataset can be accessed via: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15702415. 
 Accurate and scalable crop type maps are vital for supporting food security, as they provide critical information on the specific crops cultivated in a given area to inform agricultural decision-making and enhance crop productivity. The generation of these maps depends on high-quality crop type ground truth data, which are essential for developing remote sensing–based crop type classification models applicable across varying spatial and temporal contexts. Yet existing crop type ground truth datasets often focus on specific crop types of limited spatial and temporal ranges, constrained by the high cost and labor intensity of traditional field surveys. This limitation hinders their applicability to large-scale and multi-year applications, such as nationwide crop monitoring and long-term yield forecasting. Additionally, most existing crop type ground truth datasets contain only pixel-level labels without explicit field boundaries, impeding the extraction of field-level texture and structure information needed for accurate crop type mapping in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Collectively, these limitations hinder the development of scalable crop type mapping workflows and reduce the precision and reliability of resulting crop type maps for agricultural monitoring and decision support. In this study, we introduce CropSight-US, the first national scale, object-based crop type ground truth dataset for the contiguous United States (CONUS). This dataset spans the years 2013 to 2023 and includes over 100,000 crop type ground truth objects across 17 major crops and 294 Agricultural Statistics Districts, offering broad spatial and temporal coverage and high representativeness at field level. Each crop type ground truth object is accompanied by an uncertainty score that quantifies the confidence in its crop type identification, enabling users to filter or weight samples according to their specific reliability requirements. The crop type ground truthing framework of CropSight-US innovatively integrates crop labels derived from Google Street View imagery with field boundaries delineated from Sentinel-2 imagery to produce object-based crop type ground truth data. This scalable framework offers a valuable alternative to traditional field surveys by replacing in-person observations with virtual audits, significantly improving the efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of ground truth data collection. This framework achieves 97.2 % overall accuracy in crop type identification and 98.0 % F1 score in cropland field boundary delineation using the reference dataset. By delivering high-resolution, standardized, and reproducible reference data, CropSight-US establishes a new benchmark for crop type ground truthing and supports more informed agricultural research, monitoring, and decision-making. CropSight-US is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15702415 (Zhou et al., 2025)."

This provides an efficient way to track all the model's rain and snow back to the average location of the evaporative source, as shown in a present-day simulation. The new scheme can be used in simulations of the future to predict how sources of regional rain or snowfall might change owing to human actions, providing useful information for water management purposes. 
 There is an increasing need to understand how water is cycled and transported within the atmosphere, to aid water management. Here, atmospheric water tracers are added to the Met Office Unified Model (UM) to allow tracking of water within the model. This requires the implementation of water tracers in the following parts of the model code: large-scale advection, surface evaporation, boundary layer mixing, large-scale precipitation (microphysics), large-scale clouds, stochastic physics, and convection. A single water tracer is found to track all water in the model to a high degree of accuracy during a 35 year simulation; the differences are typically less than 10−16 kg kg−1 at the end of every time step, prior to a very small adjustment to prevent the build up of numerical error. The increase in computing time for each water tracer is between 3.1 % and 3.8 %, depending on the model resolution. The model development is tested by using the water tracers to find the sources of precipitation in a historical UM simulation. As expected, the majority of precipitation is found to be sourced directly from the ocean, with the recycling of water over land becoming increasingly important downwind across continents. The UM results for the mean evaporative source properties of precipitation are comparable to those of the ECHAM6 atmospheric model, with some interesting local differences over Antarctica, Greenland, and the Indian monsoon region. Finally, global model hydrological fluxes are derived from the water tracers to show the amount of precipitation sourced from the land and ocean separately, illustrating the additional information that can be provided from the new development."

As the northern terminus of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), it thus both affects, and is affected by, the Atlantic MOC. Here we quantify the magnitudes of the two overturning cells in density space, and then decompose the water mass transformation rates into net pan‐Arctic contributions from surface forcing and diapycnal mixing. We use a high‐resolution, quasi‐synoptic ice and ocean hydrographic data set spanning the four main Arctic Ocean gateways—Fram, Davis and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening. Two surface flux reanalyses and a hydrographic climatology are used to generate estimates of surface water mass transformation rates by density class. A box model then determines the profiles of turbulent mixing transformation rates, and associated turbulent diffusivities. We show that turbulent mixing and surface forcing drive transformations of similar magnitudes, while mixing dominates in the upper cell and surface fluxes in the lower cell. Consideration of uncertainties and timescales leads to the tentative suggestion that our results might be representative of recent decades. We discuss the possible significance of tides and sea ice brine rejection as energy sources driving turbulent mixing. Finally, we speculate as to whether water mass transformation rates may change in future as ocean heat transport into the Arctic increases. As sea ice declines and the efficiency of atmosphere‐to‐ocean momentum transfer increases, the Arctic Ocean is expected to “spin up,” causing more intense turbulent mixing, with uncertain consequences."

As aridity increases, vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity and self‐organizes into heterogeneous vegetation patterns, a step before a catastrophic shift to bare soil. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities in time or space are crucial to understand these phenomena. Using a unified mathematical model and incorporating environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation patterns create a hysteresis loop as the mortality level changes. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass that forms self‐organized hexagonal‐like patterns. However, when the mortality trend is reversed, one observes a branch with low biomass and no periodicity, where vegetation spots form disordered clusters instead of a hexagonal lattice.

However, recognizing mantle end‐members of basalts is challenging, as traditional trace element proxies yield ambiguous overlapping results in older basalts. Here we employ machine learning techniques to classify basalts, by their major and trace element characteristics, derived from three primary mantle sources: Depleted Mantle, Enriched Mantle, and Hydrated Mantle. By training on Cenozoic basalts, our machine learning achieves a high accuracy of global test sets spanning Phanerozoic to late Proterozoic, proving both its spatial and temporal effectiveness. Additionally, comparing our source predictions with full‐plate paleogeography since 1 billion years ago and testing the method in complex tectono–magmatic settings further assures spatiotemporal robustness and general applicability. We thus provide an effective machine learning classifier for accurately tracing mantle sources of basalts globally farther back in geologic time."

The transition between these seasons is driven by an increase in atmospheric baroclinicity. During this transition, the likelihood of both strong wind events and significant precipitation increases. This transition typically coincides with a minimum in regional fuel moisture, a time of high risk for severe fire weather. Therefore, when strong winds occur before significant precipitation, large wildfires can occur. While it is well understood that warming is increasing evaporative demand and lowering fuel moisture across the region, less is known about changes to the timing of precipitation and wind. Toward addressing this gap, we use 11 regional climate models to assess projected changes to the timing of the first significant precipitation and the first strong wind events across the MWUS. Historical model simulations reproduce the broad spatial and seasonal patterns of rain and wind onset. The models project that by the end of the century under an aggressive but plausible warming scenario, the average date of the first strong wind will occur later in the year across most of California and some of the Pacific Northwest. A majority of models also project a later rain onset over the Pacific Northwest, but this shift is generally smaller than wind, and models disagree on significance. Models project a slight decrease in the likelihood that wind onset precedes rain onset but disagree on significance and sign of change."

This study reveals how midlatitude dynamics triggered this unusual event. Using reanalysis, we perform a moisture budget analysis and local wave activity (LWA) diagnostics and find that the enhanced mid‐tropospheric baroclinic instability >1.1day−1 ${ >} 1.1\ \mathrm{d}\mathrm{a}{\mathrm{y}}^{-1}$ (1.34σ) $(1.34\sigma )$ peaked during 13–17 August in the North Atlantic, 7–10 days before the NWI rainfall event. This instability fueled the North Atlantic westerly jet and reinforced a “Ω ${\Omega }$” shaped blocking high over the Ural Mountains (“Ural block”) that developed over 21–22 August. This block initiated a wave train that propagated eastward with increasing amplitude over subsequent days. The downstream distorted Rossby waves broke, triggering a pronounced Caspian Sea trough that deepened by 25–26 August, strengthening a subtropical jet streak north of the Tibetan Plateau, with maximum geostrophic wind speeds exceeding 120 ms−1 $\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$. The NWI was in the jet streak's right entrance region, where the upper‐level divergence and compensatory upward motion intensified a low‐pressure system that had been steered northwestward into the region. Despite monsoon break conditions, the elevated mid‐tropospheric humidity allowed sustained deep convection, which combined with the quasigeostrophic ascent arising from the jet streak entrance region and led to extreme rainfall over NWI. Our analysis provides a case study showing the importance of the growing influence of mid‐latitude circulation changes traceable to alterations in the North Atlantic for Indian monsoon variability. The physical linkages demonstrated here may be crucial for improving monsoon behavior in changing climate."

However, precipitation anomalies during different stages of MHWs remain insufficiently explored. This study investigates the relationship between MHWs and precipitation using observations and reanalysis data from 2002 to 2021. Based on precipitation anomalies before and after the peak intensity of MHWs, four distinct MHW types are identified. Globally, the most common type exhibits negative precipitation anomalies during both the 5 days preceding (early stage) and following (late stage) the MHW peak (NN type, ∼46%), followed by events with negative anomalies in the early stage and positive anomalies in the late stage (NP type, ∼26%). On average, precipitation anomalies are negative in the early stage and positive in the late stage globally, except in the central equatorial Pacific. The MHW‐associated global mean precipitation anomalies change from −1.69 mm/day (early) to 2.82 mm/day (late), indicating that NP MHWs have a more pronounced influence on precipitation anomalies. To further elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms, the MHWs in the South China Sea (SCS) during the boreal summer is examined. Compared with NN MHWs, NP MHWs over the SCS are characterized by warmer sea surface temperature in the early stage, which enhances evaporation and water vapor convergence. This results in higher moist static energy (MSE), primarily driven by moisture contributions. The elevated MSE in the early stage promotes increased precipitation in the late stage, which in turn accelerates the decay of MHWs."

A direct numerical simulation model is initialized with different CDSDs to fill the gap. These results show that d decreases for broad CDSDs and increases for narrow ones, ultimately converging to approximately 0.5 regardless of initial CDSDs during the evaporation‐dominated mixing stage. The supersaturation fluctuation and the shape of CDSDs jointly influence the convergence behavior of d. Further sensitivity tests show that the initial microphysical/dynamical/thermodynamical conditions exert negligible effects on the final converged value of d but affect the convergence rate (k). The k generally increases with increasing droplet number concentration and dissipation rate, and increases with decreasing liquid water content, relative humidity of entrained air, and mixing fraction of cloudy air. A conceptual model with two timescales is proposed; k and the timescales are negatively correlated, meaning that slow mixing and/or evaporation process results in slow convergence of d. This finding provides an important reference for improving understanding and parameterization of d during the entrainment‐mixing processes."

This study aims to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms behind Iberian ARs and to quantify their contribution to precipitation over a long‐term period. We identify ARs affecting the IP in the ERA5 reanalysis with a 31‐km horizontal resolution and covering a 42‐year period (1979–2020). Additionally, we explore their association with the fronts of extratropical cyclones. Impact on IP precipitation is evaluated using regional observational gridded products (E‐OBS, IB01) and global reanalysis (ERA5). Three AR events (unnamed storm in October 1979, Storm Gong in January 2013, and Storm Ana in December 2017) were selected as case studies and analyzed in detail. During 1979–2020, the IP was affected by 580 persistent ARs (lasting at least 18 hr) with an annual mean of 13.8 ± 2.8 ARs and the northern IP coast being the most affected region. The year 2013 is marked by the highest total number of persistent ARs (20). Cold fronts were found more often in the vicinity of ARs than warm fronts. Case studies highlight changes in the relationship between ARs and fronts throughout their lifecycle. Precipitation associated with persistent ARs exhibits a strong north‐south gradient in the western IP with the highest contribution to annual precipitation occurring in the northern region (∼30%).

In this study, we reconstructed East Asia climate from fossil pollen using the biomization method and modern analog technique. The results show significant spatial variations in paleoclimate: warming dominates the Tibetan Plateau, whereas cooling is observed over northwestern and eastern monsoonal regions. In contrast, Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project multi‐model ensemble simulations show widespread warming across East Asia, indicating significant model‐data discrepancies in the northwest and eastern monsoon domains. To explore the underlying causes, we apply an energy balance decomposition to the simulated surface temperatures. We find region‐specific physical mechanisms: warming over the Tibetan Plateau is mainly driven by enhanced clear‐sky downward longwave radiation and vegetation‐induced surface albedo reduction; cooling in the northwest is linked to increased precipitation suppressing sensible heat flux; whereas, in the eastern monsoon region, cooling is driven either by the combined effects of cloud radiative forcing and latent heat flux changes due to increased precipitation or by reduced clear‐sky shortwave radiation independent of surface albedo feedback. These findings highlight the spatially non‐uniform climate responses across East Asia and underscore the critical roles of distinct physical processes in shaping regional climate, offering new perspectives to bridge model‐proxy gaps."

Yet projected changes in Meiyu rainfall and its coupling with ARs remain uncertain. This study utilizes the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 models under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2–4.5 (SSP245) and 5–8.5 (SSP585) scenarios to analyze four land regions with substantial Meiyu rainfall: Korean Peninsula (KR), South Japan (JP), lower Yangtze River basin (LYRB), and South China coast with Taiwan Island (SCTW). Under both scenarios, mean and extreme Meiyu precipitation increase with marked regional variations. Specifically, under the SSP585 scenario, SCTW experiences the largest increase (>40%), while JP exhibits the weakest amplification in Meiyu rainfall by the end of this century. The frequency of hazardous rainfall events is anticipated to increase substantially, particularly over KR and SCTW. AR landfalls are projected to intensify by approximately 70% over KR and LYRB and to nearly double over SCTW, with a smaller increase over JP, leading to an enhancement in the local AR‐related wet‐day and extreme precipitation frequency, while the efficiency of AR precipitation may reduce. Attribution analyses suggest thermodynamic moistening (vertical moisture term) broadly dominates precipitation increases, partly offset (strengthened) by the vertical circulation effect in the LYRB and JP (KR and SCTW). These findings underscore the challenges of climate risk management under global warming, and the mitigation (SSP245) scenario markedly reduces intensification and risk, highlighting the urgent need for climate protection measures in East Asia."

 Understanding and predicting marine-terminating glacier instability presents one of the greatest challenges to forecasting future sea level rise. An extreme case of such instability is the Hektoria Glacier on the Eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which retreated ~25 km between January 2022 and March 2023. Here we investigate the dynamics and drivers of this retreat event primarily from analysis of geophysical data and satellite imagery. We find that retreat commenced immediately after the loss of decade-old fast ice in the Larsen B embayment and was associated with an almost 6-fold increase in flow speed and 40-fold increase in glacier thinning, relative to the period immediately before the fast ice loss. We also find that in November–December 2022, the glacier retreated a total of 8.2 ± 0.2 km in two months—a retreat rate nearly an order of magnitude faster than published values—and began with a transition from tabular iceberg calving to buoyancy-driven calving on an ice plain, a flat area where the glacier was only lightly grounded. Hence we conclude that in this case, retreat primarily resulted from an ice plain calving process, rather than atmospheric or oceanic conditions as suggested previously. This implies that marine-terminating glaciers with ice plain bed geometry can be easily destabilized.

Here the authors use a host-guest system achieving phosphorescence and tuneable afterglow. ‘ 
 High-temperature afterglow organic amorphous materials expand the operational temperature beyond traditional room-temperature phosphorescent materials, broadening their potential applications. However, achieving tunable high-temperature afterglow from a single luminescent molecule remains a formidable challenge. Here, we employ host-guest anchoring coupled with single-bond rotors to achieve effective phosphorescence and tunable afterglow at high temperature simultaneously. The material demonstrates a wavelength-tunable afterglow: during heating (298 K to 473 K), the chromaticity coordinate shifts from (0.24, 0.47) to (0.18, 0.20) and the lifetime from 836 ms to 6.34 ms. The theoretical investigations reveal that the excited-state conformation of phosphors undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation, inducing the wavelength-tunable high-temperature afterglow phenomenon. This work offers a strategy for designing tunable high-temperature afterglow-emitting amorphous polymers, advancing the development of organic phosphorescent materials capable of delivering tunable high-temperature afterglow emissions. ‘High temperature afterglow materials are of interest, though designing luminescent single molecules is a challenge.

Chiral polymer films are presented with state-of-the-art Verdet constants, revealing the role of chirality, and a strategy to enhance the magnetooptical B term. 
 Connections between magnetic field induced optical activity and chirality have a rich and complicated history. Although the broken inversion symmetry of chiral molecules generates ‘natural’ optical activity, magnetic optical activity is generated by breaking time reversal symmetry. Therefore, molecular chirality is not expected to influence magnetic optical phenomena, such as Faraday rotation. Here we show that the chiral supramolecular assembly of polymers can result in large Faraday effects (Verdet constants = 105 °T–1m–1). This strong Faraday rotation, which is amongst the highest value known for organic materials, originates from the so-called Faraday B term. Typically, B term Faraday responses are weak. We demonstrate large amplification through excitonic coupling within the supramolecular assembly, where the chirality of the system controls the assembly formed. These observations provide an alternative means to enhance the Faraday rotation of low symmetry systems and clarify the role of chirality in previous reported materials. The relation between magnetooptical activity and chirality has previously been confused. Chiral polymer films are presented with state-of-the-art Verdet constants, revealing the role of chirality, and a strategy to enhance the magnetooptical B term."

This study found that thorax acceleration during non-flight vibrations peaks at 25 °C for these bumblebees, while vibration frequency continues to increase with temperature. 
 Increasing temperature beyond a species’ optimum is a major threat to insect biodiversity, particularly in rapidly warming regions such as the Arctic. For cold-adapted pollinators, high temperatures can disrupt physiology and ecosystem services, threatening pollinator populations and plant reproduction. In bumblebees, increased temperature disrupts the physiology of the indirect flight muscles. However, these muscles, which generate the bee’s charismatic buzz, also facilitate key non-flight behaviours including communication, defence, and buzz-pollination, where temperature effects remain unexplored. Here, we assess the thermal performance of non-flight muscle function across 15 Arctic bumblebee species by measuring thorax vibrations during defensive buzzing behaviour. Thorax acceleration is found to peak at an air temperature of 25 °C, declining after this peak as a potential strategy to prevent overheating. Conversely, vibration frequency continues to increase with temperature, and is better explained by thorax temperature than air temperature. Surprisingly, there are no differences in thermal response across species, castes, or temperature habitat specialisations, indicating that non-flight vibrations are similarly susceptible to unfavourable temperatures across bumblebee species. If such findings translate to non-flight buzzing in other contexts, such as buzz-pollination, changes in buzzes have the potential to disrupt key plant-pollinator interactions.

 α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH), and its expression in CD4 + T-cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T-cell metabolism and function is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T-cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using murine models of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T-cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo in female mice. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T-cell-mediated inflammation. α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase, and its expression in CD4 + T-cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis.

 Standard episodic patient monitoring of vital signs on the medical-surgical wards can potentially miss changes in health status and delay recognition of risk. To reduce these delays, we develop a clinical wearable-based deep learning model, using 9 inputs, comprised of continuous vital signs and demographics, to identify the onset of deterioration early and accurately. Using validated data from 888 adult non-intensive care unit inpatient visits with 135 outcomes, from two different clinical grade wearables, we train a recurrent neural network to predict clinical alerts and adverse clinical outcomes in the subsequent 24 hours. Our continuous clinical alert model is able to predict both clinical alerts (Area under both the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve 0.89 + /− 0.3, Precision Recall curve 0.58 + /− 0.14) and adverse clinical outcomes (accuracy: 81.8% on 11 events) up to 17 hours in advance. Our wearable based continuous clinical alert system outperforms episodic clinical support tools in detecting deterioration, retains its performance when tested on data from a different clinical wearable than the one it was trained on and can produce alerts ahead of a broad class of adverse clinical outcomes, enabling timely interventions that can avert preventable deteriorations and reduce hospital costs.

 SARS-CoV-2 NSP14, an N7-guanosine methyltransferase, plays a critical role in viral RNA capping, enabling viral replication and immune evasion. While NSP14 has emerged as a promising drug target, its role in host-virus crosstalk and the cellular consequences of NSP14 inhibition remain poorly understood. Here, we present the identification and characterization of C10, a highly potent and selective non-nucleoside inhibitor of the NSP14 S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding pocket. C10 demonstrates robust antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, with EC50 values ranging from 64.03 to 301.9 nM, comparable to the FDA-approved drug remdesivir in our cell-based assays. C10 also exhibits broad-spectrum activity against other betacoronaviruses and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 at the replication stage. C10 suppresses viral translation and exhibits immunostimulatory effect. Additionally, C10 specifically reverses NSP14-mediated alterations in host transcriptome. The antiviral efficacy of C10 is further validated in a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight C10 as a promising candidate for the development of effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. This study also uncovers a novel mechanism of NSP14 in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its therapeutic potential, providing insights that may extend to other viral capping methyltransferases.

 Ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) is a proximity labeling enzyme used for subcellular proteomics at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, toxicity of its substrate hydrogen peroxide and background labeling by endogenous peroxidases limit its use to in vitro studies of specific cell types. To minimize toxicity and reduce non-specific background labeling we establish a more versatile in situ APEX activation (iAPEX) workflow by combining APEX2 with a D-amino acid oxidase to locally produce hydrogen peroxide. Using iAPEX, we profile the proteomes of a cellular microdomain, the primary cilium, in cell lines not readily accessible to conventional APEX labeling and identify unknown ciliary proteins. Our study validates common ciliary proteins across two distinct cell lines, while observed differences may reflect heterogeneity in primary cilia proteomes. Furthermore, iAPEX proximity labeling is applicable to a range of cellular compartments including mitochondria and lipid droplets and can be employed in Xenopus laevis, which provides a proof-of-concept for future in vivo applications.

 Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising decarbonization solution for aviation, but its adoption remains below 1% due to high cost. As municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to grow and sustainable disposal remains challenging, converting MSW into SAF offers an attractive pathway to align the goals of zero-waste cities and carbon-neutral aviation, given its reliable availability, low emissions and low cost. Here we evaluate MSW as feedstock for SAF production via industrial-scale gasification and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis data. The life cycle assessment indicates that MSW-based SAF can reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 80–90% compared with conventional jet fuel, with gasification being the primary technical challenge. Incorporating green hydrogen further enhances mitigation, reducing emissions by up to 50% and enabling a reduction of over 170 kg of CO2 per tonne of processed MSW. Globally, MSW-based SAF production could exceed 50 Mt yr−1 (62.5 billion litres), offering a 16% reduction in aviation greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, the estimated 5.4 Mt yr−1 SAF capacity from this study exceeds the European Union blending mandate and complies with its restriction to non-food and feed feedstocks.

 The western North Pacific anomalous anticyclone (WNPAC) is a key atmospheric circulation system that significantly influences East Asian climate variability. Its formation and persistence result from complex interactions among the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations, this study examines projected changes in WNPAC under anthropogenic warming and quantifies the seasonal contributions from the three tropical oceans. The results show a clear intensification of WNPAC in winter, spring, and summer, primarily driven by enhanced Atlantic and Pacific forcing. The Atlantic’s influence intensifies through enhanced equatorial wave activity and the development of quasi-stationary Rossby wave trains, most prominent in winter and spring. During summer, equatorial Rossby wave mechanisms dominate. The Pacific’s strongest influence emerges in summer, linked to intensified easterly winds over the western Pacific, associated with enhanced sea surface temperature gradients between the Indo-Pacific warm pool and the central-western Pacific. The Indian Ocean shows comparatively weaker changes across all seasons. These findings provide a quantitative assessment of the evolving three-ocean influence on WNPAC and underscore the increasing roles of Atlantic and Pacific variability in shaping East Asian climate under future greenhouse gas emissions."

 Enhanced rock weathering aims at capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide as inorganic carbon, while potentially stabilizing soil organic carbon. However, the role of soil biota in this process remains underexplored. Earthworms, being key soil engineers, may impact carbon dynamics both when alive, through mineral ingestion and casting activities, and when dead, through microbial processes. Using stable isotope tracing, we investigate how live and dead earthworms affect carbon dynamics during rock weathering. We demonstrate that both living and dead earthworms contributed to carbon capture, albeit through distinct pathways. Live earthworms enhanced the formation of organo-mineral associations via their dejections over time, promoting organic carbon persistence. Dead earthworms boosted microbial abundance and activity, enhancing organo-mineral associations and atmospheric-derived inorganic carbon capture between 60 and 120 days. We show that earthworms influence carbon cycling beyond their lifespan, with contrasting physico-chemical and biological pathways driving carbon capture through rock weathering throughout their life cycle.

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), a form of solar climate intervention, has been proposed to potentially slow or reduce future surface temperature increases. Few studies have assessed how SAI may affect luxury crop growing conditions; none have done so in the context of natural variability. We compare daily and monthly output from two 10-member SAI simulations with a non-SAI simulation to assess how luxury crop growing conditions may change with and without SAI. For each year from 2036–2045 we use a composite of agroclimatic indices to determine whether a year has suitable conditions. We find that these SAI scenarios do not robustly preserve luxury crop growing conditions, despite stabilizing or reducing surface temperature increases compared to a scenario without SAI. Natural variability leads to a large spread in outcomes across ensemble members, due in large part to highly variable precipitation and humidity responses to SAI between members. In only six of the 18 regions assessed here do growing conditions improve in all climate realizations under SAI compared to the non-SAI scenario. Here, reducing disease risk is a key way that SAI improves luxury crop growing conditions. There is also a large inter-ensemble member spread in 2036–2045 revenue under SAI, underscoring the importance of including natural variability when assessing SAI’s potential influence on luxury crops. The signal is strongest in the SAI scenario with a lower temperature target, highlighting that scenario choice is also crucial in determining suitability for growing luxury crops under SAI."

Impacts of wildfires on forest carbon uptake are substantially varied by tree compositions, however, the loss of carbon uptake capability across different forest types remains uncertain. Here, we tracked post-fire changes in gross primary production (GPP) across five forest types in Siberia, namely, evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF), mixed forests (MF), and woody savannas (WSVN), using satellite-based observation data from 2001 to 2023. Results revealed substantial reductions in GPP after wildfire followed by gradual recovery except DBF. The GPP changes one year after wildfire (ΔGPP1yr) and recovery rates of GPP notably differed by forest types. In ENF, ΔGPP1yr reached −63.4 g C m−2yr−1, which is larger than that in MF, DNF, and WSVN by −20.6, −31.3, and −42.7 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively. Consistently, the GPP recovery rate is the lowest in ENF, at 63.7%. Furthermore, significant decreasing trends in 5-year mean of ΔGPP1 yr in DNF, MF, and WSVN exceed −1.0 g C m−2yr−1 yr−1, indicating intensified impacts of increased wildfire intensity and/or extent on forest carbon. Our findings highlight the urgent need for establishing fire management and forest recovery strategies adapted to different forest types to enhance ecosystem resilience."

Marine enhanced rock weathering (mERW) seeks to accelerate this process by distributing fast-weathering silicate minerals like olivine in coastal environments, thus targeting deliberate carbon dioxide removal. However, the efficiency and environmental impact of mERW remain uncertain, as experimental studies are not capable of tracking the CO2 sequestration rate and ecological effects over sufficiently long timescales. Natural coastal environments with olivine-rich sands enable insight into long-term weathering and may serve as analogues envisioned for mERW applications. Papakōlea Beach (Hawai’i) is one of the few beaches across the world with olivine-rich sands (>80% by weight), thus providing a unique mERW analogue. We examined in situ weathering and biogeochemical cycling at Papakōlea as well as in the nearby mixed volcanic/coral sands of Richardson Ocean Park. Flow-through sediment incubations examined olivine dissolution kinetics, alkalinity release, and the fate of weathering products. High-resolution scans of weathered grains characterized olivine dissolution and surface alteration processes. Alkalinity generation from Papakōlea’s olivine sands and carbonate dissolution in Richardson Ocean Park was observed alongside dissolved inorganic carbon increases, suggesting CO2 sequestration occurs in this near-shore marine setting. However, complex biogeochemical interactions impede a precise quantification of olivine dissolution. Our findings highlight the complexity and challenges of monitoring, reporting, and verification for mERW applications in dynamic coastal settings."

The objective of this study was to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of HMFs to inform managed aquifer recharge (MAR), accounting for water rights, instream flow requirements, and coastal inflows. Texas, USA, was selected as the study area due to its climate-driven water stress, rising water demand, and the availability of detailed data on legal constraints. Volumes of HMFs (defined as ⩾ 95th percentile) were calculated for 190 streamflow monitoring gages in all 23 river basins in Texas (1968–2022). Water availability models and coastal inflow requirements were used to consider limitations to HMF availability for permitted use, including water rights, environmental flows, and coastal inflows for select major river basins. Results show that HMFs averaged 31% of total flows across all stations in the state. Of these HMFs, 52% of flows were unappropriated (not reserved for water rights holders), representing 12% of total flows. The mean annual volume of unappropriated HMFs was 81 Mm3 (∼0.07 million acre-feet). Mean annual unappropriated HMF volumes increased by a factor of 100 from semi-arid West Texas to humid southeast Texas, with variability driven by basin climate and watershed size. Environmental flow requirements generally did not significantly reduce the unappropriated HMFs as they were accommodated by flow reserved for downstream senior water rights. However, coastal inflow requirements limited permittable HMF volumes, especially in the semiarid Colorado River basin which includes high urban water demand up-basin. When considering volumes of HMFs that may be considered ‘available’, it is essential to consider limitations to the amount of flows that could be permitted. This study provides a template for assessing HMFs for MAR that considers water rights, environmental flows, and coastal inflow requirements that could be generally applied in many regions (particularly the western US) to address climate extremes."

This paper systematically reviews the existing literature on stranded assets, presenting four core findings. First, the notion of stranded assets has matured from a narrow focus on ‘impaired assets’ to a comprehensive framework encompassing stranded resources, stranded capital, and stranded paper, driven by factors including unburnable carbon constraints, transition-risk policies, physical climate damages, and environmental liability attribution. Second, scale assessments typically combine top–down scenario design under stringent carbon budgets with bottom–up model construction. Third, stranded assets inflict significant financial shocks on fossil fuel upstream and downstream firms and transmit risk to the broader financial system via institutional investor exposures and systemic vulnerabilities; uneven regional risk distribution and intergenerational and international equity concerns may further trigger political risks. Finally, mitigation strategies involve portfolio optimization, accelerated renewable energy deployment, enhanced climate risk disclosure, and macroprudential policy tools. Future research should deepen the comprehensive quantification of multiple asset types, conduct micro-level empirical analyses, implement short-term dynamic monitoring, and develop equitable distribution mechanisms to support precise risk management and effective low-carbon transition decision-making."

Here, we assessed historic and recent remnant woody vegetation loss and protection across Queensland, Australia’s most biodiverse state. By comparing the proportion of remnant woody vegetation loss with the extent of formally PAs across 13 bioregions and 116 subregions, we generate a balanced evaluation of conservation progress and apply a risk classification framework. We found that Queensland has lost 21.4% of its original woody vegetation since European colonisation, with only 9.6% currently protected. Importantly, one-fifth of this loss occurred between 2000 and 2018, despite protection more than doubling during the same period. Our results show that protection gains were concentrated in low-risk regions, while areas with considerable historical loss, such as the Brigalow Belt and Mulga Lands, continued to experience clearing and low protection gains. By 2018, 44% of subregions fell into high or very high-risk categories, while only 15% were classified as not at risk. The risk status for most subregions remained unchanged, which suggests that limited conservation progress has been achieved in high-pressure landscapes. Our findings highlight the limitations of using protected area expansion alone as a metric of conservation progress. A balance-sheet approach tracking both protection and loss can provide a more robust framework for evaluating conservation outcomes. This type of balance-sheet framework can support more effective conservation planning, including restoration and stricter land-clearing controls. Our results offer practical insights for aligning national actions with global biodiversity targets, such as those outlined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework."

This study investigated the link between the recent (1980–2020) decline in freshwater availability and anthropogenic climate change using formal detection and attribution analysis. Water availability, defined as the difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (E), is assessed using a simple yet efficient Budyko-based hydrological model. Using the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology Earth System Model which is tailored to perform well in simulating climate in this region, we demonstrate that observed water availability decline (−5.60 mm yr−1, p < 0.001) falls decisively outside the range of natural climate variability (−0.50–0.48 mm yr−1 from 1000 control simulations). The spatial correlation between observations and historical simulations exceeds 99.7% of natural variability patterns, providing strong evidence for anthropogenic influence. States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal, home to one-third of the country’s population, show significant decreases in freshwater availability beyond those expected from natural climate variability alone and are consistent with anthropogenic climate change."

Fertilized soils are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent GHG. Reducing N2O emissions is a key interest for many countries, including Denmark, where approximately 90% of N2O emissions originate from agricultural soils. Although the link between nitrogen (N) fertilization and N2O emissions is well-known, quantitative evidence for the efficiency of mitigation options in the relevant local context is scarce. This is often due to high flux variation over time scales ranging from hours to a few days. Previous studies have mostly neglected to perform measurements that could to account for this variation. Furthermore, reducing N2O fluxes can result in increased losses through ammonia (NH3) volatilization and N leaching, as well as reduced yields. Thus, establishing tangible mitigation strategies requires a holistic understanding of N2O fluxes in the context of the annual, field-scale N balance, translation of findings into modeling approaches, use of models to identify emission hotspots, and scaling interventions from the field to regional and national levels. Here, we introduce the SmartField initiative, which aims to reduce national N2O emissions in Denmark by 20%–30% by 2030 by testing and providing verified, field-tested mitigation options. The initiative includes accurate and transparent N2O emissions accounting at the field, farm, and national levels and a setup to test management technologies for N2O emissions. It also involves developing a monitoring, reporting, and verification system for N2O emissions based on a Tier 3 methodology. Furthermore, SmartField collaborates closely with farmers, value chain actors, and policy makers to identify synergies and trade-offs between reducing GHG emissions and their effects on the environment, food production, and farm profitability."

This study examines a more recent and noteworthy case in late summer 2021 in which substantial sea ice loss followed a period of surface meteorological extremes in the Beaufort Sea region of the Arctic. We focus on the period from mid-August to mid-September 2021 that coincided with the Office of Naval Research THINICE Pilot Field Campaign and investigate stormy and windy conditions with respect to air-sea processes impacting sea ice conditions. We find that during the stormy first half of the campaign, cyclone-induced energy fluxes into the marginal ice zone and surrounding waters preconditioned the ice pack for more rapid melt later in the campaign. The second half of the campaign, in contrast, was marked by non-cyclone wind events that enhanced turbulent (namely sensible) heat fluxes into the ice and upper ocean that increased melt. Moreover, this latter period had enhanced advection of the Beaufort Sea ice pack into above-freezing waters, increasing bottom melt to >1 cm d−1 over the remainder of the campaign. While findings are shown to vary by surface type and at relatively small (i.e. ice-floe) scales, insights are offered on the roles of late summer coupled processes on rapid ice loss events in today’s Arctic environment."

FOSW remains an emerging technology with significant uncertainty surrounding its future development. We estimate the electricity output, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and levelized cost of transmission (LCOT) for two locations in California where offshore wind projects are currently planned (Humboldt and Morro Bay). We use data collected in a prior extensive expert elicitation, complemented by publicly available data. Assuming a 30 year lifetime and a 5.69% discount rate for the offshore components, and a 60 year lifetime and 4.40% discount rate for onshore transmission infrastructure, and under the ranges of input values provided by the experts, we find that the 2035 median levelized costs of energy and transmission (LCOE + LCOT) range from $95 to $121 per MWh. Operation and maintenance costs, turbines, and floating foundations are the largest contributors to levelized costs. In addition to a base-case analysis, we perform single-parameter sensitivity analyses and show that the results are highly sensitive to discount rate, lifetime, and farm power density. To further understand the overall uncertainty, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation assuming uniform distributions for each component-cost, finding combined LCOE + LCOT ranging from $95 to $200 per MWh. For all scenarios, transmission represents a small portion of total project costs. This analysis emphasizes the importance of strategic planning and investment in FOSW to meet California’s renewable energy goals."

Adopting an event-based framework, we analyse 5 km hourly rainfall data from 12 ensemble members and compare changes in future rainfall events to those derived from applying intensity-based scaling factors alone. This comparison allows us to identify aspects of rainfall change that are not captured by shifts in intensity distributions. Our results show that short-duration winter events become increasingly localised, with peak intensities increasing by up to 47%, amplifying flash flood potential. In summer, rainfall events exhibit expanded spatial extents—expanding by 25%–40%—magnifying total precipitation volumes. While we find small changes in the number of clustered events (i.e. heavy rainfall events that occur within a 21 day window), there are large changes to the contribution these have to seasonal precipitation, particularly in summer (7%–11% in the baseline to 11%–16% in future period). These findings highlight new insights into how heavy rainfall may change under future climate conditions, identifying aspects of change beyond intensity increases alone that are relevant for informing current practice for flood risk estimation."

Maximum endotoxin level (26.5 ng m−3) occurred near ground during winter, attributed to enhanced near-surface emissions. Bioactive endotoxins peaked at 12.4 ng m−3 near ground in winter, exceeding the exposure threshold, while averaging 8.1 ng m−3 in other seasons. Short- and mid-chain 3-OH-FAs (C8–C13) exhibited significant correlations with meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and wind speed) at both altitudes, indicating regulation through microbial growth dynamics and photochemical processes. Long-chain homologues (C14–C18) were affected by both meteorological conditions and particulate pollutants (e.g., organic carbon, K+, Ca2+), reflecting mixed influences from natural sources (e.g., soils) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., combustion).

Aqueous-phase nitration of 2-hydroxyphenol under acidic conditions, analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, demonstrated an alternative nitrophenol formation pathway. Among the detected compounds, 2-hydroxyphenol and 4-nitrophenol showed the highest average concentrations (2.31 ± 1.39 and 2.20 ± 1.21 µg m−3, respectively). Seasonal variations showed elevated nitrophenol levels during winter, especially in Dhaka South (4.54 ± 2.94 µg m−3). These findings highlight the quantification of phenolic precursors and the role of aqueous-phase reactions in BrC formation, providing valuable insights for future atmospheric modeling and air quality management strategies in South Asia."

Our large-eddy simulations with sectional aerosol–hydrometeor microphysics support this, reproducing observed size distributions and showing how SIP accelerates aggregation, enhancing surface precipitation. 
 Secondary ice production (SIP) was investigated in a cumulus congestus system observed during the Secondary Production of Ice in Cumulus Experiment (SPICULE) campaign. Large-eddy simulations were performed using UCLALES–SALSA, a model that explicitly resolves aerosol–hydrometeor interactions through a sectional representation of aerosols, cloud droplets, rain droplets, and ice crystals. Two scenarios were compared: one including only immersion freezing as an ice formation process, and another incorporating additional SIP mechanisms – namely droplet shattering, rime splintering, and ice–ice collisional breakup.The SIP-inclusive simulation reproduced the evolution of the observed cloud microphysical structure in both warm and mixed-phase regions. Ice–ice collisional breakup generated substantially more secondary ice particles than droplet shattering; however, it was only initiated after droplet shattering provided a sufficient initial ice particle population to meet the SIP triggering conditions. Droplet shattering was triggered by the presence of large supercooled droplets, defined by an integral raindrop diameter exceeding 3.5 mm L−1 at temperatures below 265 K. Once formed, secondary ice particles enhanced riming and accretion, leading to auto-catalytic amplification of SIP through ice–ice breakup. This feedback rapidly depleted cloud liquid water within approximately 10 min.Enhanced updrafts were identified in SIP-active regions, suggesting invigoration in the upper mixed-phase levels. SIP also intensified precipitation via the ice phase, resulting in a 26 % increase in domain-mean cumulative precipitation. The simulations reproduced key aspects of the observed ice multiplication, supporting the adequacy of the SIP representation in the model framework."

We applied a new tool, the convective exchange matrix, in historical simulations with a chemistry–climate model to investigate the trends in convective transport. This reveals that convection reaches higher but that deep convection occurs less often in the time period from 2011 to 2020 than in the 1980s. Thus, convective transport towards the upper troposphere has declined as an adaptation to climate change. 
 Convective transport leads to a rapid vertical redistribution of tracers. This has a major influence on the composition of the upper troposphere (UT), a highly climate-sensitive region. It is not yet clear how the convective transport is affected by climate change. In this study, we applied a new tool, the so-called convective exchange matrix, in historical simulations with the chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) to investigate the trends in convective transport. The simulated deep convection is penetrating higher but occurs less frequently from 2011 to 2020 than from 1980 to 1989. The increase in the vertical extent of convection is highly correlated with a rise in the tropopause height. The upward transport of air mass increased on average to height levels of 130 hPa and above, but convection transported material less efficiently to the upper troposphere in general from 2011 to 2020 in comparison to the 1980s. These findings give rise to new opportunities to investigate long-term simulations performed by EMAC with regard to the effects of convective transport. Furthermore, they might provide a first insight into the trends in atmospheric convective transport due to changing atmospheric conditions and might serve as an estimate for the convective feedback to climate change."

The fingerprint markers of microplastic sources are very limited. We examine the concentration, size distribution, eco-health risks, and production of reactive oxygen species of microplastics from five typical sources, especially neglected rural sources. Our results could provide a scientific foundation for developing efficient management strategies. 
 Research on atmospheric microplastics (MPs) from typical sources is limited, constraining the targeted management of pollution. Here, the source profiles of eight types of common MPs and three classes of plasticizers (i.e., phthalates, benzothiazole and its derivatives, and bisphenol A) emitted from five living sources, including Plastic Burning (PB), Fruit-bag Burning, Road Traffic (RT), Agricultural Film, and Livestock Breeding (LB), were determined in PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 µm) and PM10 (≤ 10 µm) in the Guanzhong Plain, northern China. PB exhibits high proportions of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and 2-hydroxy benzothiazole (HOBT), with PMMA being more abundant in PM2.5–10 (aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 µm). FB exhibits a higher proportion of di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP) in PM2.5–10 than in PM2.5. RT shows a distinguishable profile with high abundances of rubber. The abundance of 2-benzothiazolyl-N-morpholinosulfide (OBS) in PM2.5–10 was twice that in PM2.5 for RT. Polystyrene (PS) is the most abundant MP in AF. LB shows the distinguishing feature of benzothiazoles, especially OBS and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (CBS). The eco-health risk assessments reveal that combustion-derived MPs (Plastic Burning and Fruit-bag Burning) indicate the highest ecological risk (Level III). Elevated hazard indices to human health were observed in LB and PB, primarily attributed to bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Notably, PMMA, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates (PAEs) emerged as key drivers of oxidative stress of PMs. This study advances the understanding of atmospheric MPs, offering critical insights for source tracking and risk assessment to mitigate their eco-health effects."

Hut;Bas Walraven;Remko Uijlenhoet,Use of commercial microwave links as scintillometers: potential and limitations towards evaporation estimation,"Commercial microwave links (CMLs), part of mobile phone networks, transmit comparable signals to instruments specially designed to estimate evaporation. Therefore, we investigate if CMLs could be used to estimate evaporation, even though they have not been designed for this purpose. Our results illustrate the potential for using CMLs to estimate evaporation, especially given their global coverage, but also outline some major drawbacks, often a consequence of unfavourable design choices for CMLs. 
 Scintillometers are used to estimate path-integrated evaporation and sensible heat fluxes. Commercial microwave links (CMLs), such as are used in cellular telecommunication networks, are similar line-of-sight instruments that also measure signal intensity of microwave signals, just like microwave scintillometers do. However, CMLs are not designed to capture scintillation fluctuations. Here, we investigate if and under what conditions CMLs can be used to obtain the structure parameter of the refractive index, Cnn, which would be a first step in computing turbulent heat fluxes with CMLs using scintillation theory. We use data from three collocated microwave links installed over an 856 m path at the Ruisdael Observatory near Cabauw, the Netherlands. Two of these links are 38 GHz CMLs formerly employed in telecom networks in the Netherlands, a Nokia Flexihopper and an Ericsson MiniLink. We compare Cnn estimates obtained from the received signal intensity of these links, sampled at 20 Hz, with those obtained from measurements of a 160 GHz microwave scintillometer (RPG-MWSC) sampled at 1 kHz and with those of an eddy-covariance system. After comparison of the unprocessed Cnn, we rejected the Ericsson MiniLink because its 0.5 dB power quantization (i.e. the discretization of the signal intensity) was found to be too coarse to be applied as a scintillometer. Based on the power spectra of the Nokia Flexihopper and the microwave scintillometer, we propose two methods to correct for the white noise present in the signal of the Nokia Flexihopper: (1) we apply a high-pass filter and subtract a low quantile of the resulting variances of the Nokia Flexihopper and (2) we correct for the noise by comparing with a microwave scintillometer (MWS) and select the parts of the power spectra where the Nokia Flexihopper behaves in correspondence with scintillation theory, also considering different crosswind conditions, and correct for the underrepresented part of the scintillation spectrum based on theoretical scintillation spectra. The comparison and noise determination with the microwave scintillometer provide the best-possible Cnn estimates for the Nokia Flexihopper, although this method is not feasible in operational settings for CMLs. Both of our proposed methods show an improvement in Cnn estimates in comparison to uncorrected estimates, albeit with larger uncertainty than when using the reference instruments. Our study illustrates the potential for using CMLs as scintillometers but also outlines some major drawbacks, most of which are related to unfavourable design choices made for CMLs. If these were overcome, given their global coverage, there is potential for CMLs to perform large-scale evaporation monitoring."

Using the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI), this impact study provides critical insights into the necessity of enhanced GNSS-RO observations for NWP applications. 
 The international collaborative Radio Occultation Modeling EXperiment (ROMEX) project marks the first time using a large volume of real data to assess the impact of increased Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS-RO) observations beyond current operational levels, moving past previous theoretical simulation-based studies. The ROMEX project enabled the use of approximately 35 000 daily RO profiles – nearly triple the number typically available to operational centers, which is about 8000 to 12 000 per day. This study investigates the impact of increased RO profiles on numerical weather prediction (NWP) with the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) and the global forecast system (GFS), as part of the ROMEX effort. A series of experiments were conducted assimilating varying amounts of RO data along with a common set of other key observations. The results confirm that assimilating additional RO data further improves forecasts across all major meteorological fields, including temperature, humidity, geopotential height, and wind speed, for most of vertical levels. These improvements are significantly evident in verification against both critical observations and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses, with beneficial impacts lasting up to 5 d. Conversely, withholding RO data resulted in forecast degradations. The results also suggest that forecast improvements scale approximately logarithmically with the number of assimilated profiles, and no evidence of saturation was observed. Biases in the forecast of temperature and geopotential height over the lower stratosphere are discussed, and they are consistent with findings from other studies in the ROMEX community."

 A range of leaching protocols have been used to measure the soluble fraction of aerosol trace elements worldwide, and therefore these measurements may not be directly comparable. This work presents the first large-scale international laboratory intercomparison study for aerosol trace element leaching protocols. Eight widely-used protocols are compared using 33 samples that were subdivided and distributed to all participants. Protocols used ultrapure water, ammonium acetate, or acetic acid (the so-called “Berger leach”) as leaching solutions, although none of the protocols were identical to any other. The ultrapure water leach resulted in significantly lower soluble fractions, when compared to the ammonium acetate leach or the Berger leach. For Al, Cu, Fe and Mn, the ammonium acetate leach resulted in significantly lower soluble fractions than those obtained with the Berger leach, suggesting that categorizing these two methods together as “strong leach” in global databases is potentially misleading. Among the ultrapure water leaching methods, major differences seemed related to specific protocol features rather than the use of a batch or a flow-through technique. Differences in trace element solubilization among leach solutions were apparent for aerosols with different sources or transport histories, and further studies of this type are recommended on aerosols from other regions. We encourage the development of “best practices” guidance on analytical protocols, data treatment and data validation in order to reduce the variability in soluble aerosol trace element data reported. These developments will improve understanding of the impact of atmospheric deposition on ocean ecosystems and climate."

In this study, we used freely available historical stereo images covering Switzerland (1979–2006) to derive four countrywide digital elevation models (DSMs) at a 1 m spatial resolution. Our DSMs achieved sub-metric accuracy compared to reference data and high image matching completeness, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing surface change at a high spatial resolution over different land cover classes. 
 Historical aerial images, captured by film cameras in the previous century, are valuable resources for quantifying Earth's surface and landscape changes over time. In the post-war period, these images were often acquired to create topographic maps, resulting in the acquisition of large-scale aerial photographs with stereo coverage. Photogrammetric techniques applied to these stereo images enable the extraction of 3D information to reconstruct digital surface models (DSMs) and orthoimages.Here, we present a highly automated photogrammetric approach for generating countrywide DSMs of Switzerland, at a 1 m resolution, from approximately 32 000 scanned aerial stereo images acquired between 1979 and 2006, with known exterior and interior orientation. We derived four countrywide DSMs for the epochs 1979–1985, 1985–1991, 1991–1998, and 1998–2006. From the DSMs, we generated corresponding countrywide vegetation height models (VHMs). We assessed the quality of the historical DSMs at the country scale and within six representative study sites, evaluating the vertical accuracy and the completeness of image matching across different land cover types.Mean completeness ranged from 64 % for “glacial and perpetual snow” to 98 % for “sealed surfaces”, with a value of 93 % for the “closed forest” class. Across Switzerland, the median elevation accuracy of the historical DSMs compared with a reference digital terrain model (DTM) on sealed surface points ranged from 0.08 to 0.16 m, with a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of around 0.8 m and a maximum root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.20 m. Similar accuracies are obtained when comparing historical DSMs with measured geodetic points.The VHMs generated in this study enabled the detection of major changes in forest areas due to windstorm damage, forest dynamics, and growth. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generating accurate, very-high-resolution DSM time series (spanning three decades) and VHMs from historical aerial images of the entire surface of Switzerland in a highly automated manner. The VHMs are already being used to estimate countrywide biomass changes. The countrywide DSMs and VHMs for the four epochs, along with auxiliary data, are available online at https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.528 (Marty et al., 2024) and can be used to quantify long-term elevation changes and related processes across different surfaces."

The data are consistent with satellite-based observations and are made available for use in future geophysical and climate-related research. 
 Repeated absolute gravity measurements, conducted once or twice per year, have proven valuable for quantifying slow vertical land motion with a precision better than 0.4 µGal yr−1 (1 µGal = 10−8 m s−2) after a decade or more. This precision is comparable to vertical velocity estimates derived from continuously operating space-based geodetic techniques such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Furthermore, absolute gravimeters are particularly well suited for long-term studies, as their measurements are based on fundamental length and time standards (laser and atomic clock) and remain independent of terrestrial reference frame realizations, unlike GNSS. Consequently, an absolute gravimeter can return years or even decades later and provide relevant measurements, provided the initial gravity data are well documented and the ground gravity marker remains undisturbed. Following this line of thinking, we have compiled and consistently reprocessed absolute gravity measurements collected between 1998 and 2022 in Brest, on the French Atlantic coast, near its century-long tide gauge station. The entire dataset has been reanalyzed in accordance with international recognized standards for instrumental and modelling corrections. This effort has yielded a 25-year time series of absolute gravity values, which we present and document for future studies, along with details on our reprocessing methodology.

 Winter precipitation forecasts of phase and amount are challenging, especially in Northeast United States where mixed precipitation events from various synoptic systems frequently occur.

The goal of this campaign was to observe various phases of winter precipitation and winter storm types to validate the GPM satellite precipitation products. Over the three winters at UConn, a total of 40 instruments were deployed across two observing sites that captured 117 precipitation events, including 19 phase transition events as indicated by the PARSIVEL2. These instruments included scanning and vertically pointing radars, along with suites of in-situ sensors. In addition, an unmanned aircraft system has been deployed in 2023–2024.

 Observing sea level and its variations is of great importance for many scientific, societal and economic issues. This data paper presents a new coastal high resolution Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) product, ALTICAP (ALTimetry Innovative Coastal Approach Product), derived from along track satellite altimetry. To enable as many coastal applications as possible, collocated altimetric significant wave height and wind data are also provided, as well as quality flags and the geophysical corrections applied to the SLA. Covering all ocean regions between 0 and 500 km from land, and between 66° S and 66° N, this dataset contains five years (February 2016 to July 2021) of 20 Hz altimetry measurements from the Jason-3 mission. The altimetric standards and geophysical corrections used to compute the SLA have been selected following a round robin study based on 22 of the most recent algorithms available. The processing solution adopted was a compromise between the capability of each algorithm to provide the best sea level solution over the entire strip between 0 and 200 km from the coast and a guarantee of product continuity in the future."

Traditional methods cannot resolve cases with sharp discontinuities in hydraulic/mechanical properties across those layers. Here we present a new space-time method that can handle such discontinuities. This approach is coupled with trace element transport. Our study reveals that the layering of rocks significantly influences the formation of fluid-rich channels and the material distribution adjacent to discontinuities. 
 The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method, which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions efficiently. The space-time method enables straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results indicate that, under certain conditions, the discontinuity of the initial porosity influences the distribution of incompatible trace elements, leading to sharp concentration gradients and large degrees of elemental enrichment. Finally, our results indicate that the enrichment of trace elements depends not only on the channelization of the flow but also on the interaction of fluid-filled channels with layers of different porosity and permeability."

While all methods capture the spatial distribution of LHR reasonably well, the top three methods, which incorporate a cloud‐region constraint to exclude non‐cloud heating, exhibit the highest spatial pattern correlations with GPM observations.

The present study explores mechanisms that can explain the spatial patterns found in a previous analysis employing satellite measured SM: positive feedback in the semi‐arid western U.S. (higher morning SM predicting greater likelihood of afternoon rainfall), and negative feedback in the humid east. Using a cloud–topped boundary layer model, we examine how evaporative fraction (EF, a proxy for SM) influences cloud mass flux (CMF). We then use logistic regression to relate CMF to precipitation. The results are consistent with the previous analysis: in semi‐arid areas, increased humidification with increased EF dominates CMF strength, yielding net positive feedbacks; in humid areas, reductions in convective velocity with increasing EF dominate the CMF, yielding net negative feedbacks.

Ions with pitch angles >30° from the local perpendicular direction have guiding center trajectories that allow them to skip over the moon as they azimuthally drift with velocities ∼100 km s−1. In general, short bounce times and large gyroradii can act as good indicators when to expect significant losses; however, we show asymmetries in energy, pitch angle, and gyrophase that we cannot fully explain and require detailed particle tracing with realistic electromagnetic fields.

Beyond its specific relevance, this site provides a natural laboratory for assessing the ability of attenuation imaging to distinguish fluid‐rich zones from highly strained, failure‐prone volumes. We integrated scattering and absorption tomography models: scattering anomalies, between the two principal thrusts, highlight localized strain near fault tips; absorption tomography images the shallow UGS and reveals a deeper fluid‐saturated volume. Seismicity concentrated around this deeper anomaly, exhibiting a pulsatory temporal pattern, suggests a fluid‐driven role in the deformation processes. These findings show that attenuation tomography, combined with multiscale and complementary geophysical models, can resolve critical subsurface features related to fluids and strain.

Such conditions are most readily achieved with large crustal thicknesses, high radiogenic heating rates, and slow convergence. The first two factors indicate an important role for geological history, in terms of creating a strong foreland and assembling sufficiently radiogenic lithologies. Slow convergence is generally incompatible with uplift outpacing erosion to develop thick mountain belts, but this paradox is resolved by, and explains, most lithium deposits being formed late in the history of mountain belts, at times of slowing convergence rates.

However, the limited understanding of the molecular characteristics of this organic P hampers our ability to comprehend its environmental stability and cycling processes. To address this knowledge gap, this study synthesized various BBS‐DOMs and used FT‐ICR‐MS to analyze their molecular characteristics and potential environmental stabilities. Herein, CHOP compounds (the capital letters in these compound names indicate their elemental compositions) were the dominant organic P component in most BBS‐DOMs, followed by CHONP and CHONSP compounds. However, high content of N in biomass enabled CHONP compounds to become the primary component during the burning process. Furthermore, CHOP compounds exhibited higher polarity and aliphaticity, lower molecular mass and aromaticity than CHONP and CHONSP compounds. Among these compounds, CHOP compounds predominantly existed as hydrolysis‐available P (phosphate esters with three P‐O‐C/H groups), accounting for >76% of the total organic P. Differently, CHONP and CHONSP compounds exhibited comparable oxidation‐available P (containing P‐C bond or incompletely oxidized P) and hydrolysis‐available P levels. These findings suggested that CHOP compounds had a lower environmental stability and shorter turnover cycle than CHONP and CHONSP compounds. Additionally, the (cellulose + hemicellulose)/lignin ratio of biomass and the burning temperature co‐regulated the aromatic degree and available state of organic P compounds in BBS‐DOMs. This study provides critical molecular‐level insights into the biogeochemical process of atmospheric P from biomass burning."

 Somatically acquired mutations in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were recently identified as the cause of the adult-onset autoinflammatory syndrome VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X linked, autoinflammatory, somatic)1. UBA1 mutations in VEXAS lead to clonal expansion within the HSPC and myeloid, but not lymphoid, compartments. Despite its severity and prevalence, the mechanisms whereby UBA1 mutations cause multiorgan autoinflammation and hematologic disease are unknown. Here, we employ somatic gene editing approaches to model VEXAS-associated UBA1 mutations in primary macrophages and HSPCs. Uba1-mutant macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli underwent aberrant apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by Caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL, respectively. Accordingly, in mice challenged with TNF or LPS, the UBA1 inhibitor TAK-243 exacerbated inflammation in a RIPK3-Caspase-8-dependent manner. In contrast, Uba1 mutation in HSPCs induced an unfolded protein response and myeloid bias independently of RIPK3-Caspase-8. Mechanistically, aberrant cell death of Uba1-mutant macrophages coincided with a kinetic defect in Lys63/Met1 (i.e., linear) polyubiquitylation of inflammatory signaling complexes. Collectively, our results link VEXAS pathogenesis with that of rarer monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes; highlight specific ubiquitin-associated defects stemming from an apical mutation in the ubiquitylation cascade; and support therapeutic targeting of the inflammatory cell death axis in VEXAS."

 Cooperative catalysis, in which multiple catalytic units operate synergistically, underpins a variety of synthetically and mechanistically important organic reactions1–4. Despite its potential utility in new reactivity contexts, approaches to the discovery of cooperative catalysts have been limited, typically relying on serendipity or on prior knowledge of single-catalyst reactivity1,5. Systematic searches for unanticipated types of catalyst cooperativity must contend with vast combinatorial complexity and are therefore not undertaken6–10. Here, we describe a pooling–deconvolution algorithm, inspired by group testing11, that identifies cooperative catalyst behaviors with low experimental cost while accommodating potential inhibitory effects between catalyst candidates. The workflow was validated first on simulated cooperativity data, and then by experimentally identifying previously documented cooperativity between organocatalysts in an enantioselective oxetane-opening reaction. The workflow was then applied in a discovery context to a Pd-catalyzed decarbonylative cross-coupling reaction, enabling the identification of several ligand pairs that promote the target transformation at substantially lower catalyst loading and temperature than previously reported with single ligand systems."

 Antiferromagnetic (AF) van der Waals (vdW) magnets combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter, the Néel-vector, remains a key limitation. Here, we achieve Néel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr, via an effect we term lateral exchange bias (LEB). We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer Néel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve non-volatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AF order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.

 How individuals process and respond to uncertainty has important implications for cognition and mental health. Here, we use computational phenotyping to examine inter-individual differences in uncertainty processing in relation to neurometabolites and trait anxiety in humans. We introduce a categorical state-transition extension of the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter to model individuals’ evolving beliefs about transition probabilities in a four-choice probabilistic sensorimotor learning task with a reversal. Using 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, we measure neurotransmitter levels in the primary motor cortex. Model-based results reveal dynamic belief updating in response to environmental changes. We further find region-specific relationships between baseline primary motor cortex glutamate+ glutamine levels and prediction errors and volatility beliefs. High trait anxiety is associated with faster post-reversal responses. This study establishes a direct neurochemical correlate of hierarchical belief updating, identifying motor cortex glutamate + glutamine as an important neural marker of inter-individual differences in uncertainty processing.

Here, we use a validated microsimulation model to quantify the potential impact of improving exposure levels of eight risk factors on the burden of major illness among adults aged 30+ in England between 2023-2043.

Theoretical minimum risk exposure levels of all risk factors could reduce 2043 major illness prevalence by 2 percentage points (95% uncertainty intervals: 1.3, 2.7) compared to the continuing trends (base-case) scenario; under a 10% improvement in all risk factors, we project a 0.3 percentage points (0.2, 0.4) reduction in major illness.

Here, the authors show that rotational mixing uniquely explains this depletion using spectra from NGC 188 subgiants. 
 The Lithium-Dip is a severe lithium depletion observed in mid-F (6200-6650 K) dwarfs, which has puzzled astronomers since it was discovered in 1986. Proposed mechanisms include effects related to rotation, magnetic fields, diffusion, gravity waves, and mass loss. Which, if any, of these is realistic remains unclear. Here we show that mixing due to shear induced by stellar angular momentum loss is the unique mechanism driving the lithium depletion. Each mechanism leaves a different signature in the subsurface lithium distribution. The deepening surface convection zones of subgiants of NGC 188 evolving out of the Lithium-Dip dredge up the subsurface material and thus reveal the signature of the responsible mechanism, rotation. Subgiants can also be used more generally, thereby improving fundamental understanding of stellar evolution. Rotational mixing may be the dominant lithium-depleting mechanism in a wide range of solar-type stars, including in the Sun. Our results may further reconcile the cosmological lithium discrepancy.

Here the authors propose and realize a fiber array architecture that enables independent and highly parallel control of single qubits in a neutral atom array. 
 Arrays of single atoms trapped in optical tweezers are increasingly recognized as a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. In both the fault-tolerant and NISQ eras, the ability to individually control qubits is essential for the efficient execution of quantum circuits. Time-division multiplexed control schemes based on atom shuttling or beam scanning have been employed to build programmable neutral atom quantum processors, but achieving high-rate, highly parallel gate operations remains a challenge. Here, we propose a fiber array architecture for atom quantum computing capable of fully independent control of individual atoms. The trapping and addressing lasers for each individual atom are emitted from the same optical waveguide, enabling robust control through common-mode suppression of beam pointing noise. Using a fiber array, we experimentally demonstrate the trapping and independent control of ten single atoms in two-dimensional optical tweezers, achieving individually addressed single-qubit gates with an average fidelity of 0.9966(3). More significantly, we perform simultaneous arbitrary single-qubit gates on four randomly selected qubits, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.9961(4).

 Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are complex psychiatric disorders with overlapping features. Their heterogeneity may arise from interactions between genetic variants and environmental or epigenetic modifiers. Allele-specific expression (ASE), an imbalance in expression between gene alleles, provides a key mechanism linking these interactions to disease. We conducted transcriptomic and genomic analyses in phenotype-discordant monozygotic twins to investigate ASE in psychiatric risk. Nine ASE-affected long non-coding RNAs were identified, including LINC02449, which showed a consistent allele-specific shift in BD/SZ patients favoring the alternative G allele at rs149707223. Functional analyses revealed that overexpression of the LINC02449 G allele in mice induced social deficits and repetitive behaviors. These phenotypes were associated with enhanced excitatory transmission within the mPFC-NAc circuit, mediated by the synaptic regulator CPLX1.

 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in legume-rhizobia represents a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to chemical nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. Identifying key factors involved in nodule senescence, is crucial for enhancing SNF by effectively extending the lifespan of nodules. Here, we reveal that sulfur (S), an essential element for SNF, plays a major regulatory role in the senescence of soybean (Glycine max) nodules. Blocking S input into the symbiosome by knocking out either S transporter genes SULTR2;1 or SULTR3;5, resulted in a significant decrease in glutathione levels. This reduction impairs the capacity for reactive nitrogen species scavenging, thereby accelerating nodule senescence. Notably, reducing reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production in rhizobia or increasing S input in soybean nodules through genetic manipulation, can effectively mitigate high nitrogen-induced nodule senescence. Our findings demonstrate that SULTR-mediated S input is a pivotal step in regulating nodule senescence, and provide insights for developing strategies to enhance SNF in legumes by delaying nodule senescence.

 Climate boundaries are planetary boundaries for the climate system: limits within which humanity can sustainably prosper. Here we introduce a modelling framework to analyse global warming, ocean acidification, sea-level rise and Arctic sea-ice melt. Using a reduced-form model, we map out anthropogenic CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management pathways compatible with these boundaries. We define safety levels as the probability to stay within one or several boundaries considering physical uncertainty. If CO2 emissions peak in 2030, net-zero CO2 is reached in 2050, and carbon dioxide removal capacity is 10 PgC yr−1, without solar radiation management, remaining within the global warming boundary of 2 °C exhibits a safety level of 80%. When all four boundaries are considered together, the safety level drops to 35%. Our results highlight key trade-offs in mitigation options and suggest a need to assess climate boundaries holistically to develop sustainable future strategies.

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine has disrupted crop exports and global food security, overshadowing critical nutrient asymmetry and the associated environmental risks. Here we demonstrate that following nutrient shortages after independence in 1991, fertilizer use increased over 2000-2021, but has decreased sharply following the invasion in early 2022. Input-output balances of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for staple crops (wheat, maize and sunflower) highlight soil P and K mining since 1991, increasing N surpluses during 2000-2021 and large NPK deficits since the war began in 2022. Based on analysis of five scenarios for 2030, we show how an Integrated Nutrient Management Plan for Ukraine combining manure recycling, precision fertilization and legume expansion is urgently needed, and would maintain crop productivity, significantly reduce nutrient surpluses and improve nutrient use efficiencies up to 80–89%, substantially curtailing environmental pollution and soil degradation.

 Mars’ sedimentary rocks record Gyrs of environmental change. New data enable global analyses of paleo-environment relevant physical properties of these rocks, including layer thickness and accumulation rate. Here, using plane-fitting techniques on orbital imagery and elevation models, we find that sedimentary layer thicknesses of post-3.5 Ga rocks across the Martian surface show coherent variations at  ~1000 km-scale that are inconsistent with simple volcanic and climatic hypotheses for formation, which are consistent with global compositional homogeneity at orbital scales. These data combined with analyses of outcrop age and total rock volume revealed a global decrease in layer thickness that predates the eventual drop off in preserved sedimentary rock volume per Myr. These constraints confirm a diachronous transition in Mars’ global sedimentary rock record while also highlighting a regional dichotomy in young sedimentary rock deposits that has not been quantified before.

 Deep-sea methane seepage and associated microbial activities are a crucial part of balancing the global methane budget. However, there is a limited understanding of the various response mechanisms of prokaryotic microorganisms in methane seepage sediments from different depths, which hinders the accurate characterization of the cold seep methane budget. This study investigated the diversity, ecological clustering, and community assembly processes of microorganisms from different sediment depths in methane seepage sediments from the Haima Cold Seep. The results show that a significant correlation was observed between methane, sulfate, total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, and depth in methane seepage environments (P < 0.05). We also determined that sediment depth affected the carbon, and sulfur cycling processes, particularly at 10 and 70 cm of the sediment. The methane leakage region was dominated by deterministic processes in the vertical profiles. The concentrations of methane, total inorganic carbon, and sulfate were key drivers in microbial community structure.

 The early warning of heatwaves using seasonal forecasting systems has the potential to mitigate economic losses and risk to life. Because of the limited reliability and computational expense of dynamical forecasting systems, efforts in recent years have turned to exploiting Machine Learning. Here, an inexpensive approach to forecasting summer heatwaves over Europe is developed, using an optimisation-based feature selection framework to detect a combination of variables, domains and time-lags used to skilfully predict heatwaves. The purely data-driven forecasts are shown to match, and in places outperform, the skill of the state-of-the-art dynamical multi-model products. Moreover, low skill over Scandinavia, a long-term issue common to most dynamical systems, is improved in our data-driven approach. This work also highlights that the greatest contribution to skill comes from predictors at 4-7 weeks time-lag (e.g. mid-March), and identifies predictors which can form the basis for future studies on mechanisms.

 Evolving tropical cyclone characteristics are expected to amplify coastal hazards in a warmer climate. Here, we investigated seasonal-scale tropical cyclone genesis and landfall patterns from >64,000 statistically-downscaled tropical cyclones that impact Southeast Asian coastlines from the historical (1881–1900) through the future (2081–2100) eras for both moderate and high emission scenarios. From the historical to future eras, tropical cyclone genesis shifts northwards across seasons, with an increased likelihood of genesis adjacent to major coastlines. Proportional increases in genesis exceed 100% during the winter monsoon season and up to 50% during the summer monsoon season. Relative humidity and vertical wind shear become increasingly important influences on tropical cyclone genesis, particularly during the summer monsoon and autumn seasons. There are also increased likelihoods of tropical cyclones making their first landfall along the coastlines of the Philippines and Indonesia during the winter monsoon and spring seasons, and along mainland Southeast Asian coastlines during the summer monsoon and autumn seasons.

 Accurate estimation of leaf spectral properties or biochemical parameters from canopy-level reflectance has long posed a significant challenge in quantitative remote sensing due to the inherent variability and complexity of canopy structures. This study presents 3D-Diff, an innovative differentiable three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer approach for retrieving leaf and soil spectral properties using remote sensing imagery with known 3D canopy structures. Implemented within the LESS (LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation) model, 3D-Diff employs computer graphics-derived differentiable modeling to compute reflectance derivatives relative to scene parameters during forward simulation. A gradient-based optimization algorithm then minimizes discrepancies between simulated and observed images to estimate scene parameters. Validations using both virtual experiments and real measurements demonstrated robust performance across varying parameter quantities. Notably, the results show that the reflectance/transmittance of all scene parameters were accurately estimated with maximum RMSE of 0.015 for virtual experiments, including non-directly-observed elements, and maximum RMSE of 0.096 for real measurements. Spatial resolution significantly affected accuracy, with relative RMSE values of 0.07 % (0.05 m) and 1.4 % (2.5 m) for a dense virtual forest scene. Although computationally slower than analytic models, this work establishes differentiable radiative transfer as a promising framework for fine-scale vegetation mapping, enabling simultaneous multi-parameter retrieval while maintaining physical interpretability."

 Seagrass meadows directly and indirectly provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but their close proximity to anthropogenic activities renders them highly vulnerable. Regardless of their vulnerability and importance as ecosystem health indicators, intertidal seagrasses, unlike their subtidal relatives, have yet to be assessed at continental scales, and current global estimates of seagrass extent either do not mention intertidal seagrasses or combine them with subtidal seagrasses. Here, we present a first of its kind map of intertidal seagrasses in Europe using a harmonised methodology. Over a total intertidal area of 15,100 km2, we found that seagrasses cover an area comparable to the combined areas of Paris and Lisbon: 212 ± 18.8 km2. The proportion of available intertidal area covered by seagrass decreased towards higher latitudes (from ∼5.4 % at 35°N to ∼0 % at 58°N). Regardless of this pattern, the top three hotspots of seagrass covered the full latitudinal range of Europe, notably in the North Frisian Wadden Sea (Germany), Arcachon Bay (France) and Ria Formosa (Portugal). Furthermore, we showed latitudinal gradients in seagrass cover, with higher cover in low latitudes and lower cover in high latitudes. Finally, an almost linear change in intertidal seagrass peak timing (day of the year of maximum seagrass cover) with latitude was found, with peak timing later the further south.

 HawkEye was an ocean color instrument onboard SeaHawk, the first dedicated Ocean Color CubeSat, launched in 2018 to provide targeted high spatial resolution (∼130 m) images of open ocean, coastal, inland, and estuarine waters with eight spectral bands in the visible NIR region. This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of HawkEye standard Level-2 remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products. A total of 51 cloud-free HawkEye scenes over 15 globally distributed inland and coastal water sites with contrasting optical conditions were found to be suitable for match-up analysis, spanning two years. Compared to Rrs from ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET- OC) and in situ hyperspectral measurements from coastal Georgia waters (USA), HawkEye Rrs accuracy varied between 31 and 61 % for Median Symmetric Accuracy (MdSA) depending on the wavelength. The Rrs at 510 nm was the most accurate (31 % MdSA), and the accuracy decreased towards the blue bands, with 412 nm being the least accurate (61.7 % MdSA). HawkEye Rrs is more accurate in low Chlorophyll-a waters compared to high Chlorophyll-a waters. HawkEye products accuracy improved with a site-specific atmospheric correction (e.g. the Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM) correction improved results in two turbid coastal waters tested).

 Rivers are among the most dynamic components of the surface water cycle and play a vital role in the global hydrological system. Under the combined pressures of climate change and human activities, river meander migration has intensified, leading to localized channel cutoff events with significant ecological and management implications. Although numerous studies have documented changes in river migration, they have predominantly addressed local-scale channel dynamics, and automated methods for detecting large-scale channel cutoff events are still lacking. In this study, we propose a scalable method that integrates multi-temporal river-extent mapping with morphological analysis to detect channel cutoffs across broad spatial domains. Our technique identifies closed loops formed by intersecting river centerlines from different periods, thereby reducing false positives from bifurcations and enhancing computational efficiency. We applied the method to five major rivers, the Amazon, Tarim, Yellow, Red, and Ganges, spanning diverse climatic, hydrological, and geomorphic settings. Validation against manual inventories yielded a median F1-score of 0.86 (with a peak of 0.90 for the Yellow River), demonstrating high accuracy and robustness. Cutoff frequency and morphology varied markedly: the hyper-arid Tarim River exhibited the highest frequency (9.2 events per 100 km), with a limited spatial extent, while the Amazon showed a lower frequency (0.6 events per 100 km) but larger events (intersection lengths >2 km; loop areas >0.8 km2).

This study proposes a two-step framework for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in the Qilihai Wetland by integrating UAV LiDAR, hyperspectral images, and 2.5 m-resolution ZY-1 02E satellite imagery. First, biomass was estimated for seven regions using UAV data by comparing support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and random forest (RF) models to identify the optimal estimation model. The results showed that RF achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.922), with canopy height, vegetation type, and several narrowband indices identified as key predictors, while SVM performed the poorest (R2 = 0.616). Second, UAV-derived biomass was applied to the satellite image to compare five models (SVM, XGBoost, GBM, RF, and the convolutional neural network (CNN)). CNN achieved the best performance (R2 = 0.806), outperforming RF (R2 = 0.721) and significantly surpassing the accuracy of direct field–satellite modeling (R2 = 0.434). The high-resolution AGB map revealed clear spatial heterogeneity, with higher biomass in mixed regions of Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis and in communities closer to water sources. By integrating the predictive capabilities of CNN with the interpretability of RF, this two-step framework significantly enhanced the robustness and ecological relevance of biomass estimation. The findings underscore the pivotal role of multi-source data fusion in improving the accuracy of wetland AGB estimates. Moreover, the high-resolution biomass distribution map provides essential guidance for the conservation, management, and ecological restoration of the Qilihai Wetland."

 Natural forest above-ground biomass (AGB) accumulation alters both the three dimensional (3D) structural and spectral characteristics of forest stands. The laser scanning and five-angle multispectral systems mounted on the newly launched Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite (TECIS, also known as “Goumang”) enable the simultaneous capture of both structural and spectral information of forest. In this study, we developed a novel method to estimate forest AGB at footprint level by incorporating full-waveform laser return intensity (LRI) and forest background reflectivity obtained from the TECIS system. Forest background reflectivity was derived using five-angle multispectral imaging from the TECIS system, which significantly influences both the bidirectional reflectivity factor and the full-waveform LRI of forest stands through a geometric-optical model. In addition, we retrieved vertical profiles of gap fraction and leaf area volume density from TECIS full-waveform LRI data. By doing so, we proposed a forest AGB estimation model that incorporates forest background reflectivity, 3D structural features, and tree shape factor information. Our results showed that incorporating forest background reflectivity improved forest AGB estimation accuracy, capturing 85 % (n = 20, p < 0.01) of the variance in field-based AGB, with the coefficient of determination (R2) increasing from 0.39 to 0.66 and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing from 28.12 t/ha to 17.77 t/ha. Finally, we generated a continuous AGB map using a Random Forest model, achieving an R2 of 0.63 and an RMSE of 14.21 t/ha.

 This study investigates crustal deformation in Hong Kong using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations from 19 stations and a range of geophysical models. We examine horizontal and vertical land motions (VLM) recorded by GNSS from 2001 to 2025, accounting for the effects of tectonic deformation, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and surface mass loading. The observed horizontal velocities display a relatively uniform magnitude of 34.8 ± 0.2 mm/yr in the ITRF2014 reference frame, and 1.1 ± 0.2 mm/yr in the South China Block reference frame, consistent with regional plate tectonic motion. We identify coseismic offsets associated with the 2004 Mw 9.1–9.3 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake, the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku earthquake, and the 2012 Mw 8.6 Wharton Basin earthquake, as well as postseismic deformation following the 2004 event. These observations highlight the far-field influence of major regional earthquakes on crustal deformation in Hong Kong. Analysis of VLM reveals localized subsidence at sites impacted by urbanization and land reclamation. After correcting for surface mass loading, residual vertical rates at stations situated away from urban areas indicate consistent uplift ranging from 0.28 ± 0.10 mm/yr to 0.44 ± 0.15 mm/yr, which is in good agreement with GIA model predictions. These findings demonstrate the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic processes on crustal deformation in Hong Kong and provide valuable insights for regional geodynamics, infrastructure planning, sea-level change study, and hazard assessment."

 This study quantifies the contributions of major emission sources of road transport, maritime activities, and residential heating to air pollution in Naples using a high-resolution WRF-CAMx-PSAT modeling framework. Refined emission inventories and model validation against Environmental Air Quality Agency of Campania Region (ARPAC) monitoring data ensured robust simulation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations. The model was applied over a domain covering the Campania region, in Southern Italy, simulating key atmospheric pollutants, including NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2. The source apportionment analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns in pollutant contributions across the five receptor sites. Road transport and residential heating consistently emerged as dominant sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5, particularly within urban and suburban contexts. Maritime emissions were found to significantly impact SO2 and NO2 concentrations at coastal sites, especially near the Port of Naples. Natural sources with sea salt, and secondary organic aerosols also played a non-negligible role in PM10 and PM2.5 levels, especially at inland locations.

 Residential coal combustion is a significant source of airborne particulate matter, which has been linked to adverse health effects. This study investigates the in vitro toxicity (MTT, fluorometric intracellular ROS, flow cytometry, and FITC Annexin V) and the composition of PM10-bound organics (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of PM samples collected indoors and outdoors during coal combustion, as well as in the absence of the combustion source. Higher average PAH concentrations were detected indoors during coal burning, compared to outdoor and indoor concentrations without stove operation, with average levels over 8 and 10 times higher, respectively. PAHs with higher molecular weights constituted the largest amount of indoor PM10 samples, with indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene as the most abundant compound. Several compounds such as levoglucosan, phthalimide, oxidized Irgafos 168, phenyl compounds, dicarboxylic acids, and fatty acids exhibited lower concentrations or were absent in outdoor/background air but were prevalent during indoor coal burning. In vitro assays using A549 cells have shown that indoor samples collected during coal combustion induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. The cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the Gap 1 (G1) phase and a decrease in the S (DNA synthesis) phase, pointing towards cell cycle arrest. The FITC Annexin V assay showed a marked increase in necrotic cell populations, suggesting persistent DNA damage or failure in DNA repair that hinders replication and transcription. Cell viability showed strong negative correlations with several PM-bound organic compounds, including dicarboxylic acids (p < 0.01), phenolic compounds such as vanillin, vanillic acid, and syringic acid (p < 0.01), and resin acids, particularly dehydroabietic acid (p < 0.01). Cell cycle arrest was significantly correlated with PAHs (p < 0.01) and phytane (p < 0.01). ROS levels were also correlated with PAHs, including phenanthrene and p-terphenyl (p < 0.01), as well as with glyceridic compounds and dicarboxylic acids (p < 0.01).

 Reanalysis data, while widely used to study rainfall mechanisms, requires rigorous uncertainty assessment, especially over complex terrains such as the Sichuan Basin (SCB). This study evaluates the performance of ERA5 in capturing low-level winds associated with SCB nocturnal rainfall, using hourly wind profiles from four wind profiler radars. Analysis confirms key features of SCB rainfall dynamics previously identified using reanalysis and model outputs, including nocturnal flow enhancement over the Yungui Plateau (YGP) and its positive correlation with low-level vorticity in the SCB, which ERA5 generally reproduces. However, substantial discrepancies emerge between ERA5 and observations, particularly in the vertical structure of low-level winds. ERA5 underestimates the height of the maximum wind speed over the YGP while overestimating its magnitude. This creates distinct vertical wind structures during SCB nocturnal rainfall events: observations exhibit an elevated peak (“prominent nose”), whereas ERA5 shows a stronger but lower-altitude maximum (“flatter nose”). Correspondingly, ERA5 overestimates lower-level intensity of the circulation over SCB and fails to reproduce the observed increase in circulation with height. These vertical structure biases highlight limitations in ERA5's representation of terrain-modulated nocturnal flows, emphasizing that uncritical use of reanalysis may misrepresent key mechanisms driving SCB rainfall. Our results underscore the necessity for enhanced observational data collection and analysis to constrain uncertainties in reanalysis and model outputs, thereby improving their reliability for applications such as low-level aviation and wind energy assessment, particularly over complex terrains."

 The very intense Tropical Cyclone (TC) FREDDY has broken many records in the climatology of TCs in Mozambique. Among TCs of its kind, FREDDY has the longest lifetime, unprecedented travelled distance, singular trajectory, and multiple landfalls. This research aims to understand the role of southeastern Africa weather systems on the unusual behavior of FREDDY. For achieving this purpose, data from the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), such as, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), ocean heat content (OHC), mean sea level pressure (SLP), wind at different levels, and relative humidity were used, including historical TC tracks from 1857 to 2025. Different weather systems were synchronized with FREDDY's manifestation. Results indicate that FREDDY's lifetime was influenced by the combination of warm waters from the Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO), whose SSTs varied from 26.6 °C to 29.7 °C at the TC center, and the southern subtropical High Pressure Systems (HPS), which enhanced moisture to the cyclone in the continent, through its confluent winds at low levels. Besides, the Subtropical Jet Streams (SJS) had contributed to its singular trajectory, leading to multiple landfalls. The upper Trough and upper Ridge associated with the SJS, positioned respectively over the southern Africa and southern Madagascar, had determined the back-and-forth movement of FREDDY through the Mozambique Channel, hitting both countries, Mozambique and Madagascar. These findings provide important clues for cyclone monitoring at national and regional levels, and may help anticipate interventions for minimizing the negative impacts of future similar scenarios."

 Oxygen (δ18O) and nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) are reliable methods for tracing the formation pathways and sources of nitrate (NO3−) in the atmosphere, while neglecting of primary NO3− contributions from these isotopic approaches. Here, we collected PM2.5 in summer and winter in Tianjin, the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions, metal element, organic carbon, and elemental carbon, as well as the δ15N and δ18O values of NO3− in PM2.5 were measured. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed that primary NO3− accounted for 22.1 % of total NO3− in summer (14.5 % from biomass burning and 7.6 % from sea salt) and 24.8 % in winter (22.5 % from biomass burning and 2.3 % from dust), indicating that NO3− in PM2.5 in Tianjin is not solely derived from the secondary transformation of NOx. Notably, after correcting for primary NO3− contributions, the estimated contribution of the •OH oxidation pathway decreased by 22.4 % in summer and 21.3 % in winter. This suggests that disregarding primary NO3− may lead to an overestimation of the contribution of •OH pathway. Furthermore, the Bayesian isotope mixing (MixSIAR) model highlighted biomass burning as a major NO3− source in Tianjin, contributing over 20 % in summer and over 30 % in winter. Critically, failing to account for primary NO3− could result in a substantial underestimation the contribution of biomass burning. Our results demonstrated that primary NO3− was the important sources in PM2.5 in Tianjin, and neglecting primary NO3− could result in misestimation of formation pathways and sources of NO3− by isotopic methods."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most destructive weather phenomena, causing severe social and economic damage through extreme rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges. Wind and pressure fields, which define TCs’ structure and impact, are spatial variables whose accurate estimation is essential for improved analysis and prediction. However, high-precision observations are limited by cost and coverage, and numerical or reanalysis models are computationally intensive. Parametric models based on radial symmetry also struggle to represent the asymmetry and diversity of real TCs. This study proposes a random forest model that estimates TC pressure fields by learning the nonlinear relationship between wind and pressure. Trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, the model captures spatial patterns such as pressure asymmetry, land–sea contrasts, and shows high explanatory power and low error, especially for intense TCs and within the gale-force wind radius. Comparison with parametric and other data-driven models confirms its superior spatial accuracy. An experiment using satellite-based two-dimensional wind data demonstrates the model’s ability to estimate pressure fields from real time inputs, supporting its use in disaster response and early warning."

 Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have become the focus due to their physicochemical stability and potential toxicity. In this study, the investigation aimed to characterize the pollution levels, identify the primary sources, and assess the health risks associated with PFAS in PM2.5. The average concentration range for PFAS were between 46.68 and 181.63 pg m−3, with the main components being perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorobutanoic acid. PFAS concentrations in PM2.5 were greatly influenced by the short- and medium-range air masses, and markedly elevated by industrial activities in surrounding urban areas.

Waves were stronger and varied more in winter, while in summer slow waves tied to Earth's rotation dominated. We also observed new patterns in how energy is shared between both energy types and height-dependent changes in wave behaviour. These results refine our view of such waves. 
 We present the first multi-year study of gravity-wave (GW) kinetic Ekin and potential Epot energy spectra in the polar middle atmosphere, based on simultaneous temperature and horizontal-wind measurements by the Doppler Rayleigh–Mie–Raman lidar at the ALOMAR observatory (69° N, 16° E). The analysed 7 year dataset (2017–2023) comprises 61 soundings, each longer than 12 h, totalling 2036 h of observations between 35–60 km. Our results reveal a strong winter-summer contrast that depends on both frequency and vertical wavenumber: winter spectra exhibit significantly higher energies and greater variability, particularly at long periods, while summer spectra are marked by a distinct near-inertial peak, most pronounced in Ekin. We further reveal that the ratio of kinetic to potential energy depends systematically on frequency and vertical wavelength, with near-inertial, short-vertical-scale waves channelling a disproportionate share of energy into kinetic form, indicating that the two-dimensional GW spectrum cannot be treated as fully separable. Frequency spectra also show, for the first time, broken power laws at 35–40 km, merging into a single flatter power law with increasing altitude. These findings provide new constraints on the spectral energy budget at high latitudes in the middle atmosphere and deliver essential benchmarks for validating and improving GW parameterisations in climate and numerical weather prediction models."

By making these resources openly available, we aim to advance research on the shallow and deep Earth. 
 Surface wave dispersion curve inversion plays a critical role in both shallow geophysical exploration and deep geological studies, yet it remains hindered by sensitivity to initial models, susceptibility to local minima, and low computational efficiency. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods, inspired by their success in computer vision and natural language processing, have shown promising potential to overcome these challenges. However, the lack of large-scale and diverse benchmark datasets remains a major obstacle to the development and evaluation of such methods. To address this gap, we introduce OpenSWI, a comprehensive benchmark dataset generated through the Surface Wave Inversion Dataset Preparation (SWIDP) pipeline. OpenSWI comprises two synthetic datasets tailored to different research scales and application scenarios, namely OpenSWI-shallow and OpenSWI-deep, as well as an AI-ready real-world dataset for generalization evaluation, OpenSWI-real. OpenSWI-shallow is derived from the 2-D geological model dataset OpenFWI, containing over 22 million 1-D velocity profiles paired with their fundamental-mode phase and group velocity dispersion curves, spanning a broad spectrum of shallow geological structures (e.g., flat layers, faults, folds, and realistic stratigraphy). OpenSWI-deep is built from 14 global and regional 3-D geological models, comprising approximately 1.26 million high-fidelity 1-D velocity-dispersion data pairs for deep earth studies. OpenSWI-real, compiled from open-source projects, contains two sets of observed dispersion curves and their corresponding 1-D reference models, serving as a benchmark for evaluating the generalization of deep learning models. To demonstrate the utility of OpenSWI, we trained deep learning models on OpenSWI-shallow and OpenSWI-deep, and evaluated them on OpenSWI-real. The results show strong agreement between the predicted and reference velocity models, confirming the diversity and representativeness of the OpenSWI dataset.

However, progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree – a comprehensive global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3 million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and 21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M, a large subset for model pretraining, and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval, a benchmark for zero-shot and few-shot classification. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MUYang99/GlobalGeoTree, and the GlobalGeoTree dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yann111/GlobalGeoTree."

Lawless,A Python interface to the Fortran-based Parallel Data  Assimilation Framework: pyPDAF v1.0.2,"In this paper, we present pyPDAF, a Python interface to the parallel data assimilation framework (PDAF) allowing for coupling with Python-based models. We demonstrate the capability and efficiency of pyPDAF under a coupled data assimilation setup. 
 Data assimilation (DA) is an essential component of numerical weather and climate prediction. Efficient implementation of DA algorithms benefits both research and operational prediction. Currently, a variety of DA software programs are available. One of the notable DA libraries is the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF) designed for ensemble data assimilation. The DA framework is widely used with complex high-dimensional climate models, and is applied for research on atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and marine ecosystem modelling, as well as operational ocean forecasting. Meanwhile, there are increasing demands for flexible and efficient DA implementations using Python due to the increasing amount of intermediate complexity models as well as machine learning based models coded in Python. To accommodate for such demands, we introduce a Python interface to PDAF, pyPDAF. pyPDAF allows for flexible DA system development while retaining the efficient implementation of the core DA algorithms in the Fortran-based PDAF. The ideal use-case of pyPDAF is a DA system where the model integration is independent from the DA program, which reads the model forecast ensemble, produces an analysis, and updates the restart files of the model, or a DA system where the model can be used in Python. With implementations of both PDAF and pyPDAF, this study demonstrates the use of pyPDAF and PDAF in a coupled data assimilation (CDA) setup in a coupled atmosphere-ocean model, the Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM). This study demonstrates that pyPDAF allows for PDAF functionalities from Python where users can utilise Python functions to handle case-specific information from observations and numerical model. The study also shows that pyPDAF can be used with high-dimensional systems with little slow-down per analysis step of only up to 13 % for the localized ensemble Kalman filter LETKF in the example used in this study. The study also shows that, compared to PDAF, the overhead of pyPDAF is comparatively smaller when computationally intensive components dominate the DA system. This can be the case for systems with high-dimensional state vectors."

MacLeod;Siddhartha Mitra;Julio Sepúlveda,Sunburned plankton: ultraviolet radiation inhibition of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the Community Earth System Model version 2,"We have developed a new feature in the atmosphere and ocean components of the Community Earth System Model version 2 by implementing ultraviolet (UV) radiation inhibition of photosynthesis of four marine phytoplankton functional groups represented in the Marine Biogeochemistry Library. The new feature is tested with varying levels of UV radiation, and it will enable an analysis of an asteroid impact’s effect on the ozone layer and how that affects the base of the marine food web. 
 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can damage DNA and kill cells. We use laboratory and observational studies of the harmful effect of UV radiation on marine photosynthesizers to inform the implementation of a UV radiation damage function for phytoplankton photosynthesis in a modified version of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2-UVphyto). CESM2-UVphyto is capable of simulating UV inhibition of photosynthesis among modeled phytoplankton and ocean column penetration of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C radiation. We conduct a series of simulations with CESM2-UVphyto using the Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL) ecosystem model to understand the sensitivity of phytoplankton productivity to UV radiation.  Results from the simulations indicate that increased UV radiation shifts the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and productivity deeper into the column, causes a moderate decline in total global productivity, and changes phytoplankton community structure. Our new CESM2-UVphyto model configuration can be used to quantify the potential ocean biogeochemical and ecosystem impacts resulting from events that disturb the stratospheric ozone layer, such as an asteroid impact, a volcanic eruption, a nuclear war, and stratospheric-aerosol-injection-based geoengineering."

Thanks to a new coordinate system which tracks the trajectories and a change of the time variable, our scheme combines the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes: no numerical diffusion and no dilution of tracers. Our model is so fast that it is easy to optimize its parameters. Our model is made available to the ice sheet community as an easy to use open-source software coded in python. 
 Numerical age models are useful tools for investigating the age of the ice in an ice sheet. They can be used to date ice cores or to interpret isochronal horizons which are observed by radar instruments. Here, we present a new numerical age model for a flow line of an ice sheet. The assumption here is that the geometry of the flow line and the velocity shape functions are steady (i.e. constant in time). A time-varying factor can only be applied to the surface accumulation rates and basal melting rates. Our model uses an innovative logarithmic flux coordinate system (π, θ), previously published, which is suitable for solving transport equations because it tracks ice trajectories. Using this coordinate system, solving the age equation is simple, fast and accurate, because the trajectories of ice particles pass exactly through the nodes of the grid. Our numerical scheme, called Eulerian-Lagrangian, therefore combines the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. We present an application of this model to the flow line going from Dome C to the Beyond EPICA Little Dome C drill site and show that horizontal flow is a non-negligible factor which should be considered when modelling the age-depth relationship of the Beyond EPICA ice core. The code we developed for age modelling along a flow tube is named age_flow_line-1.0 and is freely available under an open-source license."

Anthony;Adina Paytan,Development of a model framework for terrestrial carbon flux prediction: the Regional Carbon and Climate Analytics Tool (RCCAT) applied to non-tidal wetlands,"Wetlands absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), helping slow climate change, but they also release methane, a potent warming gas. We developed a collection of AI-based models to estimate magnitudes of CO2 and methane exchanged between the land and the atmosphere, for wetlands on a regional scale. This approach helps to inform land-use planning, restoration, and greenhouse gas accounting, while also creating a foundation for future advancements in prediction accuracy. 
 Wetlands play a pivotal role in carbon sequestration but emit methane (CH4), creating uncertainty in their net climate impact. Although process-based models offer mechanistic insights into wetland dynamics, they require extensive site-specific parameterisation (e.g. soil carbon profiles, pore-water chemistry, vegetation-specific model parameters), as well as high-resolution hydrological and meteorological inputs that are often difficult to obtain outside of well-instrumented research sites, which makes regional upscaling challenging. In contrast, data-driven models provide a scalable alternative by leveraging available datasets to identify patterns and relationships, making them more adaptable for large-scale applications. However, their performance can vary significantly depending on the quality and representativeness of the data, as well as the model design, which raises questions about their reliability and generalizability in complex wetland systems. To address these issues, we present a data-driven framework for upscaling wetland CO2 and CH4 emissions, across a range of machine learning models that vary in complexity, validated against an extensive observational dataset from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. We show that artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, including Random Forests, gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU, LSTM), outperform linear regression models, with RNNs standing out, achieving an R2 of 0.73 for daily CO2 flux predictions compared to 0.64 for linear regression, and an R2 of 0.53 for CH4 flux predictions compared to 0.47 for linear regression. Interestingly, linear regression performed better than random forest for methane flux, which highlights the necessity for comparison. The, interannual variability is less well captured, with annual mean absolute error of 176 gC m−2 yr−1 for CO2 fluxes and 9 gC-CH4 m−2 yr−1  for CH4 fluxes. By integrating vertically-resolved atmospheric, subsurface, and spectral reflectance information from readily available sources, the model identifies key drivers of wetland CO2 and CH4 emissions and enables regional upscaling. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI methods for upscaling, providing practical tools for wetland management and restoration planning to support climate mitigation efforts."

Our algorithms are optimized for modern super computers, enabling efficient large-scale weather simulations. A key innovation is the model's inherent differentiable nature, allowing seamless integration with AI systems to enhance predictive capabilities through machine learning techniques. 
 This study presents the High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE), an automatically differentiable, non-oscillatory finite-volume dynamical core for shallow water equations on the cubed-sphere grid. HOPE integrates five key features: (1) arbitrary high-order accuracy through genuine two-dimensional reconstruction schemes; (2) essential non-oscillation via adaptive polynomial order reduction in discontinuous regions; (3) exact mass conservation inherited from finite-volume discretization; (4) automatically differentiable and (5) GPU-native scalability through PyTorch-based implementation. Another innovation is the development of a two-way coupled ghost cell interpolation method. This approach incorporates information from adjacent panels on both sides of the boundary, thereby overcoming the integration instability inherent in one-sided ghost cell interpolation approaches when using high-order reconstruction. Leveraging the linear operator nature of this interpolation scheme, we optimized its computation: information exchange across the panel boundary is achieved through a single matrix-vector multiplication instead of iterative coupling, without accuracy loss. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of HOPE: The 11th-order scheme reduces errors to near double-precision round-off levels in steady-state geostrophic flow tests on coarse grids. Maintenance of Rossby–Haurwitz waves over 100 simulation days without crashing. A cylindrical dam-break test case confirms the genuinely two-dimensional WENO scheme exhibits significantly better isotropy compared to dimension-by-dimension approaches. Moreover, normalized conservation errors in total energy, total potential enstrophy, and total zonal angular momentum significantly reduce with increasing order of the reconstruction scheme. Two implementations are developed: a Fortran version for convergence analysis and a PyTorch version leveraging automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration. The PyTorch implementation maps reconstruction and quadrature operation to 2D convolution and Einstein summation respectively, achieving about 2× speedup on single NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU versus Dual Intel E5-2699v4 CPUs execution. This design enables seamless coupling with neural network parameterizations, positioning HOPE as a foundational tool for next-generation differentiable atmosphere models."

They are typically forced remotely or locally by variations in equatorial or alongshore winds, respectively. We use an extensive in‐situ data set to show that sea surface salinity (SSS) changes can also act as a local forcing that amplifies these extreme warm and cold events by altering the water column stratification and consequently the impact of subsurface mixing. The mixed layer turbulent heat loss during an extreme warm episode with unusually low SSS in 1995 is nearly 3× lower than during a cold event with high SSS in 1997. We also demonstrate that interannual turbulent heat flux variability in early boreal spring off Angola is strongly impacted by salt advection fluctuations, and that this turbulent mixing is significant for altering mixed layer temperatures and restoring its salinities."

We augment traditional single‐beam bubble detection methods by utilizing all five beams of the ADCP to achieve broader spatial coverage of bubble plume measurements.

Field measurements in the Yangtze Delta captured synchronous tidal‐induced pore pressure fluctuations and soil strain responses, demonstrating consistent linear stress–strain behavior from which depth‐resolved constrained moduli were derived. This tidal‐driven method effectively identifies subtle mechanical contrasts and meter‐scale interlayers with anomalously high or low stiffness, and enables continuous, long‐term monitoring of temporal and seasonal changes in soil stiffness.

The QBWO_SCS modulates marine boundary layer jets (MBLJs) embedded in the southwesterly monsoon flow during June, the late Meiyu season. During the first half cycle from Phase 1 (P1) to Phase 2 (P2), convection is most suppressed over the SCS in P2, while enhanced convective activity is observed within the Meiyu trough over southeastern China. An anomalous low‐level anticyclonic circulation over the SCS leads to increased (decreased) MBLJ frequency over the northern (southern) SCS, and these anomalies reverse in Phase 4 (P4). In P2, QBWO_SCS‐intensified MBLJs near the southeastern coast of China create favorable conditions for heavy inland rainfall. First, strengthened southwesterly MBLJs enhance moisture transport from the SCS to inland southeast China and increase moisture convergence within the Meiyu trough. Second, warm, moist air advected inland meets continental cold air, enhancing baroclinicity and frontogenesis, which strongly correlates with inland rainfall maxima. Third, the topography of southeast China amplifies rainfall through orographic lifting as moisture‐laden MBLJs impinge on elevated terrain. In contrast, during P4, weakened MBLJs reduce moisture transport, convergence, and frontogenesis, leading to diminished inland rainfall. Meanwhile, QBWO_SCS‐induced convection‐coupled circulation in P4 supports monsoon trough development and enhances heavy precipitation over coastal south China, the northern SCS, and southern Taiwan. About 25% of QBWOs over SCS are positively correlated with low‐level cyclonic flow originating from QBWOs over the tropical western Pacific, 10% are weakly modulated by the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation, and 65% are caused by other processes."

However, the coarse spatial resolution of Earth system models, such as the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM), limits their ability to resolve fine‐scale ice features that are critical for safe Arctic navigation. To address the limitation, we implement a dynamical downscaling approach in a case study covering the 2023 autumn freeze‐up season. Specifically, a NorCPM hindcast provides atmospheric forcing for the regional coupled ocean‐sea ice model, the Norwegian High‐resolution pan‐Arctic ocean, and sea ice Prediction System (NorHAPS), which produces high‐resolution (3–5 km) hindcasts of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC). The downscaled SIC predictions show improved performance throughout the prediction period with particularly notable reductions in the overestimation bias along the Northeast and Northwest Passages prior to mid‐to‐late October especially in marginal ice zones. Furthermore, NorHAPS provides a more accurate representation of local discontinuities and fine‐scale sea ice structures in key regions of the Arctic passages, such as the Laptev Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Beaufort Sea. These improvements are associated with a more realistic simulation of sea ice freeze‐up processes, which mitigates the premature freezing found in NorCPM outputs. Overall, our results demonstrate that dynamical downscaling is a viable method for refining the outputs of coarse‐resolution climate models. This approach generates detailed sea ice predictions, which can support safe Arctic maritime operations."

 Densely substituted aromatic rings are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals1. For making aromatic molecules, aryne intermediates have synthetic potential that rivals most functional groups2. They readily react with nucleophiles, participate in pericyclic reactions, and activate inert σ-bonds. Despite their potential, arynes are currently used by a specialized community for mainly niche applications. The lack of widespread adoption of arynes is due to the undesirable means to generate them. Here, we report the design of an aryne precursor to overcome this prohibitive barrier. Readily available carboxylic acids are derivatized in a single step to a make a precursor which is then activated by blue light or by heat. Dozens of previously unknown aminated arynes, including pyridynes, are generated in this work, opening the door to drug discovery using aryne intermediates. We envision that future development of this precursor platform will allow even more decorated arynes to be accessed, further expanding the reach of aryne chemistry."

 The amplification of extremely short laser pulses (under 100 fs) presents a fundamental challenge due to the trade-off between amplification bandwidth, efficiency and gain1. Conventional methods rely on complex optical set-ups with preprocessing and postprocessing steps2. Optical parametric amplification3 offers a high optical gain that scales with the length of the nonlinear medium at the expense of bandwidth, limiting its effectiveness for extremely short and intrinsically broadband ultrashort pulses, whose amplification requires a broad gain–bandwidth, high single-pass gain and simultaneously strong nonlinear interaction. Here we introduce a new multipass4 optical parametric amplification system that leverages dispersion-engineered dielectric mirrors to repeatedly focus the laser into a nonlinear gain crystal. The coatings simultaneously compensate for the group delay5 after each multipass step and suppress the idler wave and, therefore, backconversion. This approach achieves ×1,500 higher gain compared with single-pass amplification, a photon conversion efficiency of up to 81% (52% system conversion efficiency) and near Fourier-limited time–bandwidth products of the amplified pulses, while fully preserving the spatial beam quality. Our concept breaks the gain versus bandwidth barrier and achieves 12 THz at 41 dB gain. As our concept does not require specific gain materials, it is versatile and broadly applicable to ultrafast6 laser systems in quantum technologies7–9, attosecond physics10–12, material processing and ultrabroadband low-cost bio-imaging systems13,14.

 Emerging evidence indicates that cancer cells are susceptible to ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is triggered by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation1–3. Despite broad enthusiasm about harnessing ferroptosis as a novel anti-cancer strategy, whether ferroptosis is a barrier to tumorigenesis and can be leveraged therapeutically remains unknown4,5. Here, using genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma, we performed tumour-specific loss-of-function studies of two key ferroptosis suppressors, GPX46,7 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)8,9, and observed increased lipid peroxidation and robust suppression of tumorigenesis, suggesting that lung tumours are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Furthermore, across multiple pre-clinical models, we found that FSP1 was required for ferroptosis protection in vivo, but not in vitro, underscoring a heightened need to buffer lipid peroxidation under physiological conditions. Lipidomic analyses revealed that Fsp1-knockout tumours had an accumulation of lipid peroxides, and inhibition of ferroptosis with genetic, dietary or pharmacological approaches effectively restored the growth of Fsp1-knockout tumours in vivo. Unlike GPX4, expression of FSP1 (also known as AIFM2) was prognostic for disease progression and poorer survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic target. To this end, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FSP1 had significant therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical lung cancer models. Our studies highlight the importance of ferroptosis suppression in vivo and pave the way for FSP1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer. The ferroptosis suppressor protein FSP1 has a critical role in ferroptosis protection of tumours across multiple in vivo models and is linked to worse prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in lung cancer."

 The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly interconnected membrane network that serves as a central site for protein synthesis and maturation1. A crucial subset of ER-associated transcripts, termed secretome mRNAs, encode secretory, lumenal and integral membrane proteins, representing nearly one-third of human protein-coding genes1. Unlike cytosolic mRNAs, secretome mRNAs undergo co-translational translocation, and thus require precise coordination between translation and protein insertion2,3. Disruption of this process, such as through altered elongation rates4, activates stress response pathways that impede cellular growth, raising the question of whether secretome translation is spatially organized to ensure fidelity. Here, using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that secretome mRNA translation is preferentially localized to ER junctions that are enriched with the structural protein lunapark and in close proximity to lysosomes. Lunapark depletion reduced ribosome density and translation efficiency of secretome mRNAs near lysosomes, an effect that was dependent on eIF2-mediated initiation and was reversed by the integrated stress response inhibitor ISRIB. Lysosome-associated translation was further modulated by nutrient status: amino acid deprivation enhanced lysosome-proximal translation, whereas lysosomal pH neutralization suppressed it. These findings identify a mechanism by which ER junctional proteins and lysosomal activity cooperatively pattern secretome mRNA translation, linking ER architecture and nutrient sensing to the production of secretory and membrane proteins.

 Phylogenetics has a central role in evolutionary biology and genomic epidemiology1. Assessing phylogenetic confidence and reliability is therefore crucial and the methods that do this, such as those derived from Felsenstein’s bootstrap2, are among the most widely used in modern science. However, these methods require enormous computational capacity, and are unsuitable for large datasets. Furthermore, most of these methods emerge from a focus on the membership of clades (groupings of taxa), which makes their results difficult to interpret in the context of genomic epidemiology. Here we propose subtree pruning and regrafting-based tree assessment (SPRTA), an efficient and interpretable approach to assess confidence in phylogenetic trees. SPRTA shifts the paradigm of phylogenetic support measurement from evaluating the confidence in clades to evolution histories and phylogenetic placement—for example, assessing whether a lineage evolved from another considered lineage, which is particularly valuable in genomic epidemiology. We use SPRTA to investigate a global public SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree relating more than two million genomes, highlighting plausible alternative evolutionary origins of many SARS-CoV-2 variants, assessing reliability in the Pango outbreak lineage classification system3, and demonstrating the effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on inferred mutation rates. Our results show that SPRTA enables pandemic-scale and detailed probabilistic assessment of transmission and mutational histories.

We demonstrated innovative smart textiles derived from those fabrics, including an active ventilation fabric for personal moisture management, an integrated conformable gripper for handling objects of varying shapes and stiffness, and a compact remote-controllable haptic finger glove that replicates the sensation of fabric hardness and smoothness.

 Neurodevelopmental disorders that cause cognitive, behavioural or motor impairments affect around 15% of children and adolescents worldwide1, with diagnoses of profound autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder increasing in the USA and contributing to a major economic burden2,3. Yet the origins and mechanisms of these conditions remain poorly understood, limiting progress in therapies. Comprehensive cell atlases of the developing human brain, alongside those of model organisms such as mice and non-human primates, are now providing high-resolution measures of gene expression, cell-type abundance and spatial distribution. In this Perspective, we highlight recent studies that have identified novel developmental cell populations, revealed conserved and divergent patterns of cell genesis, migration and maturation across species, and begun testing hypotheses that link them to processes ranging from transcriptional control of cell fate specification to the emergence of complex behaviours. We present remaining conceptual and technical challenges and provide an outlook on how further studies of human and mammalian brain development can empower a deeper understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Future efforts expanding to additional developmental stages, including adolescence, as well as whole-brain, multimodal and cross-species integration, will yield new insights into how development shapes the brain. These atlases promise to serve as essential references for unravelling mechanisms of brain function and disease vulnerability, and for advancing precision medicine.

 Ferroptosis has emerged as an actionable target to eliminate therapy-resistant and metastatic cancers1. However, which ferroptosis surveillance systems may offer a therapeutic window to leverage redox maladaptation in cancer remains unclear. In melanoma, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) impedes ferroptosis during haematogenous metastasis, but is dispensable during lymphatic metastasis2. Here, using a metastatic mouse melanoma model selected for lymph node metastasis, we show that lymph-node-derived metastatic cells exhibit markedly diminished expression of glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCLC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels relative to their parental counterparts. This metabolic shift occurs within the hypoxic lymphatic niche. Under comparable low-oxygen conditions, GPX4 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In response, lymph node metastatic cells acquire increased reliance on ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), which is localized with perinuclear lysosomes. These findings reveal that the reduced reliance on the GPX4 axis enables melanoma cells to shift toward FSP1 dependency. Notably, intratumoural monotherapy with selective FSP1 inhibitors (viFSP1 and FSEN1) effectively suppresses melanoma growth in lymph nodes, but not in subcutaneous tumours, emphasizing a microenvironment-specific dependency on FSP1. Thus, targeting FSP1 in the lymph nodes holds strong potential for blocking melanoma progression. Targeting FSP1 in lymph nodes has considerable potential for blocking melanoma progression."

 Computer vision is central to many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, from autonomous vehicles to consumer devices. However, the data behind such technical innovations are often collected with insufficient consideration of ethical concerns1–3. This has led to a reliance on datasets that lack diversity, perpetuate biases and are collected without the consent of data rights holders. These datasets compromise the fairness and accuracy of AI models and disenfranchise stakeholders4–8. Although awareness of the problems of bias in computer vision technologies, particularly facial recognition, has become widespread9, the field lacks publicly available, consensually collected datasets for evaluating bias for most tasks3,10,11. In response, we introduce the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced ‘Feebee’), a publicly available human image dataset implementing best practices for consent, privacy, compensation, safety, diversity and utility. FHIBE can be used responsibly as a fairness evaluation dataset for many human-centric computer vision tasks, including pose estimation, person segmentation, face detection and verification, and visual question answering. By leveraging comprehensive annotations capturing demographic and physical attributes, environmental factors, instrument and pixel-level annotations, FHIBE can identify a wide variety of biases. The annotations also enable more nuanced and granular bias diagnoses, enabling practitioners to better understand sources of bias and mitigate potential downstream harms. FHIBE therefore represents an important step forward towards trustworthy AI, raising the bar for fairness benchmarks and providing a road map for responsible data curation in AI.

 Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause, typically affecting individuals aged 50–60 years and leading to death within a decade1–3. It is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) composed of fibrillar α-synuclein (aSyn)4–8, the formation of which shows parallels with prion propagation9,10. While fibrils extracted from brains of individuals with MSA have been structurally characterized11, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned12, and their ability to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B13,14, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice15—suggesting direct relevance to MSA—but lacks scrutiny at the atomic scale. Here we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Notably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from patients with MSA11. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B. Our findings identify 1B as a synthetic pathogen capable of self-replication in vivo and reveal structural features of 1B and 1BP that may underlie MSA pathology, offering insights for therapeutic strategies.

 Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, play a defining role in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1. The microglial response to amyloid plaques in AD can range from neuroprotective to neurotoxic2. Here we show that the protective function of microglia is governed by the transcription factor PU.1, which becomes downregulated following microglial contact with plaques. Lowering PU.1 expression in microglia reduces the severity of amyloid disease pathology in mice and is linked to the expression of immunoregulatory lymphoid receptor proteins, particularly CD28, a surface receptor that is critical for T cell activation3,4. Microglia-specific deficiency in CD28, which is expressed by a small subset of plaque-associated PU.1low microglia, promotes a broad inflammatory microglial state that is associated with increased amyloid plaque load. Our findings indicate that PU.1low CD28-expressing microglia may operate as suppressive microglia that mitigate the progression of AD by reducing the severity of neuroinflammation. This role of CD28 and potentially other lymphoid co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptor proteins in governing microglial responses in AD points to possible immunotherapy approaches for treating the disease by promoting protective microglial functions.

 Despite the central role of antibodies in modern medicine, no method currently exists to design novel, epitope-specific antibodies entirely in silico. Instead, antibody discovery currently relies on immunization, random library screening or the isolation of antibodies directly from patients1. Here we demonstrate that combining computational protein design using a fine-tuned RFdiffusion2 network with yeast display screening enables the de novo generation of antibody variable heavy chains (VHHs), single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and full antibodies that bind to user-specified epitopes with atomic-level precision. We experimentally characterize VHH binders to four disease-relevant epitopes. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose of designed VHHs targeting influenza haemagglutinin and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). A high-resolution structure of the influenza-targeting VHH confirms atomic accuracy of the designed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Although initial computational designs exhibit modest affinity (tens to hundreds of nanomolar Kd), affinity maturation using OrthoRep3 enables production of single-digit nanomolar binders that maintain the intended epitope selectivity. We further demonstrate the de novo design of scFvs to TcdB and a PHOX2B peptide–MHC complex by combining designed heavy-chain and light-chain CDRs. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose for two distinct TcdB scFvs, with high-resolution data for one design verifying the atomically accurate design of the conformations of all six CDR loops. Our approach establishes a framework for the computational design, screening and characterization of fully de novo antibodies with atomic-level precision in both structure and epitope targeting. The combination of computational design, laboratory-based screening and biophysical validation enables the de novo generation of variable heavy-chain antibody fragments and antibodies that precisely target chosen disease-related molecules."

 The human neocortex is composed of diverse cell types1 that are generated during development according to spatially and temporally organized programmes initiated by neural stem cells2–5. Despite the growing number of studies that have captured snapshots of gene expression of single cells along the axis of differentiation and maturation, the underlying map of lineage relationships that link individual progenitor cells to specific subtypes of neurons and glia remains unknown, especially in humans. Here we applied prospective lineage tracing to map the manifold of human neural stem and progenitor cell differentiation across the developmental window encompassing neurogenesis and gliogenesis in human primary tissue. By profiling the clonal output of 6,402 progenitor cells, we created a lineage-resolved map of human cortical development. Here we show that cortical progenitors switch from glutamatergic to GABAergic (involving γ-aminobutyric acid) neurogenesis around midgestation, which coincides with an onset of oligodendrocyte generation. Additionally, we find that truncated radial glia maintain a glutamatergic neurogenic potential for a protracted period during human cortical development. Unexpectedly, we find that late-born glutamatergic neurons derived from truncated radial glia exhibit molecular features of deep cortical layer neurons and may contribute to the expansion of the subplate region during midgestation. Lineage tracing in human tissue samples from gestational weeks 16 to 24 provides insight into lineage relationships between cortical cell types and shows a switch in progenitor output from glutamatergic to GABAergic neurons."

 The mammalian cortex is composed of a highly diverse set of cell types and develops through a series of temporally regulated events1–3. Single-cell transcriptomics enables a systematic study of cell types across the entire timeline of cortical development. Here we present a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and epigenomic cell-type atlas of the developing mouse visual cortex. The atlas is built from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 568,654 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes and a single-nucleus Multiome dataset of 200,061 high-quality nuclei, which were densely sampled across the embryonic and postnatal developmental stages (from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56). We computationally reconstructed a transcriptomic developmental trajectory map of all excitatory, inhibitory and non-neuronal cell types in the visual cortex. Branching points that mark the emergence of new cell types at specific developmental ages and molecular signatures of cellular diversification are identified. The trajectory map shows that neurogenesis, gliogenesis and early postmitotic maturation in the embryonic stage give rise to all cell classes and nearly all subclasses in a staggered parallel manner. Increasingly refined cell types emerge throughout the postnatal differentiation process, including the late emergence of many cell types during the eye-opening stage and the onset of critical period, suggesting that there is continuous cell-type diversification at different stages of cortical development. Throughout development, there are cooperative dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in specific cell types. We identify cell-type-specific and temporally resolved gene regulatory networks that link transcription factors and downstream target genes through accessible chromatin motifs. Collectively, our study provides a detailed dynamic molecular map directly associated with individual cell types and specific temporal events that can reveal the molecular logic underlying the complex and multifaceted cortical cell type and circuit development.

 As a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) activates heterotrimeric G proteins by opening the Gα α-helical domain (AHD) to enable GDP–GTP exchange, with GDP release representing the rate-limiting step1,2. Here, using pharmacological assays, we show that agonist efficacy correlates with decreased GDP affinity, promoting GTP exchange, whereas antagonists increase GDP affinity, dampening activation. Further investigating this phenomenon, we provide 8 unique structural models and 16 cryogenic electron microscopy maps of MOR with naloxone or loperamide, capturing several intermediate conformations along the activation pathway. These include four GDP-bound states with previously undescribed receptor–G protein interfaces, AHD arrangements and transitions in the nucleotide-binding pocket required for GDP release. Naloxone stalls MOR in a ‘latent’ state, whereas loperamide promotes an ‘engaged’ state, which is structurally poised for opening of the AHD domain and subsequent GDP release. These findings, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, identify GDP-bound intermediates and AHD conformations as key determinants of nucleotide exchange rates, providing structural and mechanistic insights into G protein activation and ligand efficacy with broad implications for G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology.

 Mammalian brains vary in size, structure and function, but the extent to which evolutionarily novel cell types contribute to this variation remains unresolved1–4. Previous studies suggest that there is a primate-specific population of striatal inhibitory interneurons—the TAC3 interneurons5. However, broader taxonomic and developmental characterization is required to address novelty in cell-type evolution. Here we examine gene expression in inhibitory neurons across 10 mammalian species, spanning 160 million years of divergence from primates. We find that the initial class of newborn TAC3 interneurons specified during development represents an ancestral, medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived striatal population that is also present in pig and ferret cortex. This discovery prompted a re-examination of Glires, including mice, which are thought to lack the TAC3 type5,6. Targeted enrichment of MGE precursors in mice revealed conservation of the TAC3 initial class, camouflaged by reduced expression of Tac2 (the mouse orthologue of TAC3) and a gain of Th expression. Extending our analysis to the adult striatum further supported the homology of primate TAC3 and mouse Th striatal interneurons, and also uncovered a rare Tac2 subpopulation in the mouse ventromedial striatum. This study suggests that initial classes of telencephalic inhibitory neurons are largely conserved, and that during evolution, neuronal types in the mammalian brain change through redistribution and fate refinement, rather than by derivation of novel precursors early in development. An analysis of cell-type diversity in brain samples from a variety of mammalian species, both during development and in adult animals, reveals that the TAC3 initial class of striatal interneurons is conserved across placental mammals and is homologous to Th striatal interneurons in rodents."

 Receptor signalling determines cellular responses and is crucial for defining specific biological outcomes. In legume root cells, highly similar and structurally conserved chitin and Nod factor receptor kinases activate immune or symbiotic pathways, respectively, when chitinous ligands are perceived1. Here we show that specific amino acid residues in the intracellular part of the Nod factor receptor NFR1 control signalling specificity and enable the distinction of immune and symbiotic responses. Functional investigation of CERK6, NFR1 and receptor variants thereof revealed a conserved motif that we term Symbiosis Determinant 1 in the juxtamembrane region of the kinase domain, which is key for symbiotic signalling. We show that two residues in Symbiosis Determinant 1 are indispensable hallmarks of NFR1-type receptors and are sufficient to convert Lotus CERK6 and barley RLK4 kinase outputs to enable symbiotic signalling in Lotus japonicus. An investigation of plant receptor-like kinases identifies regions of these proteins that control whether immune or symbiotic signalling pathways are activated, with minimal changes to specific residues in one of these regions being sufficient to alter signalling specificity."

 The central Southern Cone of South America was one of the last regions of the globe to become inhabited by people1, and remains under-represented in studies of ancient DNA. Here we report genome-wide data from 238 ancient individuals spanning ten millennia. The oldest, from the Pampas region and dating to 10,000 years before present (bp), had distinct genetic affinity to Middle Holocene Southern Cone individuals, showing that differentiation from the central Andes and central east Brazil had begun by this time. Individuals dating to 4,600–150 bp primarily descended from a previously unsampled deep lineage of which the earliest representative is an individual dating to around 8,500 bp. This central Argentina lineage co-existed with two other lineages during the Mid-Holocene and, within central Argentina, this ancestry persisted for thousands of years with little evidence of inter-regional migration. Central Argentina ancestry was involved in three distinct gene flows: it mixed into the Pampas by 3,300 bp and seemingly became the main component there after 800 bp, with central Andes ancestry in northwest Argentina, and with tropical and subtropical forest ancestry in the Gran Chaco. In northwest Argentina, there was an increased rate of close-kin unions by 1,000 bp, paralleling the pattern in the central Andes. In the Paraná River region, a 400 bp individual with a Guaraní archaeological association clusters with Brazilian groups, consistent with Guaraní presence by this time.

 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide1. Here, in the Breast Cancer-Anti-Progestin Prevention Study 1 (BC-APPS1; 
              NCT02408770
              
            ), we assessed whether progesterone receptor antagonism with ulipristal acetate for 12 weeks reduces surrogate markers of breast cancer risk in 24 premenopausal women. We used multilayered OMICs and live-cell approaches as readouts for molecular features alongside clinical imaging and tissue micromechanics correlates. Ulipristal acetate reduced epithelial proliferation (Ki67) and the proportion, proliferation and colony formation capacity of luminal progenitor cells, the putative cell of origin of aggressive breast cancers2. MRI scans showed reduction in fibroglandular volume with treatment, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, histology and atomic force microscopy identified extracellular matrix remodelling with reduced collagen organization and tissue stiffness. Collagen VI was the most significantly downregulated protein after ulipristal acetate treatment, and we uncovered an unanticipated spatial association between collagen VI and SOX9high luminal progenitor cell localization, establishing a link between collagen organization and luminal progenitor activity. Culture of primary human breast epithelial cells in a stiff environment increased luminal progenitor activity, which was antagonized by anti-progestin therapy, strengthening this mechanistic link. This study offers a template for biologically informed early-phase therapeutic cancer prevention trials and demonstrates the potential for premenopausal breast cancer prevention with progesterone receptor antagonists through stromal remodelling and luminal progenitor suppression. Results of an early-phase breast cancer prevention trial demonstrate the potential for breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women with anti-progestin therapy by inducing epithelial–stromal remodelling and suppression of luminal progenitors."

 In human neuroimaging, brain atlases are essential for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs) and comparing subjects in a common coordinate frame. State-of-the-art atlases derived from histology1–3 provide exquisite three-dimensional cytoarchitectural maps but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain: that is, the likelihood of each location belonging to a given ROI. Here we present NextBrain, a probabilistic histological atlas of the whole human brain. We developed artificial intelligence-enabled methods to align roughly 10,000 histological sections from five whole brain hemispheres into three-dimensional volumes and to produce delineations for 333 ROIs on these sections. We also created a companion Bayesian tool for automatic segmentation of these ROIs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We showcase two applications of the atlas: segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of Alzheimer’s disease using in vivo MRI. We publicly release raw and aligned data, an online visualization tool, the atlas, the segmentation tool, and ground truth delineations for a high-resolution ex vivo hemisphere used in validation. By enabling researchers worldwide to automatically analyse brain MRIs at a higher level of granularity, NextBrain holds promise to increase the specificity of findings and accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.

 The ability to spatially map multiple layers of omics information across developmental timepoints enables exploration of the mechanisms driving brain development1, differentiation, arealization and disease-related alterations. Here we used spatial tri-omic sequencing, including spatial ATAC–RNA–protein sequencing and spatial CUT&Tag–RNA–protein sequencing, alongside multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging (co-detection by indexinng (CODEX)) to map dynamic spatial remodelling during brain development and neuroinflammation. We generated a spatiotemporal tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P21 and compared corresponding regions with the human developing brain. In the cortex, we identified temporal persistence and spatial spreading of chromatin accessibility for a subset of layer-defining transcription factors. In the corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes across subregions and identified a role for layer-specific projection neurons in coordinating axonogenesis and myelination. In a lysolecithin neuroinflammation mouse model, we detected molecular programs shared with developmental processes. Microglia exhibited both conserved and distinct programs for inflammation and resolution, with transient activation observed not only at the lesion core but also at distal locations. Overall, this study reveals common and differential mechanisms underlying brain development and neuroinflammation, providing a rich resource for investigating brain development, function and disease.

 Lithospheric thin zones, such as recently failed rifts, are generally assumed to be weak spots where magmatism and deformation can concentrate during rifting and large igneous province development1–3. Yet, the Turkana Depression in East Africa, the site of the failed 66-million-year-old Anza Rift, did not experience the widespread flood magmatism seen on the adjacent Ethiopian Plateau, despite being a lithospheric thin spot when the region encountered hot plume material around 45 million years ago4. Here we jointly invert surface-wave and receiver function data to constrain crustal and upper-mantle seismic structure below the Depression to evaluate lithospheric thermo-mechanical modification. Evidence for thick lower crustal intrusions, ubiquitous below the uplifted Ethiopian Plateau5,6, is comparatively lacking below the Depression’s failed Anza Rift system, which ongoing East African rifting is circumnavigating, not exploiting. The mantle lithosphere below the Depression has also retained its cool, fast-wavespeed ‘lid’ character, contrasting the Ethiopian Plateau. Volatile depletion during failed Anza rifting probably rendered the thinned lithosphere refractory without later rejuvenation. Subsequent rifting and magmatism thus initiated away from the still-thin Anza Rift, in regions where fertile lithosphere enabled melting and the sufficient lowering of plate yield strength. Areas of thinned lithosphere are thus not necessarily persistent weak zones where significant extension and magmatic provinces will develop. Seismic data from the Turkana Depression in East Africa show that areas of thinned lithosphere are not necessarily persistent weak zones where extension and magmatic provinces will develop."

 Standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and rare variant burden tests are essential tools for identifying trait-relevant genes1. Although these methods are conceptually similar, by analysing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank2–4, we show that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: (1) trait importance — how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and (2) trait specificity — the importance of a gene for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, whereas burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, whereas burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.

The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics2, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve substantial improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon markedly decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Qavg) of 9.7 × 106 across 45 qubits. For our best qubit, we achieve a Qavg of 1.5 × 107, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 × 107, corresponding to a lifetime (T1) up to 1.68 ms. This low loss also allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use an improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T2E) exceeding T1. We achieve these materials improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single-qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The tantalum-on-silicon platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at the wafer scale and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors. A materials platform using tantalum as a base layer and silicon as the substrate to construct superconducting qubits enables device performance improvements such as millisecond lifetimes and coherence times, as well as high time-averaged quality factors."

 The telencephalon of the mammalian brain contains multiple regions and circuits that have adaptive and integrative roles in a variety of brain functions. GABAergic neurons in the telencephalon are diverse; they have many circuit functions, and dysfunction of these neurons has been implicated in various brain disorders1–3. Here we conducted a systematic and in-depth analysis of the transcriptomic and spatial organization of GABAergic neuronal types in all regions of the mouse telencephalon and their developmental origins. This was accomplished using 611,423 young adult single-cell transcriptomes and 614,569 single-cell transcriptomes collected from multiple prenatal and postnatal developmental timepoints. We present a hierarchically organized adult telencephalic GABAergic neuronal cell-type taxonomy of 7 classes, 52 subclasses, 284 supertypes and 1,051 clusters, as well as a corresponding developmental taxonomy of 1,688 clusters across ages from embryonic day 7 to postnatal day 14. Detailed charting efforts reveal extraordinary complexity whereby relationships among cell types reflect both spatial locations and developmental origins. Transcriptomically and developmentally related cell types are often found in distant and diverse brain regions, indicating that long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons. Moreover, we find various spatial dimensions of both discrete and continuous variation among related cell types that are correlated with gene expression gradients. Lastly, we find that cortical, striatal and some pallidal GABAergic neurons undergo extensive postnatal diversification, whereas septal, preoptic and most pallidal GABAergic neuronal types emerge in a burst during the embryonic stage with limited postnatal diversification. Overall, the telencephalic GABAergic cell-type taxonomy will serve as a foundational reference for molecular, structural and functional studies of cell types and circuits by the entire community. Long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons, which diversify extensively after birth in the cortex and striatum, but show limited postnatal changes in the septum, preoptic area and pallidum."

 Ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) achieve rapid remission in treatment-resistant depression. However, their mechanisms of action—the understanding of which is essential for refining therapeutic precision—remain unclear1–3. Here, using mouse models, we identify adenosine signalling as a central pathway that underlies the antidepressant effects of these interventions. Results from genetically encoded adenosine sensor experiments and real-time optical recordings reveal that both therapies induce strong adenosine surges in key mood-regulatory regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors abolishes their therapeutic effects, which establishes the essential role of adenosine signalling in antidepressant efficacy. Notably, adenosine signalling specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex drives antidepressant actions. Ketamine increases adenosine by modulating cellular metabolism to increase intracellular adenosine levels without causing neuronal hyperactivity. Leveraging this mechanism, we develop ketamine derivatives that enhance adenosine signalling and exhibit improved antidepressant efficacy with reduced side effects at therapeutic doses. Furthermore, acute intermittent hypoxia, a non-pharmacological intervention involving controlled reductions in oxygen levels, increases brain adenosine levels and produces antidepressant effects, paralleling the actions of ketamine and ECT. Our findings establish adenosine as a pivotal mediator of rapid-acting antidepressants and a tractable target for scalable, noninvasive therapeutics in major depressive disorder. Adenosine signalling is identified as the central mechanism of action of the antidepressant effects of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy, and newly developed analogues of ketamine exhibit improved antidepressant efficacy with reduced side effects."

 The Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt first appeared in 2011 and quickly became the largest interconnected floating biome on Earth. In recent years, Sargassum stranding events have caused substantial ecological and socio-economic impacts in coastal communities. Sargassum requires both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) for growth, yet the primary sources of these nutrients fuelling the extensive Sargassum blooms remain unclear. Here we use coral-bound N isotopes to reconstruct N2 fixation, the ultimate source of the ocean’s bioavailable N, across the Caribbean over the past 120 years. Our data indicate that changes in N2 fixation were primarily controlled by multidecadal and interannual changes in equatorial Atlantic upwelling of ‘excess P’, that is, P in stoichiometric excess relative to fixed N. We show that the supply of excess P from equatorial upwelling and N from the N2 fixation response can account for the majority of Sargassum variability since 2011. Sargassum dynamics are best explained by their symbiosis with N2-fixing epiphytes, which render the macroalgae highly competitive during strong equatorial upwelling of excess P. Thus, the future of Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic will depend on how global warming affects equatorial Atlantic upwelling and the climatic modes that control it. High near-surface nitrogen-fixation rates that promoted the recent growth of the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt were tied to greater upwelling of phosphorus from the equatorial Atlantic, according to coral-bound nitrogen isotope records from the Caribbean."

Stolper,Isotopic evidence for elevated photorespiration during the last glacial period,"Low carbon dioxide levels during the last glacial period enhanced photorespiration in trees across North America, indicating a decline in land plant productivity, according to measurements of clumped isotopes in subfossil wood samples. 
 Low atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are thought to suppress land plant productivity in part by promoting photorespiration, wherein illuminated C3 plants uptake molecular oxygen and release carbon dioxide. This could act as a negative feedback that limits atmospheric carbon dioxide decline during glacial periods. However, colder glacial temperatures would suppress photorespiration, potentially counteracting this feedback. Here we tested the hypothesis that land plants photorespired more during glacial periods by applying a proxy for photorespiration rate based on clumped isotope compositions of wood methoxyl groups, validated in modern and recent trees, to North American subfossil tree specimens from the last glacial period. We find that, across most of ice-free North America, trees from the last glacial period photorespired more than more recent trees from similar locations and more than contemporary trees from higher latitudes. We reconcile these differences using a single model relationship between temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration, which suggests that, during glacial periods, photorespiration increased primarily in warmer growing environments that cooled by about 6 °C or less. This supports the hypothesis of a negative feedback that regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide by increasing photorespiration and restricting land plant productivity during glacial periods.

 Compositional inhomogeneity in a material can result in low thermal conductivity, benefiting applications such as thermoelectric energy conversion, energy gas storage, and thermal barrier coating. However, current understanding remains limited to effective thermal conductivity models, which largely overlook detailed structural features of the material. Here, taking Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 compound as a proof-of-concept material, we reveal that the true reason for low thermal conductivity determined by compositional inhomogeneity originates from randomly aligned edge dislocations. The random alignment of edge dislocations is consistent with the alignment of composition distribution. This is because these edge dislocations are primarily gathered at composition gradient domains between domains with different compositions, having preferential orientation along the composition gradient direction. This work offers a structural perspective on the mechanism underlying reduced thermal conductivity due to compositional inhomogeneity, providing valuable insights for designing materials with tailored thermal properties.

Here, the authors report the topological differences in 3D and 2D reconstructions of twin networks and reveal the biases embedded in surface views of 3D domain structures. 
 Assessing the fingerprint of a material’s microstructure is key for supporting materials design. With the emergence of a wide range of 3D characterization techniques, it is critical to understand the main differences in fingerprints reconstructed from 2D and 3D datasets. To this end, we introduce a graph-based microstructure reconstruction framework that enables structural comparisons of twin domain networks in high purity Ti using 3D and 2D electron backscatter diffraction. Insights into the structure of the twin networks are facilitated by combining statistical analysis of twin crystallography with visual and graphical analysis of the novel graph abstractions of the twins. We demonstrate that compared to 3D reconstructions, conventional 2D views of twinning miss key aspects of the microstructure including the high interconnectivity of domains into networks that span the full reconstruction volume. The reduced cross-grain and in-grain twin connectivity typically observed in 2D has notable implications on our understanding of how twinning mediates the plastic response of microstructures and how twin networks evolve. It is thus clear that 3D characterization is critical for accurately inferring both twin network morphologies as well as the key unit processes facilitating network formation.

Here the authors present high-resolution simulations that show that mesoscale horizontal stirring increases in the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica, mainly due to sea ice reduction. 
 Mesoscale horizontal stirring (MHS) is ubiquitous in the oceans, influencing heat and carbon transport, phytoplankton blooms and fish larvae dispersal. The current generation of Earth system models lacks sufficient resolution to properly resolve MHS-relevant small-scale phenomena, such as oceanic mesoscale eddies, leaving it largely unknown how MHS will change in response to greenhouse warming. Here we determine how CO2 doubling and quadrupling will change the surface MHS statistics in Community Earth System Model simulations with 1/10-degree ocean resolution. MHS is analysed using the finite-size Lyapunov exponent, a Lagrangian diagnostic that measures the separation of close trajectories. Projected increases in MHS are expected in the Arctic Ocean and coastal Antarctic regions, driven by enhanced time-mean ocean flow and turbulence which predominantly result from sea ice reduction. The enhanced horizontal stirring in polar oceans implies substantial yet uncertain consequences for tracer transport, nutrient supply and ecosystems under higher CO2 conditions.

 Global inequalities in resource use leave billions below decent living standards (DLS)—a proposal of universal minimum service levels required to meet essential human needs. Although research has examined the energy use and greenhouse gas emission implications of achieving universal DLS, little is known about the necessary expansion of societies’ material stocks in buildings, infrastructure and machinery. Here we estimate that closing global DLS gaps would require an increase of approximately 12% in the existing material stocks of society, if efforts to expand these stocks are devoted exclusively to meet DLS. At current construction rates, this could be accomplished by 2030. However, if historical trends of unequal growth of material stocks driven by demands beyond DLS persist, the material stock requirements for DLS could increase tenfold, risking the achievement of sustainable development and climate change mitigation goals. To achieve DLS for all while limiting environmental pressures, it is essential to prioritize expansion of material stocks for closing DLS gaps and to critically asses stock expansion for demands beyond DLS—especially in affluent regions. Such a strategy could ensure universal DLS at more sustainable resource use levels.

This study reveals the interplay between SNF management strategies and their environmental impacts with a particular focus on iodine-129, a highly mobile, persistent and dominant risk contributor. 
 Nuclear energy has an important role in the low-carbon energy transition, but the safety of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management remains a public concern. Here we investigate the interplay between waste management strategies and their environmental impacts with a particular focus on a highly mobile and persistent radionuclide, iodine-129 (I-129), which is the dominant risk contributor from SNF disposal and at existing groundwater contamination sites. The results show that the current recycling practice releases more than 90% of I-129 in SNF into the present-day biosphere using an isotropic dilution strategy, whereas the direct disposal of SNF in geological repositories is likely to delay and reduce the release by 8 orders of magnitude. In addition, our data synthesis of surface water concentrations near four nuclear facilities shows that the release-dilution strategy results in lower concentrations than regulatory standards, while insufficient waste isolation in the past has resulted in locally high concentrations within one site. Our analysis suggests that it is essential to consider effluents more explicitly as a part of the waste, that as society moves from dilution to isolation of waste, the potential risks of waste isolation to local regions should be carefully evaluated, and that excessive burdens of proof could hinder or discourage waste isolation. Comprehensive waste management strategies—considering not just volume but also mobility, isolation technologies and ultimate fates—are needed for persistent contaminants. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing the management of SNF and other persistent contaminants.

 The thermal response of permafrost to climate change is quantified by two key metrics: the surface offset (SO), the mean annual temperature difference between near-surface air and the ground surface, and the thermal offset (TO), the equivalent difference between the ground surface and the top of permafrost. However, a comprehensive global synthesis of their magnitude, variability, and controlling drivers remains elusive. Here, synthesizing data from 117 sites across the three poles, we reveal a fundamental, scale-dependent decoupling of their controls. We show that SO is primarily controlled by large-scale climate, with precipitation dictating the similar large magnitude of SO in the Arctic (3.1 ± 0.3 °C, cold-humid permafrost) and the Third Pole (3.2 ± 0.2 °C, warm-dry permafrost), but small in Antarctica (1.0 ± 0.2 °C, ultraxerous permafrost). In contrast, TO is predominantly determined by local-scale substrate properties, being markedly negative in the Arctic (−0.5 ± 0.2 °C), weakly negative in the Third Pole (−0.2 ± 0.1 °C), and negligible in Antarctica (−0.1 ± 0.1 °C). Critically, this substrate control can be overridden by regional climate, such as advective heat transport following rainfall. This synthesis establishes the first global benchmarks for permafrost thermal states and reveals a paradigm of divergent, multi-scale controls essential for improving models that predict the fate of Earth’s thawing cryosphere."

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is characterized by a zonal (longitudinal) displacement of the background Walker circulation across the equatorial Pacific, or spatial shifting. The warm pool edge position (WPEP) commonly measures the intensity of this shifting. Hereby organizing sea surface temperature (SST) maps according to WPEP quantiles, we construct a synthetic, continuous sequence of patterns—termed the pattern continuum—that captures the SST evolution along the movement, namely the gradual transition from broad Central Pacific La Niña cooling to Central then Eastern Pacific El Niño warming. This pattern continuum can also be approximated by a “shifted-mean” framework, wherein a fixed spatial structure shifts zonally. The present diagnosis provides insight into key dynamical features of the ENSO, such as its spatial diversity, asymmetry, and nonlinearity, including the quadratic relationship between SST principal components. It may also be useful for practical model evaluation and intercomparison."

Insights from the 2019 Southern Hemisphere sudden stratospheric warming 
 This study isolates the role of the 2019 Southern Hemisphere (SH) sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) for surface climate in eight Stratospheric Nudging And Predictable Surface Impacts project (SNAPSI) models. The novel nudging experiments allow for a clearer disentanglement of the SSW’s impact on surface climate than the standard free-running forecasts, in which the entire atmospheric system evolves freely and deviates from observed reality. SNAPSI models capture the downward propagation of the negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM) from the stratosphere when the zonally symmetric stratospheric circulation is nudged toward the observations. In addition, zonally asymmetric stratospheric variations amplify warm anomalies and dry conditions over eastern Australia, enhancing the Australian local high-pressure system. The composite analysis reveals that the zonally asymmetric stratospheric variations driven by the westward-shifted vortex influence the eastern Australian precipitation forecast by strengthening the downward coupling of the SAM and enhancing the meridional ridge-trough structure over Australia. Westward-shifted vortex events are identified in over 60% more ensemble members in the nudged run than in the free run, associated with precipitation closer to observed values in the nudged run. The wildfire weather potential risk in Australia is assessed using the Fraction Attributable Risk (FAR) of the Hot Dry Windy (HDW) wildfire weather index. The positive FAR of the HDW wildfire weather index indicates that the nudged stratosphere contributes up to ~30% to the increased wildfire weather risk along eastern and southern Australia, highlighting the contribution of the 2019 SSW event to Australian extreme weather from mid-October to mid-November."

 Submarine landslides reshape seafloor geomorphology, transport sediment and carbon to the deep-sea, and can trigger tsunamis or damage valuable seabed infrastructure. Yet, submarine landslides have never been directly observed in action. Here, we present the most detailed measurements yet of an ongoing submarine landslide using high-frequency (1–10 Hz) ground motions captured by an ocean-bottom seismometer placed in the vicinity of the slide’s source region. We tracked a ~ 0.00423 km³ flank collapse in the Congo Canyon, and reveal its triggers and chronology of movement, thereby testing fundamental landslide models. A powerful turbidity current undercut the canyon wall, and landslide failure initiated at the base-of-slope. The landslide retrogressed 1.3 km upslope for 15 minutes in 1–2 min pulses, interspersed with brief downslope movement. Retrogression speeds ranged from 1.6 to 5.8 m/s, and downslope movement speeds from 0.8 to 3.3 m/s. Once the failure reached its upslope limit, the landslide transitioned into 1.5 hours of pulsed sediment transport, which fed a turbidity current along the canyon-axis. These observations show seismic monitoring can produce major advances in the understanding of submarine landslides. They challenge simple “toe-backward” and “head-forward” collapse models, revealing a hybrid, bottom-up retrogressive process that only released sediment after climbing far upslope.

 Beginning in the 13th century, Polynesian settlers on the island of Rapa Nui engaged in megalithic monument construction, crafting hundreds of ahu platforms and moai statues from volcanic bedrock. The decline of this tradition centuries later, coincident with land-use changes and the emergence of new ritual practices on the island, has intrigued archaeologists for decades. Here, we present evidence for a transition to persistent drought conditions on Rapa Nui beginning in the mid 16th century, based on two independent reconstructions of hydrogen isotopes in rainfall inferred from hydrogen isotopes of leaf waxes preserved in wetland sediments. Consistent with observational data and model simulations, we interpret more negative hydrogen isotopes in precipitation to reflect an increase in the frequency of large storms and total rainfall amount over Rapa Nui. We show that 16th–17th century changes in human geography on Rapa Nui coincided with a sustained, multi-century decrease in annual precipitation of ~600–800 mm, which is of greater magnitude than the drying observed in recent decades.

 Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, along with point cloud modeling techniques like Quantitative Structure Models (QSM), have improved the accuracy of non-destructive above-ground tree biomass estimation. However, branch-level tree growth analysis using QSM time series remains underexplored due to challenges in data quality and methodology. This study investigates the boundary conditions in terms of data and species to facilitate robust QSM generation, which could enable branch-level growth analysis using multi-temporal LiDAR data and QSM. A multi-scan terrestrial laser scanning dataset and a dataset from a tower-based system were used to assess the impact of data acquisition setup and data quality on QSM reconstruction for birch (Betula pendula), pines (Pinus sylvestris), and spruces (Picea abies). The results show that reliable QSMs for detecting branch-level growth require a minimum spatial resolution of approximately 500 pts./m3 with a uniform point density, a maximum uniform 3D point distance of 2 cm, and gaps smaller than around 20 cm. Although smaller spherical noise clusters can be removed using denoising techniques, larger and denser noise clusters (e.g., > 9500 points within 1 m radius) are more likely to be misidentified as additional branches. Foliage removal methods risk modeling accuracy by inadvertently removing woody points. Regarding species, birches were more accurately modeled than pines and spruces. While QSMs are reproducible for single time points, comparing branches over time is challenging due to inconsistencies in modeled branching order and scanner positioning. Nonetheless, tree-level QSM metrics remain statistically consistent, revealing diverse growth strategies within and across species."

 Peatland restoration can halt biodiversity loss and organic soil degradation and mitigate climate change. Monitoring of restoration impacts requires novel approaches that can be scaled to large site networks. On a smaller scale, the restoration practitioners would likewise benefit from spatially and temporally comprehensive and objective monitoring data. This narrative review compiles potential remote sensing methods for practical monitoring of the ecohydrological processes in restoration of forestry-drained boreal peatlands to support and complement conventional ground monitoring approaches that are restricted by spatial coverage. Remote sensing provides tools for tracking the changes in soil surface moisture, water flow routes, vegetation cover and structure, topography, peat depth and greenhouse gas emissions. We emphasize that the suitable indicators of restoration success, platforms and sensors should be tailored to specific restoration cases with their own initial site conditions and restoration targets. The choice of spatial and temporal resolutions of data is defined by the scale and change rate of the restoration indicators. Data acquisition campaigns and selection of existing datasets require meticulous planning due to seasonal changes in hydrology and vegetation. We also compiled practical experiences on selecting remote sensing tools and ensuring satisfactory data quality to facilitate the implementation of remote-sensing-based monitoring. Finally, we provide recommendations on how the rapid development of remote sensing technology, encompassing new uncrewed applications and novel sensors on conventional platforms, can offer a range of monitoring tools to cater to the growing needs for spatially comprehensive data amounts assessing peatland restoration success in boreal conditions."

 Sentinel-1 is a unique resource for global flood monitoring, providing systematic, weather-independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with unprecedented coverage. To overcome limitations of on-demand flood mapping services that depend on human operators to collect and interpret satellite images, a fundamentally new approach was adopted by the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) service. This service, which was launched in 2021 as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), processes all Sentinel-1 land images acquired in VV polarisation fully automatically in near-real time. This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of GFM’s scientific achievements and challenges during its initial years of operation. To map floods reliably under diverse environmental conditions, GFM combines three complementary flood-mapping algorithms with reference water datasets to differentiate flooded areas from permanent and seasonal water bodies. The service also offers a novel flood-likelihood layer and contextual information to highlight areas where flood mapping is unreliable or not feasible. These data layers were derived from a global 20 m backscatter datacube containing approximately 379 billion land surface pixels. This datacube also made it possible to generate the first global Sentinel-1 flood archive (2015 to present). Our performance analysis shows that GFM typically delivers flood maps within five hours of image acquisition. However, a significant percentage of floods may go undetected due to coverage gaps. Initial evaluation results show that good accuracies are achieved for larger-scale floods and regions in the temperate and tropical zones, while accuracies are lower for smaller-scale floods and arid environments. The GFM service will continue to improve service quality by enhancing flood detection capabilities using improved algorithms and additional data, such as the VH channel from Sentinel-1 or L-band data from the upcoming ROSE-L mission."

 We present a discretized, multi-layer soil moisture model that links soil moisture variability to single-look SAR measurements. Our model reveals distinct closure phase signatures arising from variation of soil moisture, radar frequencies, and soil textures. Specifically, our model predicts that positive asymmetric soil moisture anomalies produce positive closure phase step-changes, and negative asymmetric anomalies yield negative closure phase step-changes, consistent with observed data. Additionally, our analysis reveals that low-frequency radar (e.g., L-band) exhibits heightened sensitivity to the vertical distribution of soil moisture. We identify an approximate transfer function between soil moisture anomalies and closure phase responses and introduce a scalable algorithm for retrieving the InSAR Soil Moisture Index, a relative soil moisture product. We demonstrate the retrieval algorithm in two diverse environments: the Mojave Desert and the Central Valley in California. Good agreements between the derived InSAR Soil Moisture Index, in situ soil moisture measurements, and SMAP/Sentinel-1 soil moisture measurements highlight the potential for large-scale soil moisture monitoring using InSAR closure phase."

 Line Surge Arresters (LSAs) play a vital role in protecting power transmission systems from overvoltage, and obtaining their 3D information is crucial for precise reconstruction of power lines and intelligent planning of inspection routes. Current studies mainly rely on image-based methods for LSAs recognition. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-mounted Light Detection and Ranging is an effective way to obtain 3D information of transmission corridors. However, accurately extracting LSAs from point clouds remains a significant challenge because of small physical size, sparse point distribution, and structural similarity to other components. In this study, an LSAs extraction method is proposed using the structural features. The method initially separates pylon and power line components using established techniques and further clusters the power line points into Single Power Line (SPL) as analysis unit, representing potential installation locations of the LSAs. For each SPL, this study proposes a structure-based method to identify the presence of LSAs. A width-based filtering criterion is applied to exclude SPLs without LSAs coarsely, retaining only those with potential LSA presence. For the retained SPLs, kernel density estimation is employed to capture the structural characteristics in case of LSA existence, thereby precisely preserving the SPLs containing LSAs. Following the identifying process, a Particle Swarm Optimization based segmentation method is proposed to achieve precise extraction of the LSAs. A structure-consistency-driven objective function is constructed using proposed Transmission Compactness Index and Axial Uniformity Index to model the geometric differences between LSAs and neighboring components. Based on this objective function, the optimal segmentation plane is searched to separate the LSAs from other components. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset covering 63 transmission lines with a total of 3,571 pylons. Results demonstrate that the method achieves an overall identification accuracy of 98.28 %, with extraction precision of 92.66 %, recall of 87.43 %, and F1-score of 90.11 %. Additionally, our method shows high efficiency with the average processing time per pylon of 3.82 s. Compared to existing general segmentation algorithms, the proposed approach offers significant improvements in extraction accuracy. To foster further research, we release a point cloud dataset for LSAs extraction, which will be publicly available at: https://github.com/c175044/Line-Surge-Arresters-datasets."

 Mangroves are vital ecosystems that thrive in specific ecological niches, making it essential to identify areas of potential region for effective large-scale monitoring. However, existing methods for delineating potential mangrove regions are often either rigid or labor-intensive, frequently overlooking inland mangroves along tidal channels and lacking suitability for long-term analysis. Therefore, this study develops the self-supervised geospatially-aligned prototype learning (SGAPL) to automatically generate the potential mangrove regions based on scene-level labels. SGAPL integrates geo-grouped temporal inputs for deep feature extraction, geo-corrected prototype modeling with superpixel-aligned smoothing to enhance spatial completeness, and an adjacent-scene continuity strategy to improve the consistency of potential mangrove regions. We produced the scene-driven Australia mangrove maps (SAMM_14-23), which achieved an overall accuracy of 94.65 ±0.85%. The analysis based on the mangrove potential region generated by SGAPL revealed that more than 4000 ha of inland mangrove patches had been underestimated by traditional approaches. Analysis of SAMM_14-23 revealed two key patterns: (1) over 70% of mangrove changes occurred within a 50-meter buffer zone along patch boundaries, highlighting significant edge vulnerability; and (2) a clear inverse relationship between patch size and change rate, with patches larger than 4000 ha demonstrating high stability. SGAPL offers a novel framework for large-scale mangrove monitoring, addressing the long-standing gap in inland mangrove detection. The resulting SAMM_14-23 dataset provides comprehensive, up-to-date information to support targeted conservation efforts, particularly in edge protection and habitat connectivity, with direct relevance to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

 Individuals make distinct walking choices based on the surrounding urban environment perceptions. Although a lot of work has been done in quantifying human perception of urban environment, existing research has not explored how the choices driven by perception can support walkability. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a framework that leverages 360-degree Google Street View Images (GSVIs), which serve as inputs to Deep Learning (DL) models. These models then extract informative features that contribute to the prediction of various perceptual attributes viz. beautiful, boring, safe, and lively collected through a primary survey. The attributes were integrated with road network at 100-meter intervals for the city of Mumbai, India. A multi-objective function is proposed to minimize the distance and maximize the perception to provide good routes. The DL models OCRNet and pretrained PPYOLOE + x achieved a high mIoU score of 72.13 %, and 51.4 %, respectively. Additionally, the state-of-art transformer-based model DINOv3 utilized for comparitive analysis and generalizability. The perception models also achieved a high accuracy of over 90%. Significant variations in routes were observed in diverse urban built-ups.

 Chemical speciation and oxidative potential (OP) analysis of airborne particles in African schools has not been previously conducted. In this study, daily atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) sampling was carried out in classrooms of four primary schools in Luanda, Angola. Samples were analysed for elemental composition, organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). OP was measured using two acellular assays: dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA). PM10 concentrations ranged from 10.2 to 183 μg m−3, exceeding the WHO guideline on ∼70 % of days, with weekday averages (61.0 μg m−3) more than twice those recorded on Saturdays (26.2 μg m−3). Carbonaceous constituents accounted for 21.3 % of PM10 mass, with a consistent OC/EC ratio of 2.26 ± 0.74. On average, 77 % of OC was estimated to be secondary, while WSOC/OC ratios ranged from 0.15 to 0.90, averaging 0.42 ± 0.18.

 Extreme high temperatures frequently affect the densely populated Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China, impacting livelihoods and ecosystems. However, predicting such events on a sub-seasonal scale remains challenging. This study develops an advanced deterministic and probabilistic forecasting framework based on the residual U-Net (Res-UNet) architecture, trained and validated from 2003 to 2018 and tested over 2019–2022 over the YRB. In deterministic forecast, Res-UNet substantially improves temporal correlation coefficient by 14 % compared to the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (EC) and empirical quantile mapping (QM) at the 3–4 weeks lead time. Notably, it achieves a probability of detection (POD) of 0.3, maintaining predictive skill where other models falter. For the probabilistic forecast, Res-UNet outperforms EC and QM at longer lead times, providing Brier Skill Score (BSS) and Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS), with lower Brier Scores (BS), especially in Chongqing and Sichuan. During the extreme events of 2022, Res-UNet delivers high-confidence predictions of extreme high temperatures up to 3 weeks in advance.

 The impacts of urbanization, particularly through their complex interactions with synoptic-scale and orographic forcings, pose a great challenge to the accurate prediction of urban convective storms. On 28 July 2020, a convective storm occurs to the south of the Meiyu front, producing a localized and intense precipitation in the coastal megacity of Shanghai. To investigate urbanization impacts, particularly the urban heat island (UHI) effect, on such convective storm linked to Meiyu front and sea breeze circulation, comprehensive observational analysis and cloud-permitting (1 km) numerical simulations are conducted. Besides the favorable convective environments related to synoptic-scale forcings, a strong UHI surging to over 1.1 °C prior to precipitation is detected. It intensifies the “warm bubble” over Shanghai, sharpening its thermal contrasts with the Meiyu front's cold outflows and cool marine air, and increasing atmospheric instability. Subsequently, convergence over the eastern urban periphery is promoted to the west, forming an east-west oriented convergence line. A multicell line storm forms along it. As the convective system traverses the residual arid urban landscape, the UHI effect enhances the thermal contrast between its cold outflows and ambient environment, inducing the thermally driven convergence. This further facilitates the convective cell formation along the outflow boundary, resulting in the prolonged and intensified convective activity around the urban area. However, as the UHI is weakened, urban-induced moisture deficiency dominates, suppressing convection initiation over the urban area. It is implied that the pronounced UHI might promote convective activity in the vicinity of the urban center, even under the influence of synoptic-scale forcings."

This strategy would create an unprecedented climate where the relationship between surface temperature and carbon dioxide concentration is decoupled. The implications of stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI) for global crop protein concentrations have not yet been explored. While elevated CO2 concentrations are expected to reduce crop protein, higher temperatures may increase crop protein concentrations. Here we report changes of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat protein concentrations under a medium emissions climate change scenario and a SAI scenario to maintain global average temperatures at 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels, as simulated by three global gridded crop models. We show that using SAI to offset surface temperature increases would create decreases in the global protein concentrations of maize and rice, with minimal impact on wheat and soybean. Some already protein-deficient and malnourished nations that rely heavily on these crops to meet protein demands would show large decreases in protein intake under SAI with the current diet pattern, which could exacerbate their nutrient scarcity. The range of results between crop models highlights the need for a more comprehensive analysis using additional crop models, climate models, a broader range of climate intervention scenarios, and advancements in crop models to better represent protein responses to climate changes."

This study investigates the relationship between climate change conference of the parties (COP) meetings and the stock market performance of selected publicly listed companies. Specifically, we compare the price formation of fossil fuel companies, ethically-rated (‘green’) companies and renewable energy companies during international climate negotiations, compared to the periods around them. We investigate changes in market behaviour during COPs using two different statistical approaches to assess both whole of the period and daily effects. Both methods find distinct increases in the values of stocks with high green ratings, but no changes in stocks of renewable companies and weaker and more statistically inconsistent decreases in the values of fossil fuel companies. No consistent results are found for variability measurements, other than general market variability increases during COPs. We show that, by contrast, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meetings produce very strong increases in the stock values and variabilities of fossil fuel companies, and fairly strong decreases in the value of renewables companies, showing that detectable changes during predictable events are generally plausible. We conclude that market behaviour so far appears to favour companies with lower environmental impact during COPs but does not convincingly shift company price formation in line with the necessary green transition."

Christine Chiu,Marine and continental stratocumulus cloud microphysical properties obtained from routine ARM Cimel sunphotometer observations,"Photometer observations of stratocumulus cloud properties are evaluated for a multiyear archive. Retrievals for cloud optical depth, cloud droplet effective radius, and liquid water path show solid agreement with collocated references. Continental stratocumulus clouds sorted by cloud thickness indicate double the cloud optical depth and liquid water path of their marine counterparts, while exhibiting similar bulk cloud droplet effective radius. 
 This study investigates marine and continental stratocumulus (Sc) cloud properties obtained from an automated implementation of a multispectral  photometer retrieval. Photometer methods simultaneously retrieve cloud optical depth (τ) and cloud droplet effective radius (re),  with estimates for liquid water path (LWP) calculated on the availability of those quantities. These applied methods evaluate retrieved cloud  properties for Sc identified during a recent 6 year period over the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program sites  in Oklahoma, USA (SGP) and in the Azores, Portugal (ENA).Modest agreement in key quantity retrievals is found between the routine photometer products and multisensor collocated profiling references. Cumulative breakdowns contingent on cloud thickness indicate increases in all retrieved quantities in thicker clouds, with larger discrepancies in the relative performance between the retrievals collected in the presence of drizzle. Under continental cloud conditions, the clouds of a similar thickness and re to those sampled under marine conditions report a factor of 1.5 larger τ and LWP. An r2≅0.65 is found between photometer τ retrievals and shadowband radiometer measurements, with photometer retrievals reporting a high (relative) bias. The τ intercomparisons indicate that variability between retrievals is a factor of three larger than errors reported from individual retrieval input perturbation tests. Photometer re retrievals suggest a low r2 (< 0.1) having a standard deviation ≅ 3 µm when compared to ARM baseline multi-sensor radar/radiometer references (accounting for offsets in the cloud droplet number concentration assumptions of the latter). However, photometer LWP calculations remain relatively unbiased in non-drizzling conditions, with errors O (50 g m−2) and r2≅0.5 to collocated radiometer and interferometer references. Additional sensitivity tests for island influences on marine Sc properties suggest that while island-influenced winds may promote larger cloud LWP or thickness, the influence could be within retrieval method uncertainty and/or collocated instrument variability."

While holographic imaging enables detailed analysis of cloud droplet size, shape, and distribution, processing errors remain poorly quantified. To address this, we developed CloudTarget, a patterned photomask that can quantify the detection efficiency and uncertainties. Additionally, our AI-based classification enhances both accuracy and speed, achieving over 90 % precision while accelerating analysis 100-fold. 
 Accurate measurements of cloud particle size, shape, and concentration are essential for microphysical cloud research. Holographic imaging is ideal for three-dimensional analyses of particle size, shape, and spatial distribution in large sample volumes, but its post-processing often leads to operator-dependent results and introduces uncertainties in detection efficiency. Here we present CloudTarget, a set of chrome photomasks with a customized pattern of opaque circles, serving as a verification tool to quantify detection efficiency and evaluate size and position errors. CloudTarget provides a ground truth for optimizing hologram processing parameters, including detection, sizing, and classification thresholds, and it facilitates evaluations of size- and position-dependent detection efficiency and uncertainties. Additionally, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object classification that achieves high accuracy with moderate training data. In a holography setup featuring a 5120 × 5120 pixel imaging sensor, a 3 µm effective pixel size, and 355 nm illumination, the CNN achieves over 90 % recall and precision for particles larger than 7 µm in a 10 cm × 1.3 cm × 1.3 cm detection volume. The average focus position error remains below 150 µm (1.5 times the reconstruction resolution) for particles <10 cm from the image plane, with in-plane random position detection errors below 5 pixels (mean <2 pixels). By combining inverse techniques with CloudTarget, the sizing error standard deviation is reduced to about 2 µm. Overall, classification performance improves significantly, and a 100-fold increase in classification speed is achieved."

The method is fast, sensitive, and suitable for low-mass samples. Its application to a 6-year dataset from the Jungfraujoch site highlights its potential for source identification and understanding of biogenic and biomass burning tracers. 
 Sugars compose an important class of compounds by mass in atmospheric particulate matter (PM), often with biogenic and anthropogenic sources, many of them still poorly characterized. These sugars are mainly analysed by gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or ion chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (IC-PAD). However, these techniques present several disadvantages such as a complex preparation for GC-MS, or a limited range of possible analytes and elevated limits of quantification for IC-PAD. This hinders our capability to perform analyses of extensive time series, in order to develop our knowledge of the phenomenology of these species. In this paper, we present the validation of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 21 sugars in atmospheric PM. The sample preparation is simple, fast and safe, consisting of an aqueous extraction. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, and recovery. This technique showed excellent linearity (r2>0.99), precision (relative standard deviation RSD <25 %) and extraction yields (results between 70 % and 120 %). The suitability of the method for analyses of samples from sites with very low PM concentrations was demonstrated with samples from the High-Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ), Switzerland. A series of samples spanning a 6-year period is presented. Results for arabitol, levoglucosan and 2-methyl-tetrols display strong seasonality, due to seasonal variation in chemical production and boundary layer dynamics, with atmospheric convection and transport from the valleys to high altitudes mostly in summer. This simple and fast method facilitates the analysis of large sets of PM samples and sugar compounds, and opens the door to a better understanding and attribution of their sources."

The methodology identifies patterns with timescales of impact for one or more forcers using idealised experiments and anomaly calculations. Results for precipitation and temperature show good model performance and can reproduce hysteresis for overshoot scenarios. 
 Resolved spatial information for climate change projections is critical to any robust assessment of climate impacts and adaptation options. However, the range of spatially resolved future scenario assessments available is limited, due to the significant computational and human demands of Earth System Model (ESM) pipelines. In order to explore a wider variety of societal outcomes and to enable coupling of climate impacts into societal modelling frameworks, rapid spatial emulation of ESM responses to climate change is therefore desirable. Many existing pattern scaling methods assume spatial climate signals which scale linearly with global temperature change, where the pattern of response is independent of the nature and timing of emissions. However, this assumption may introduce biases in emulated climates, especially under net negative emissions and overshoot scenarios. To address these biases, we propose a novel emulation system, METEOR, which represents multi-timescale spatial climate responses to multiple climate forcers. The mapping of emissions to forcing is provided by the CICERO Simple Climate Model, combined with a calibration system that can be used to train model-specific pattern response engines using only core training simulations from CMIP. Here, we demonstrate that our fitted spatial emulation system is capable of rapidly and accurately predicting gridded annual mean temperature and precipitation responses to out-of-sample scenarios."

Our study reveals stripe patterns arise from mismatches between dynamic and physical calculations in models. Simplified experiments demonstrate that adjusting their connection eliminates stripes. This advances numerical weather prediction understanding, aiding forecasters and the public. Our diagnostic methods provide a framework for solving this global meteorological modeling challenge. 
 An unphysical stripe pattern is identified in low-level wind field in China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA-GFS), characterized by meridional stripes in u-component and zonal stripes in v-component. This stripe noise is primarily confined to the planetary boundary layer over land. The structural mismatch between static field variations and the observed 2Δx noise amplitude suggests that locally forced mechanisms from surface inhomogeneity alone cannot explain the wind stripe patterns. Meanwhile, pure dynamical core simulations exhibit no such noise, confirming that the dynamical core itself does not generate these patterns. These results suggest that staggered-grid mismatch in physics-dynamics coupling is likely the primary mechanism. Idealized two-dimensional experiments demonstrate that combining one-dimensional dynamic-core advection and physics-based vertical diffusion on a staggered grid generates 2Δx-wavelength spurious waves when surface friction is non-uniform. One-dimensional linear wave analysis further confirms that staggered-grid coupling between dynamic advection and inhomogeneous damping forcing induces dispersion errors in wave solutions. Sensitivity tests validate that eliminating grid mismatch in physics-dynamics coupling removes this stripe noise. These findings collectively indicate that while staggered grids benefit the dynamic core's numerical stability and accuracy, their inherent grid mismatch with physics parameterizations requires specialized coupling strategies to avoid spurious noise. Potential solutions to remedy this issue are discussed."

Using a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model including solar wind, ionospheric, and plasmaspheric H+ and O+ components, coupled with ring current and polar wind models, we simulate the 8 September 2017 storm. The modeled plasmaspheric density closely matches RBSP observations on the dayside. Plasmaspheric‐origin H+ contributes significantly to plasma sheet mass density throughout the storm and becomes a major pressure source during the early main phase, accounting for up to 60% of the total pressure in localized regions. This pressure dominance occurs when pre‐existing plasmaspheric ions, accumulated in the dawnside plasma sheet due to asymmetric erosion, are energized by storm‐time processes. As the plasmasphere becomes depleted and refilling lags behind convection, this contribution diminishes. These results reveal a previously underappreciated role of plasmaspheric‐origin ions in pressure dynamics and provide new insight into storm‐time mass and energy transport."

We find that while humid regions experience flash droughts more frequently, events in drylands intensify more rapidly. This contrast reflects differences in energy and water constraints: net radiation plays a greater role in humid regions, whereas surface drying dominates in drylands. Moreover, short‐term antecedent moisture recovery followed by rapid drying accelerates the onset, with soil moisture depths and timescales exerting region‐specific influences.

This study employs all‐day cloud physical properties to automatically identify and track DCSs in summer. The results show that, influenced by factors such as summer monsoon, topography, and solar radiation, the diurnal variation of DCS number follows a unimodal pattern, with a phase difference of approximately 2 hr between the two areas. Additionally, diurnal variation in cloud properties of DCSs and their internal regions is revealed for the first time. Quantitative analysis of the DCS properties with different sizes and lifetimes indicates that both the TP and SA are dominated by small‐sized DCS with initial DCS lifetimes under 6 hr.

Based on the Self‐Organizing Map method, this study analyzed the typical synoptic types causing extreme summer precipitation events in the NTP and the role of local and non‐local land surface thermal changes. Results show that there are two typical synoptic types that are conducive to the occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the NTP and with an increasing trend, namely the shortwave type and the zonal high‐pressure type. Coupling with these two synoptic types, the reduced soil moisture (SM) in the southwestern and northeastern TP has a prior promotion on extreme precipitation events corresponding to two typical synoptic types in the NTP. The reduction in non‐local SM in the southwestern TP results in a dipole circulation pattern, which leads to convergence of warm and cold air and promotes the transport of moisture from the southwestern TP to the NTP. The reduction in local SM in the northeastern TP contributes to the development of an anticyclone over the northern TP that drives monsoon moisture from the east of the TP, while simultaneously suppressing the eastward export of moisture from the westerlies, leading to increased precipitation in the NTP. This study demonstrates that both local and non‐local thermal effects of the TP can drive extreme precipitation when coupling with specific synoptic types, and it provides some assistance in disaster forecasting and prediction."

This study examines the impacts of three types of LLJs (Central, Northern, and Andes) on Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs), using a 4 km horizontal grid spacing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation and satellite‐based data. The Central and Andes LLJ types facilitate significant moisture flux convergence over the La Plata Basin (LPB), contributing to intense MCS activity and heavy precipitation. In contrast, the Northern LLJ type, operating over the eastern slopes of the northern Andes, exerts a weaker impact on MCS development over the Amazon Basin, leading to more scattered convection. Stronger LLJs support larger, longer‐lived MCSs with higher mean precipitation in jet exit regions. El Niño Southern Oscillation modulates these relationships, with El Niño increasing MCS size and duration in the Central LLJ region, while La Niña enhances MCS frequency in the Andes and Northern LLJ regions. The WRF model captures many of these dynamics but produces higher extreme MCS mean precipitation than IMERG. These findings highlight the importance of LLJ variability in modulating MCSs and suggest that future LLJ changes could alter the hydroclimate and extreme weather patterns in the region. This study underscores the utility of km‐scale models in representing the complex interactions of LLJs and MCSs, making them a promising tool to improve our understanding of these interactions and to assess the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and extreme weather in South America."

However, unconcern about the subseasonal variability of SSTKOE substantially existed in previous studies. We first systematic exposed that the phase reversals of SSTKOE anomalies are an intrinsic and objective phenomenon, that is, the persistently warm SSTKOE anomalies in early‐autumn turns to cool in late‐autumn, and vice versa. This SSTKOE anomalies reversals, occurring in one‐quarter of years, accompanied by subsurface thermal, gradients and marine heatwaves undergo great changes in early‐ and late‐autumn. Utilizing observations and ocean model intercomparison project simulations, the impacts of atmospheric and oceanic variability were separated, and SSTKOE anomalies reversal was found to be mainly due to the atmospheric forcing. Specifically, the local anticyclonic circulation anomalies in early‐autumn enhanced the sinking motion and shortwave radiation, thus heating the sea surface. In late‐autumn, this region shifted to cyclonic circulation anomalies control, with enhanced cold ocean currents and increased cloudiness suppressing shortwave radiation, leading to SSTKOE reversal. The phase reversal of SSTKOE anomalies not only alters the ocean seasonality, but may also provide new predictors for mid‐ and low‐latitude extreme climate prediction."

Their future changes under warming is critical to the society. However, the exact impacts of thermodynamic environmental changes on them are difficult to resolve using climate model simulations which integrate both dynamic and thermodynamic factors. This study explores a theoretical modeling approach to isolate environmental thermodynamic effects on their future changes through a case study. For a 50‐day period during the 2020 summer, a pair of convection‐permitting model simulations indicate contrasting changes in MCSs and IDC between inland and coastal regions under pseudo global warming. Driven by the thermodynamic environments of these simulations, a single‐column parcel model indicates a decrease in the frequency of IDC occurrences, along with increases in duration and precipitation amount under warming, attributable to rising most unstable convective available potential energy (MUCAPE), convective inhibition (MUCIN), and precipitable water (PW). A multi‐column parcel model reveals contrasting changes in the frequency and mean area of MCSs between inland and coastal regions, underscoring the increase in mean MUCIN over inland regions and increases in mean MUCAPE and PW over coastal regions. The increase in mean MCS area over inland regions is linked to the interplay between accelerated gust fronts and enhanced subsidence strength, which is further traced to the unchanged mean MUCIN but increased mean MUCAPE in large‐scale environments. These case study results suggest a major role of thermodynamic environmental changes in controlling characteristics of MCSs and IDC under warming."

Current studies have mainly focused on the temperature effects of changes in land cover types; however, the impacts of vegetation self‐greening, characterized by natural physiological processes such as aging and canopy structure development, on land surface temperature (LST) remain unclear. Here, we employed a space‐for‐time approach to quantify the biophysical effects of vegetation greening on LST (i.e., ΔLST) across China from 2000 to 2018 using multi‐year satellite observations. We found that vegetation greening caused significant daytime cooling (−0.36 K), surpassing that of nighttime (−0.07 K) over the study period. Spatially, pronounced cooling dominated lower latitudes, contrasting with slight warming in mid‐to‐high latitudes, with this warming phenomenon being more evident at nighttime. The latitudinal transition of LST from cooling to warming occurred at around 47°N for daytime, nighttime, and daily mean values. This latitudinal pattern was season‐dependent, shifting to its northernmost extent in summer and southward to around 40°N in winter. Data‐driven methods revealed that albedo decreased by −0.0035 ± 0.009 in total, contributing to warming in Northeastern China, while evapotranspiration (ET) increased by 37.3 ± 33.9 mm across China, driving cooling in other regions. Our findings highlight the importance of vegetation greening in shaping local climate and advance understanding of vegetation feedback on climate, providing valuable insights for developing targeted land management strategies."

In Europe, floods now surpass other natural disasters in severity, causing substantial economic losses, particularly in the companies (commercial and industrial sectors). While river flood impacts on agriculture and residential properties have been extensively studied, research on companies losses remain limited despite their significantly high direct damages. This study enhances fluvial flood risk assessment for company assets by integrating flood hazard scenarios with flexible state‐of‐the‐art Bayesian Network‐based flood loss model and object‐specific exposure data. It estimates the expected annual damage (EAD) to company properties across Europe under a baseline and potential future scenarios shaped by climate change, exposure dynamics, and their combined effects. Additionally, the study assesses the potential of property‐level precautionary measures to mitigate flood risks. Results indicate that, compared to the baseline (year—1995), the EAD values could rise more than 5‐fold under RCP4.5 scenario and 7‐fold under RCP8.5 scenario by the end of the century. However, a policy scenario in which all companies implement at least one precautionary measure (“measures for all”) effectively offsets these projected losses by up to 67%.

However, changes in heat stress and labor capacity in major urban centers that attract rural‐to‐urban work migrants remain unexplored. Moreover, it remains unclear how the increased heat stress and reduced labor capacity under the warming climate will alter the most preferred workplaces for migrant laborers in India. Here, we use station‐based observations, reanalysis data, and climate model projections to reconstruct trends and variability in heat stress metrics, including wet‐bulb temperature for indoor exposure and wet‐bulb globe temperature for outdoor exposure based on migrant data from the 2011 Census. We show that during 1980–2021, most rural‐to‐urban migration hotspots in north, east, and southern India witnessed a significant (p < 0.05) rise in Tw, indicating elevated indoor heat stress. Over that interval, outdoor heat stress has considerably increased and led to a ∼10% decline in labor capacity in these hotspots. A substantial rise in the indoor and outdoor heat stress exposure of migrants and a reduction in their physical labor capacity is projected with each additional degree of global warming. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation variability can also significantly enhance these effects. Effective mitigation and adaptation options are needed to reduce the risks migrant workers face due to increasing indoor and outdoor heat stress in India."

To mitigate the impacts of EWE exposure on PLHIV, it is necessary to understand the historical EWE exposure patterns at HIV care clinics. In this paper, we link open‐source measures of drought and flood events to clinic locations from the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) network, a longitudinal study of over 2 million people living with and at risk for HIV in 44 different countries around the globe enrolling in HIV care from 2006 to present. Using generalized additive models fit to clinic‐level drought and flood exposures, we show how exposures vary across and within countries, model each clinic's probability of exposure to a drought or flood to identify high‐risk areas, and describe how this historical exposure record could ultimately be used to identify at‐risk populations for a wide variety of study designs.

 Water on the surface of the Moon is a key factor in tracing lunar surface processes and represents a potential future resource for lunar exploration. Samples from the Apollo and Luna missions provide constraints on the content and possible origin of this water, but represent only low latitudes on the Moon’s nearside. Information about the lunar farside has been restricted to remote sensing observations and thus the global distribution and origin of lunar surface water are still debated. Here we performed laboratory analyses of samples from the lunar farside at mid-latitudes returned by the Chang’e-6 mission. We find that the samples have very low δD values (as low as −983‰) and high water contents (up to 1.7 wt%) in the topmost layers of grains, indicating that solar-wind implantation is the primary source. The water contents are comparable to those reported for Chang’e-5 samples from mid-latitudes on the nearside, but nearly double those of Apollo samples. Infrared reflectance spectra further reveal that the bulk Chang’e-6 samples exhibit stronger OH/H2O features and higher maturity than Chang’e-5 samples, despite both showing similar water content profiles with depth. These findings suggest that the distribution of water on the lunar surface is strongly dependent on latitude, with the bulk water content also depending on regolith maturity. Our findings imply that lunar surface water may be more abundant in highly mature regolith in high-latitude regions.

The directing effect of the carbonyl of amides and esters facilitates the iron catalyst in overcoming the substantial steric hindrance and numerous competing side reactions, allowing the reaction to proceed smoothly. The current study develops a directing strategy for highly steric reductive coupling reactions, and offers new insights into the efficient construction of complex C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds using iron catalysts modified with phosphine ligands. Iron-catalyzed C–C reductive coupling avoids sensitive reagents but struggles to build quaternary centers. Using phosphine-ligated Fe and carbonyl directing groups, this work enables tertiary–primary/secondary C(sp³) coupling under mild conditions."

 Mucosal influenza vaccines may provide improved protection against infection and transmission, but their development is hindered by absence of immune correlates of protection. Here, we report a randomized, controlled phase I trial of a recombinant influenza A/H5 (A/Indonesia/05/2005, clade 2.1) hemagglutinin vaccine formulated with a nanoemulsion adjuvant (W805EC). The vaccine is administered intranasally in two doses 28 days apart at three antigen levels. Controls receive unadjuvanted H5 or placebo. Six months later, participants receive an intramuscular boost with unadjuvanted inactivated A/H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, clade 1) vaccine. Primary outcomes are solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs), laboratory safety abnormalities, medically-attended AEs, potential immune-mediated conditions, new-onset chronic conditions, and serious AEs. All vaccines are well tolerated. After the intranasal series, hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization responses are minimal. However, adjuvanted H5 recipients show significant increases in mucosal and serum IgG/IgA, surface plasmon resonance antibody binding, memory B and CD4 T cell activity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Following H5N1 boost, participants mount robust responses across measurements and have microneutralization responses against diverse H5N1 clades (including circulating clade 2.3.4.4b). Findings demonstrate successful mucosal priming and broad cross-clade responses. This intranasal vaccine supports further exploration of mucosal immune biomarkers and may accelerate development of intranasal influenza vaccines.

 Compute-in-memory technology offers promising solutions for neural network acceleration but its potential is severely limited by inflexible and resource-intensive analog-to-digital converters. Here, we present a memristor-based analog-to-digital converter featuring adaptive quantization for diverse output distributions. Our design employs analog content-addressable memory cells with programmable overlapped boundaries to establish optimized quantization thresholds, demonstrating excellent integral and differential non-linearities. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of our approach by achieving 89.55% accuracy on CIFAR-10 (VGG8) at 5-bit adaptive quantized precision and maintaining competitive performance on ImageNet (ResNet18) through a proposed super-resolution strategy under experimental memristor variations. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, our converter achieves a 15.1× improvement in energy efficiency and a 12.9× reduction in area. Furthermore, integrating our converter into CIM systems reduces the energy and area overhead by up to 57.2% and 30.7%, respectively.

Here, the authors fill this gap showing that such representations can successfully and rigorously approximate bosonic physics. 
 Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect to Bose–Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typically, truncating their infinite-dimensional state space or restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to these simple classes, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional spaces. Can we trust that results obtained with such simplifying assumptions capture real effects? We solve this outstanding problem, showing that these effective descriptions do correctly capture the physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contributions are twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical bosonic unitary evolution can be accurately approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, show that polynomial Hamiltonians generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and lead to a bosonic Solovay–Kitaev theorem. Bosonic systems live in an infinite-dimensional space, and in order to be able to describe them one usually reduces it to an effective finite dimension or constrain the dynamics in some way, but it is not fully understood whether this captures all the physics at play.

Here, the authors discover an alternate site on nuclear receptors that can be targeted by degraders. 
 Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) containing a target protein ligand linked to an E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand induce target protein degradation through E3 recruitment. Most PROTACs bind a surface cleft of the protein of interest rather than a buried pocket. Using the nuclear receptor PXR, we previously described the inherent difficulties of PROTAC targeting via a deep solvent-inaccessible ligand binding pocket. Here, we discover that the CRBN-dependent MDM2 PROTAC MD-224 is a potent PXR degrader that achieves its activity from binding adjacent to the ligand-binding pocket. Furthermore, because the proximal region is a structural feature common among nuclear receptors, MD-224 also targets additional receptors for proteasomal degradation. Using structure- and activity-guided medicinal chemistry, we ablated MDM2 degradation and generated MD-224 analogs with activities skewed toward different receptors. Thus, we describe (1) PROTAC repurposing as a potential route of degrader discovery and (2) nuclear receptor-targeted degradation through a noncanonical binding site. Chemically induced protein degradation is a powerful alternative to classical inhibition, but some proteins have deeply masked binding pockets that make the development of degrader molecules difficult.

 The human circadian clock integrates external environmental changes and internal physiological signals to generate natural oscillations of secreted endocrine signals to regulate diverse biological processes. Here, we explore human receptors responsive to molecules displaying in vivo oscillatory patterns and identify melatonin receptor 1A (MTNR1A) as a promising molecular sensor to trigger transgene expression. We engineer a melatonin-inducible gene switch consisting of ectopically expressed MTNR1A linked to an amplifier module utilizing the native Gαs protein-mediated cell signaling cascade, which involves adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, protein kinase A and the cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB, to drive transgene expression from a synthetic promoter. This system operates within the physiological melatonin concentration range, selectively responding to night-phase levels of the diurnal rhythm, while remaining unresponsive to day-phase levels. Such temporal control suggests its potential for personalized cell- and gene-based therapies requiring once-per-day dosing regimen. As proof-of-concept, we show that alginate-encapsulated engineered cells implanted in C3H/HeJ male mice can translate circadian inputs or clinically licensed MTNR1A agonists into regulated GLP-1 expression as a therapeutic output exclusively secreted during nighttime, highlighting potential as an experimental cell therapy for obesity-dependent type-2 diabetes.

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends describing low-probability outcomes using negative verbal probability terms such as unlikely, rather than positive terms such as a small probability. However, we propose that this choice of probability terms might undermine public perception and understanding of climate science. Across eight preregistered experiments (N = 4,150), we find that participants perceive outcomes described with negative low probability terms as reflecting lower scientific consensus than probabilistically equivalent but positively framed terms. The effect persists after controlling for beliefs in climate change, familiarity with the IPCC and political orientation, although it weakens when the projected values exceeded participants’ personal expectations. Participants also associate negative low-probability terms more strongly with extreme outcomes and judge them as less evidence-based than their positive counterparts. We recommend using positive verbal probabilities to communicate comparable levels of uncertainty without undermining perceptions of scientific consensus and evidence. Effective communication of uncertainty is vital for public accurate understanding of climate science.

 The Atlantic Niño is the dominant mode of interannual variability in the Tropical Atlantic with significant impacts on local and remote climate patterns. Despite recent advances in understanding the mechanisms leading to weakened Atlantic Niño variability, its primary causes remain unknown. Here, we use an Earth System Model to show that the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modulates air-sea feedbacks in the equatorial Atlantic through both atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections. The combination of a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the propagation of oceanic downwelling Kelvin waves due to an AMOC weakening, generated in the subpolar North Atlantic, deepens the eastern thermocline and weakens the equatorial trade winds, leading to a decoupling in air-sea feedbacks. Finally, we show that adding the effect of meltwater in future projections reduces the upwelling feedback strength by 60 ± 6% in 2100, with potential changes in the Atlantic Niño-driven rainfall."

 Phytoplankton net primary production in the Arctic has historically been constrained to a short, intense summer bloom that sustains fish, seabird, and marine mammal populations. However, climate change is altering Arctic phytoplankton bloom phenology. We use an ensemble of Earth system model simulations to isolate the impact of climate change on the timing, duration, and importance (relative contribution to total net primary production) of the bloom. Earlier blooms emerge across 71% of the Arctic Ocean by 2100, when blooms begin 34 days earlier and last 15 days longer than in 1970. Productivity is less concentrated in a single bloom in sub-Arctic seas and on Arctic inflow shelves by 2100, indicating that the bloom declines in importance.

 During an earthquake rupture, both dynamic and static stress drop play a key role in controlling how much energy is radiated as seismic waves, how large is the fault slip, and how quickly the rupture spreads out of the nucleation zone. Using a time-domain analysis of P- and S-wave log-displacement records, we estimate seismic moment, rupture velocity, static stress drop, and source radius of 56 Md 3+ earthquakes detected during the 2020-2025 seismic crisis at Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy. Fractures propagated at sub-shear velocities (0.4-0.9 of the shear wave velocity) along 100-1000 m in radius fault surfaces. Independent stress release estimates show a statistically significant inverse relation with the rupture velocity. The measured low seismic radiation efficiency, with a median value of 0.1, suggests that only a small portion of the stress drop is radiated as seismic waves, implying that a significant amount of energy is likely dissipated through frictional and inelastic processes, including off-fault damage. The findings suggest that in this volcanic caldera, earthquakes with higher stress drop may enhance fault-surrounding damage, which acts as a natural barrier to rupture propagation. Consequently, this mechanism could limit rupture extent and constrain the maximum magnitude of earthquakes in the area.

 The expansion of natural gas production and utilization worldwide has led to the decline of many once-productive wells, eventually resulting in costly well-plugging and unused infrastructure. However, in areas like the Michigan basin, MI, where the majority of natural gas is biogenically produced, microbial communities could potentially be stimulated to generate additional methane, increasing gas supply and reducing the need to drill new wells. In this study, we performed metaproteomic, metagenomic, and geochemical analyses of Antrim Shale formation water from a marginally producing natural gas well to evaluate resident microbial community functions in the context of potential bioenergy production. Functional proteins involved in methanogenesis, degradation/catabolism (including organic matter degradation), biosynthesis, energy utilization, transmembrane transport, and stress response were among the most commonly identified groups. Three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were characterized, including Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanothrix, and Smithella.

 Accurate maps of cropland soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and clay content are essential for climate-smart agriculture. Soil reflectance composites (SRC), derived from multispectral bare soil observations, offer a scalable approach to high-resolution soil mapping. While studies often focus on maximizing model performance, challenges remain regarding (1) the bias introduced by masking and excluding soil samples during SRC generation and (2) the accurate representation of the full range and distribution of soil properties in the resulting maps. Evaluating different SRC parameters, we found that commonly used indices such as the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were significantly correlated with clay content and SOCS, respectively. These dependencies can lead to the systematic exclusion of high SOCS (>80 Mg ha−1) and clay (>30 mass%) samples during SRC generation, introducing bias in the resulting maps. Models trained solely on SRC bands failed to capture the full range of the training data, limiting the applicability of the soil property maps. While the inclusion of additional remote sensing features, such as spectral-temporal metrics and indices, significantly improved the prediction accuracy, the representation of the imbalanced samples remained challenging. We demonstrated that a combined framework of spatial data augmentation and majority undersampling was effective in improving the range and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the predictions (SOCS = 0.82; Clay = 0.9). Our findings emphasize the importance of (1) evaluating excluded samples to identify potential SRC-induced bias, and (2) optimizing model predictions reflecting the observed data range to improve the reliability and usability of the resulting soil maps."

 High-resolution monitoring of root-zone soil moisture is essential for optimizing irrigation in precision agriculture. This study demonstrates the potential of drone-borne Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) to map spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics across an agricultural field over an entire growing season. Using the innovative gprSense® system, which combines a frequency-domain radar with full-wave inversion, we achieved precise and automated data acquisition and processing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement time-lapse, root-zone soil moisture mapping using drone-borne GPR combined with real-time full-wave inversion. Time-lapse mapping was conducted in a spinach field, yielding eight high-resolution soil moisture maps that captured dynamic variations driven by precipitation and irrigation. Operating in the frequency range 110–120 MHz, the system measured soil moisture down to a depth of approximately 35–40 cm, with comparisons performed using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and mass balance analyses. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) provided complementary data into soil electrical conductivity patterns. Results revealed strong agreement between GPR-derived soil moisture estimates and conventional methods, with spatial patterns aligning closely with predictions from Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. These findings demonstrate the capacity of drone-borne GPR to deliver actionable, root-zone scale insights for real-time irrigation optimization and agricultural water management."

 Current disaster and emergency management services produce flood maps within hours using satellite data. To handle large-scale events efficiently, a reliable automated method is needed to generate an initial flood extent map, which can then be refined manually.Launched in December 2022, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, equipped with the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn), provides high-resolution radar observations used here for flood detection. While not initially designed for detailed flood mapping in vegetated or urban regions, the performance of SWOT’s Pixel Cloud products was assessed during four major flood events in Greece, France, Brazil, and the USA. Each event is paired with Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 imagery within a 3-hour time frame, providing a valuable opportunity to compare and evaluate SWOT’s flood detection capabilities.Three radar variables of the Pixel Cloud products are studied for extracting flood extents: σ0, coherent power, and interferometric coherence — which is computed from the two complex interferograms. They are compared to the built-in classification and flood masks computed from Sentinel-1/2. The study demonstrates the capabilities of the SWOT satellite in detecting flooded vegetation, flooded urban areas, and even regions with high snow cover. However, limitations are observed: (1) when high soil moisture is observed, causing signal saturation, (2) SWOT can be sensitive to the incidence angle, both of which lead to less reliable flood extent estimation. These findings highlight the potential of SWOT satellite for improving global flood mapping, as well as the need for further exploration to address current limitations and enhance flood monitoring capabilities in the near future."

 With the continuous advancement of global urbanization and industrialization, the pollution issue (e.g., light pollution) has become increasingly severe, posing a serious threat to the global dark sky quality. Evaluating the global dark sky quality and conducting site selection for potential dark sky parks not only contribute to the protection of natural ecosystems and the safeguarding of ecological security, but also provide scientific reference for sustainable ecotourism. Thus, our study integrated remote sensing nighttime light, cloud cover, and other data to develop a global dark sky quality identification based on the random forest model, effectively achieving interannual and seasonal dynamic identification of global dark sky quality. Then, the study defined global construction potential constraints and conducted site selection research for potential conventional dark sky parks and potential seasonal dark sky parks. The results show that in 2023, areas with high dark sky quality accounted for only 20.6 % globally, mainly distributed in high-altitude or arid regions worldwide, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, inland Australia, and other areas. From 2012 to 2023, global dark sky quality exhibited an interannual fluctuation pattern of “decline–rise–decline” and further showed significant seasonal differences. In addition, the identified potential conventional dark sky parks are mainly distributed in southern Africa, the southwestern United States, and other regions, while potential seasonal dark sky parks are mainly located in the Korean Peninsula, southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and other areas. Our study can provide a scientific reference for global light pollution control, ecotourism development, and policymaking on nighttime environmental protection, supporting strategic progress assessment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and SDG 15: Life on Land)."

 Seafloor topography is a fundamental element of the marine environment, playing a critical role in understanding geological evolution, hydrodynamic patterns, sediment distribution and benthic habitat structure. However, due to the low resolution of existing seafloor digital elevation models (DEMs), refined modelling techniques that can accurately represent the complexity of seafloor topographic environment are urgently needed. Aiming to address this need, this study introduces Bathy-DDPM, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) that incorporates shipborne bathymetric data into its loss function to enhance DEM super-resolution. Leveraging GEBCO DEM data and single-beam bathymetric measurements, the model employs transfer learning by pretraining on land-based data and fine-tuning with limited marine datasets. Experimental results show that Bathy-DDPM consistently outperforms traditional interpolation methods and existing deep learning models (Bathy-CNN, Bathy-GAN, Bathy-TfaSR and Bathy-MSRResNet) across all the evaluation metrics. Compared to the advanced MSRResNet model, Bathy-DDPM achieves 18.2% reduction in MAE and a 15.2% reduction in RMSE, highlighting the efficacy of DDPM-based architectures in reconstructing complex seafloor topography. Additionally, Bathy-DDPM exhibits rapid convergence during training, improving training efficiency. The integration of shipborne bathymetric points also enhances performance across various deep learning models, particularly within GAN-based architectures. Furthermore, analysis results of bathymetry loss weight and measurement point density reveal that both factors notably influence model performance, with optimal results achieved at moderate loss weights and high spatial sampling densities. Overall, Bathy-DDPM shows strong potential for high-resolution seafloor reconstruction in data-scarce regions, offering valuable support for geospatial analysis and marine scientific research."

 Under the dual pressures of climate change and rapid urbanization, the frequent occurrence of flood disasters has become a global challenge. The widespread use of social media provides new perspectives for broader and more comprehensive perception of flood disaster events, and a social media-enabled flood disaster informatics framework has gradually taken shape. This study systematically reviews 607 publications from 2004 to 2024, aiming to reveal the research progress of utilizing social media big data in flood disaster management. By constructing a “method–technology–application” full-chain flood disaster informatics framework, this study highlights the flood information processing workflow featuring social media data, covering multiple aspects including social media data analysis, flood event detection, flood situation awareness, flood risk mapping, and emergency management practices. The literature review indicates that social media has been proven effective in compensating for the limitations of traditional flood monitoring approaches. In particular, multimodal data fusion and the application of artificial intelligence techniques can significantly enhance global flood monitoring capabilities. However, current research still faces challenges such as verifying data authenticity and integrating information across platforms. Future research should focus on exploring the transformative applications of foundation models (e.g., large language models, vision foundation models, and multimodal large models) with social media, including massive multi-source heterogeneous information understanding, generative disaster reporting and decision support, as well as real-time prediction and emergency simulation incorporating physical mechanisms. These advances are expected to drive a profound transformation of the intelligent emergency decision-making paradigm and provide a solid theoretical and technical foundation for the development of smart flood emergency management systems."

 Daily actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial variable for efficient water resource management and irrigation planning, highlighting the need for timely and accurate ET products to support agricultural decision-making. This study presents a practical workflow for generating all-weather, daily ET data by integrating remote sensing and meteorological inputs. A pixel-wise land surface temperature (LST)–fractional vegetation cover (FVC) space is constructed based on energy balance theory, and a combination of remote sensing, meteorological, and physical model outputs are used as input features for machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate ET. To address data gaps caused by cloud cover, land surface temperature (LST) derived from the Noah land surface model was utilized to supplement missing MODIS LST data, and separate ML models were developed for cloud-free and cloud-cover conditions. The ET predicted by both these models were integrated to produce all-weather ET. A comparative analysis between latent heat flux (LE) derived from this workflow and in-situ measurements collected in Nebraska (NE) during 2004 and 2012 demonstrated robust performance, R2 and RMSE are 0.70 and 90.03 W/M2 (NE1), 0.75 and 78.50 W/m2 (NE2) and 0.75 and 79.77 W/m2 (NE3), respectively. In the daily ET validation for 2020, R2 and RMSEs are 0.76 and 0.96 mm, 0.75 and 1.04 mm, and 0.75 and 0.93 mm. Both profile and wall-to-wall comparisons demonstrate that the all-weather ET product effectively captures annual ET variability across the study region. The ET dataset is updated daily and is publicly accessible via CropSmart Data Information Portal."

 In climatology, the South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon (SCSSM) onset features rapid establishment of low-level westerlies and convection across the entire basin, in contrast to Indian summer monsoon onset which begins with northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Diverse SCSSM onset pathways complicate subseasonal rainfall forecasts in the surrounding region during boreal spring. Besides simultaneous onset in the SCS, this study recognizes two other types of SCSSM onset: northern-initiated and southern-initiated pathways. In the northern-initiated type, the low-level westerly wind begins over northern SCS, accompanied by a positive Tripole mode in the North Atlantic and decaying El Niño SSTAs in the Pacific. This SSTA configuration regulates the extra-tropical meridional cell and tropical Walker circulation to shift the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) southward, suppressing (intensifying) westerly wind in the southern (northern) SCS. In contrast, the southern-initiated type features initiation of westerly wind in the southern SCS. This type is ascribed to the tropical southern Indian Ocean cooling and negative Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM)-like pattern. The colder Indian Ocean boosts northward migration of ITCZ over Arabian Sea, which strengthens low-level westerly wind over the southern SCS by enhancing cross-equatorial Somali jet and shifts the WPSH northward, thereby suppressing the monsoon onset over the northern SCS. This pattern is developed by the PMM-like related easterly wind in the tropical Pacific Ocean. These findings shed new light on SCSSM onset behavior and show potential implications for prediction regional precipitation."

 This study reports the first observation of dual upward positive leaders (UPL1 and UPL2) emerging between the initial continuous current (ICC) termination and the first return stroke (RS1) in rocket-triggered lightning. Synchronized current, electric field measurements, and high-speed optical imaging were used to analyze the propagation characteristics and triggering mechanisms of these two leaders. Bipolar variations in the electric field indicate that both UPLs were related to the approach of intracloud negative leaders. UPL1, an attempted leader that failed to connect to the cloud, exhibited a two-dimensional (2-D) propagation speed ranging from 0.10 × 106 to 4.31 × 106 m/s, with an average speed of 1.63 × 106 m/s, significantly higher than that of traditional UPLs in triggered lightning. The high speed was due to the pre-ionized channel by the ICC stage. UPL2 successfully connected to the negative charge region in the cloud, establishing a stable discharge channel. Analysis of optical and electric field diagrams indicates that the successful connection was closely related to improved channel conditions and UPL1-induced dynamic modulation of the ambient electric field. These findings shed light on the physical mechanisms of multiple leader attempts during the ICC-RS transition, providing new insights into the complexity of lightning discharge processes."

Our method shows consistent results with previous studies but also provide new information about possible bimodality of the ASMA and inter-annual decrease of the ASMA area. 
 The definition of the boundary of the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) (350–410 K) is a known challenge that highly impacts the information about the anticyclone's behavior and affects the results when studying of its interannual variability.  We present a novel method based on the absolute vortex moments that defines the ASMA boundary by solving an optimization problem. Here, we address the ASMA's climatology (1980–2023), interannual variability, the variability of the start and end dates and the duration of the anticyclone peak phase calculated with help of the defined novel method by using the ERA5 reanalysis provided by ECMWF. In addition, three individual years – 2017, 2022 and 2023 are highlighted during which aircraft campaigns took place to measure air inside the ASMA or its outflow (StratoClim, ACCLIP, PHILEAS). The interannual analysis is based on the anticyclone's centroid latitude and longitude, excess kurtosis, angle and aspect ratio using four isentropic surfaces: 350, 370, 390 and 410 K. Our findings show that the ASMA area decreases at 370, 390 and 410 K over the period 1980–2023 in contrast to previous studies. Further, we provide evidence of possible bimodality of the ASMA where the spatial distribution shows clustering of high-magnitude values (the Montgomery streamfunction values minus an optimized background value) around two centers on climatological data over 44 years as well as counting the number of days when two anticyclones (or two modes) where found simultaneously."

We demonstrate that global aerosol forcing signal can be robustly reproduced across resolutions when aerosol activation processes are carefully parameterized. Further, we argue that simplified prescribed aerosol schemes will open the door for further process/mechanism studies under controlled conditions. 
 Aerosol effective radiative forcing critically influences climate projections but remains poorly constrained. Using the Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (SCREAM) v1 configuration, we assess the sensitivity of the radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol changes using a simplified prescribed aerosol scheme (SPA) derived from E3SM v3. Nudged simulations at 3 and 12 km horizontal grid spacings reveal a more negative aerosol forcing than the reference 100 km E3SM v3 whence the SPA properties are derived. The resulting globally averaged aerosol forcing signal is largely due to aerosol–cloud interactions and exhibits little overall resolution sensitivity, while hints of resolution sensitivity appear regionally between the 3 and 12 km runs. While the default SPA scheme overestimates cloud droplet dependence on aerosols, parameterization adjustments in the activation process reconcile forcing estimates with the reference model. Our results demonstrate the ability to use a prescribed aerosol scheme to hold aerosol forcing to a desired strength across resolutions."

From the data, heating and cooling as well as drying and moistening of the air masses along their way into and out of the Arctic could be measured for the first time. These data are used to evaluate if weather prediction models are able to accurately represent these air mass transformations. This work helps to model the future Arctic climate changes, which may have an impact for mid-latitude weather as well. 
 Profiles of thermodynamic and cloud properties and their transformations during Arctic Warm Air Intrusions (WAIs) and Cold Air Outbreaks (CAOs) were observed during an aircraft campaign, and simulated using the ICON weather prediction model. The data were collected along flight patterns aimed at sampling the same air parcels multiple times, enabling Eulerian and quasi-Lagrangian measurement-model comparisons and model process studies. Within the Eulerian framework, the temperature profiles agreed well with the ICON output although a small model bias of −0.9 K was detected over sea ice during CAOs. Also, the air parcels did not adjust to the changing surface skin temperature quickly enough. The specific humidity profiles were reproduced by ICON with mean deviations of 6.0 % and 19.5 % for WAIs and CAOs, respectively. Radar reflectivities based on ICON output captured the vertical cloud distributions during the airmass transformations. The simulated process rates of temperature and humidity along the trajectories showed that adiabatic processes dominated the heating and cooling of the air parcels over diabatic effects during both WAIs and CAOs. Of the diabatic processes, latent heating and turbulence had a stronger impact on the temperature process rates than terrestrial radiative effects, especially over the warm ocean surface during CAOs. Finally, a quasi-Lagrangian observation-model comparison was performed. For WAIs, the observed change rates of temperature and humidity were not perfectly captured in the simulations. For the CAOs, the calculated heating and moistening change rates of the airmasses were well represented by ICON with remaining deviations close to the surface."

Among them, the Goda and Elfouhaily spectra are well applied for remote sensing simulations. However, they do not consider the sea state factor well. In this research, based on them, we apply the spectra measured from the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring instrument and establish a Combined Spectrum. Validation indicates the established spectrum is closer to the SWIM described sea surface with varied sea states. 
 The one-dimensional ocean wave spectra (1D spectra) describing the total energy of the ocean waves are vital for providing ocean surface roughness information in remote sensing simulations. Most existing wave spectrum models deviate from real ocean surface descriptions due to limitations of observation methods and approximation in theories applied to generating them. In this research, the widely applied Goda and Elfouhaily spectra in their 1D form are compared with the remote sensing products from the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on-board the China France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT). Differences between models and the measurements are addressed, and the causes are analysed before concluded in terms of sea states. Then, a Combined spectrum (C spectrum) considering varied sea states is proposed as a closer model to the observations of the real sea, where parameterization of the spectral peak enhancement factor (γ) is achieved by the inverse wave age and wave steepness for multiple sea states. Then the specific values of the all-state sea are obtained from SWIM observations. The validation of the C spectrum is achieved by comparisons with SWIM measurements not utilized during the model establishment, and with buoy measurements. The difference index (DI) and the R-squared (R2), are calculated for evaluation of the results, indicating that the C spectrum demonstrates closer fitting to the SWIM and buoy measurements than both Goda and Elfouhaily spectra. The DI and R2 for the C spectrum are compared to the Goda spectrum, which is closer to SWIM measurements than E spectrum. Results suggest the C spectrum is suitable for providing information required for remote sensing applications."

This paper describes the protocols and data available for modeling groups to add this anomalous freshwater to their ocean modules to better represent the impacts of these fluxes on ocean circulation, sea ice, salinity and sea level. 
 Anomalous freshwater fluxes from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and ice shelves are impacting the surrounding oceans, and we need to be able to account for these effects in climate model simulations over the historical period and in future projections. In previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), models mostly either assumed that the ice sheets were in mass balance, or that discharge from the ice sheets was constant, but in neither case was the observed increasing discharge over the historical period properly represented. In this paper, we present data products of absolute and anomalous freshwater mass fluxes from both major ice sheets, and recommendations for their use in historical simulations. These fluxes can be implemented in climate simulations as a forcing for models that do not (yet) include interactive ice sheets, or used to evaluate models that do. We also make recommendations for how climatological and anomalous fluxes can be implemented in climate models that may have different approaches to interactions with the ice sheets. These forcings are available for CMIP7 simulations and should lead to more robust and coherent simulation of sea surface temperature, sea ice and regional sea level trends in the recent historical period and, as these data are extended, improve the credibility of projections."

By decomposing model outputs into oscillatory components, we preserve critical information across various timescales, ensuring more reliable projections. This improved reliability supports strategic decisions in sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and disaster preparedness. 
 Bias correction is a crucial step in using Earth system model outputs for assessments, as it adjusts systematic errors by comparing the model to observations. However, standard methods – ranging from mean-based linear scaling to distribution-based quantile mapping  typically treat bias correction as a single-scale process, overlooking the fact that biases can manifest differently across daily, seasonal, and annual timescales. In this study, we propose a novel, timescale-aware bias-correction approach built on Empirical Mode Decomposition. By decomposing the meteorological signal into multiple oscillatory components and aggregating them to represent distinct timescales, we apply targeted corrections to each component, thereby preserving both short- and long-term structure in the data. Experimental illustrations show that the timescale-aware EMDBC framework matches the performance of conventional quantile-delta mapping (QDM) at the native daily scale and achieves progressively larger bias reductions at bi-weekly, seasonal, and annual scales. As a result, the proposed approach offers a more robust path to accurate and reliable Earth system projections, strengthening their utility for resilience and adaptation planning."

For each FeX alloy, we interpolate elastic tensors across the pressure and temperature range of the inner core and model the anisotropy resulting from flow during core growth. Lastly, we compare predicted PKIKP travel times with observations to determine the best fitting alloy.

Using observations and data‐assimilating model output, the impact of seasonal extension of the eastern WG on the local eddy kinetic energy (EKE) field was investigated. By altering the ambient density field, the gyre seasonal extension modulates both EKE production via baroclinic instability (BCC) and EKE redistribution through the pressure work (PW). When WG extends eastward in autumn‐winter, the more enhanced PW drives EKE outward flux outweighing its local production by BCC. In contrast, during spring‐summer as WG contracts, the dominant role of BCC production over PW removal favors EKE accumulation. Understanding these dynamics is critical to predicting eddy‐induced warm inflow into a potentially expanding WG under climate change, and also provides insight into interactions between eddy and mean flow fields in the Southern Ocean."

Here, using an Earth System Model, we find TP darkening contributes to North Pacific Meridional Mode‐like cooling anomaly over the subtropical Pacific particularly in boreal winter and spring. This anomaly induces persistent annual near‐surface easterly winds in equatorial Pacific and strengthens Walker Circulation in a series of atmosphere‐ocean interactions, culminating in an intensified tropical Pacific zonal temperature gradient especially during boreal summer and autumn.

A similar anti‐correlated variation is identified in the latitude of the midlatitude ionospheric trough (MIT) minimum, derived from electron density measurements by the DMSP F16 satellite.

In the magnetosheath, significant parallel temperature enhancement occurs within a thin layer on the flux rope's surface.

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is experiencing significant accelerated warming with the Amazon's warming‐drying impact exhibiting interdecadal differences around 2004. During 1981–2004 (P1), Amazonian warming in March, by exciting the North Atlantic Tripole pattern, enhanced the African jet stream and triggered the eastward propagation of Rossby waves leading to an abnormal strengthening of the northern wind over the TP in April. This suppressed snowmelt and expanded snow cover, significantly increasing albedo and thereby inhibiting warming in the central and western TP. From 2005 to 2023 (P2), TP surface skin temperature (SKT) and soil moisture replaced snow albedo as the dominant factor for warming. The Amazon's warm‐dry signal extended northward, triggering warming in the Greenland Sea and exciting anomalous wave trains propagating southeastward. These waves intensified TP warming by regulating atmospheric circulation and surface radiation processes. The study demonstrates that as the Amazon Rainforest approaches a climate critical point, the cross‐continental teleconnection mechanism with the TP undergoes fundamental changes, highlighting the nonlinear impact of climate subsystems' critical states on amplification effects. This finding provides a dynamical basis for understanding the synergistic effects of global climate critical points."

Although previous studies have used remote sensing data to assess the impact of PV facilities on greenness, there is still a lack of in‐depth exploration into the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation changes within these facilities and their driving factors. This study focuses on the Yellow River Basin, a region severely affected by soil erosion, using PV data sets from 2010 to 2021 and 30‐m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to conduct a pixel‐level analysis of the environmental impacts of PV facilities. The results reveal that, while 60% of PV‐occupied areas exhibited increased greenness post‐deployment, only 14% of facilities showed overall greening, and 72% exhibited less greening than their respective control areas. These findings indicate that PV deployment does not result in net greening at the landscape scale. Higher background greenness was associated with better vegetation recovery within PV facilities. Human activities also significantly influenced greenness change within PV facility. The intensity of land disturbance during PV construction may hinder vegetation recovery, but human management post PV construction appears to mitigate previous land uses, leading to vegetation improvement within PV installations. These findings underscore the importance of scientifically planning PV facilities in fragile regions, suggesting that appropriate site selection and management can facilitate sustainable renewable energy development and promote ecosystem restoration."

 Phosphorus is a critically limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems, with alkaline phosphatases (APases) playing a vital role in liberating phosphate from organic compounds. However, the dominant taxa and APase families driving the marine phosphorus cycle, particularly in the deep ocean, remain poorly understood. Equally enigmatic remains the (multi)functional diversity and mechanisms of action of different APases. To address these gaps, this study combines global multi-omic analyses, biochemical studies of purified recombinant proteins, and laboratory experiments with proteomics and enzymatic rate measurements. Here we show that multi-omics consistently identify Alteromonas as a primary contributor to APase expression and production, with PhoA as the dominant APase family, particularly in the deep ocean. Furthermore, all four major APase families (PhoA, PhoD, PhoX, PafA) exhibit multifunctionality, revealing distinct substrate preferences and regulatory mechanisms. Ultimately, this study expands the mechanistic understanding of the marine phosphorus cycle, while revealing the significance of enzyme multifunctionality in elemental cycles.

 The ocean, because of its ability to store heat and as the biggest mediator of water exchanges on Earth, modulates the climate from years to centuries. By combining Water Mass transformation and the Temporal-Residual-Mean frameworks, together with a direct estimation of turbulent diffusivity (computed through an artificial intelligence method), we determine temperature and salinity transformations along density surfaces. Because isopycnal transformations barely alter the density field, they remain hidden from the ocean dynamics. Here we unveil these hidden, isopycnal transformations from in situ observations at 1000-m depth. We shows that these isopycnal transformations are 5 times as large as their diapycnal counterpart and are occurring for  ~ 67% in the Southern Ocean. Our estimations stress the role of the spatially-varying and anisotropic characteristics of isopycnal diffusion, often not considered in ocean models.

 Avena fatua (weedy oat) is a globally pervasive weed, notorious for its adaptability to extreme environments and herbicide tolerance. Here, we present the 10.98-Gb hexaploid genome of A. fatua and a variation map from 768 wild and cultivated oats (A. fatua, A. sterilis and A. sativa), elucidating their genetic relationship and evolutionary history. Population genomic analyses reveal genetic connections between A. fatua and cultivated naked oats, and identify divergent regions between A. fatua and A. sativa enriched in genes associated with biotic and abiotic stresses. Among them, a herbicide-resistance locus is identified on chromosome 4D, with A. fatua accessions carrying a highly differentiated haplotype from cultivated oats. Multi-omics profiling and functional validation demonstrate that one expanded GST gene in this locus contributes significantly to oat herbicide resistance. Our study provides genomic resources for understanding A. fatua’s broad adaptability to diverse environmental conditions, facilitating the development of climate-resilient oat varieties.

 Extreme heat events are observed increasingly in eastern China during recent high-summer (July–August), yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we reveal considerable changes in local interannual temperature variability, manifesting as the enhancing south-north uniform warming (SNUW) mode and the disappearing south-north meridional dipole (SNMD) mode. The strengthening interannual SNUW variability is mainly associated with the increasing interannual variability of Pakistan convective precipitation and Arctic Oscillation, with the former linked to anthropogenic warming and the latter reflecting natural fluctuations. The decline in the interannual SNMD variability can be linked to the reduced interannual sea-ice variability in the Barents-Kara seas after 2004, which is associated with the disappearance of the Rossby wavetrain propagating towards eastern China. Moreover, projections from climate models suggest that future SNUW amplification will be dominated by increasing Pakistan convective precipitation variability; whereas the Arctic Oscillation influence is likely to be limited, featuring internal cyclical fluctuations of relatively small amplitude. Although models reproduce the SNUW mode reasonably well, their performance in simulating SNMD remains unsatisfactory, leaving the attribution of SNMD variability highly uncertain. Nevertheless, model projections consistently point to a further disappearance of the SNMD mode in the future. Together, these results highlight a fundamental reorganization of interannual temperature variability in eastern China under climate warming, and provide a new perspective for understanding the recent rapid changes in regional temperature variability."

 Porphyry copper (-gold) deposits in both arc and non-arc settings are hosted by oxidized magmatic rocks, but the exact mechanism by which the source magmas of these non-arc deposits become oxidized remains obscure. Through whole-rock geochemistry, mineral chemistry, and zircon isotopic analyses, here we show that the Neoproterozoic root of the Cretaceous Shaxi porphyry copper-gold deposit in the Jiangnan orogen is reduced and copper-sulfide rich, whereas the Cretaceous ore-forming magmas are oxidized. An oxidized mafic melt flushed the Neoproterozoic root zone, extracted copper and gold, and transported them to the upper crust where the Cretaceous Shaxi deposit formed. Evidence is recorded in growth zones of clinopyroxene, zircon, spinel, and plagioclase. Our results indicate that the relatively reduced, sulfide-enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle or lower crust is essential but not sufficient for the formation of fertile non-arc porphyry magmas.

 High-quality and temporally continuous surface reflectance data are essential for remote sensing applications, but cloud contamination introduces severe spatiotemporal gaps in optical satellite image time series (SITS). Recent multi-modal approaches, integrating optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with deep learning models, have advanced gap-free SITS reconstruction. However, several challenges remain. These include the reliance on external preprocessing to generate regular optical composite time series (e.g., 8-day intervals) and to temporally align SAR with optical data; insufficient modeling of the relationship between observation time series and their corresponding timestamps limits output flexibility, especially when generating predictions at any or user-specified time points; and reduced training and inference efficiency due to the incorporation of an additional modality (SAR). Collectively, these limitations hinder the practical applicability of current methods. To address the above challenges, this study proposes AnytimeFormer, a Transformer-based model for optical SITS reconstruction. First, AnytimeFormer accepts Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 observations along with their corresponding timestamps as input, and adaptively aligns temporally asynchronous multi-modal time series through a time-align attention module. Second, a low-rank fusion module is introduced to capture multi-modal information while preserving a lightweight architecture. Finally, a time-aware decoder enables the reconstruction of reflectance data at any user-specific time point. Extensive experiments conducted across eight globally distributed study sites, encompassing diverse land cover types and a range of cloud conditions, demonstrate the superior performance of AnytimeFormer (e.g., average RMSE: 0.03, R2: 0.95 at 80 % missing ratio) over benchmarks (HANTS, U-TILISE, STORI, RESTORE-DiT, et al.) under scenarios with different missing ratios and temporal pattern complexity. In terms of efficiency, compared to the suboptimal STORI, it reduces training time tenfold. Furthermore, the comparison with the Planet Fusion product shows a high consistency in temporal trends between the two and demonstrates AnytimeFormer's flexibility in reconstructing user-specified intervals. All the experiment results demonstrate that AnytimeFormer is a promising and practical solution for gap-free optical SITS reconstruction.

 Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) is tightly linked to photosynthetic electron transport and informs gross primary productivity (GPP) across scales. Sun-induced ChlF (SIF) is typically retrieved at specific wavelengths (e.g., Fraunhofer lines, oxygen absorption bands) within a narrow field of view (solid angle), and given in power units. This spectral SIF radiance, denoted SIFλ, is not directly photosynthetically relevant, rather, it is the integrated radiant exitance, SIFint, expressed in molar units and integrated over 660–800 nm and the full angular domain, that corresponds mechanistically to photosynthesis. It is generally assumed that the SIFλ is proportional to SIFint and that this proportionality is spatially and temporally invariant. Here we tested this assumption with spectrally resolved SIF measured in three crop and six tree species at the leaf level. We found that while SIFλ is significantly related to SIFint at individual Fraunhofer lines, this relationship varies with wavelength and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). We therefore developed a model to predict SIFint from SIFλ using wavelength and LCC as inputs. The model performed well across the ChlF emission band, particularly in the far-red region, enabling accurate conversion from observed SIFλ to mechanistically relevant SIFint. As an exploratory extension, the model was applied at the canopy scale for C3 and C4 crops with the Mechanistic Light Response model, yielding encouraging agreement between modeled and observed GPP. The core contribution of this work is establishing the SIFλ–SIFint relationship and a transfer model at the leaf scale, while the canopy application serves as an exploratory extension illustrating its scaling potential. Together, these findings provide a more mechanistically consistent basis for SIF-based GPP estimation and strengthen the application of fluorescence observations in carbon cycle research."

 Habitat suitability, which reflects how well environmental conditions support species survival, growth, and reproduction, is highly sensitive to climate change and human activities and underpins effective conservation policy-making. Traditional machine learning models for habitat suitability assessment often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships among environmental factors and suffer from limited spatial generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoKG-HSA, a novel framework leveraging geospatial knowledge graphs to enhance habitat suitability assessment. By adopting an ontology-based approach, GeoKG-HSA explicitly models semantic relationships among diverse environmental variables, enabling structured integration of multi-source heterogeneous habitat data. The framework further integrates symbolic domain knowledge with data-driven machine learning, establishing a hybrid paradigm that improves both interpretability and predictive accuracy. A case study on Tundra Swan habitat in a wetland ecosystem shows that, on average across four models, GeoKG-HSA improves precision by 0.147, recall by 0.281, and F1 score by 0.255. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores were also improved by 0.04 for the logistic regression model, 0.20 for the support vector machine model, 0.06 for the decision tree model, and 0.13 for the multi-layer perceptron model. Compared with the MaxEnt, GeoKG-HSA exhibits superior spatial generalization in regions with missing or sparse samples. These results demonstrate that GeoKG-HSA effectively integrates multi-source environmental data, enhances model generalizability, and significantly outperforms traditional Tabular-HSA methods.

 Correct classification of crop layers is crucial for crop growth tracking and estimating yields, but existing methods depends heavily on the completeness of data and ground truth labels. Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables crop mapping when data is limited. However, current SSL approaches fail to fully integrate information across spatiotemporal dimensions and lack the ability to learn and represent consistent ground object features. To this end, a self-supervised crop mapping framework is proposed, which integrates adaptive k-means clustering, graph convolution, and global spatiotemporal attention (SAKG). This framework reduces reliance on labeled data through contrastive learning and achieves implicit semantic grouping of crop spatiotemporal features using adaptive K-means clustering, graph convolution, and self-attention mechanisms, enhancing model robustness and representation of complex data while mitigating sample imbalance issues. Three experiments (cross spatial, cross temporal, cross Spatiotemporal) demonstrate that SAKG outperforms existing models in most transfer scenarios. Furthermore, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE) visualization verifies its effective reduction of spectral differences between the source and target domains, achieving consistent representation of crop features. Overall, this method can effectively utilize existing satellite data and labels to achieve large-scale crop mapping. The code can be obtained here: https://github.com/LijianXie/SAKG-net."

 Accurate land surface feature recognition is vital for geospatial analysis and Earth observation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels in generalization, offering significant potential for remote sensing (RS) monitoring with limited annotated data. This study proposes MM-SAM, a SAM-based framework enhanced with multimodal and multiscale adaptations for fine-grained segmentation of heterogeneous surfaces in open-pit mining areas. Leveraging an adaptive fine-tuning strategy with minimal learnable parameters, MM-SAM tackles domain-specific challenges in mining environments via two key architectural innovations: 1) Multimodal RS Fusion (MRF), a preprocessing adapter integrates multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, extending SAM’s input from RGB to multidimensional spectral-spatial representations, effectively mitigating spectral distortions caused by terrain variations and cloud occlusions. 2) Multiscale Feature Enhancement (MFE), a lightweight multiscale convolutional adapter is embedded in the image encoder, coupled with a refinement branch in the decoder. This enables the integration of global semantic coherence with multiscale localized details, addressing significant scale variations in mining features. Experimental results demonstrate that MM-SAM achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 69.99%, outperforming SAM by 17.88% and surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It also improves overall accuracy and macro F1 scores while showing robust temporal transferability, maintaining a consistent mIoU of 69.51% across datasets from different years. These confirm MM-SAM’s reliable performance and adaptability to open-pit mining landscapes, potentially advancing foundation models in complex geospatial tasks."

 Clouds play a critical role in climate change and the energy budget in the Arctic. The parameterization of cloud microphysics is crucial for simulating surface radiation and atmospheric vertical structure in the Arctic region. This study evaluates the performance of eight widely used cloud microphysics schemes in the Svalbard region during winter and summer, utilizing field observation data and the polar-optimized Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar-WRF). The results demonstrated that the choice of cloud microphysics scheme significantly influences surface radiation and simulations of the lower atmosphere. During winter, the Thompson, Morrison, and NSSL schemes effectively simulate surface radiation, whereas the Lin, Goddard, and WSM6 schemes excel in capturing the vertical structure of the atmosphere. In summer, the WSM6 and Thompson schemes show superior performance in simulating surface radiation, whereas the Thompson, Morrison, and CAM5.1 schemes better represent atmospheric profiles. The accuracy of cloud simulations is crucial for surface radiation, as all schemes tend to underestimate downward longwave radiation, primarily due to an overestimation of low cloud cover. In addition, challenges in simulating mixed-phase clouds, which are prevalent in the Svalbard region, were identified, with most schemes overestimating the ice water content and underestimating the liquid water content in winter. In summer, models tend to underestimate the cloud height and liquid water content of low-level clouds. These findings highlight the importance of accurately simulating low-level mixed-phase clouds to improve the understanding of surface–atmosphere interactions in the Arctic."

 Compound dry-hot events (CDHEs), characterized by the concurrence of drought and heat extremes, have become increasingly frequent and severe under climate change, posing significant risks to ecosystems, agriculture, and human society. Understanding the dominant drivers and their interactions across different temporal scales is critical for advancing prediction and attribution of such events. In this study, we develop regression models of the Standardized Compound Drought and Heat Index (SCDHI) at weekly, bi-weekly, and four-week scales for the middle-lower Yangtze River Basin. The models incorporate land-surface and near-surface factors—temperature, soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation-together with large-scale atmospheric circulation indices, including the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) and the strength (WS) and area (WA) of the western Pacific subtropical high. By applying explainable machine learning approaches-Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we systematically quantify the direct contributions of individual variables and their pairwise interactions. Results show that VPD is the most influential driver of CDHEs across all time scales. Circulation factors (Z500, WA, WS) and precipitation become increasingly important at longer scales, underscoring the influence of mid-tropospheric circulation patterns and the western Pacific subtropical high in sustaining extreme events. Notably, interactions across scales-from large-scale circulation anomalies (e.g., Z500) to near-surface atmospheric demand (e.g., VPD) - intensify with both event severity and time scale, underscoring the compound nature of CDHE formation. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive multi-scale attribution framework for CDHEs, demonstrating the added value of combining deep learning regression models with explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The findings not only enhance understanding of the physical mechanisms driving CDHEs but also offer methodological insights for future climate attribution and risk management in drought- and heat-prone regions."

The Agreement stipulates that countries’ NDCs will represent a progression and reflect their highest possible ambition (HPA). However, the vague conceptualisation of this HPA norm challenges its translation into practice, allowing states to reference ambition in their NDC without clear evidence. Recently, the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) advisory opinion on climate change provided clarification regarding this norm. The level of ambition communicated in an NDC is not entirely left to the discretion of states but must constitute an adequate contribution to the collective achievement of the global temperature goal. States are obliged to exercise due diligence to ensure their NDCs reflect their best efforts. Building on the ICJ’s interpretative guidance, we propose a structured framework to operationalise the HPA norm and reflect upon considerations of ambition in countries’ NDCs. The framework’s core pillars incorporate domestic, international, and implementation considerations in NDCs, elaborated upon in two elements per pillar. Under domestic considerations, NDCs should be based on a faithful assessment of mitigation options utilising national capabilities. International considerations require contributions that adequately support the LTTG while balancing equity. Implementation considerations demand that NDCs account for the co-impact of the measures considered and be actionable in the near term to ensure ambition is translated into action. The Paris Agreement-HPA Framework can support transparent communication of the conditions under which more ambitious targets can be pursued. We apply the framework to explore the engagement of current NDCs with the framework’s elements. Finally, the framework empowers societal stakeholders to interrogate, verify and, when necessary, challenge whether NDC preparations were carried out with due diligence, supporting accountability in global and national climate action."

Ice production is impacted by aerosols that either can form cloud droplets or ice crystals and processes that form ice crystals from pre-existing cloud particles. All those processes can interact and affect the electrical activity and differently according to the cloud conditions. 
 Ice particles play a crucial role in shaping cloud electrification, affecting the intensity of lightning activity. Previous studies have found a change of electric activity with varying aerosols concentration or active secondary ice production processes (SIP). However, the electric response to those parameters can differ with different cloud conditions and interact between themselves. The Meso-NH model was used with the two-moment microphysics scheme LIMA coupled with an explicit electrical scheme. Three idealized storms with varying warm-phase thicknesses were simulated to examine their response to aerosol concentrations and SIP mechanisms.Increasing the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or the ice nucleating particle (INP) concentration increases ice crystal concentration, non-inductive charging and lightning activity up to a threshold. The main ice production processes (heterogeneous, homogeneous nucleation or Hallett-Mossop mechanism) depend on the cloud base temperature, and the aerosol concentration. CCN concentration thresholds (1000–8000 cm−3) differ across all storms due to cloud base temperature, while the threshold for INP concentration is generally ∼ 100 L−1. Higher CCN concentrations increase cloud water content, affecting charge polarity, but has a relatively limited impact on graupel mass.SIP mechanisms significantly enhance non-inductive charging and lightning activity by increasing ice crystal concentrations, particularly at low altitudes where primary ice production is inactive. This promotes ice-graupel collisions and amplifies charge exchange in each grid cell. The intensity of SIP processes varies with the thickness of the warm-phase region. Raindrop shattering freezing is the most sensitive and requires a deep warm-phase, while Hallett-Mossop and collisional ice break-up produce abundant ice crystals in all storms."

However, these processes do not always produce surface manifestations and may sometimes elude detection by current geological and geodetic monitoring. Here we monitor subsurface seismic velocity changes across Kīlauea's system from 2013 to 2018 and integrate these observations with concurrent measurements of ground deformation and lava lake elevation. We corroborate years‐long seismic velocity decreases around the summit caldera, which are particularly pronounced at southern stations, consistent with sustained pressurization of the South Caldera reservoir (SCR) from a deep magma supply. Following the 2015 summit intrusion, accelerated rates of velocity decrease, summit inflation, and lava lake rise suggest an increased magma supply to the SCR. Notably, we identify an anomalous 7‐month period (late 2016–mid 2017) of disrupted magma/pressure transfer between the SCR and Halema'uma'u magma reservoir (HMR), as evidenced by dropping lava lake levels despite continued summit inflation and SCR pressurization. This period coincided with pressurization observed beneath Pu'u'ō'ō, indicating pressure/magma diversion from the summit toward the ERZ and the episode terminated with a M5.3 flank earthquake in June 2017 that restored the connectivity between the SCR and HMR and triggered shallow crustal pressurization beneath the summit caldera for the subsequent 2–3 months. Our findings reveal significant perturbations in Kīlauea's magmatic plumbing system approximately one year before the catastrophic 2018 eruption, highlighting seismic velocity monitoring's value for detecting subtle changes of the volcano."

This allowed for intensification of hurricanes into major storms prior to landfall. Water mass transformation analysis reveals much of the anomalous warm water volume arose from atmospheric heat flux into the ocean. Lagrangian analysis then shows how, atypically, warm water was advected to the west by a rarely observed zonal pathway. Thus, combined heat exchanges via air‐sea heat transfer and ocean currents coordinated to result in record breaking temperatures in the western tropical Atlantic in 2024, allowing development of landfalling major hurricanes when atmospheric and oceanic conditions were aligned and conducive to tropical cyclone development."

We estimated a mean dFe residence time in the euphotic zone (0–150 m) for each season, which was consistent at 5 ± 1 months despite 2‐fold seasonal variability in dFe inventories. The sub‐annual residence time highlights the importance of recycling winter and spring dFe sources to sustain productivity and nitrogen fixation through the summer and fall.

In this study, we developed the orographic drag scheme that includes orographic anisotropy for all flow directions based on Lambert projection grid and implemented it into the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. We then conducted two monthly simulations for Tibetan Plateau (TP) using the updated WRF model with the new drag scheme and that with orographic anisotropy for eight representative directions (8X) to validate the updated model against station observation and reanalysis data. The new scheme is shown to reduce the root‐mean‐square‐error (RMSE) in the upper‐level zonal wind speed (above 50 hPa) by 10%–20% in the north of the TP and by 5%–10% on the northern TP region. This is achieved by better representation of the orographic parameters that perturbed the launching gravity wave momentum flux from the surface and altered its breaking level aloft, thereby impacting the zonal wind vertically. The weakened drag over the west TP raised the breaking level and enhanced zonal wind below 100‐hPa while weakened zonal wind above; strengthened drag over the north of TP lowered the breaking level and weakened zonal wind below 50 hpa while enhance it above.

These pose hazards for electronic equipment and affect biological systems. We present a new methodology for simulating the formation of electromagnetic fields within and near dust devils. Starting from an approximation of planar circular motion and physical laws defining field generation from charged particles, a dust devil model is developed based upon observation and measurements. Simulated electromagnetic fields from a 7 m diameter event match measured fields. The only in situ measurements of electromagnetic fields within a dust devil record an electric field of −4.3 kVm−1 50 m from the center of the dust devil and a central magnetic field of 0.4 nT. Our simulation using 106 superparticles yields 0.16 nT at the center and −3.2 kVm−1 50 m distant, indicating that the model is effective. Analysis shows the results are most sensitive to poorly understood parameters, such as the grain size distribution through the height of the dust devil, and the azimuthal distribution of dust in the event. These are crucial areas for targeted future measurements. The model not only enables simulation of dust devils without supporting experimental data but also allows key properties to be inferred when point measurements are available, this is particularly important given the scarcity of experimental data. The simulation's modular structure means it is readily adapted to simulate dust devils with differing properties, in different environments, or when more experimental data become available."

This study evaluates the effectiveness of approaches used in event attribution studies for estimating the return periods of hot extremes based on large samples from large ensembles of climate model simulations. We found that, even with large sample sizes, annual maxima of temperature extremes do not fit well to a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution in the far right tail, leading to an overestimation of return period. However, the maxima of multi‐year blocks generally fit well to a GEV distribution, improving the accuracy of exceedance probability estimates for very rare events. For events with shorter return periods, such as those spanning tens of years or less, fitting annual maxima to a GEV distribution can generally still provide robust estimates. Additionally, estimates based on data samples of similar lengths to observational records are less reliable due to limited sample sizes. These findings highlight the need for caution when interpreting event attribution results for events with long return periods."

In this study, we conduct climatology‐hydrodynamic modeling to estimate TC surge hazards along the US northeast coastline under future climate scenarios. In this methodology, we generate synthetic TCs for the northeastern US to drive a hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC) to simulate storm surges. Observing their significant effect on storm surge, for the first time, we bias‐correct landfall angles of synthetic TCs, in addition to bias‐correcting their frequency and intensity. Our findings show that under the combined effects of sea level rise (SLR) and TC climatology change, historical 100‐year extreme water levels (EWLs) along the US northeast coastline would occur annually at the end of the century in both SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 emissions scenarios. 500‐year EWLs are also projected to occur every 1–60 (1–20) years under SSP2‐4.5 (SSP5‐8.5). SLR is the dominant factor in the dramatic changes in the EWLs. However, while in higher latitudes (>40.5° ${ >} 40.5{}^{\circ}$) TC climatology change modestly affect EWLs (<10% ${< } 10\%$ contribution for 100‐year and <40% ${< } 40\%$for 500‐year EWL changes), in lower latitudes the impact is more significant (up to 40% contribution to 100‐year and 55% for 500‐year EWL changes).

 Sacrificial anodes have been broadly deployed in electro-synthesis for the development of reductive electrosynthetic reactions. The metal cations released from sacrificial anodes during these processes are widely believed to not affect reaction outcomes. Here, we disclose an electrochemical deutero-(di)carboxylation of acetylenes and cinnamic acids that in fact relies on anodically generated Mg2+ cations to achieve regioselective α-carboxylation to afford deuterated malonic acids with precise control over both the site and amount of deuteration. The unusual, beneficial role of Mg2+ cations on product selectivity is supported by mechanistic studies and density functional theory [ZORA-B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-TZVP/DMF(SMD)] calculations, and is believed to mimic enzymatic α-carboxylation mechanisms. The deuteration patterns in the malonic acid products can be precisely controlled, providing a platform for the concise synthesis of high-value β-d₂- and β-d₁-α-amino acid analogs, as well as other precisely deuterated frameworks.

This study shows that anthropogenic warming now has greater influence than the PDO on North Pacific sea surface temperatures, with implications for predictability and impacts. 
 The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has served as a key index linking basin-scale climate variability to marine ecosystem changes in the North Pacific. However, recent apparent breakdowns of PDO–ecosystem correlations have raised concerns about the stability of the mode and its continued relevance in a warming climate. Here we show that basin-wide warming now overwhelms PDO-related sea surface temperature (SST) variability, although neither the PDO’s spatial pattern nor its strength have changed. We introduce the pan-basin pattern as a complementary index to describe the non-stationary SST baseline of the North Pacific. Regional SSTs increasingly reflect the superposition of these two signals, providing an explanation for weakened or inverted PDO–ecosystem correlations. Future use of the PDO index in management will require discerning the effects of internal dynamics from those of absolute changes in SST as extreme and no-analogue ocean conditions driven by interacting natural variability and anthropogenic warming become more common. Natural patterns of climate variability, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), strongly influence regional climate.

 Streetlights are essential infrastructure in cities. They enhance traffic and public safety at night, but they also entail significant energy consumption. The study of the density, quantity and distribution of streetlights is essential for sustainable urban development. The Sustainable Development Global Scientific Satellite-1 has enriched night-time light data. This study is based on the Crowded Scene Recognition Network (CSRNet) and proposes a novel Streetlight Counting Network (SLCNet) by introducing a deeper front-end network and adding a spatial attention mechanism. This model can effectively estimate the density distribution of streetlights within a region and achieve automatic counting of large-scale streetlight numbers. Experimental results show that SLCNet achieves a mean absolute error of 135.35, a root mean square error of 231.37, and a normalised absolute error of 0.22, representing reductions of 5.60 %, 8.08 %, and 12.00 % respectively outperforming the original CSRNet model. The visualisation results also show that SLCNet predicts the distribution of streetlight density more accurately than CSRNet. Comprehensive ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each improvement method. Compared with the high-resolution yet costly Jilin-1 night-time images, SLCNet maintains comparable accuracy while enabling large-scale streetlight density and quantity estimation with publicly accessible SDGSAT-1 images. This study demonstrates the application potential of SDGSAT-1 in urban night-time lighting monitoring, providing new technical pathways and research frameworks for urban lighting management, sustainable development assessment, and smart city construction."

Multi-metric remote sensing is key to assessing ecosystem resilience. 
 Climate-driven increases in wildfire frequency threaten forest resilience in fire-prone ecosystems. Although short-term studies indicate rapid recovery of eucalypt forests, such assessments may be overly optimistic, given the uncertain long-term alignment of structural and functional trajectories. This study integrated multi-source remote sensing data (2000−2020) with eddy covariance flux measurements to quantify post-fire recovery dynamics of eucalypt forests in southeastern Australia. We analyzed key structural metrics, including fraction of tree cover (FTC), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and leaf area index (LAI), as well as functional traits, including gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), evapotranspiration (ET), fuel moisture content (FMC), and vegetation optical depth (VOD). On average, all these traits recovered to pre-fire levels within 5.5 to 7.5 years, though some areas required over a decade or more. Recovery trajectories diverged notably both between the structural and functional categories and among individual traits within each category. These recovery rates varied across forest groups, modulated by disturbance severity, understory compositions, and fire frequency. Notably, functional traits such as GPP and SIF recovered rapidly, surpassing even the fastest structural metrics. At the Wallaby Creek flux site (burned in 2009 and rebuilt), GPP and SIF exhibited a distinct “peak-decline-stabilize” pattern, surpassing pre-fire levels within three years before declining as LAI recovered. In contrast, structural metrics recovered gradually, with LAI lagging behind FTC and NDVI. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multi-dimensional data to comprehensively assess forest recovery, offering critical insights for ecosystem management and carbon cycle modeling in fire-prone regions."

 Child malnutrition continues to be a significant public health issue in Indonesia, with considerable spatial variations among provinces. This study utilizes an integrated framework that combines Bayesian Network (BN) modeling, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and Moran’s I analysis to ascertain the principal determinants of child nutritional status and their spatial distribution. The Bayesian Network (BN) probabilistic approach captures intricate interdependencies among health and behavioral factors, such as Correct Knowledge about Stunting (CKS), Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF), Breastfeeding for Two Years (BF2Y), Complementary Feeding (CF), Immunization (IMM), Growth Monitoring (GM), Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation (IFA), Antenatal Care (ANC6), and Animal Protein Intake for Pregnant Women (APH), and their impact on outcomes classified as Severely Underweight (SUW), Underweight (UW), and Normal (N). Spatial statistical analyses indicate considerable heterogeneity and elevated-risk clusters of malnutrition, underscoring areas necessitating prioritized interventions. Stochastic simulations elucidate the variability and robustness of critical determinants, whereas model evaluation via Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicates robust predictive performance for variables such as N, ANC6, and SUW, with heightened uncertainty noted for EBF, IFA, and IMM, implying the impact of supplementary social or contextual factors. This study combines probabilistic inference with spatial analysis to show the pathways and interactions that lead to child malnutrition. This gives useful information for focused, evidence-based interventions. The results support strategies that involve more than one sector and are in line with Indonesia’s National Strategy for Stunting Reduction (Presidential Regulation No. 72 of 2021). This will help resources be used more effectively, policies be planned better, and children’s nutrition outcomes be more fair across the country."

 Precise reconstruction of lunar south pole’s terrain is crucial for future exploration missions, particularly for landing site selection, resource identification, and scientific research. However, the challenging illumination conditions, characterized by extensive shadowed areas, pose significant challenges to traditional photogrammetric methods. The shadowed areas lead to poor disparity estimation and less accurate terrain models, highlighting the need for improved techniques that can effectively address these difficult conditions. This study proposes an enhanced dense matching method for terrain reconstruction at lunar south pole, which incorporates prior information of existing lower-resolution terrain model to guide the semi-global matching (SGM) process. We begin by adaptively selecting seed points in shadowed areas of the image through intensity histogram analysis. Homogeneous pixels with close spatial distance and small intensity difference surrounding each seed point are then identified based on distance and intensity differences. After obtaining prior disparity values, the corresponding costs are simulated and combined with matching costs from the original 2D disparity search SGM algorithm, optimizing pixel costs to refine the cost volume and improve the robustness of the matching process. Experiments were conducted in representative areas of lunar south pole to validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, the performance of our method is compared with SGM variants and two advanced cost volume optimization methods, further demonstrating its effectiveness. Finally, we apply our method to several pairs of LROC NAC images to generate detailed terrain models at lunar south pole, quantitatively validating its reliability through comparisons with reference terrain data and LOLA laser points."

 Atmospheric nitrate (NO₃−), a key component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly impacts air quality and climate. This study investigates decadal variability (2013−2022) of PM2.5-associated NO₃− in Beijing using continuous real-time measurements, meteorological normalization, and source identification. Results reveal an annual NO₃− decline of 4.8 %, driven by stringent clean air policies like “coal-to-gas” initiatives, with autumn and winter reductions (−8.6 %/yr and − 8.4 %/yr, respectively) outpacing other seasons due to targeted emission controls. Despite progress, NO₃− remains elevated (11.7 ± 15.8 μg/m3), contributing 33.0 % to PM2.5 by 2022, underscoring persistent secondary formation under high oxidation capacity. Diurnal patterns show high nocturnal and morning values (shallow boundary layers and traffic emissions) and minima at 16:00–18:00 (volatilization and deep boundary layers), while absent weekend effects reflect unregulated traffic and sustained residential activity. Meteorological normalization attributes 78.4 % of NO₃− decline to emission controls, emphasizing policy efficacy, yet chemical feedbacks (enhanced NOₓ-to-HNO₃ conversion) and transboundary transport challenge further mitigation. The interplay between local emissions and regional transport significantly shaped the variability of PM2.5-associated NO3− in Beijing from 2013 to 2022. The nonparametric wind regression analyses identify northwest and southern hotspots, with shifting source regions post-2018 highlighting growing contributions from southern industrial zones. Based on the potential source contribution function and concentration weighted trajectory methods, it can be found that dominant source regions of NO3− and its precursor (NOₓ) were located south of Beijing. Findings advocate interaction of policy, chemistry, and meteorology in shaping PM2.5 composition, integrated NH₃-NOₓ controls and regional coordination, offering critical insights for optimizing air quality strategies in rapidly urbanizing regions globally."

This study introduces three advanced machine-learning algorithms—Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)—to enhance seasonal forecasts of the leading mode of YREPD. Key predictors from preceding-season observational datasets were rigorously selected based on Spearman's rank correlation and physical mechanisms. Their ensemble achieves a temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) of 0.73 (P < 0.05) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 on test data. Compared to the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model (TCC = 0.59, RMSE = 0.99), the ensemble increases TCC by 23.7 % and reduces RMSE by 12.1 %. Moreover, the ensemble model significantly outperforms traditional multiple linear regression as well as persistence and climate baseline approaches. Furthermore, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis identifies Eurasian snow depth anomalies and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies as dominant drivers. Crucially, the SHAP analysis uncovers prevalent nonlinear predictor relationships and significant predictor interactions, providing novel physical insights into YREPD variability.

 Tropical cyclones and frontal systems are two primary weather systems influencing East Asia. Distinguishing between typhoon rainfall (TR) and non-typhoon rainfall (non-TR) and analyzing their divergent changes are essential for exploring extreme rainfall evolution. Existing related researches remain limited and have primarily focused on a single timescale (annual or seasonal), overlooking characteristics across other timescales. Fujian was selected as a typical case due to its distinctive geographic environment. This study adopted total rainfall and maximum daily rainfall to compare long-term trends of typhoon-related extreme rainfall (TER) and non-typhoon-related extreme rainfall (non-TER) across multiple timescales and their spatial patterns. There were divergent timescale effects in trends of TER and non-TER in Fujian (1961–2021). While no significant trends are found at annual and typhoon-season scales, TER showed a significant increasing trend for August. In contrast, non-TER displayed a significant upward trend for typhoon season, but not at other timescales. Temporally, concentrated typhoon frequency and increased typhoon linger time in August were primary drivers of the significant TER increase during same period. Spatially, the combined influences of terrain and typhoon tracks resulted in a greater relative increase in August TER in the western region than the eastern region, creating a distinct west-east divergence: significant increases in the west contrasted with minimal changes in the east. By distinguishing between TR and non-TR, analyzing regional extreme rainfall variability offers a newer insight into its evolution under distinct weather systems across East Asia."

Using CLM5.0 sensitivity experiments with ± $\pm $50% nighttime precipitation perturbations (HALF and PLUS50) and fixed precipitation variability (FIX1979), we show that nighttime precipitation anomalies modulate soil moisture, repartition turbulent and ground heat fluxes and, during daytime, alter surface albedo.

The response is diurnally asymmetric: daytime LST is jointly controlled by evapotranspiration and albedo anomalies, whereas nighttime LST is dominated by changes in turbulent and ground heat fluxes.

It also examines the added value of finer grid spacing, which enables the explicit representation of deep convection. Simulations were conducted at grid spacings of 0.11° (≈12 km) and 0.0225° (≈2.5 km), and the results were compared with surface observations from 35 hydrometeorological stations across Quebec over two cold seasons (October to April in 2020–21 and 2021–22). The analysis was further supported by atmospheric sounding data from two stations, and several gridded reference products. Both simulations exhibited similar large‐scale 2‐m air temperature spatial patterns with the coarser‐resolution simulation generating consistently colder values as well as a larger total precipitation amount and bias compared to station observations. The finer‐resolution simulation reduced the total precipitation bias by a factor of three. Both simulations overestimated liquid precipitation and underestimated solid precipitation with the finer resolution better capturing liquid precipitation and the coarser resolution better capturing solid precipitation. Mixed precipitation remained a challenge, being simulated at colder temperatures than observed, particularly near 0°C. The 50% rain‐snow temperature threshold (T50), which indicates when liquid and solid phases occur equally, was 0.5°C for the finer resolution and 0.8°C for the coarser resolution both below the observed 2.1°C.

High fullness is typically beneficial for intensification, but there are situations where high‐fullness TCs do not intensify. This study explores the structural characteristics and environmental conditions of weakening TCs under high fullness. Identifying these situations can be helpful for improved prediction of TC intensity change. This study analyzes 5,218 GPS dropsondes from 36 TCs to compare structural and environmental conditions of intensifying (IN) and weakening (WE) TCs under high fullness. For the environmental conditions, TCs tend to weaken with strong southerly vertical wind shear, dry air, and less ocean heat content, suggesting that more adverse conditions are required to offset the favorable effects of high fullness. In terms of structural characteristics, WE TCs have a warmer, moister boundary layer but weaker surface fluxes than IN TCs. Additionally, WE TCs exhibit stronger inward advection of absolute angular momentum within the friction layer. Above the frictional inflow layer, WE TCs display weak outflow, whereas IN TCs exhibit weak inflow. The implications of these differences in surface enthalpy fluxes and radial flow above the friction layer are discussed within the context of recent hypotheses regarding boundary layer ventilation and TC intensification."

Although previous studies have focused on large‐scale circulations driving these events, this study investigates ARs through attributing their moisture sources using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) with moisture‐tagging capability. Examining ARs in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic separately revealed distinct contributions from remote versus local, and ocean versus land, moisture sources. Unlike non‐AR events, Arctic ARs primarily draw moisture from their respective ocean basins in lower‐latitude regions during the cold season, and shift to land sources in the warm season. Cold‐season ARs in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors source 73.2% and 85.3% of their moisture from their respective ocean basins at lower latitudes, however warm‐season contributions decrease to 41.3% and 29.4%. In contrast, mid‐ and high‐latitude continents combined contribute 40.1% and 51.3% in the warm season. Trajectory clustering analysis shows that AR moisture sources depend on both their genesis regions and transport pathways. In recent decades, the Arctic has experienced a moistening trend in both the cold and warm seasons. Our results suggest that local and remote sources equally drive the observed cold‐season moistening, whereas remote sources predominantly drive the warm‐season moistening.

To better understand the diurnal cycle of tropical oceanic rain and cloud cover, the diurnal cycle of deep convective system (DCS) initiation and the subsequent later‐stage accumulation of rainfall resulting from systems initiating at earlier times is analyzed using Lagrangian‐tracked DCSs. The Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm through 3D segmentatioN (TOOCAN) DCSs are matched to the Integrated Multi‐satellitE Retrieval for GPM rainfall product and binned by their hour of initiation (in local solar time) to evaluate morphological characteristics and contributions to rain and cloud cover diurnal cycles. Two peaks of DCS initiation are observed: an anticipated overnight peak and an unexpected late morning peak that is earlier than the expected afternoon peak in surface heating. DCSs initiated within the daytime peak have similar morphologies to DCSs initiated overnight and significantly contribute to the afternoon rain and cloud cover likely important for explaining the decreased amplitude of the over‐ocean diurnal cycle. When daytime‐initiated DCSs are excluded from the computation of the precipitation diurnal cycle, we find a closer resemblance to the NASA‐GISS ESM simulated diurnal cycle amplitude, suggesting that daytime DCS initiations may be too few or not maintained in ESMs that exhibit an over‐ocean diurnal cycle amplitude that exceeds observational estimates."

Here, we model the historical glacio‐hydrology of 2,236 catchments across the Western Patagonia, and project climate change impacts through the 21st century. To this end, we develop a novel modeling framework that combines Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with ice‐dynamical glacier modeling using the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM). We evaluate the ability of this hybrid framework to predict streamflow in ungauged basins (PUB) and regions (PUR) through 10‐fold cross‐validation and compare the results with those obtained with a LSTM model without a glacier component, and two process‐based coupled glacio‐hydrological models. The hybrid modeling approach outperforms all other approaches in 38% and 44% of the catchments considering PUB and PUR evaluations, respectively. Using our new hybrid approach, we estimate an average regional freshwater flux of 19,815 m3 s−1 for the period 2000–2019, with glacier melt contributing 29% during the summer season. Under a high‐emission scenario (Shared socioeconomic pathways 5‐8.5), the northern region (>46°S) is projected to experience the largest reductions in runoff, with dry season runoff decreasing by almost 50% by the end of the century. In contrast, runoff increases are projected for glacierized basins in the southern regions, with average relative changes of 10%–25% and a marked seasonality shift.

 Snow on sea ice strongly modulates growth, albedo, and air–sea exchange, but it also drives major uncertainties in altimeter-based thickness retrievals. This is critical for Ku-band radar altimeters (e.g., CryoSat-2, CS-2), whose waveforms integrate backscatter from snow-covered sea ice. Contrary to the common assumption that returns originate near the snow–ice interface, complex snow properties (roughness, layering, wetness, ice lenses) can shift effective scattering upward into the snowpack. We analyze Ku-band CS-2 satellite and Ka-band KAREN airborne waveforms over the Weddell Sea to partition contributions from the snow surface, snow volume, and ice surface. Using a physics-based Forward Backscatter Emulation Model (FBEM) and a CNN trained on simulated waveforms, we retrieve geophysical parameters and assess sensitivity to snow conditions. Under typical Antarctic conditions, snow-volume scattering contributes as much as, or more than, the snow–ice interface to CS-2 returns, while Ka-band is dominated by surface/near-surface snow scattering with minimal penetration to the ice surface. Wet snow further amplifies upper-layer backscatter. Sensitivity tests identify volume scattering and ice-surface roughness as primary controls on waveform shape. These results argue for explicit snow-volume terms in waveform models and support dual-frequency strategies relevant to ESA’s upcoming CRISTAL mission.

 The surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, assessed through remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), remains a focal point in urban climate research. Conventional indicators like SUHI intensity (SUHII) and footprint (SUHIF) capture peak values and spatial extent but fail to account for the cumulative thermal load—a critical dimension reflecting the total heat exposure imposed by spatially continuous warming, which directly limits a holistic assessment of ecological and societal impacts of the SUHI effect. Therefore, this study introduces an indicator termed SUHI capacity (SUHIC), designed to quantify the aggregated SUHI effect by integrating the magnitude of the warming signal across all affected areas, thereby enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of urban thermal environments. Furthermore, a direction-enhanced adaptive synchronous extraction (DEASE) method is proposed for the quantification of SUHIC. This method can dynamically identify the optimal background reference area based on the urban-rural LST gradients in various directions within the city, without relying on predefined mathematical models as previously. The results from 102 European cities first confirm that the directional variations in urban-rural LST gradients, and the DEASE method can effectively capture these distinctions for the simultaneous estimation of SUHII, SUHIF, and SUHIC. Secondly, the spatial patterns of absolute SUHIC values show strong associations with those of SUHIF (R2 > 0.86), while its relative values (normalized by the area of urban) align more closely with SUHII (R2 > 0.64). More importantly, SUHIC can serve as a crucial reference for assessing the urban thermal signal when SUHII and SUHIF diverge. The proposed method and framework contribute to standardizing the quantification of the SUHI effect."

 Eutrophication has become a persistent environmental challenge in the Mid-Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), influencing both water security and regional sustainability. Remote sensing provides an effective approach for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla). However, due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of satellite observations and inconsistencies among satellite sensors, long-term variations in Chla across the MLYRB have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by generating a four-decade (1984–2024) Chla dataset for lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km2 in the MLYRB using Landsat imagery. In this study, Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI imagery were used to develop a machine learning approach based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to estimate Chla, calibrated with 235 synchronized satellite and in situ measurements. The model showed strong performance on the testing dataset (R2 = 0.78, RMSLE = 0.21, AURE = 29.6 %) and was subsequently applied to reconstruct annual Chla maps for lakes and reservoirs across the MLYRB from 1984 to 2024. The reconstructed results revealed that Chla were highest in the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake sub-basins (27.9 ± 2.5 and 27.8 ± 2.7 mg/m3, respectively) and lowest in the Han River and Taihu Lake sub-basins (22.7 ± 2.5 and 22.8 ± 2.1 mg/m3). Spatially, Chla distribution was strongly correlated with precipitation and temperature, which together accounted for 72.4 % of the spatial variability. A distinct transition occurred between 2005 and 2007, when mean Chla peaked at 27.6 ± 8.5 mg/m3 and the overall trend shifted from fluctuating increases to a decline. Temporally, Chla variations were largely associated with, meteorological factors, particularly nighttime light (NTL) and gross domestic product (GDP), explaining 65 % of the temporal variability. This study presents the first nearly four-decade Landsat-derived Chla dataset for lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km2 in the MLYRB. This long-term dataset offers critical support for understanding water quality dynamics and guiding evidence-based environmental management in eastern plains of China."

 Tropical cyclone (TC) genesis projections remain a significant challenge in the context of climate change, primarily due to the intricate interactions between large-scale environmental factors. This paper presents a deep learning-based model designed to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of TC genesis in the western North Pacific under climate change. The model, built on an innovative convolutional architecture incorporating spatial and channel mixing techniques, generates heatmaps of TC genesis using key environmental variables, including sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, low-level relative vorticity, humidity, and temperature. This model outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks in TC genesis predictions. Model projections suggest a weak long-term decline in tropical cyclone frequency across the western North Pacific over the 21st century. Vertical wind shear and low-level vorticity are key factors governing the accuracy of TC genesis predictions. In high-emission scenarios, TC frequency in the South China Sea is projected to increase. Despite uncertainties in climate model simulations, the proposed model provides valuable insights into the response of TC genesis to anthropogenic warming, offering a new framework for future climate risk assessments."

Ice from mountains is concentrated in mid- and high-latitudes, while ice from turbulence and anvils is more common in low and mid-latitudes. Both schemes simulate orographic cirrus clouds, with mountain ice as the dominant source. The schemes differ in how they handle ice source competition, causing turbulence and anvils to influence clouds differently. 
 Ice crystal formation in cirrus clouds is poorly understood, and its representation remains a challenge in global climate models. To enhance the understanding, a novel ice nucleation parameterization based on the Kärcher (2022) (K22) scheme is introduced into the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). To investigate ice formation in cirrus clouds, sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze three ice sources from orographic gravity wave (OGWs), convective detrainment, and turbulence. These tests employ both the K22 scheme and the default Liu and Penner (2005) (LP05) scheme. Model evaluation includes 6-year climatology and nudged simulations representing the Small Particles in Cirrus (SPARTICUS) and O2 / N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study (ORCAS) campaigns.Both schemes simulate that convection detrained and turbulence-induced ice crystals are concentrated in low- to mid-latitudes, whereas OGW-induced ice crystals are concentrated in mid- to high latitudes. Compared to the LP05 scheme, the K22 scheme generates a higher number of ice crystals. The simulated cloud microphysical properties using the K22 scheme align well with observations for orographic cirrus during the SPARTICUS campaign. In orographic cirrus over high terrains at mid- to high latitudes, both schemes identify OGW-induced ice crystals as the dominant ice source. Due to its distinct competition parameterizations, the K22 scheme exhibits less contribution from minor ice sources (convection detrained and turbulence-induced). This underscores the significance of competition mechanisms within ice nucleation schemes and helps clarify regional and dynamical controls on ice sources in cirrus clouds. The application of two distinct nucleation schemes provides valuable insights into the dominant ice sources in cirrus clouds."

Collett Jr.,Sensitivity of simulated ammonia fluxes in  Rocky Mountain National Park to measurement time resolution and meteorological inputs,"The contribution of ammonia atmosphere-surface exchange to excess deposition of reactive nitrogen is poorly understood. Reactive nitrogen deposition has negative impacts on ecosystem health. Ammonia can be difficult and expensive to measure. We demonstrate that depositions modeled using low-cost measurements underestimate ecosystem inputs but can be corrected using typical daily concentration cycles. We also illustrate the limitations of reanalysis meteorology for ammonia deposition modeling. 
 Gaseous ammonia (NH3) is an important precursor for secondary aerosol formation and contributes to reactive nitrogen deposition. NH3 dry deposition is poorly quantified due to the complex bidirectional nature of NH3 atmosphere-surface exchange and lack of high time-resolution in situ NH3 concentration and meteorological measurements. To better quantify NH3 dry deposition, measurements of NH3 were made above a subalpine forest canopy in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and used with in situ micrometeorology to simulate bidirectional fluxes. NH3 dry deposition was largest during the summer, with 47 % of annual net NH3 dry deposition occurring in June, July, and August. Because in situ, high time-resolution concentration and meteorological data are often unavailable, the impacts on estimated deposition from utilizing more commonly available biweekly NH3 measurements and ERA5 meteorology were evaluated. Fluxes simulated with biweekly NH3 concentrations, commonly available from NH3 monitoring networks, underestimated NH3 dry deposition by 45 %. These fluxes were strongly correlated with 30 min fluxes integrated to a biweekly basis (R2 = 0.88), indicating that a correction factor could be applied to mitigate the observed bias. Application of an average NH3 diel concentration pattern to the biweekly NH3 concentration data removed the observed low bias. Annual NH3 dry deposition from fluxes simulated with reanalysis meteorological inputs exceeded simulations using in situ meteorology measurements by a factor of 2."

However, the mechanism of CA-based nucleation is unclear. We provide molecular-level evidence that CA-dimethylamine (DMA) nucleation may not effectively contribute to Arctic new particle formation (NPF). The proposed CA-DMA nucleation mechanism may help us to deeply understand marine NPF events in the Arctic boundary layer. 
 Chlorine radicals are strong oxidizing agents in the atmosphere, and the process of chlorine oxidation results in the formation of chloric acid (HClO3, CA). Recent studies have shown that trace amounts of CA have been detected in the Arctic boundary layer. However, the contribution of chlorine-containing species to oceanic new particle formation (NPF) has not been fully revealed. It is speculated that CA is involved in the oceanic nucleation process. In this study, the enhancement of CA-based NPF by dimethylamine (DMA) and sulfuric acid (SA) was comparatively investigated at the molecular level using density-functional theory (DFT) and atmospheric cluster dynamics simulation (ACDC). The results show that DMA can form clusters with CA through hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding and proton transfer, which reduces the energy barrier for CA-based cluster formation and significantly improves the thermodynamic stability of CA clusters. The cluster formation rate of CA-DMA cluster system is higher than that of the CA-SA cluster system. CA-DMA nucleation may not effectively contribute to Arctic NPF. These findings may help to reveal some of the missing sources of the Arctic NPF.

Existing methods require supporting data from other instruments – making them unusable in remote regions like the Tibetan Plateau. Our innovation enables fully independent cloud identification using only the radiometer's data. This self-contained solution eliminates dependencies on external equipment or historical datasets, providing a practical cloud monitoring method for isolated sites where conventional approaches fail. 
 Accurate cloud detection over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is crucial for understanding regional weather patterns and global climate dynamics. Yet, it remains challenging due to harsh environmental conditions and sparse observations. While ground-based infrared radiometers offer a promising solution through downwelling infrared brightness temperature (IRBT) measurements, existing algorithms require supplementary meteorological data often unavailable in remote TP regions. This study presents a novel cloud detection algorithm that operates solely on IRBT data from a single ground-based infrared radiometer, addressing the critical need for autonomous cloud monitoring in resource-limited environments. The algorithm integrates spectral and temporal analysis approaches: the spectral test identifies cloud presence by comparing observed IRBT against statistically derived clear-sky diurnal cycles, and the temporal test detects clouds through IRBT variability analysis using sliding standard deviation calculations. A key innovation includes a normalization procedure that effectively mitigates dust contamination effects – a persistent challenge in the arid TP environment that can introduce extremely large errors. Validation against 13 months of radiosonde data demonstrates robust performance with agreement rates exceeding 70 % in most months, with particularly effective performance during the wet season. This work provides a practical and cost-effective solution for autonomous cloud monitoring over the TP, with potential for application in other regions with limited observational data."

However, when flying above sea-ice, satellites pick up noisy signals coming from holes in the sea-ice cover. We reprocess these signals, extracting local sea level measurement. By integrating them with open ocean sea level estimates, we create the longest continuous record of sea level measurements in both ice-covered and ice-free Antarctic waters. 
 Antarctic Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) remain poorly observed due to the presence of sea ice, which hampers conventional satellite altimetry. Recent advances in lead-based retracking techniques have enabled SLA estimation within ice-covered regions. However, existing products are temporally limited, with currently available dataset covering periods shorter than 10 years. In this study, we extend the time span of SLA reconstruction by processing multiple satellite missions: Envisat, CryoSat-2, SARAL/Altika, and Sentinel-3A. We produce a consistent and continuous SLA dataset spanning both ice-free and ice-covered areas of the Southern Ocean (south of 50° S) from 2003 to 2021. This 19-year product provides the longest temporal coverage to date for SLA under sea ice. The resulting SLA fields resolve the large-scale variability and parts of the mesoscale signal, with smooth transitions across the sea-ice edge. We show that the product reliably captures physical signals on timescales longer than 10 days, with estimated uncertainties of 1.3 cm. in the subpolar ocean. Our satellite-based SLA reconstruction compares well with most independent in situ observations from tide gauges and bottom pressure recorders: mean correlation coefficients are 0.58 and 0.66, respectively. The reconstruction fills a key observational gap and offers new opportunities to study trends and interannual variability in sea level and ocean circulation in the Southern Ocean, particularly under sea-ice cover."

WOFOST-EW significantly improves the simulation of winter wheat growth under extreme weather conditions, providing more accurate predictions of phenology and yield. As extreme weather events become more frequent, WOFOST-EW provides a key tool for agricultural development. 
 Extreme weather events pose significant challenges to crop production, making their assessment essential for developing effective climate adaptation strategies. Process-based crop models are valuable for evaluating climate change impacts on crop yields but often struggle to simulate the effects of extreme weather accurately. To fill this knowledge gap, this study introduces WOFOST-EW v1, an enhanced version of the World Food Studies Simulation Model (WOFOST), which integrates extreme weather indices and deep learning algorithm to improve simulations of winter wheat growth under extreme conditions. Deep learning offers powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities, enabling it to capture subtle and intricate interactions between extreme weather events and crop development, thereby significantly improving simulation accuracy under extreme scenarios. We validate WOFOST-EW using phenological, yield, and extreme weather data from agricultural meteorological stations in the North China Plain. The results show that WOFOST-EW improves simulation accuracy. The RRMSE for heading and maturity decreases from 4.61 % to 3.73 % and from 4.74 % to 3.98 %, respectively (with RMSE reductions of 10.64 % and 12.86 %). The R2 value for yield simulations increases from 0.67 to 0.76. In addition, we further validate the WOFOST-EW model in years affected by extreme weather and find that, compared to the original WOFOST model (R2 ranging from 0.61 to 0.71), WOFOST-EW achieves more accurate results (R2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.86). WOFOST-EW effectively captures the impacts of extreme weather, offering a reliable tool for agricultural planning and climate adaptation. As extreme weather events become increasingly frequent, WOFOST-EW can assist decision-makers in more accurately evaluating crop yields, providing technical support for agricultural systems in the context of global climate change."

Convective precipitation is potentially hazardous and difficult to predict. Cloud microphysics schemes contribute significantly to this uncertainty. Depending on the microphysics used, the simulated precipitation distribution varies significantly. The main reason for these differences are the underlying rain drop size distributions. 
 The representation of cloud microphysics in numerical weather prediction models contributes significantly to the uncertainty of weather forecasts. Polarimetric radar observations are increasingly used to evaluate numerical weather simulations, due to their sensitivity to microphysical properties. Typically, this evaluation is performed for individual case studies, which limits the generalizability of the results. This is particularly problematic for convective precipitation events, which are characterized by high variability due to their small scale and rapid error growth of initial uncertainties, and are often associated with severe weather phenomena. In this study, the performance of microphysics schemes in the simulation of convective precipitation events is evaluated statistically over a 30 d dataset. The aim is to assess the distribution of precipitation into convective and stratiform regions, and the microphysical properties in these regions based on radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity. Within a Weather Research and Forecasting model setup, 5 different microphysics schemes of varying complexity are evaluated. The choice of microphysics schemes has a significant impact on the distribution of precipitation; the median convective area fraction varies by an order of magnitude between the microphysics schemes. These differences are attributed to differences in rain drop size distributions. In the convective core, the FSBM and Morrison schemes frequently lack large rain drops, while the Thompson and P3 schemes simulate too many. Statistical evaluations are important to address the prevailing uncertainty surrounding cloud microphysics. The framework presented in this study can serve as a guide for future statistical evaluations of weather models with polarimetric radar observations."

 Quantum error correction (QEC) [1,2] is essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers [3,4]. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded ‘logical’ qubits [5,6], understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement the key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors [6,7], demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding [8,9]. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery [10–12], and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes [13,14], enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with polylogarithmic overhead [5,15]. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use [16], increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations [17–20] with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic & entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates & magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality & physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems."

 Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their ultra-high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1-3. However, the mechanical stress generated during repeated environmental stress cycles remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, leading to interfacial delamination and device degradation. In this work, we propose a dual-buffer-layer strategy with a stress-release mechanism to synergistically mitigate ion bombardment during subsequent sputtering deposition and enhance interfacial adhesion while preserving efficient charge extraction. The loose SnOx buffer layer, engineered by adjusting the purging time of atomic layer deposition, can dissipate strain energy, whereas the compact SnOx layer can ensure robust electrical contact. Based on this dual-buffer-layer, the flexible tandem solar cell, constructed on a 60-micron thick ultra-thin silicon bottom cell, achieves a certified PCE of 33.4% on 1-cm2 area, and an certified PCE of 29.8% on wafer-sized area of 260-cm2 with a power-per-weight of up to 1.77 W/g. The modified tandem solar cells demonstrate good durability, retaining over 97% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 43000 bending cycles under a maximum curvature radius of around 40 mm in air, and around 97% after thermal cycling testing (−40 °C to 85 °C) for 250 cycles."

 Magnetostriction plays a pivotal role in magneto-mechanical systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanical frequency comb solely requiring the fundamental mode f0 of a magnetostrictive mm-scale macroresonator. Both integer-harmonic combs and half-integer-harmonic combs are observed in kHz regime with Hz resolution by near-resonant pumping fp ≈ f0 and parametrical stiffness modulation fs ≪ f0. The tooth spacing of both combs is determined by fs, which can be continuously tuned by changing fs from Hz to kHz. Moreover, the half-integer-harmonic combs can be purposely switched with frequency shifting half a tooth spacing via suppressing period-doubling bifurcation. The experimentally observed formation, evolution, and switching of combs can be well understood by introducing the bias magnetical force and the parametrically modulated stiffness into the Duffing equation. Our findings could provide a magneto-mechanical platform with tunability for potential applications in the acoustic frequency range such as non-invasive/contactless sensor and wireless antenna.

 Sepsis-induced liver injury is common, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Given the critical role of gut-liver crosstalk in sepsis, we hypothesize that gut-trained neutrophils, migrating via the portal vein, release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to activate Kupffer cells, thereby exacerbating hepatic injury during sepsis. Here we show that iNOS expression in Kupffer cells increases in septic wild type mice but decreases in PAD4-/- mice. In vitro, NETs stimulate Kupffer cell IL-6 and TNF release, while conditioned media from NET-treated Kupffer cells induces hepatocyte death. Inhibition of neutrophil elastase and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) mitigates IL-6 and TNF secretion by Kupffer cells. Ex vivo, portal vein neutrophils from septic mice produce more NETs and induce greater Kupffer cell activation than systemic neutrophils, with this effect attenuated in PAD4-/- neutrophils. Furthermore, gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) interact with neutrophils during sepsis and facilitate NETosis, and IEL-primed neutrophils also induce Kupffer cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Our data thus suggest that IEL-facilitated, gut-derived neutrophil NETs activate Kupffer cells to contribute to sepsis-induced liver injury. Sepsis often induces liver injury, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unclear.

 Although tuberculosis is preventable, whom to prioritize for preventive interventions is debated. As part of a follow-up to a mass tuberculosis screening, we aimed to evaluate tuberculosis incidence among persons with distinct baseline X-ray results. From March to October 2020, we implemented a mass tuberculosis screening intervention among elderly persons in eastern China. Participants were followed for incident tuberculosis until October 2022. Tuberculosis incidence over two years among participants with differing baseline chest X-ray results were assessed. Physical examinations and X-rays were administered to all participants. Among persons suspected of tuberculosis, computed tomography, culture or GeneXpert MTB/RIF was performed. Among 183,808 participants, 27,796 had a baseline abnormal X-ray. The annualized incidence per 100,000 person-years was 1,525 (95% CI, 989-2,243), 278 (202-373), 325 (218-466), and 61 (50–75) among participants with X-rays suggestive of active, stable, uncertain and normal, respectively. Among persons with X-ray findings suggestive of tuberculosis, the increased hazard was 16.7 (95% CI, 11.9–23.4). These results demonstrate the risk of developing tuberculosis among persons with an abnormal chest X-ray was very high. Combining mass screening with preventive interventions based on X-ray findings should be explored as a combination intervention package to reduce tuberculosis in high-risk populations. In this study, authors evaluate mass tuberculosis (TB) screening data from 183,808 elderly individuals in China, finding that abnormal chest X-rays significantly increase TB risk."

Here, the authors use single-pulse X-ray imaging to show that surface plasmons channel energy relaxation into distinct pathways, leading to different shape deformations. 
 Ultrafast laser excitation can drive materials into exotic states beyond thermodynamic limits, offering alternative ways to control how matter stores and releases energy. Yet, whether light can actively steer energy-relaxation pathways during structural transitions remains unclear due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. Here we show, using single-pulse time-resolved X-ray imaging of gold nanorods, that photoinduced localized surface plasmons control ultrafast energy relaxation into distinct deformation modes, transverse or longitudinal deformation modes, each accompanied by characteristic plasmon-induced oscillatory distortions depending on the laser fluence. Numerical simulations further confirm that localized surface plasmons dictate ultrafast energy relaxation process from photoexcited hot electrons to anharmonic nanocrystal deformations. Our results provide direct evidence that surface plasmon-mediated interactions enable ultrafast, nanoscale control of materials’ energetics, opening a pathway for tailoring energy-transfer processes with femtosecond laser fields. This approach lays the foundation for customizing nonequilibrium phase dynamics at the nanoscale and provides a route to tailoring energy-transfer processes using femtosecond laser fields.

 The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex drives NF-κB signaling and MALT1 protease activation after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, forming a central signaling hub in adaptive immunity. Both linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN, and TRAF6 interact with the CBM complex. Still, the coordinated activity of these E3 ligases in controlling CBM activity remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that LUBAC, unlike TRAF6, is largely dispensable for TCR-induced NF-κB activation in human CD4+ T cells. However, HOIP contributes to NF-κB target gene expression and, with TRAF6, modulates MALT1 substrate recognition, influencing T cell responses. Further, LUBAC-mediated conjugation of Met1-linked ubiquitin chains to BCL10 strictly depends on TRAF6, but putative Met1-ubiquitin acceptor lysines in BCL10 serve essential structural roles that limit accessibility within BCL10-MALT1 filaments. Thus, LUBAC acts downstream of TRAF6 to modulate MALT1 substrate recognition and to catalyze BCL10 ubiquitination, which is incompatible with BCL10-MALT1 filament formation. The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex governs canonical NF-κB signaling and MALT1 protease activation downstream of TCR stimulation.

Here, the authors report findings from a community-based cross-sectional study in India on the incidence, clinical outcomes, and costs associated with snake bites. 
 Snakebite, a neglected tropical disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in India, despite which reliable nationwide data are limited. To address this, we carried out a survey in 25 districts across 11 states, covering a 60 million population. The community-based study was led by frontline health workers who tracked cases and deaths, while field teams collected details on the bite, the type of snake, treatment received, and costs. Data were gathered continuously for a one-year period. Here we show that 7,094 snakebite cases were recorded, with a mortality rate of 0.33 per 100,000 population. Nearly half of the reported deaths occurred outside hospital settings. Bites were most common in males (64.1%), adults aged 30–39 years (20.9%), and during the monsoon season (62.1%). Most victims (86.4%) sought hospital care, 60.2% received anti-snake venom, and 17.2% experienced side effects to the anti-venom. Treatment placed a heavy financial burden on families; average out-of-pocket expenditure was INR 6,500, with higher costs in private hospitals (INR 27,400) compared to public facilities (INR 3,900). And 47.5% of the victims belonged to households below the poverty line. These findings show that faster access to hospitals, improved anti-venoms, and health insurance are urgently needed to prevent avoidable deaths.

Here, the authors derive theoretical formulae showing that higher variance along task-relevant directions accelerates learning speed, providing a framework consistent with empirical findings. 
 Learning speed depends on both task structure and neural dynamics prior to learning, yet a theory connecting them has been missing. Inspired by the fluctuation-response relation, we derive two formulae linking neural dynamics to learning. Initial learning speed is proportional to the covariance between pre-learning spontaneous activity and network’s input-evoked response, independent of the learning rule. For Hebb-type learning, initial speed scales with the variance of activity along target and input directions. These results apply across tasks including input-output mapping and time-series generation. Numerical simulations across diverse models validate the formulae beyond the theoretical-derivation’s assumptions. Although derived for early learning, the formulae predict total learning time. A straightforward implication is learning is faster when task-relevant directions align with high-variance spontaneous activities, consistent with empirical findings. Our framework establishes how the geometrical relationship between pre-learning dynamics and task directions governs learning speed, independent of details of tasks. Spontaneous neural activity has been experimentally linked to learning ability.

Their findings emphasize the importance of preserving interspecific connectivity. 
 Climate change is rapidly driving environmental shifts, posing an increasing threat to global biodiversity. Interspecific introgression—in which genetic material is transferred from one species to another following hybridization—may facilitate climate adaptation by introducing new genetic variation, which could mitigate species’ vulnerability to changing conditions. Here, using population and ecological genomic approaches and genetic offset modelling for future climates, we show that hybrid mountainous birds showed reduced vulnerability to climate change compared with non-hybrid counterparts. While geographic isolation and ecological heterogeneity promoted species divergence and distinct climatic niche requirements, gene flow persists at contact zones between these species. Maintaining current gene flow rates is projected to buffer against climate change risks over the next 40 generations. These findings demonstrate the role of interspecific introgression in enhancing climate resilience and future survival, and emphasize the conservation importance of preserving gene flow among species with narrow environmental tolerances.

Riverbed lowering due to sand mining and sediment diversion has substantially reduced the annual flood pulse and is projected to worsen if business continues as usual. 
 The Tonle Sap Lake (TSL), one of the world’s most productive lake–wetland ecosystems is sustained by an annual flood pulse that reverses Lower Mekong River flow into the lake during the monsoon and returns freshwater downstream during the dry season. Recent declines in the reverse flow have previously been attributed to climate change and upstream damming. However, here we show that between 1998 and 2018, riverbed lowering of the Mekong mainstem, driven by sand mining and upstream sediment trapping, has reduced the reverse flow by between 40 and 50% (high- to low-flow year range; 47% for medium flows). Projections to 2038, with additional riverbed lowering driven by ongoing sand mining, predict reverse flow declines of 69% (64–73%) compared with 1998. We show how these changes affect the lake’s flow regulation services across the Lower Mekong system. Specifically, the reduced TSL reverse flow increases flows to the Mekong Delta by ~26 km3 (31–23 km3) during the monsoon, heightening flood risk, while decreasing dry-season flows by ~59% (50–61%), contributing to intensified saltwater intrusion and diminished agricultural yields across the Mekong’s Delta. Our results underscore how excessive sand extraction is an existential threat to the TSL–Mekong system’s sustainability. The annual flood of Tonle Sap Lake supports over 20 million people’s livelihoods. Riverbed lowering due to sand mining and sediment diversion has substantially reduced the annual flood pulse and is projected to worsen if business continues as usual."

 The rapidly increasing demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models requires extensive server installation with sustainability implications in terms of the compound energy–water–climate impacts. Here we show that the deployment of AI servers across the United States could generate an annual water footprint ranging from 731 to 1,125 million m3 and additional annual carbon emissions from 24 to 44 Mt CO2-equivalent between 2024 and 2030, depending on the scale of expansion. Other factors, such as industry efficiency initiatives, grid decarbonization rates and the spatial distribution of server locations within the United States, drive deep uncertainties in the estimated water and carbon footprints. We show that the AI server industry is unlikely to meet its net-zero aspirations by 2030 without substantial reliance on highly uncertain carbon offset and water restoration mechanisms. Although best practices may reduce emissions and water footprints by up to 73% and 86%, respectively, their effectiveness is constrained by current energy infrastructure limitations. These findings underscore the urgency of accelerating the energy transition and point to the need for AI companies to harness the clean energy potential of Midwestern states. Coordinating efforts of private actors and regulatory interventions would ensure the competitive and sustainable development of the AI sector.

 Magnetite is a principal paleomagnetic recorder on Earth, but lunar magnetism is thought to be dominated by metallic iron and Fe-Ni alloys, with magnetite rare and typically sub-micrometer within troilite. We identify nanometer- to micrometer-scale magnetite in pentlandite-troilite assemblages from a Chang’e-5 regolith breccia. Magnetite occurs at and within pentlandite, locally enclosing pentlandite nanoinclusions, implying a formation pathway distinct from troilite-hosted occurrences. Textures and compositions indicate sequential crystallization from an impact-generated Fe-Ni-S-O melt: rapid pentlandite growth along troilite margins followed by magnetite nucleation at sulfide-silicate interfaces. The lunar low oxygen fugacity stabilizes Fe2+-enriched magnetite, unlike terrestrial analogues. High crystallinity and single-domain to single-vortex states indicate strong remanence stability, making these grains reliable recorders of the contemporaneous lunar magnetic fields. These results broaden the inventory of lunar magnetic carriers, demonstrate impact-driven magnetite formation under lunar redox conditions, and motivate use of magnetite to refine the Moon’s magnetic history.

This study examined the impacts of repeated OWP application on soil properties in two French long-term field experiments: QualiAgro and PROspective (20 and 18 years, respectively). The OWP included dehydrated urban sewage sludge (SLU), green waste and SLU compost, biowaste compost from source-separated municipal organic waste co-composted with green waste, municipal solid waste compost, farmyard manure from a dairy cow farm (FYM), and composted FYM from open-air composting on a concrete platform. The application of OWP led to increased soil nutrient levels and trace element availability, and stimulated microbial biomass and enzyme activities, while the response of nematode varied depending on site and OWP type. Biological properties were less affected than physico-chemical properties, though the OWP application enhanced soil microbial biomass and specific enzyme activities. The impact on soil nematode communities varied depending on OWP type and site. Strong correlations were observed among soil property changes, with exogenous carbon and nutrient inputs from OWP identified as key drivers.

This study quantified and characterized MP abundances along the Na’aman stream (Israel) and its outlet to the Mediterranean Sea, with samples collected before, during, and after the rainy season from established transects along the streambank and from the nearby beach. The spatial distribution and abundances of MPs were examined in relation to seasonal and hydrological conditions. MPs were sorted by type and counted by dissecting microscope. A representative subset of putative MP particles was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The overall mean (±standard error) MP abundance for the Na’aman stream was 231 ± 67 particles kg−1 sediment dry weight, with significant seasonal and spatial variation. MP accumulation increased during dry months and decreased sharply following flood events—dropping by 43% after a 13 mm rainfall event that triggered stream discharge of 3.25 m3 s−1, highlighting the stream’s role in flushing MPs to the sea. The most common MP types were fragments (61.9%), fibers, and foam, with polypropylene accounting for 56.9% of analyzed particles. MP types and polymer compositions varied by site and season, suggesting diverse sources such as domestic wastewater, agriculture, and marine backflow. These findings confirm that ephemeral stream systems can temporarily trap and subsequently remobilize MPs, acting as critical conduits between land-based sources and the marine environment.

Without understanding these heterogeneous effects, our ability to understand and respond to climate-related armed conflict risk remains incomplete. This paper systematically investigates the heterogeneous causal effects of droughts on both conflict incidence (extensive margin) and conflict intensity (intensive margin) across 8 world regions, 4 temporal and spatial resolutions, and 3 conflict types, reporting only patterns that hold consistently across specifications. Using a causal forest and a calibration test for heterogeneity reveals some evidence that droughts heterogeneously affect conflict incidence. Zero inflated negative binomial models that control for grid cell and yearly effects and include drought interactions with socioeconomic, political, and demographic variables show significant evidence that droughts heterogeneously affect conflict intensity. When examining individual interaction terms, baseline conflict risk-estimated using a random forest with the same socioeconomic, political, and demographic predictors plus conflict history-emerges as the only significant source of heterogeneity that is consistent across specifications. This suggests that other variables primarily influence drought–conflict relationships through their contribution to overall conflict risk, rather than through independent causal channels. The results demonstrate that even when droughts do affect conflict intensity heterogeneously, their overall role in armed conflict dynamics remains limited."

We conducted a laboratory experiment to assess the impacts of brucite inspired alkalinity addition (BIAA) as an OAE approach on the carbonate chemistry, biogeochemistry, and composition of the natural Santa Barbara Channel phytoplankton community sourced from a spring upwelling event. The BIAA treatment used MgCl2 * 6H2O and NaOH to yield a total alkalinity (TA) concentration of ∼3000 µmol kg−1, in contrast with the untreated seawater controls (TA = ∼ 2300 µmol kg−1). Our results suggest that BIAA altered the phytoplankton community composition, including reduced contribution of diatoms and enhanced numbers of Prymnesiophyceae (coccolithophores and Phaeocystis sp.). These results are in agreement with observations that biogenic silica content was lower under BIAA treatment. While the concentration of particulate inorganic carbon was consistently higher compared to controls, these differences were not statistically significant. Results revealed no differences between control and BIAA treatment in particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) concentrations. The proxy for cellular photosynthetic health Fv/Fm revealed that cells were photosynthetically healthy for both control and BIAA treatments, but values were lower in the BIAA treatment at the beginning of the exponential phase.

This could lead to higher energy-related emissions by lower-income consumers, potentially creating some conflicts with climate change mitigation objectives. Using an enhanced version of the Global Change Analysis Model, we simulate reductions of within-region income inequality that allow for narrowing differences in energy and food demand across deciles by 2050 in a Paris-compliant world. The energy demand increase by lower-income consumers is greater than the decline in demand by wealthier and more satiated income groups, leading to an overall rise in total demand. Nevertheless, the projected higher energy demand in the proposed more egalitarian societies only slightly increases the regional carbon prices and mitigation costs associated with the emission targets, therefore posing minimal impact on the achievement of the existing portfolio of climate pledges."

Here, we quantify the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation variability on total winter precipitation for Europe using dynamical adjustment with synoptic-scale weather patterns (WPs). Variability in atmospheric dynamics, through frequency changes in WPs, is shown to be a significant driver of observed wetting and drying trends, linked to observed trends in the North Atlantic jet stream. After removing dynamical variability, trends emerge in non-dynamical winter precipitation which are attributable to anthropogenic forcing: a north-south signal of a drying Mediterranean and increasingly wetter mid-to-high latitudes. Although this spatial pattern is well-represented by CMIP6 models, the magnitude of observed changes is approximately 23 years ahead of the CMIP6 multi-model mean predictions. Our results suggest that current adaptation strategies, based on multi-model means, may underestimate the near-term risk of climate-related hazards, and therefore require critical re-evaluation."

However, GRB221009A did not yield any observable signatures at the Schumann resonances (∼8, ∼14 Hz), which are also sensitive to the lower ionosphere. We show that the effects of GRB221009A are observable in a decrease in propagation velocity of ELF (3–1,000 Hz) lightning impulses. Analytical and numerical analysis points to an ionospheric perturbation in which the GRB increased the daytime electron density uniformly over a wide altitude range from 50 to 90 km. The GRB perturbation is markedly different from perturbations from solar flares, which significantly increase the vertical gradient of the electron density. ELF propagation velocity is shown to be a technique that can identify the altitude range of ionospheric perturbations."

Using Shannon entropy, mutual information (MI), and joint mutual information, metrics that capture both linear and nonlinear relationships, we identify the most informative variables and variable combinations governing D‐excess across contrasting marine and continental regimes. Relative humidity with respect to sea surface temperature (RHS) is consistently the strongest individual predictor, explaining up to 27% of D‐excess variability during marine conditions but only 10% in continental air masses. The Relative humidity(RHS) + sea surface temperature (SST) combination demonstrates synergistic effects, where their joint influence (explaining up to 36% of D‐excess variability) exceeds what either variable achieves individually, confirming their coupled influence on deuterium excess. Wind direction complements RHS most effectively during continental conditions. The best three‐variable combination (RHS + SST + Planetary Boundary Layer height) explains 38% of D‐excess variability in marine air, while no combination exceeds 20% explanatory power during continental periods. Information theory shows that heteroscedasticity in D‐excess relationships indicates regime shifts in controlling processes and quantifies fundamental constraints on predictor variables: some environmental factors like surface pressure or water vapor flux contain insufficient information content to explain D‐excess variability regardless of their physical relevance. These results highlight the different predictability limits between marine and continental regimes, challenging the adequacy of linear models and providing a rigorous framework for quantifying the information content of isotope‐climate relationships with implications for both modern and paleoclimate applications."

 Echocardiography is the most widely used cardiac imaging modality, capturing ultrasound video data to assess cardiac structure and function1. Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography."

 Tandem light-emitting diodes (LEDs), achieved by vertically stacking multiple units in series to combine the luminance of individual light-emitting elements, are effective for improving efficiency and lifespan compared to single-unit devices1–3. In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2.

 Extratropical peatlands in the Southern Hemisphere preserve detailed information on climatic and environmental change going back millennia. They are particularly valuable for understanding the evolution of the mid-latitude southern westerly winds (SWW), which play a major role in driving regional temperature and precipitation patterns, Antarctic sea-ice extent and ocean carbon fluxes. Here we investigate the timing and drivers of peatland initiation across the southern mid-latitudes after the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago) and test how this might relate to past changes in the SWW. We radiocarbon-date basal peats from the Falkland Islands and collate published basal peat radiocarbon ages from peat-forming regions south of 35° S. Using kernel density estimate models, we find distinct latitudinal phases of post-glacial peat initiation that suggest that peat growth is sensitive to variations in SWW position through their influence on moisture availability, temperature and dust deposition. A peak in peat growth in regions north of 52.5° S during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,700–12,800 years ago) suggests an equatorward migration of the SWW, coinciding with a slowdown in atmospheric CO2 increases. In light of recent SWW intensification and poleward migration, our findings highlight the potential for ongoing changes in the Southern Hemisphere climate and carbon fluxes under continued anthropogenic heating.

 The origin of geochemically enriched mantle in the asthenosphere is important to understanding the physical, thermal and chemical evolution of Earth’s interior. While subduction of oceanic sediments and deep mantle plumes have been implicated in this enrichment, they cannot fully explain the observed geochemical trends. Here we use geodynamic models to show that enriched mantle can be liberated from the roots of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle by highly organized convective erosion, a process tied to continental rifting and break-up. We demonstrate that this ‘chain’ of convective instabilities sweeps enriched lithospheric material into the suboceanic asthenosphere, in a predictable and quantifiable manner, over tens of millions of years—potentially faster for denser, removed keels. We test this model using geochemical data from the Indian Ocean Seamount Province, a near-continent site of enriched volcanism with minimal deep mantle plume influence. This region shows a peak in enriched mantle volcanism within 50 million years of break-up followed by a steady decline in enrichment, consistent with model predictions. We propose that persistent and long-distance lateral transport of locally metasomatized, removed keel can explain the billion-year-old enrichments in seamounts and ocean island volcanoes located off fragmented continents. Continental break-up causes a reorganization of shallow mantle dynamics that persists long after rifting, disturbing the geosphere and deep carbon cycle.

 The charge environment of superconducting qubits may be studied through the introduction of controlled, quantified amounts of ionizing radiation. We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth’s surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4π coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits.

Here, the authors show that X-linked repeats are differentially silenced during inactivation but do not undergo hyperactivation. 
 In mammals, X-linked dosage compensation involves X-chromosome inactivation to balance X chromosome dosage between males and females, and hyperactivation of the remaining X-chromosome (Xa-hyperactivation) to achieve X-autosome balance in both sexes. Studies of both processes have largely focused on coding genes and have not accounted for transposable elements which comprise 50% of the X-chromosome with numerous epigenetic functions. Here we develop a new bioinformatic pipeline tailored to repetitive elements with capability for allelic discrimination. We then apply the pipeline to our recent So-Smart-Seq analysis of single embryos to comprehensively interrogate whether X-linked transposable elements are subject to either X-chromosome inactivation or Xa-hyperactivation. We observe significant differences in repeat silencing in parentally driven “imprinted” versus zygotically driven “random” X-chromosome inactivation. Chromosomal positioning, genetic background and evolutionary age impact their silencing. In contrast, transposable elements do not undergo Xa-hyperactivation. Evolutionary and functional implications are discussed. X-chromosome dosage compensation involves inactivation and hyperactivation, but the role of transposable elements is unclear.

Here, the authors show that wild-type KRAS plays a key role in immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma by impairing interferon-mediated immunity and promoting resistance to immunotherapy via the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. 
 Increasing evidence indicates that activation of oncogenic pathways contributes to an unfavourable tumour immune microenvironment (TIME), ultimately resulting in resistance to immunotherapy. Here, we aim to identify a critical oncogenic pathway involved in an antigen-expressing c-MYC-lucOSOE/Tp53KO hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model that simulates immune response against tumour-associated antigens. Using data-independent acquisition proteomics, we reveal the role of wild-type KRAS in immune escaped mouse HCC tumours, with EGF concurrently activating EGFR/MEK/ERK signalling. Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis reveals that KRAS signalling intrinsically inhibits interferon-mediated MHC-I expression and extrinsically impairs CD8+ T cell activity due to the suppression of CXCL9 through the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. We observe KRAS activation in HCC patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments, where it correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Notably, combination therapy with SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902, Trametinib, and anti-PD-1 antibody effectively increased intratumoural CD8+ T cell infiltration and improved survival. Our study thus reveals that targeting wild-type KRAS signalling in combination with ICIs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for advanced HCC patients.

 Neural circuits undergo experience-dependent plasticity to form long-lasting memories, but how inhibitory interneurons contribute to this process remains poorly understood. Using miniature microscope calcium imaging, we monitored the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction. Here we show that interneurons exhibit complex and heterogeneous plasticity at both single-cell and ensemble levels across memory acquisition, expression, and extinction. Analysis of molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that disinhibitory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells are predominantly activated by salient external stimuli, whereas the activity of projection neuron targeting somatostatin (SST) interneurons additionally aligns with internal behavioural states. Although responses within each interneuron subtype are non-uniform, molecular identity biases their functional role, producing weighted circuit outputs that can flexibly regulate excitatory projection neuron activity and plasticity. These findings demonstrate that inhibitory interneurons actively shape the encoding and stability of emotional memories, underscoring their importance in adaptive learning. In this study, the authors uncover how diverse inhibitory interneurons in the amygdala flexibly contribute to fear and safety learning, revealing a key role for inhibition in emotional memory and adaptive circuit plasticity."

 Polymers that alter their properties and functions in response to carbon dioxide (CO2) exposure offer significant potential for the development of smart technologies and innovative CO2 utilization approaches. Nonetheless, effectively regulating the behavior of solid-state polymers using CO2 remains a considerable challenge, highlighting the need for robust and reliable strategies to address this issue. This study presents elastomers that feature nanophase-separated morphologies composed of CO2-vitrifiable polyethyleneimine and CO2-permeable polydimethylsiloxane components. The elastomers (Young’s modulus (E) of approximately 1 MPa) reversibly transform into hard plastics (E > 2 GPa) in the presence of CO2. In addition to bulk stiffening, their surface adhesion and friction rapidly shift, and the material’s fluorescence is significantly amplified. Here, we show that these multifunctional responses to CO2 position the materials as innovative platforms for responsive mechanical systems and CO2-activated optical devices, with potential applications in sensing, display, and data storage technologies.

 Increased water temperatures under climate change will probably cause decreases in dissolved oxygen and an associated increase in the number of days with hypoxia. This could have major consequences for freshwater ecosystems, but the extent of this threat remains unclear. Here we analyse trends in dissolved oxygen concentrations and days with stress and hypoxia in rivers worldwide between the periods 1980–2019 and 2020–2100 under global change. To achieve this, we train a hybrid process-based and machine learning model on approximately 2.6 million observations of dissolved oxygen, and we apply this model under both past and future conditions globally. The model projects significant decreasing trends in dissolved oxygen in most of the world’s rivers, resulting in on average 8.8 ± 2.3 more hypoxia days per decade globally between the years 2020 and 2100, and indicating a potentially major threat to freshwater ecosystems worldwide.

 Strong El Niño events drive substantial snowfall in West Antarctica, including the Antarctic Peninsula, by weakening the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) through atmospheric teleconnections, increasing surface mass balance, and mitigating ice mass loss’s contribution to sea-level rise. However, we find that CMIP6 projections show a diminishing El Niño-driven precipitation effect as global warming intensifies. The El Niño-associated precipitation anomaly is projected to weaken in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, becoming indistinguishable from zero by the late 21st century in the latter. This transition is caused by a strengthened polar jet, linked to a positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) trend in a warmer climate, which extends the wavelength of Rossby waves. As a result, the ASL anomaly eventually migrates eastward and equatorward, reducing water vapor transport into West Antarctica’s interior. These findings indicate that El Niño-driven precipitation disappears in a high-emission future, eliminating one of the buffering mechanisms that help counteract sea-level rise."

 The shallow portion of megathrusts can exhibit various modes of failure: interseismic creep, triggered afterslip, or rupture during a tsunami(genic) earthquake, resulting in a potential hidden danger to onshore communities. However, determining which mode is likely for a given portion remains challenging due to a lack of near-trench observations and limited resolution in inversion models. Here, we present a new two-step hybrid postseismic modelling approach that integrates the advantages of conventional forward and inverse methods, greatly improving our resolution of afterslip on the fault, viscous strain in the mantle, and the associated mechanical properties of both regions. We apply this approach to image the fault properties and slip evolution of the region surrounding the 2007 Mw 8.4 Bengkulu earthquake, and show how it promoted the subsequent 2010 Mw 7.8 Mentawai tsunami earthquake. Our results indicate that the deeper portion of the 2010 coseismic rupture area is velocity-strengthening, and slipped aseismically following the 2007 event. Upward propagation of this afterslip then loaded the shallow velocity-weakening area of the 2010 rupture, which generated a large tsunami in the Pagai Islands. Our approach affords a powerful tool for assessing the future possibility of tsunami(genic) and other triggered earthquakes in seismic gaps near recent large events.

 Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural hazards whose released energy can be quantified by their magnitude. Predicting how much energy will be released before the end of the rupture process represents a challenging question. The way earthquake ruptures grow, propagate and arrest determines the final size: small-to-moderate ruptures evolve in few seconds within few kilometers, while large-to-huge events develop in tens of seconds and several hundred kilometers. If the rupture process starts in the same way for small and large earthquakes, no deterministic prediction of the final size is feasible, until the process has completed. Instead, if the source mechanism starts differently from its beginning, real-time proxies can be measured on early radiated waves to discriminate the final event size. Here we show that the initial ground displacement grows differently for small and large earthquakes, based on the analysis of an unprecedented catalog of seismic waveforms from worldwide earthquakes. The result supports the hypothesis of early predictable magnitude for a wide range of different earthquakes in diverse geological settings. This study confirms that the initial growth of displacement can be used for a fast magnitude estimation, making it potentially feasible for future implementation in early warning systems.

 High-altitude hydrothermal systems provide laboratories for understanding microbial adaptation to extreme conditions. Here we investigated thermodynamic controls on metabolic transitions in Lirima hydrothermal system (Chile, 4000 meters above sea level) calculating affinities of competing carbon and sulfur reactions across pools (53–75 °C). Through geochemistry, numerical thermodynamic modeling, and stable isotope analysis, we identify Energetic Convergence Nodes where chemical affinities of competing pathways become equal. Calculations reveal hydrogenotrophic and carboxydotrophic methanogenesis converge with sulfate reduction at 63–64 °C. This corresponds with responses: carbon isotopes shift from −17.2‰ to −27.7‰, sulfur isotopes from −20.5‰ to −9.1‰, and carbon-to-sulfur ratios drop from ~10 to <1, indicating transition from carbon to sulfur-dominated metabolism. Microbial activity collapses at this temperature, while metagenomics validates both pathways. Independent analysis confirms convergence at 63–64 °C, establishing Energetic Convergence Nodes as predictive frameworks for metabolic boundaries with applications for early Earth biogeochemistry and extraterrestrial biosignature detection.

 Photosynthetic microbial fuel cells present an integrated strategy for wastewater treatment, greenhouse gas mitigation and bioenergy recovery. Here we elucidate the bioelectrochemical mechanisms by which external resistance and cathodic configuration regulate nitrogen transformation, carbon dynamics and microalgae-bacteria interactions. A microalgae-based cathode achieved net-negative carbon dioxide flux and approximately 37% lower nitrous oxide emissions than open-circuit systems, corresponding to reduced global warming potential relative to mixed-microbial and abiotic cathodes. This reflected enhanced carbon dioxide fixation and suppression of methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide reduction in the anodic region was attributed to denitrifying bacteria expressing nitrous oxide reductase, supported by electrons from organic matter oxidation. Photosynthesis stimulated nitrification at the cathode, while microalgae assimilated nutrients, improving removal. Lower external resistance enhanced extracellular electron transfer, correlated with elevated pilA and OmcS gene abundance and enrichment of electrogenic genera including Shinella, Geobacter and Pseudomonas.

 The conversion of natural forests to agricultural land threatens soil biodiversity and ecosystem stability, but its integrated impacts on soil multitrophic communities remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationships between forest-to-agriculture conversion, soil multitrophic community diversity, and temporal stability along a 3000 km transect in the Yangtze River Basin. Forest conversion increased the α-diversity of copiotrophic bacteria, but decreased the α-diversity of mycorrhizal fungi, parasitic protists, and most nematode functional groups. Crucially, it consistently decreased β-diversity across all functional groups, homogenizing soil communities. This homogenization destabilized ecosystem productivity by impairing soil nitrogen cycling and weakening plant–soil feedbacks. While the loss of α-diversity was observed in certain groups, it was the decline in β-diversity, or spatial variation, that emerged as the primary driver of reduced ecosystem stability. Our findings challenge conventional conservation paradigms by demonstrating that preserving ecosystem stability requires prioritizing β-diversity through sustainable agriculture and habitat protection.

 Earth’s sedimentary rock record is the primary archive for biotic, environmental, and climatic trends in deep time. Reconstructing these patterns requires a high-resolution geochronologic framework. This remains a significant challenge for many terrestrial ecosystems and an acute problem for some of the world’s most important Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil records. Overcoming this issue requires frontier approaches, such as directly dating fossils, long considered untenable. Here, we test the reliability of novel LA-ICP-MS U-Pb calcite dating and elemental mapping of non-avian dinosaur eggshells to produce accurate “burial ages.” We directly dated fossilized dinosaur eggs recovered from the Western Interior Basin of North America, producing ages within 5% of high-precision ages from bracketing ash beds. We then directly dated dinosaur eggs from Upper Cretaceous strata within Mongolia’s famous yet poorly age-constrained Gobi Basin, providing the first radioisotopic age for these deposits. Geochemical data coupled with trace elemental mapping indicate early uptake of uranium (U) in non-avian dinosaur eggshells via sediment contact, consistent with findings from Quaternary avian eggs. Calcified eggs, having evolved over 250 million years ago, offers a promising experimental methodology for determining the age of globally distributed fossil assemblages and recovering temporal, environmental, and ecological data from a single fossil. Biogenic carbonate of eggshells can be used as a new geochronometer through direct calcite U-Pb dating, producing high accurate ages, as revealed by two tests on dinosaur eggs from North America and Mongolia."

 Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) density mapping initiatives generally use one of three remote sensing approaches: lidar, radar, or near-nadir multispectral imaging leveraging machine learning methods, or a combination thereof. However, the active instrument record is limited and near-nadir multispectral imaging data are relatively insensitive to canopy physical structure. Multiangle imaging enables annual wall-to-wall mapping with a global record that extends back to 2000 as these data are highly sensitive to forest AGB. This paper describes work to validate estimates in a published annual, wall-to-wall record of forest AGB on a 250 m grid, derived using 672 nm imagery from the NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) for 2000–2021, covering the southwestern United States. Estimates in the published MISR-derived annual forest AGB map series for the southwestern United States and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B Gridded 1 km AGB product were both found to be highly consistent with NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) airborne lidar survey (ALS) AGB data. MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded similar coefficients of determination (∼0.7) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (∼60 Mg ha−1) for all ALS data used. For the large CMS Sonoma County Improved AGB dataset, MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded R2 = 0.88, 0.88 (0.91); RMSE = 58, 40 (37) Mg ha−1. Estimates from MISR thus have an accuracy similar to that of the GEDI L4B gridded AGB product, with some limitations (e.g., topographic shading, tall, dense canopies). However the published MISR maps are on a 250 m grid, wall-to-wall, and cover the period 2000–2021. These results suggest MISR is able to provide a means to investigate trajectories of forest AGB change in the southwestern U.S. from 2000 onwards—over a substantial period of accelerating environmental and human- and climate-driven change– with reasonable precision."

 Faster, better, and more accurate burned area (BA) mapping is crucial for assessing the environmental and socio-economic impacts of wildfires. However, the diverse background disturbance, spectral variability, and extensive distribution of BAs pose significant challenges to their detection using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery over large areas. Here, we developed a novel Moderate Spatial Resolution Burned Area Change Detection (MSR-BACD) framework, addressing these challenges through dataset development, model innovation, and inference optimization. Specifically: (1) we constructed a globally comprehensive MSR-BACD dataset, incorporating more than one million positive and negative samples (256 × 256 pixels) across diverse land cover backgrounds and cloud conditions to enhance model generalization; (2) we developed a specialized deep learning (DL) foundation model (custom Swin Transformer) leveraging dual-temporal (pre-and-post-fire) imagery to achieve precise BA delineation; and (3) we designed a candidate-based inference mode, collectively using the computational power and petabyte-scale RS data of the Google Earth Engine to generate BA candidates and the DL foundation model deployed on local GPU servers to filter out erroneous detections and delineate the BA extent, to improve detection efficiency significantly. Experimental results demonstrate that the MSR-BACD framework achieved a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.50 % in closed-set scenarios and outperformed existing moderate-resolution BA products in open-set evaluations in Portugal, increasing the Dice coefficient by 19.90 % while reducing computational costs by 95.62 % compared to traditional scene-by-scene exhaustive inference. These advancements highlight the MSR-BACD framework as a robust and efficient tool for regional-scale BA detection, contributing to wildfire science and application progress."

 Neurological diseases are a major public health concern. While these diseases could be influenced by pollution, the relationship controlling for extreme temperatures remains unexplored.We conducted a retrospective ecological time series study in Spain's 10 most heavily populated provinces, across the period 2013–2018. The dependent variables were daily emergency hospital admissions due to Parkinson's disease, dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis; and the independent variables were mean daily PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3 concentrations, and maximum and minimum daily temperatures in heat and cold waves. We used GLMs with the logit link function (linear regression models of the binomial family) for each province, and based on the probability of admission for each variable, we then calculated hospital admissions attributable to each variable of environmental risk.Across the study period in all the provinces covered, 2077 emergency hospital admissions due to the neurological causes considered were attributed to the environmental variables analysed, and accounted for 13.5 % of the total: the percentage breakdown showed 12.5 % as being attributable to air pollution and 1.0 % to extreme temperatures (0.6 % to cold waves and 0.4 % to heat waves). In terms of pollutants, 245 (95 %CI: 31–466) admissions were attributable to the effect of PM concentrations, a number far lower than those attributable to NO2, 581 (95 %CI: 148–1054), and to ozone, 1107 (95 %CI: 366–1861).The high impact of air pollution on these types of hospital admissions, taken together with population ageing and the imminence of increasingly higher populations living in large cities, calls for the urgent adoption of measures designed to reduce the pollution levels to which the populations of large cities are exposed."

 This study investigates the impacts of atmospheric mean state biases on the Indian Ocean teleconnection with Chile, using ERA5 reanalysis and CMIP5/CMIP6 models. During austral early-winter (May–June), Indian Ocean heating anomalies trigger a dipole of increased (reduced) precipitation over central (southern) Chile. The dipole is driven by cyclonic circulation anomalies induced by a zonal wavenumber-3 Rossby wave train originating from South Australia. Models that fail to simulate this rainfall dipole consistently exhibit an equatorward shift of the Southern Hemispheric eddy-driven jet stream. The associated waveguide weakening displaces the refraction location of zonal wavenumber-3 waves westward, thus shifting anticyclonic anomalies from the Amundsen Sea toward Chile. Consequently, the dry signal associated with the Indian Ocean teleconnection moves from southern to central Chile. This waveguide bias likely stems from a reduced meridional gradient of surface temperature, linked to an underestimated Antarctic Sea ice cover. For this reason, accurately simulating Antarctic Sea ice cover is crucial for a better representation of the Indian Ocean teleconnection to Chilean rainfall."

Trees in Montreal and Helsinki did not emit more BVOCs than expected based on measurements from forest trees, but the emissions varied between individual trees and growth environments. Avoiding high-BVOC emitting tree species and management strategies that protect trees from BVOC-inducing stress factors would help minimise their negative air quality impacts. 
 Many cities attempt to mitigate poor air quality by increasing tree canopy cover. Trees can indeed capture pollutants and reduce their dispersion, but they can also negatively impact urban air quality. For example, trees emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that participate in both ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, yet these emissions have been little studied in urban contexts.We sampled BVOCs from the leaves of mature urban trees using lightweight enclosures and adsorbent tubes in two cities: Montreal, Canada and Helsinki, Finland. In both cities, we targeted five common broadleaved species in parks and streets, comparing their standardised BVOC emission potentials to nonurban BVOC emission potential estimates from emission databases. We also calculated the potential O3 and SOA formation by the study species at the leaf scale and upscaled to the neighbourhood.We found that the measured BVOC emission potentials generally deviated little from the emission database estimates, supporting the use of database estimates for urban trees. However, tree-to-tree variation in the BVOC emission potentials was large, with slight differences between park and street trees. Compared to park trees, street tree emissions were higher in Montreal (specifically isoprene and sesquiterpenoids) and lower in Helsinki (specifically green leaf volatiles). Finally, we found that O3 formation from our study species' BVOC emissions was dominated by isoprene, while SOA formation was also affected by lower monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid emissions. These findings highlight the importance of species selection and management strategies that protect trees from BVOC-inducing stresses."

Previously, such information was not available, and calibration of the instrument had to be extrapolated to cover the whole measurement range. Results of this study will provide the scientific community with better tools for investigating the complexity of ambient aerosols. 
 The Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols coupled with a Chemical Ionization Mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-CIMS) is a widely used method for determining the chemical composition of the molecular constituents of atmospheric organic aerosols (OA). This temperature-programmed desorption technique thermally desorbs OA in a linearly ramped desorption temperature, and the temperature at a detected molecule's peak desorption rate, Tmax, is proportional to the molecule's volatility. Thereby, FIGAERO-CIMS also enables a direct measurement of the volatilities (saturation vapor pressures) of the OA constituents. A series of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) has been used to quantitatively connect FIGAERO measurement results (in particular, Tmax) to volatilities (i.e., calibrate). However, available literature values of saturation pressure (Psat) or saturation mass concentration (C*) for these compounds only extend to PEG 9, which exhibits Tmax values around ∼ 90 °C, whereas Tmax values of OA constituents measured from lab-generated or ambient aerosols routinely reach up to 160 °C (Li et al., 2021; Masoud et al., 2022). To extend the region over which we can conveniently calibrate FIGAERO-CIMS, and hypothetically also other thermal desorption-based techniques for investigating OA composition and volatilities, we performed FIGAERO-CIMS calibration experiments using aerosol particles consisting of PEGs 5-15, which yielded Tmax values of up to ∼ 150 °C. We then set out to estimate the hitherto unknown Psat (C*) values of PEGs 10-15 by utilizing a suite of different Psat estimation methods: both measurement-independent methods (quantum chemistry-based calculations, molecular structure-based group contribution methods, and parametrizations based on molecular sum formulas) and fits of an explicit desorption model to our FIGAERO measurement results with C* and vaporization enthalpies as free parameters. We assess the respective suitability of each method and argue that we obtain the best estimates for PEG volatilities based on the fits to our measurements. We obtained log 10(C* (µg m−3)) values ranging from 0.51 ± 0.07 (PEG 6) to −9.2 ± 1.6 (PEG 14), agreeing with previous literature results on PEGs < 10. Within uncertainties, our results broadly continue the near log-linear relationship of C* with PEG mass for larger PEGs and also agree with some of the independent methods. Contrary to common assumptions in previous literature on FIGAERO results, we find that the relationship between log10(C*(µgm-3)) and measured Tmax is not linear. We explore the consequences of this finding on the analysis of previously published FIGAERO-CIMS measurements of sesquiterpene-derived OA. Prospects for improving on our results in future work are discussed. We conclude that calibration experiments using aerosol containing PEGs up to ∼ PEG 15, with best-estimated saturation vapor pressures, provide promising opportunities for constraining the volatilities of aerosol constituents, down throughout the range of extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOC, C* < 3 × 10−4 µg m−3), as detected not only via FIGAERO-CIMS but also other (online) temperature-programmed desorption techniques."

 The Wind Synthesis System using Doppler Measurements (WISSDOM) is a practical scheme employed to derive high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) winds using any number of radars. This study evaluated the advantages of using multiple radars with different wavelengths in WISSDOM for the analysis of bow-shaped convection in a severe squall line recorded on 2 August 2020. A total of 11 radars were in operation in the areas surrounding Seoul metropolitan, South Korea: four S-band, two C-band, and five X-band radars. The advantages of using these radars were assessed using six different synthesis scenarios: (1) four S-band (scenario S), (2) two C-band (scenario C), (3) five X-band (scenario X), (4) a combination of four S- and two C-band (scenario SC), (5) four S- and five X-band (scenario SX), and (6) four S-, two C-, and five X-band radars (scenario SCX). The results revealed that scenario S offered good coverage in the synthesis domain, but relatively fewer observations were produced near the surface. In contrast, scenarios C and X provided sufficient data at lower levels but less coverage in the areas far from the radars. The scenarios SC and SX captured the return flow at low levels similar to typical squall line structures. Overall, the scenario SCX led to the optimal synthesis when compared with the observations. The mean bias (MB) of the U- and V-winds between the sounding observations and scenario SCX was 0.7 and 0.5 m s−1, respectively, while the root mean square difference (RMSD) of the U- and V-winds were around 1.7 m s−1. In addition, when comparing the retrieved WISSDOM winds with three radar wind profiler observations, the average MB (RMSD) for the U-, V-, and W-winds was 1.4, 2.0, and 1.0 m s−1 (3.1, 3.9, and 1.5 m s−1), respectively. The significant differences between scenarios S and SCX can be attributed to additional low-level observations in SCX, which allowed for the capture of stronger updrafts in the convection areas of the squall line.

These living datasets are updated every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO2, the key driver of climate change. 
 Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesise datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data. Emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are estimated by bookkeeping models based on land-use and land-use change data. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured at surface stations, and the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The global net uptake of CO2 by the ocean (SOCEAN, called the ocean sink) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2-products. The global net uptake of CO2 by the land (SLAND, called the land sink) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, ocean interior observation-based estimates, and Earth System Models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle.

By applying a deep learning model trained on both observational data and model simulations, we improved the representation of interannual variability and more accurately captured ocean responses to climate events like El Niño. This work supports global efforts to understand the ocean’s role in the carbon cycle and its response to climate change. 
 The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Spatial and temporal variations of ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 (spCO2) influence the air–sea CO2 flux through the difference between surface ocean and atmospheric pCO2 (ΔpCO2), which is further modulated by surface wind speed and gas exchange velocity. However, constructing a global spCO2 data product that is able to resolve interannual and decadal variability remains a challenge due to the spatial sparsity and temporal discontinuity of observational data. This study presents an approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, combining high-quality observational data from the CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) with multiple advanced global ocean biogeochemical models results to reconstruct a global monthly spCO2 dataset (SJTU-AViT) at 1° resolution from 1982 to 2023. The approach employs the self-attention mechanism of the ViT model to enhance the modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of spCO2, as well as incorporates physical-biogeochemical constraints from the derivative of spCO2 with respect to key controlling factors as additional features. The incorporation of advanced ocean biogeochemical models during the training process allows the ViT-based model to capture more accurate spCO2 variability in these data-sparse regions. Evaluations demonstrate that the new data product effectively captures spCO2 variability at both global and regional scales, showing good consistency with SOCAT observations, long-term ocean station data, and global atmospheric CO2 trends. The reconstructed spCO2 demonstrates strong capability in reproducing spCO2 anomalies during El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, particularly in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where it shows a correlation of −0.81 with the Niño 3.4 index and demonstrates high consistency with cruise data. Based on the SJTU-AViT dataset, the estimated global air–sea CO2 flux patterns are consistent with known regional features such as strong uptake in the Southern Ocean and outgassing in the tropical Pacific. This study not only provides a new 42-year data product for advancing understanding of the ocean carbon cycle and global carbon budget assessments, but also introduces a new Transformer-based deep learning framework for Earth-system data reconstruction.

To address this, we used machine learning models to learn the hidden relationships between easy-to-measure ocean properties (like temperature and salinity) and nutrient levels. Applying this model, we created ~ 470 million nutrient data points across the North Pacific from 1895 to 2024. This data will help to understand nutrient and marine ecosystem variability under climate change. 
 Nutrients play a critical role in oceanic primary productivity and the biological pump. However, compared to hydrographic parameters such as temperature and salinity, nutrient observations are limited due to their labor-intensive and costly measurements. Thus, nutrient observations are several orders of magnitude sparser than hydrographic observations. In this study, we first established a rigorous data quality control procedure to clean the hydrographic and nutrient (including NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻, DIP, and Si(OH)₄) observations collected from World Ocean Database (WOD) and CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) in the North Pacific. Subsequently, the cleaned and high-quality CCHDO dataset was used to train three machine learning models – Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Gaussian Process Regression – to establish relationships between nutrient concentrations and key variables, including space coordinates (longitude, latitude, and depth), time variables (year and month), and water mass properties (indexed by potential temperature and salinity). Validation shows that the reconstruction closely matches the observations, with RMSEs of <1.41, <0.071, <0.089 and <3.07 mmol kg-1 for NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻, DIP, and Si(OH)₄, respectively. The validated models were then applied to reconstruct nutrient concentrations from the hydrographic observations in WOD, most of which lacked direct nutrient measurements. This resulted in ~473 million reconstructed nutrient data points across 1.92 million stations for each nutrient, spanning from 1895 to 2024, representing a 2,127 to 2,393-fold increase compared to the original nutrient observations in the North Pacific (197,539 to 222,234). This new dataset will be valuable for studying nutrient variability under climate change and anthropogenic influences, and for providing transient boundary conditions in ocean biogeochemical models.

Kern;Andreas Maier;Nikki Vercauteren,Landscape reconstructions for Europe  during the late Last Glacial (60–20 ka BP):  a pollen-based REVEALS approach,"We provide vegetation reconstructions during the Last Glacial period (60,000 to 20,000 years before present) using fossil pollen data and the REVEALS model. Understanding vegetation change in response to abrupt climate change is critical to enhance our understanding plant migration patterns and the demographic development and dispersal of anatomically modern humans into Europe. Our application PALVEG (https://oakern.shinyapps.io/PALVEG/), aims to make such data accessible to non-experts. 
 Vegetation change during the Last Glacial period in Europe plays a crucial role in better understanding the ecosystem dynamics response to abrupt climate change. Yet, most quantitative reconstructions of land-cover primarily focus on the Holocene and aim to disentangle the impact of anthropogenic and climatic stress on the vegetation. Here, we present temporally continuous land-cover reconstructions from Europe for the latter half of the Last Glacial period (60–20 ka BP) using the “Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites” (REVEALS) model. The pollen-based REVEALS model uniquely factors in plant-specific parameters, such as relative pollen productivity (RPP) and pollen fall speed to model pollen dispersal and thus provides more accurate representation of past vegetation cover than simple relations of fossil pollen counts. We compiled a total of 61 datasets from Europe and its bordering regions to model land-cover estimates across 60 time steps in 1000 year increments (Kern, 2024b). By grouping the 38 analysed taxa into 5 land-cover types (LCTs), we simplify the interpretation of our results, demonstrated in three selected periods during the Last Glacial: Greenland Interstadial 14 (GI-14), Greenland Stadial 9 (GS-9), and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). These periods provide insight into stadial-interstadial vegetation variability as well as extreme glacial conditions, which seem to play a fundamental role in the demographic developments of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. Additionally, we compare the REVEALS land-cover estimates to raw pollen data, provide REVEALS standard errors, and discuss the reliability of our results as well as potential avenues to further improve the reliability of REVEALS estimates. To facilitate the use and interpretation of our data for a wide scientific audience, we developed the browser-based application PALVEG (https://oakern.shinyapps.io/PALVEG/, last access: 22 October 2025), which requires no prior programming experience and dynamically generates maps based on user input."

As our climate warms, fjords are hotspots of change and more scientists are collecting data in fjords. These data need to be available, useable, and intuitive across a wide range of users – from scientists to local people. We provide an example of gridded transect data from Sermilik Fjord as a way to achieve this. 
 As global atmosphere and ocean temperatures rise and the Greenland Ice Sheet loses mass, the glacial fjords of Kalaallit Nunaat/Greenland play an increasingly critical role in our climate system. Fjords are pathways for freshwater from ice melt to reach the ocean and for deep, warm, nutrient-rich ocean waters to reach marine–terminating glaciers, supporting abundant local ecosystems that Greenlanders rely upon. Research in Greenland fjords has become more interdisciplinary and more observations are being collected in fjords than in previous decades. However, there are few long-term (> 10 years) datasets available for single fjords. Additionally, observations in fjords are often spatially and temporally disjointed, utilize multiple observing tools, and datasets are rarely provided in formats that are easily used across disciplines or audiences. We address this issue by providing standardized, gridded summer season hydrographic sections for Sermilik Fjord in Southeast Greenland, from 2009–2023. Gridded data facilitate the analysis of coherent spatial patterns across the fjord domain, and are a more accessible and intuitive data product compared to discrete profiles. We combined ship-based conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiles with helicopter-deployed eXpendable CTD (XCTD) profiles from the ice mélange region to create objectively mapped (or optimally interpolated) along-fjord sections of conservative temperature and absolute salinity. From the gridded data, we derived a summer season climatological mean and root mean square deviation, summarizing typical fjord conditions and highlighting regions of variability. This information can be used by model and laboratory studies, biological and ecosystem studies in the fjord, and provides context for interpreting previous work. Additionally, this method can be applied to datasets from other fjords helping to facilitate fjord intercomparison studies. The gridded data and climatological products are available in netCDF format at https://doi.org/10.18739/A28G8FK6D (Roth et al., 2025a). All original profile observations, with unique DOIs for each field campaign, are available through the Sermilik Fjord Hydrography Data Portal (https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/sermilik, last access: 7 November 2025) hosted by the Arctic Data Center (Straneo et al., 2025).

 A continuous meteorological and hydrological observational record is described of the Met Office semi-rural field site of Cardington in southern England between 2004 and 2024. The site was designed to carry out boundary layer, fog and air-surface exchange research to improve the representation of process-based physics within the Met Office Unified Model. The site lay in a flat river basin and was laid mainly to cropped grass and was surrounded by arable fields intermixed with small trees and shrubs through most wind sectors. Observations utilised flux masts at various heights, visibility, radiosondes, very near-surface and subsoil in situ sensors in addition to more specialist remote sensing instruments to retrieve atmospheric properties. In addition to boundary layer and surface data, soil properties such as temperature, moisture and water table depth were obtained. All components of the surface energy balance could be determined. Availability of data based on 30 minute time steps over 20 yr, for the combined components of the energy balance not flagged as either bad or missing, amounts to 77 %. The momentum roughness length as determined at the 10 m height for the prevailing wind sector increased from 3 cm to 8 cm over the period predominately due to 52 ha of woodland growth within 1 km of the site.

Turetsky,A Comprehensive Database of Thawing Permafrost Locations Across Alaska,"We created a database of 19,540 thawing permafrost sites across Alaska, including both abrupt and non-abrupt thaw features and explored relationships with elevation, slope, and incoming solar radiation. We use the database to show that existing ground ice maps are too coarse to predict abrupt thaw risk. This database can enhance predictions of future thaw, improve greenhouse gas budget calculations, and guide planning and climate adaptation strategies. 
 The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average, leading to widespread permafrost thaw degradation with profound implications for ecosystems, infrastructure, and global climate feedbacks. While gradual permafrost thaw occurs over decades, abrupt thaw events – such as thermokarst formation or retrogressive thaw slumps – can rapidly alter ecosystems and severely damage infrastructure. Although abrupt thaw is increasingly widespread, comprehensive datasets that map its spatial distribution at regional scales for land managers and local governments are still lacking. To address this gap, we created the Alaska Permafrost Thaw Database, an open-access, collaborative database which compiles 19,540 permafrost thaw and thermokarst locations across Alaska from 44 sources, integrating field observations, remote sensing products, and the published literature. This database spans observations from 1950 through present and incorporates datasets of varying spatial resolution, ranging from field-based point measurements to remotely sensed products (1–125 m), providing statewide coverage across Alaska. The dataset includes abrupt thaw features and sites experiencing gradual top-down thaw that can help to support comparative analysis and predictive modeling. We used this database to explore relationships between thaw type (abrupt vs. non-abrupt) and topographic metrics (i.e., slope, relative elevation, and potential incoming solar radiation), analyze the distribution of various thaw features across Alaska’s major ecoregions, and compare the database to current spatial datasets of ground ice and Yedoma. Our analysis shows abrupt thaw features are more prevalent in lowlands and depressions while gradual top-down and lateral thaw features are more commonly associated with areas receiving higher potential incoming solar radiation such as south facing slopes and open clearings. We also found substantial mismatches between ice-driven thaw processes and existing ground ice and Yedoma maps, likely reflecting the coarse resolution of current mapping products relative to the fine-scale nature of field measurements and highlighting the limitations of current datasets for local-scale prediction. The database provides direct, empirical evidence of actively thawing and stable permafrost locations and can be used to inform and validate ground ice mapping. By comparing the database with physiographic characteristics and remotely sensed measurements, the database can guide future field campaigns in areas with little to no observations. As permafrost thaw transforms Arctic landscapes, high-resolution, accessible spatial data – such as our thaw database – will be critical for informing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. The Alaska Permafrost Thaw Database is openly available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16996415), which provides a link to the GitHub repository and access to all versions; this paper describes version 2.0.0."

 This study presents the first national-scale spatial inventory of relict charcoal hearths (RCHs) in Poland, based on high-resolution LiDAR data and digital terrain analysis. Using a combination of manual interpretation, GIS-based feature extraction, and K-prototypes clustering, we identified and classified 634,815 RCHs across forested regions of the country. Each feature was georeferenced and categorized by size, morphological characteristics, slope position, and environmental context, including current and potential vegetation and soil types. Spatial analyses revealed significant regional differences in hearth density, with the highest concentrations found in western and south-central Poland, particularly in the Lower Silesian, Stobrawa, and Świętokrzyskie forests. Cluster analysis distinguished three major types of RCHs, differing in their environmental settings and spatial organization: (1) lowland pine-dominated clusters on gentle terrain, (2) isolated features on steep slopes in mixed forests, and (3) high-density hearth groups in elevated areas. Although large portions of the country appear devoid of RCHs, we argue that this reflects limitations in preservation and detection – due to long-term agricultural activity in lowlands and erosion in mountainous areas – rather than an actual absence of charcoal production. The resulting ReCHAR database offers a unique, open-access tool for interdisciplinary research on forest history, human-environment interactions, and early industrial landscapes. Its modular design supports further expansion, including links to historical settlements and industries reliant on charcoal, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and tar or potash production."

 Internal climate variability encompasses processes ranging from daily weather fluctuations to multidecadal interactions within the climate system. A large component of internal variability on sub-seasonal to multi-decadal time scales is associated with recurring patterns or “climate modes”.

These modes were derived from 23 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models, each with over 500 years of simulation data, ensuring robust statistical insights into their spatial and temporal structures. The datasets were validated against observational data, revealing broad-scale consistency and highlighting biases in regional features and amplitudes.

 High spatiotemporal resolution typical meteorological year (TMY) data are essential for building energy modelling and urban climate studies. However, conventional TMY datasets, limited by sparse ground-based station coverage and infrequent updates, fail to meet the demands of detailed urban-scale simulations. To overcome these limitations, this study uses Australia as a case study and develops a new high-resolution dataset, the TMY derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), hereafter referred to as TMY-MER. A novel weather classification approach was introduced, utilizing a mean relative error index derived from the ratio of daily to monthly maximum solar radiation to identify clear-sky conditions. Uncertainty errors were spatially interpolated using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method. The results reveal several limitations in the previously generated TMY datasets. TMY-MER demonstrates stable accuracy under clear-sky conditions, with annual average errors below 5 %, while under cloudy conditions, influenced by cloud simulation bias, errors can reach up to 50 %. Spatially, annual solar irradiance is overestimated by 30 % in southeastern coastal urban clusters, while errors in inland regions remain below 10 %. Temporally, the peak error during cloudy winter periods reaches 30 %, whereas summer clear-sky errors are under 5 %. Further analysis using the direct-diffuse separation model indicates a systematic overestimation of diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) within 6 %, and an approximately 20 % negative bias in direct normal irradiance (DNI). Validation through building cluster simulations shows that the optimized dataset achieves over 90 % consistency with traditional TMY data, with monthly mean errors below 5 %. The multidimensional error assessment framework significantly enhances the reliability of reanalysis data for use in complex climate zones, supporting dynamic energy system planning and urban thermal environment modelling."

 We integrate the refactored community Noah-MP version 5.0 model with the NASA Land Information System (LIS) version 7.5.2 to streamline the synchronization, development, and maintenance of Noah-MP within LIS and to enhance their interoperability and applicability. We evaluate and compare 5-year (2018–2022) global and regional benchmark simulations of LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 and LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 for a set of key land surface variables. Both models capture the spatial and seasonal distributions of observed soil moisture, latent heat (LH), snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, snow cover, and surface albedo, with similar bias patterns. Both models tend to underestimate soil moisture over wet soil regimes and overestimate over dry soil regimes, with slightly higher (≤ ∼ 0.01 m3 m−3 for global mean) soil moisture in LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 across most regions. The model bias patterns of LH overall follow those of soil moisture, while LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 has a lower LH across many non-polar regions than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1, which reduces the global mean LH bias from 0.99 to −0.39 W m−2. The model SWE bias patterns are dominated by the precipitation and temperature forcing uncertainties, with slightly lower SWE values in LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 (global mean bias of −13.2 mm) than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 (global mean bias of −10.1 mm). The model bias patterns of snow depth generally follow those of SWE. LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 consistently overestimates snow cover globally with a mean bias of 0.11, while LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 effectively reduces the overestimates across the global snowpacks with a mean bias of 0.07 because of updated snow cover parameters. Both models show widespread overestimates of surface albedo over mid-latitude and high-latitude regions but significant underestimates in the Sahara Desert and Antarctica. Overall, LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 outperforms or is similar to LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 in the evaluated land surface variables, except for slight degradation in simulated surface soil moisture and SWE. This study reveals possible model deficiencies, motivates future improvements in coupled canopy-snowpack-soil processes and input soil data, and points to the importance of considering observational and forcing data uncertainties in model evaluation."

Satellites image the whole terrestrial surface and could cost-efficiently map plant diversity globally. However, developing the necessary methods lacks consistent and sufficient field measurements. Thus, we propose using a simulation tool that generates virtual ecosystems, with species properties and functions varying in response to meteorology and the respective remote sensing imagery. 
 As global and regional vegetation diversity loss threatens essential ecosystem services under climate change, monitoring biodiversity dynamics and its role in ecosystem services is crucial in predicting future states and providing insights into climate adaptation and mitigation. In this context, remote sensing (RS) offers a unique opportunity to assess long-term and large-scale biodiversity dynamics. However, the development of this capability suffers from the lack of consistent, global, and spatially matched ground diversity measurements that enable testing and validating generalizable methodologies. The Biodiversity Observing System Simulation Experiment (BOSSE) aims to alleviate the lack of this information by means of simulation. BOSSE simulates synthetic landscapes featuring communities of various vegetation species whose traits's seasonality and ecosystem functions (e.g., biospheric fluxes) respond to meteorology and environmental factors. Simultaneously, BOSSE can generate various types of remote sensing imagery linked to the traits and functions via radiative transfer theory. Specifically, it simulates hyperspectral reflectance factors (R), which can be convolved to the bands of specific RS missions, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and land surface temperature (LST). The resolution of the RS imagery can be degraded to test the robustness of different approaches to information loss and the capability of new methodologies to overcome this limitation. Therefore, BOSSE enables users to evaluate the capability of different methods to estimate plant functional diversity (PFD) from RS and link it to ecosystem functions. We expect BOSSE to support the benchmarking and improvement of old and novel methods dedicated to estimating plant diversity and exploring the biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) relationships, facilitating advances in this growing area of research and supporting the analysis and interpretation of real-world measurements. We also expect BOSSE to be extended and include new features that provide more realistic simulations that help answer more complex questions related to climate change and global warming."

We then implement Ternary Homogeneous Nucleation (THN), Ion Mediated Nucleation (IMN), and sulfuric acid-dimethylamine (DMA) nucleation parameterization schemes into the CMAQ model. Seven modelling scenarios are conducted to explore the model's performance on PNC. The results indicate that the scenario with combined IMN and DMA scheme (SumID scheme) yields the best agreement with the observations, enhancing PNC during new particle formation (NPF) events by 84 % in Beijing and 36 % in Nanjing. In SumID scheme, IMN contributes to 56.30 % of the number concentrations in Beijing and 27.86 % in Nanjing, while DMA accounts for 28.15 % in Beijing and 29.27 % in Nanjing, respectively. IMN nucleation contributed PNC exhibits a pronounced diurnal variation with higher concentrations during the day and lower levels at night. DMA pathway predominantly influences NPF events during the morning and evening peak. This study enhances the model's capability to accurately simulate NPF events and underscores the significant influence of IMN and DMA nucleation on PNC in eastern cities."

We use a high‐resolution (3–4 km) pan‐Arctic ocean‐sea ice model forced by present day and future scenarios to examine changes in mean kinetic energy (MKE) and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Our study suggests that both the mean and eddy fields are becoming more energetic under anthropogenic forcing but changes in the mean circulation dominate the increase, concurrent with a spin‐up of the large‐scale circulation, concentrated in the top 200 m and along boundaries. The increase in EKE is strongest in the upper 50 m and is linked to enhanced baroclinic instability within the mean boundary currents. A better grasp of the distribution of this energy surplus helps to understand projected changes to stratification, mixing, and circulation in a future Arctic Ocean."

As in previous studies, our results show that growing cumuli are surrounded by downdrafts linked to cloud‐scale quasi‐toroidal circulations at all times at middle and upper cloud levels consistent with the thermal chain description of convective clouds. These toroidal circulations are responsible for the most intense cloud‐edge downdrafts in our simulations. In the upper cloud half, roughly 30%–50% of the upward mass flux is typically compensated within a radius of about twice the updraft radius in quasi‐laminar simulations forced by a warm bubble in an initially quiescent flow. In a turbulent cloud forced by surface fluxes, this compensation fraction is around 10%–30% over the same region. In contrast to the buoyancy‐centered view of subsiding shells, Eulerian and Lagrangian vertical momentum budget analyses show that the most intense cloud‐edge downdrafts in the turbulent setup, and after spin‐up of the toroidal circulation in the quasi‐laminar experiments, are predominantly mechanically forced (i.e., driven by dynamic pressure accelerations). This is consistent throughout the entire growth phase of the cumulus clouds and across tests with varying assumptions, including drier and moister environments. Despite dynamic pressure perturbations being the main driver of toroidal downdrafts, the downdraft speed (relative to the corresponding updraft velocity) exceeds the prediction of the non‐buoyant Hill's spherical vortex—a simple model frequently used for cloud‐scale circulations—by more than 30%."

Climate‐smart agriculture aims to improve yields while minimizing its climate impact, such as from soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions driven by microbial activity. From an irrigation perspective, this underscores the need to assess irrigation practices beyond the traditional objectives of maximizing yield and water use efficiency by also considering their climate impact from soil GHG emissions. To address this gap, we frame climate‐smart irrigation as a multi‐objective optimization problem and derive a dual‐index framework for evaluating irrigation practices across productivity, water consumption, and climate impact dimensions. The Marginal Irrigation Water Productivity (MIWP) index quantifies additional yield per unit of irrigation water, while the Marginal Irrigation Climate Impact (MICI) index measures the associated changes in soil GHG emissions. We apply this dual‐index framework to wheat and rice field irrigation studies with varying soil GHG compositions, showing its ability to assess irrigation across different crop systems. Crop model simulations further demonstrate how different irrigation practices are mapped within the MIWP‐MICI space, where Pareto‐optimal solutions highlight trade‐offs between productivity and climate impact goals. Our approach provides a consistent, quantitative basis for comparing irrigation across multiple dimensions of climate‐smart irrigation."

 Chirality is central to life, and controlling the formation of one of a pair of mirror-image molecules (enantiomers) is a central tenet of synthetic chemistry. Although controlling stereogenic carbon1–3, silicon4,5, phosphorus6,7 and sulfur8,9 centres is commonplace, nitrogen centres in amines are not typically stable. Limited achievements in the enantioselective construction of nitrogen chirality have primarily been established in quaternary ammonium salts10–12 and bridged bicyclic amines13–17, which have a restricted pyramidal configuration. The asymmetric synthesis of non-bridged pyramidal nitrogen-chirogenic compounds suffers from a super-stoichiometric chiral source and exhibits poor stereoselectivity18–24. Here we present a catalytic enantioselective strategy for construction of acyclic nitrogen stereocentres via a chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed chlorination reaction. We designed a stereospecific intramolecular reaction to overcome the structural and configurational instabilities of nitrogen-chlorinated hydroxylamines. The resulting 2-alkoxy-1,2-oxazolidines showed good enantiopurities, and density functional theory calculations confirmed successful enantiocontrol of nitrogen chirality during the chlorination process. Furthermore, this strategy has been applied successfully to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre. Control experiments provide evidence for an SN2 pathway for the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution event. An asymmetric organocatalysis strategy is used to control pyramidal nitrogen chirality and to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre."

 Axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) do not regenerate following injury, in contrast to neurons in the peripheral nervous system and neuronal growth during embryonic development. The molecular mechanisms that prevent regeneration of neurons in the CNS remain largely unknown1,2. Here, to address the intracellular response to injury, we developed an in situ cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy platform to mimic axonal damage and present the structural mechanism underlying thalamic axon regeneration induced by the drug epothilone B. We observed that stabilized microtubules extend beyond the injury site, generating membrane tension and driving membrane expansion. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the in situ structure of microtubules at 3.19 Å resolution, which engage epothilone B within the microtubule lattice at the regenerating front. During repair, tubulin clusters are delivered and incorporated into polymerizing microtubules at the regenerating site. These microtubule shoots serve as scaffolds for various types of vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the supply of materials necessary for axon repair until membrane tension normalizes. We demonstrate the unexpected ability of neuronal cells to adjust to strain induced by epothilone B, which creates homeostatic imbalances and activates axons to regeneration mode.

 Since late 2021, a panzootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 has devastated wild birds, agriculture and mammals. Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015 (refs. 1,2), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention.

 Rare coding variants shape inter-individual differences in human phenotypes1. However, the contribution of rare non-coding variants to those differences remains poorly characterized. Here we analyse whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank2,3 to quantify the relative contribution of 40 million single-nucleotide and short indel variants (with a minor allele frequency (MAF) larger than 0.01%) to the heritability of 34 complex traits and diseases. On average across phenotypes, we find that WGS captures approximately 88% of the pedigree-based narrow sense heritability: that is, 20% from rare variants (MAF < 1%) and 68% from common variants (MAF ≥ 1%). We show that coding and non-coding genetic variants account for 21% and 79% of the rare-variant WGS-based heritability, respectively. We identified 15 traits with no significant difference between WGS-based and pedigree-based heritability estimates, suggesting their heritability is fully accounted for by WGS data. Finally, we performed genome-wide association analyses of all 34 phenotypes and, overall, identified 11,243 common-variant associations and 886 rare-variant associations. Altogether, our study provides high-precision estimates of rare-variant heritability, explains the heritability of many phenotypes and demonstrates for lipid traits that more than 25% of rare-variant heritability can be mapped to specific loci using fewer than 500,000 fully sequenced genomes. WGS data were used from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank to obtain high-precision estimates of coding and non-coding rare variant heritability for 34 complex traits and diseases."

 Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity1–3. Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease.

Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development. In flowering plants, DNA–FD–14-3-3 recruits FT to the florigen activation complex both through DNA–FT interactions and by reducing liquid phase condensation of FD protein, which promotes dimerization, leading to FT recruitment."

 It has long been proposed1, and then observed2,3, that faster rates of soil production occur beneath thinner soils. It remains uncertain, however, whether soil thickness is the driving variable regulating production from the top-down2–6, or whether soil thickness is simply responding to changes in bedrock weathering controlled from the bottom-up7,8. Answering this question is difficult because the feedbacks between soil production and soil erosion, the processes that jointly govern soil thickness2,9,10, respond to perturbations on timescales of thousands to millions of years11,12, timescales that are too long for scientists to observe directly. Here we leverage a space-for-time substitution at a transient mountain range along the San Andreas Fault13–15, where the remarkable tectonic setting allows for independent quantification of uplift, soil production and erosion. We show that, following a pulse of tectonic uplift, the conversion of rock to soil accelerates before the overlying soils thin, but at the same time that topographic stresses increase7 and the rock weakens16. This observation challenges the long-standing assumption that soil production rates are controlled predominantly by soil thickness1,2, and instead lends evidence for a bottom-up, rock strength control on soil production. Findings from a tectonically active mountain range show that soil production is driven by bottom-up rock weakening rather than by soil thickness, challenging long-held top-down models."

 Rainfall and flooding frequently disrupt the lives of urban residents worldwide, posing substantial public health risks1,2. Rapid urbanization is exposing larger and more vulnerable populations to flooding3, while climate change intensifies rainfall patterns4,5 and rising sea levels impair drainage systems6–11. Despite the growing recognition and urgency of these hazards, the health impacts of rainfall remain poorly understood, and those of sea-level rise are entirely unquantified. Here we estimate the mortality consequences of rainfall in one of the world’s largest cities—Mumbai, India. We integrate high-resolution data on rainfall, tides and mortality to analyse how unmanaged rainfall, and its interaction with tidal dynamics, contribute to urban health risks. We find that rainfall causes more than 8% of Mumbai’s deaths during the monsoon season, and that more than 80% of this burden is borne by slum residents. Children face the biggest increase in mortality risk from rainfall, and women face a greater risk than men. We also demonstrate that mortality risk from rainfall increases sharply during high tides and use this relationship to evaluate how rising sea levels could amplify rainfall-induced mortality in the absence of adaptation. Our findings reveal that the mortality impacts of rainfall are an order of magnitude larger than is documented by official statistics12,13, highlighting the urgent need for investment in improved drainage, sanitation and waste-management infrastructure.

 Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behaviour and neural representations in vision tasks1,2. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do3,4, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref. 5), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems. Aligning foundation models with human judgments enables them to more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across various levels of visual abstraction, while additionally improving their generalization performance."

 Two-dimensional moiré materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. Correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered by precise choice of stacking geometry1–3. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry4,5. An open question is how the atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. On above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of 0.6°, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons and correlation-driven behaviours.

 Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb–Robinson bound for information propagation1,2, often lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during the formation of a weakly interacting Bose–Einstein condensate3–18. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas19,20 that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the interatomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, at which the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck’s constant and the particle mass, or, equivalently, by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium21–34, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.

 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a large genetic component1. It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults2, and is associated with several severe outcomes3–11. Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified12,13, but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes (MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2; P < 3.07 × 10−6; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD (n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes.

 The synthesis of enantiopure materials is vital for pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries owing to the inherently chiral nature of biological systems and the fact that two enantiomers can have markedly different biochemical properties1. In particular, enantioselective preparation of atropisomers is of great interest owing to their privileged status as chiral ligands and pharmacophores2–4. Although chromatographic- or crystallization-based methods are commonly used to separate atropisomers, we urgently need more efficient and economical approaches to access enantioenriched atropisomers5,6. The use of stereoconvergent methods to access molecules with point chirality is well established but we have not tapped the potential of stereoconvergent catalytic methods to arrive at enantioenriched atropisomers. Here we report deracemization activity of a P450 enzyme and explore its ability to deliver a stereoconvergent route towards enantioenriched atropisomers. Using a curated set of P450 variants, we found that a wide variety of symmetric and non-symmetrically substituted 2,2′-binaphthol (BINOL) building blocks can be deracemized to high enantiomeric purity. This deracemization activity is mechanistically distinct from the activity of previously reported P450 enzymes, which operate through enantioselective bond formation to afford enantioenriched atropisomers. By contrast, the deracemization process reported here is proposed to proceed through bond rotation. As engineered variants have complementary selectivity profiles and substrate scope, this biocatalytic platform should be readily tunable for any desired substitution pattern. We anticipate that these results will inspire new stereoconvergent approaches to synthesizing conformationally stable atropisomers. A new method for deracemization of atropisomers is described which leverages a P450 enzyme-mediated process involving bond rotation for enantioenrichment."

 Gene flow between biological species is a common and often adaptive evolutionary phenomenon throughout the tree of life1–4. Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny.

 All polymers exhibit gas permeability through the free volume of entangled polymer chains1–3. By contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene stack densely and can exhibit molecular impermeability4–6. Solution-synthesized 2D polymers that exhibit the latter by poly-condensation have been a longstanding goal.

Optical interference during the pressurization of nanofilm-coated microwells allows measurement of mechanosensitive rim opening and sealing, creating gas-filled bulges that are stable exceeding three years. This discovery enables 2D polymer resonators with high resonance frequencies (about 8 MHz) and quality factors up to 537, similar to graphene. A 60-nm coating of air-sensitive perovskites reduces the lattice degradation rate 14-fold with an oxygen permeability of 3.3 × 10−8 Barrer.

 Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) sits at the nexus of nutrient metabolism and shuttles between the canonical and non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle1,2, which is dynamically regulated by nutritional status, such as fasting3. Here we find that mitophagy is triggered after a reduction in cytosolic AcCoA levels through short-term fasting and through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase (encoded by ACLY), mitochondrial citrate/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A1) or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (encoded by ACSS2), and the mitophagy can be counteracted by acetate supplementation. Notably, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member X1 (NLRX1) mediates this effect. Disrupting NLRX1 abolishes cytosolic AcCoA reduction-induced mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the mitochondria outer-membrane-localized NLRX1 directly binds to cytosolic AcCoA within a conserved pocket on its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, AcCoA binds to the LRR domain and enhances its interaction with the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which helps to maintain NLRX1 in an autoinhibited state and prevents the association between NLRX1 and light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, we find that the AcCoA–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance. Thus, cytosolic AcCoA is a signalling metabolite that connects metabolism to mitophagy through its receptor NLRX1.

 Rare diseases are collectively common, affecting approximately 1 in 20 individuals worldwide. In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.

 Marine picocyanobacteria are abundant photosynthetic organisms of global importance. They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages—viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit1–5. One such gene is nblA, which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6–8. Under nutrient deprivation cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9–11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light-harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation6,8,13. However, the benefit of the virus-encoded NblA for cyanophages and the broader impact on the host are unclear. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that viral NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and comprise 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of NblA to the cyanophage, while it exerts a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA has an adverse global impact on light harvesting by oceanic picocyanobacteria. Viral NblA accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency."

 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive expulsions of magnetized plasma from a star and are the largest contributors to space weather in the Solar System1,2. CMEs play an important role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star3–5. However, this conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive event6–9. A signature of a fast CME is a type II radio burst10,11, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time and polarization properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar type II burst. We demonstrate that the rate of these events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs is

 The number of spatial omics technologies being developed is increasing1. However, a missing tool is one that can locate proteins in tissues in an untargeted manner at high spatial resolution and coverage. Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications.

 The challenges associated with the transition of life from water to land are profound1, yet they have been met in many distinct animal lineages2–5. These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems.

 Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies1. NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis2,3, but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases.

 Precise construction of molecular chirality is a longstanding scientific challenge in synthetic chemistry. Although methods to enantioselectively assemble consecutive carbon stereocenters are abundant, courses to establish enriched continuous heteroatomic stereocenters have acquired less attention and remain a tremendous challenge. Of those atoms in main group elements, nitrogen and boron are the most intractable ones to control their chirality.

The protocol is compatible with a wide range of amine boranes and diazo compounds, exhibiting high diastereo- and enantioselectivities.

 Trypanosoma cruzi possesses hundreds of genes associated with pathogenesis. The extent and organization of this diverse gene repertoire, expression, and role in infection remain unclear. Using accurate long-read sequencing and chromatin conformation capture, we assembled T. cruzi Sylvio X10 strain chromosomes from telomere-to-telomere. The genome provides accurate organization of multigene family genes, confirming their distribution in expanded clusters or scattered throughout the chromosomes. Quantitative proteomics shows stage-specific proteins and numerous trans-sialidases upregulated in trypomastigotes. The expression of virulence gene families varied in trypomastigotes after each round of cell infection, resulting in heterogeneous parasite populations with variable cell invasion capacity. A T. cruzi genome-wide yeast surface display screen against Chagas disease patients’ antibodies reveals genes expressed during human infections. However, limited conservation in their antibody-binding sites suggests their sequence diversity and variation might help parasites avert antibody recognition.

Here, the authors show that YTHDF2 recognizes m6A-modified U6 snRNA to prevent aberrant TLR3 activation to inhibit inflammation and skin cancer development. 
 The role of m6A RNA methylation of self non-coding RNA remains poorly understood. Here we show that m6A-methylated self U6 snRNA is recognized by YTHDF2 to reduce its stability and prevent its binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), leading to decreased inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells and mouse models. At the molecular level, endosomal U6 snRNA binds to the LRR21 domain in TLR3, independent of m6A methylation, to activate inflammatory gene expression, a mechanism that is distinct from that of the best known synthetic TLR3 agonist poly I:C. Both U6 snRNA and YTHDF2 are localized to endosomes via the transmembrane protein SIDT2, where YTHDF2 functions to prevent the U6-TLR3 interaction. We further show that UVB exposure inhibits YTHDF2 by inducing its dephosphorylation and autophagic protein degradation in human keratinocytes and mouse skin. Skin-specific deletion of Ythdf2 in mice enhanced the UVB-induced skin inflammatory response and promoted tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that YTHDF2 plays a crucial role in controlling inflammation by inhibiting m6A U6-mediated TLR3 activation, suggesting that YTHDF2 and m6A U6 are potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating inflammation and tumorigenesis.

 Plasmids carrying the mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 are prevalent among multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, yet their broad impact on bacterial physiology and virulence remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acquisition of an mcr-1 plasmid concurrently increases antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity in Escherichia coli. On the same plasmid, the XRE-family transcriptional regulator EcaR cooperates with MCR-1 to activate the wec operon, driving biosynthesis of two surface polysaccharides: enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and a high-molecular-weight O-chain. Expression of these surface polysaccharides increases bile resistance and virulence in a murine model and further elevates colistin resistance. MCR-1 enhances transcription of upstream genes in the wec operon, whereas EcaR directly activates an internal promoter (PwecE) to induce downstream gene expression. Thus, both components are required for surface polysaccharide expression, and deletion of either abolishes the phenotype. Genomic analysis of publicly available mcr plasmids reveals widespread co-occurrence of mcr-1 and ecaR on IncI2 and IncX4 plasmids, indicating their functional complementarity. These findings uncover a mechanism by which resistance plasmids remodel the bacterial surface, linking horizontal gene transfer to coordinated regulation of antimicrobial resistance and virulence. In this work, authors show that colistin-resistance plasmids in Escherichia coli, via MCR-1 and a plasmid-encoded regulator, upregulate surface polysaccharide synthesis, enhancing antibiotic resistance and virulence and defining a mechanistic link between resistance and pathogenicity."

Here the authors design an electrochromic organogel for stable electrochromic windows. 
 Electrochromic (EC) devices based on structurally designable and color-tunable EC molecules can dynamically regulate light-heat transmittance via the charge-transfer mechanism, yet face challenges of limited near-infrared (NIR) absorption, long-term instability, and restricted modulation modes. Here, we show that π-stacking of heteroaromatic tri-pyridine molecules with a 1,3,5-triazine core (H-TriPy) enhances molecular conjugation, significantly augments NIR absorption, and enables dual-band modulation with improved visual comfort. The three pyridine-based redox centers facilitate multi-step electron transfer, enabling multi-modal EC regulation, including bright, cool, and dark modes. Incorporation of a fluorinated ionic liquid into EC organogels inhibits irreversible π-stacking of high-concentration H-TriPy. Consequently, H-TriPy-based EC devices achieve neutral-colored states with near-zero transmittance as low as 3.7% in both visible and NIR ranges and maintain high switching stability of over 89.1% retention after 100,000 cycles. Furthermore, large-area EC devices exhibit uniform tinting and reliable stability, underscoring their potential for energy-efficient green buildings.

Here, authors show how CLMB uses a composite motif to form multimeric complexes with calcineurin that are required for dephosphorylation. 
 Calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase, recognizes substrates and regulators via short linear motifs, PxIxIT and LxVP, which dock to distinct sites on calcineurin to determine enzyme distribution and catalysis, respectively. Calcimembrin/C16orf74 (CLMB), an intrinsically disordered microprotein whose expression correlates with poor cancer outcomes, targets calcineurin to membranes where it may promote oncogenesis by shaping calcineurin signaling. We show that CLMB associates with membranes via lipidation, i.e., N-myristoylation and reversible S-acylation. Furthermore, CLMB contains an unusual composite ‘LxVPxIxIT’ motif, that binds the PxIxIT-docking site on calcineurin with extraordinarily high affinity when phosphorylated, 33LDVPDIIITPP(p)T44. Calcineurin dephosphorylates CLMB to decrease this affinity, but Thr44 is protected from dephosphorylation when PxIxIT-bound. We propose that CLMB is dephosphorylated in multimeric complexes, where one PxIxIT-bound CLMB recruits calcineurin to membranes, allowing a second CLMB to engage via its LxVP motif to be dephosphorylated. In vivo and in vitro data, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of CLMB-calcineurin complexes, support this model. Thus, CLMB with its composite motif imposes distinct properties to calcineurin signaling at membranes including sensitivity to CLMB:calcineurin ratios, CLMB phosphorylation and dynamic S-acylation.

This work develops a titanium alloy exhibiting active passivation behavior that ensures its electrochemical and mechanical stability in seawater-like environments. 
 Titanium alloys represent a promising material in marine applications, focusing on high-stakes environments where their corrosion resistance and high specific strength offer significant benefits. However, they can still be vulnerable to localized corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, in the presence of aggressive chlorides. Here we report a lightweight titanium alloy that addresses these issues through conventional casting and thermal-mechanical processing. The alloy can generate a passive film showing distinct but stable electrochemical responses. It is found that the reaction of the passive film can shift from the slow accumulation in the passive region, to the rapid buildup of passive layers in extreme anodic potentials. Consequently, the alloy exhibits a pitting potential above 10 VSCE without being subjected to localized corrosion. Meanwhile, mechanical reliability is also achieved during stress corrosion tests, owing to the fast repair of the passive film that substantially constrains the crack propagation. Such virtual immunity to seawater corrosion qualifies this titanium alloy as a potential candidate for long-term cost savings and sustainability. Seawater corrosion can impact the lifespan and reliability of metallic materials for marine applications.

 Artificial light pollution is increasing worldwide with pervasive effects on ecosystem structure and function, yet its influence on ecosystem metabolism remains largely unknown. Here we combine artificial light at night (ALAN) intensity metrics with eddy covariance observations across 86 sites in North America and Europe to show that ALAN indirectly decreases annual net ecosystem exchange by enhancing ecosystem respiration (Re). At half-hourly and daily scales, we detect consistent nonlinear interactions between ALAN and night duration, with Re increasing under higher ALAN and partially decoupling from gross primary production. At the annual scale, gross primary production shows no direct ALAN response and is instead influenced by the growing season length and urban proximity, whereas Re responds more strongly and consistently across timescales. Our findings show that ALAN disrupts the fundamental energetic constraints on ecosystem metabolism, warranting the inclusion of light pollution in global change and carbon–climate feedback assessments.

 On 1 January 2024, the Noto Peninsula earthquake generated a devastating tsunami that struck coastal areas within several minutes, yet resulted in few tsunami casualties. Despite its importance, the cause of this unexpectedly low human loss remained unclear, as conventional surveys were hindered by the limited access and the presence of many visitors during the holiday. Here we reveal evacuation behaviour during the 2024 Noto Peninsula tsunami using large-scale geolocation data collected from a smartphone app. We find that the evacuation was extremely fast, occurring within 2–6 min after the origin time. Additionally, the long-term analysis of the data reveals that people started returning to the coastal area 20–100 min after the origin time, which was long before the downgrading and cancellation of the tsunami warnings. These results highlight the utility of the geolocation data for evacuation surveys, which addresses the limitations of conventional evacuation surveys.

 In the Arctic, substantial amounts of methane are stored in marine sediments. Yet, the distribution and stability of methane reservoirs is poorly understood, especially offshore Greenland. As Arctic warming accelerates, understanding natural methane seepage is crucial for assessing its role in the carbon cycle and climate impact. Here, we present a unique interdisciplinary geoscientific data set that spans the ice-covered Northeast Greenland shelf and captures entire fluid flow systems from source to sink. Our data documents widespread natural seepage of oil and gas from the seafloor through the water column, locally reaching the sea surface. The released hydrocarbons are sourced from deep petroleum systems and primarily migrate along permeable beds towards the seafloor. Glacial erosion during the Quaternary has effectively removed the sealing units, creating geologic windows that allow widespread natural seepage. Our first-order estimates suggest that minimum 677–1460 Mt of thermogenic gas ( ~ 0.5–1.1 Gt of carbon) has been released into the ocean since grounded ice retreated from the shelf around ~15 ka BP. These findings provide new insight into the impact of active natural seepage in a rapidly changing climate and have substantial implications for the Arctic Ocean’s carbon cycle and marine ecosystems.

 Decreasing fish catch threatens the food security and livelihoods of coral reef–dependent communities. However, coastal food systems are too often managed through the narrow lens of fish production, while accessibility also matters. Here, using small-scale fishery, socioeconomic, and interview data from five coastal districts of Palawan, Philippines, we show that fish consumption—an important driver of nutrition security, since energy, protein, and micronutrient intakes depend on the amount and type of fish consumed by residents—is not correlated with production, as a large share of the catch is exported, particularly reef fish. Pelagic and soft-bottom–associated species, on the other hand, are less frequently exported, cheaper, and locally preferred, making them a vital food safety net. We suggest that coral reef fisheries and blue food management should take into account species differences and post-harvest processes to ensure more equitable food outcomes for coastal communities.

 The encroachment of human settlements into wildland areas has expanded the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), disrupting ecosystems and increasing wildfire risks. A systematic mapping of woody vegetation and building structures across the wildland-urban continuum is critical for fire risk and ecosystem service assessment, fuel management, conservation, and land use planning. The highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of this landscape requires a fine-scale monitoring approach. Although machine learning and computer vision have advanced land cover classification using very high resolution imagery (VHR), most studies either focus on identifying only a particular object or a limited study area. We here developed a unified semantic segmentation deep learning model (U-Net) to map trees, shrubs, and building footprints at 0.6 m resolution using the open-source VHR multispectral imagery from the National Aerial Imaging Program (NAIP) for the state of California. A semi-automatic labeling process was adapted to generate a large set of labels for model training and testing with available aerial LiDAR surveys. The validation showed robust performance of the trained U-Net model in predicting canopy-scale trees and shrubs as well as buildings, achieving an overall accuracy of 87.1% and F1 scores of 83.1% for trees and 78.9% for shrubs across different years. Further evaluation demonstrated that this approach captured the fine-scale spatial arrangement of woody vegetation and buildings, and the temporal vegetation dynamics from selective logging, regrowth, and tree mortality following wildfire. The model’s scalability was also shown for county and statewide mapping. Given the availability of open-access NAIP imagery every 2–3 years over the continental US, our scalable approach provides a sub-meter monitoring tool and data to improve ecological and building assessment and fire simulation. These capabilities support adaptive land management to mitigate WUI fire risk and ultimately promote fire-safe communities and resilient ecosystems along the WUI-wildland gradient."

 Based on daily precipitation data from the China Meteorological Administration and reanalysis data from the Japan Meteorological Agency during 1979–2023, this study finds that the synoptic-scale disturbances and the quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) have crucial influence on the spring rainy season onset (RSO) over southern China. Pronounced changes in precipitation are identified before and after the RSO dates on both synoptic and quasi-biweekly timescales, associated with distinct atmospheric circulations. On the synoptic timescale, the RSO is typically preceded by the development of a lower-tropospheric cyclone and a mid-tropospheric baroclinic trough to the west of southern China, enhancing moisture transport from the South China Sea. Meanwhile, on the quasi-biweekly timescale, the key circulation features consist of a broad quasi-barotropic cyclone encircling the Tibetan Plateau and a corresponding anticyclone over the Bay of Bengal in the lower and middle troposphere, jointly facilitating moisture advection from the Arabian Sea. These systems amplify geostrophic relative vorticity anomalies over East Asia and sharpen the zonal gradient of relative vorticity, thereby contributing to upward motion through dynamic processes. From a thermodynamic perspective, the intensification of the cyclone to the west of southern China strengthens southerly winds, which promotes warm air advection and further reinforces vertical ascent. The synergy between these dynamic and thermodynamic processes sustain ascending motion, thereby facilitating the RSO in conjunction with enhanced low-level moisture transport. Clarifying the circulation characteristics triggering the RSO will aid in better predicting the start of the local rainy season in both weather forecasts and extended-range outlooks, then guiding spring farming activities."

 Extreme precipitation events are highly destructive, but their accurate prediction poses a significant challenge because the physical mechanisms underlying each event are uniquely complex. In June 2024, extreme heavy rainfall struck regions south of the Yangtze River (SYR) in China, marking the highest precipitation anomaly of the corresponding period near Dongting Lake since 1961. This led to the year's first flood of Dongting Lake and a levee breach in Huarong County, causing substantial damage to agricultural fields, infrastructure facilities, and residential areas. Regarding external sea surface temperature (SST) forcing, the elevated SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic and Indian Ocean combined with cold SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific contributed to this extreme rainfall, with the Indian Ocean playing a dominant role. In terms of internal atmospheric variability, the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) subsequently triggered subseasonal precipitation anomalies and further intensified precipitation during late June 2024. A global climate model (BCC_CPSv3) initialized in May produced a northward deviation in the heavy rainfall belt in June 2024. Through dynamical downscaling, the regional climate model (CWRF) improved the spatial distribution of the precipitation prediction. This improvement was primarily attributed to the more realistic representation of warmer SSTs in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, and their relationships with precipitation in the regional model. A U-Net model based on the nonlinear relationship between circulation and precipitation was employed to pinpoint the circulation sources of prediction skill and error in the regional model. The experimental results revealed that the prediction skill of CWRF for precipitation in the SYR region during June 2024 stemmed mainly from its accurate representation of lower-tropospheric meridional wind. However, its simulation of lower-tropospheric humidity remains inadequate and requires further improvement."

The results suggest this next‑generation propellant supports climate goals with its near‑zero global warming potential (GWP) and offers a sustainable substitute, helping ensure future pMDI supply for people with chronic respiratory diseases. 
 Trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene (HFO-1234ze(E); E-CF3CH=CHF) is a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) with near-zero global warming potential, developed as a propellant for use in pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs). HFO-1234ze(E) contains a “–CF3” moiety, which makes formation of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) possible in the atmosphere. To quantify the contribution of TFA formed from prospective HFO-1234ze(E)-based pMDIs, we applied a global atmospheric model coupled with detailed watershed modelling. Our atmospheric model incorporates the master chemical mechanism for HFO-1234ze(E) and assumes pMDIs as its sole emission source. Based on global pMDI volume-sales data, we estimate HFO-1234ze(E) emissions at 4.736 Gg yr−1. Although emissions are higher in northern-temperate regions, our model predicts that the highest TFA deposition rates occur in the tropics, likely due to more intensive photolysis of trifluoroacetic aldehyde in temperate zones (favouring non-TFA products) and/or transport of TFA into the tropical zone from nearby regions. Using predicted TFA deposition rates around the Hudson, Cauvery, and Rhine river basins, we applied a fate-and-transport model to estimate TFA concentrations in surface water, soil, and sediments over 30 years. Modelled surface-water TFA levels ranged from 0.8 to 19.3 ng L−1 across the three watersheds, indicating substantial variability between regions. Comparison of Rhine results with the conservative Netherlands drinking-water thresholds (2200 ng L−1) yields a margin of exposure of approximately 700-to-2500-fold. These findings suggest that modelled TFA levels from continuous pMDI-related HFO-1234ze(E) emissions over the study period in the Rhine region are unlikely to pose a risk to human health or the environment."

Groos;Nicolas Brand;Murat Bronz;Andreas Philipp,Atmospheric sounding of the boundary layer over alpine glaciers using fixed-wing UAVs,"We have developed a low-cost, lightweight, and open-source fixed-wing drone to study vertical changes in air temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction and turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer over mountain glaciers. The results of four measurement campaigns on a glacier in the Swiss Alps demonstrate the potential of the new measurement technique and reveal characteristic insights into glacier-atmosphere interactions and the mountain-valley wind circulation. 
 Glaciers are an integral part of the high mountain environment and interact with the overlying atmosphere and surrounding terrain in a complex and dynamic manner. The energy exchange between the glacier surface and the overlying atmosphere controls ice melt rates and promotes a characteristic microclimate, including the formation of a low-level katabatic jet that interacts with other, often thermally driven winds in alpine terrain. Information on the local circulation and structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers is crucial for studying cryosphere-atmosphere interactions and for investigating the characteristics of the katabatic wind, its broader cooling effect, and its susceptibility to be disrupted by strong valley or synoptic winds that promote heat advection from the ice- and snow-free periphery towards the glacier. While the number of ground-based measurements from weather stations and meteorological towers installed on glaciers for boundary layer research has increased in recent years, a lightweight and mobile measurement technique for atmospheric sounding over alpine glaciers has not yet been available. Here we describe a new measurement technique based on a low-cost and open-source fixed-wing UAV, which allows sounding the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers up to several hundred metres above the surface. In the frame of a feasibility study in 2021, two half-day (16 June, 23 September) and two 24 h campaigns (9/10 July, 25/26 August), including nocturnal soundings, were performed, demonstrating the UAV's capability to reach heights of up to 800 m above the glacier surface. From these campaigns, 40 profiles of air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and turbulence were derived. The results highlight characteristic features of the glacier boundary layer, including a persistent surface-based inversion, a cool and dry katabatic wind confined to the lowest 50 m a.g.l., an overlying shear layer, and a warmer, often more humid valley wind above 100–200 m a.g.l. These observations illustrate how the boundary layer responds to synoptic forcing and local winds and demonstrate the potential of UAV-based atmospheric soundings for advancing glacier meteorology in complex alpine terrain."

Bishop,"A detailed streamflow and groundwater salinity dataset for Muttama Creek Catchment, NSW, Australia","A detailed water quality dataset for a 1000 km2 catchment in New South Wales, Australia is presented. The water quality data for surface and groundwater was collected over 14 years and contains more than 1000 records. Despite missing values and different sampling methods and groups, the data provides a consistent overview of the hydrogeochemistry of the catchment. This dataset is valuable for global modelling studies as well as better understanding of local dryland salinity and water quality processes. 
 Dryland salinity remains a major global natural resource management concern, and which is amplified in Australia. However, limited detailed space-time data sets with observations of stream and groundwater salinity has constrained a deep understanding of the range of processes that can lead to dryland salinity problems in landscapes. The aim of this study is to report on the open dataset (https://doi.org/10.25910/m0wp-8890, Vervoort et al., 2025) resulting from a 14 year data collection effort in a subcatchment of the Murrumbidgee catchment in New South Wales, Australia. Over a 14 year period a series of different sampling campaigns has resulted in a large dataset with hydrogeochemical data which includes both in-situ (field) data and post laboratory analysis of major anions and cations. This data is augmented with observed groundwater levels and publicly available streamflow and climate data (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BEUWK, Vervoort and Akter, 2024). The data set covers 23 groundwater sample sites and 39 surface water sites. Because the data was collected by four distinct groups and over many years, we investigate whether this has caused a bias in the dataset. In addition, we show the major spatial and temporal trends to provide an overview of the dataset. The dataset is made open access to encourage further research and the current paper shows the richness of the collected data and opportunities for further research."

Due to scarce snow data in remote areas, this project involved local communities in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to measure snow depth using simple tools and share results via Telegram. This community data improved satellite snow observations, enhancing water forecasts. Local involvement enhances accuracy and supports better water management in this challenging region. 
 Central Asia is a landlocked region with its freshwater resources originating in the mountains of Pamir, Tianshan, and Hindukush. Water resources in this area are formed mainly due to seasonal snowmelt, with glacier melt being the second largest hydrological component contributing to river flow, primarily in late summer. Water resources are shared among all Central Asian countries and used mainly for agricultural production purposes as well as hydropower generation. Proper management of water resources requires an accurate assessment of water availability originating in the mountains, mainly due to snowmelt. This requires data on snow depth, which is limited in the region. Snow surveys that were initiated during the 1980s have not continued in many parts of the region. The limitation of data on snow depth observations creates a challenge in forecasting water availability with the required accuracy."

A spectral-index random forest (93.21 % accuracy) and post-processing enhanced boundary precision. The dataset (TPLake-MED) shows steady lake expansion (~ 34.91 km² per year) with peak area in September/October. Monthly changes are more significant in the west, and smaller lakes are more sensitive, offering insights for climate and ecosystem management. 
 Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau have expanded markedly over recent decades, reflecting complex interactions between the regional water cycle and the cryosphere. Whereas annual datasets capture long-term trends, they often overlook short-term hydrological responses and seasonal transitions that are resolved by monthly observations. Consequently, a systematic understanding of intra-annual lake variability remains limited, largely because most existing datasets are designed for interannual scales, which makes monthly variations and seasonal patterns difficult to characterise. These limitations hinder investigations into the driving mechanisms and complicate assessments of climate-change impacts. To address this gap, we utilised Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the MODIS Surface Reflectance product MOD09A1 (500 m) to construct a monthly vector boundary dataset for lakes larger than 10 km2 across the Tibetan Plateau for 2000–2024. Within this dataset, the number of large lakes larger than 50 km2 ranged from 142 to 175, and the number of smaller lakes (10–50 km2) varies between 232 and 260 across the study period. A random forest classifier based on spectral indices was developed and validated with 533 balanced water/non-water samples, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.21 % and an F1 score of 0.927. To enhance spatial precision, we implemented a boundary optimisation workflow integrating filtering, morphological operations, and geometric rectification, thereby improving agreement between extracted and actual lake extents. Aggregate lake area on the Plateau increased at 34.91 km2 per year, and typically reached its annual maximum in September or October. The relative monthly rate of area change showed higher values in the west, lower in the east, and stronger variability centrally; for individual lakes the maximum monthly relative change reached 28.43 % from 2000 to 2024. In addition, smaller lakes were more sensitive to environmental change than larger lakes. To our knowledge, this is the first monthly resolution vector dataset of Tibetan Plateau lakes that couples multi-temporal classification with morphological optimisation. The dataset provides critical support for climate-change research, ecological conservation, and policy formulation, and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12443/BNU.RSEC.TPLake-MED20251028."

These storms, called Polar Mesoscale Cyclones (PMCs), sometimes cause extreme winds and waves, threatening marine operations. IMPMCT combines remote sensing measurements and reanalysis data to construct a comprehensive PMCs archive. It includes 1110 PMCs tracks, 16 001 cloud patterns, and 4472 wind records, providing fundamental data for advancing our understanding of their development mechanisms. 
 Polar Mesoscale Cyclones (PMCs), particularly their intense subset known as Polar Lows (PLs), characterized by short lifespans of 3–36 h and horizontal scales below 1000 km, pose significant hazards to polar maritime activities due to extreme winds exceeding 15 m s−1 and wave heights surpassing 11 m. These intense weather systems play a critical role in modulating sea-ice dynamics and ocean-atmosphere heat exchange. However, current understanding remains constrained by sparse observational records and an overreliance on single data sources (e.g., remote sensing or reanalysis). To address these gaps, this study presents the Integrated Multi-source Polar Mesoscale Cyclone Tracks (IMPMCT) dataset, a comprehensive 24-year (2001–2024) record of wintertime (November–April) PMCs for the Nordic Seas. The IMPMCT dataset was created by combining vortex-tracking algorithms applied to ERA5 reanalysis data with a deep learning-based method for detecting cyclonic cloud features in Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared imagery. It also incorporates near-surface wind data from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) measurements. The dataset contains 1110 vortex tracks, 16 001 cyclonic cloud features including length, width, position and morphological characteristics (spiral/comma shape), and 4472 wind speed records (wind vector imagery and cyclone maximum winds). Corresponding ERA5-derived hourly vortex tracks are also provided, including 850 hPa vorticity and proximate sea-level pressure minima. Validation demonstrates statistical agreement with existing PLs track datasets while providing more complete cyclone life cycle trajectories, more intuitive cloud imagery visualization, and a richer set of parameters compared to previous datasets. As the most comprehensive PMCs archive for the Nordic Seas, the IMPMCT dataset provides fundamental data for advancing our understanding of the genesis and intensification mechanisms, enables the development of enhanced monitoring and early warning systems, supports the validation and refinement of polar numerical weather prediction models, and facilitates improved risk assessment and safety protocols for maritime operations.

 MechGen is a software system designed to derive gas-phase reaction mechanisms for reactive organic compounds under atmospherically relevant conditions for use in chemical models and for data analysis and interpretation. It has been used to derive versions of the SAPRC mechanisms used in airshed models, with SAPRC-22 being the most recent. MechGen derives fully explicit mechanisms for many types of organic compounds and their oxidation products when they react in the atmosphere in the presence of oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants and then uses these explicit mechanisms to derive reduced or lumped mechanisms more suitable for use in airshed models. This paper gives an overview of the system, describes the procedures it uses to generate explicit and reduced mechanisms, and presents several types of applications. The assignments and estimates used to derive individual chemical reactions and assign rate constants are discussed in a separate companion paper. The system is publicly accessible for generating explicit mechanisms for single compounds and viewing associated documentation using a web-based interface. A separate terminal login is available for deriving mechanisms for multiple compounds, multi-generation mechanisms, and portions of lumped mechanisms for airshed models, as well as for system programming and management.

Zakem,Nitrite accumulation in marine oxygen minimum zones induced by microbial nitrite consumers,"Despite being consumers, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria contribute to the accumulation of nitrite in marine oxygen minimum zones through interactions with other microbes, in particular denitrifiers, according to ecosystem and regional ocean modelling. 
 Nitrite is a key intermediate in both aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen-cycling pathways. Although it rarely accumulates in the ocean, nitrite reaches micromolar concentrations in anoxic zones for reasons that remain unclear. Microorganisms are responsible for the production and consumption of nitrite, and their interactions are fuelled by the dynamic supply of organic substrates to anoxic waters. Here we use a mechanistic ecosystem model to study the microbial community response to such variations in the supply of organic matter over time. Our results demonstrate that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, despite consuming nitrite, contribute to this accumulation through interactions with other microorganisms, mainly denitrifiers. Aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria capitalize on the nitrite produced by nitrate-reducing denitrifiers, outcompeting and suppressing nitrite-reducing denitrifiers. Oxygen limits nitrite-oxidizing bacteria before all the nitrite is consumed, leading to nitrite accumulation. In an eddy-resolving, three-dimensional model, this shift in microbial activity in time manifests as shifts in both time and space, closely matching observed depth profiles of nitrite, its fluxes and the abundance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. These results reveal a mechanism driving nitrite accumulation, which maintains the standing stock of bioavailable nitrogen in anoxic zones, demonstrating that microbial interactions within fine-scale ocean currents dictate the fate of nitrogen.

Here, the authors demonstrate a chip-based lithium niobate platform that delivers tunable mid-infrared light, opening new possibilities for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. 
 While cascaded second-order nonlinear processes have revolutionized shorter-wavelength light generation through up-conversion, their potential for longer-wavelength emission via parametric down-conversion remains fundamentally unexplored – constrained by narrow phase-matching bandwidths, insufficient parametric gain and stringent requirements on complex poling. Here, we break this paradigm through a reverse-polarization dual-layer lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide that achieves broadband phase matching and record 15.3% conversion efficiency for mid-infrared (MIR) generation. Pumped at 1.03 μm, the cascaded optical parametric generation and difference frequency generation processes produce dynamically tunable MIR emissions spanning 2.06–3.09 μm – a relative bandwidth of 40%. By strategically engineering dispersion characteristics, we further extend the versatility of this platform: pumping at telecommunications-compatible wavelengths (1.3–1.6 μm) generates discrete MIR lines at 3.59, 3.93, 4.31, and 4.6 μm, penetrating the crucial molecular fingerprint region. This work not only establishes cascaded down-conversion as a viable strategy for efficient long-wavelength generation but also provides a blueprint for designing reconfigurable nonlinear photonic systems, with transformative implications for spectroscopy, sensing, and wavelength-division multiplexing technologies.

 Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly – neat, or in a homopolymer/second BCP containing molecular blend – enables complex nanostructures including spherical micelles, co-continuous cubic gyroids and Frank-Kasper phases. Emergent properties in metallic and high entropy alloys inspire a paradigm shift: treating chemically distinct BCP micelles as functional building blocks to pave a path for multicomponent assemblies with molecularly engineered property profiles. Slowing current progress are challenges associated with the structural characterization of such BCP assemblies with poor atomic contrast. Here, we demonstrate how film surface self-assemblies of binary and ternary BCP micelle alloys can be phase inverted to generate porosity. This, combined with machine-learning assisted image segmentation, allows component classification via routine scanning electron microscopy. Results are supported by mechanistic insights from Voronoi analysis, cluster analysis and Monte Carlo/Brownian Dynamics simulations, revealing rich and controllable non-equilibrium surface structural behavior. Such multicomponent materials are expected to enable emergent properties for a range of applications.

 Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) remains one of the most critical challenges in drug development, causing patient safety concerns, clinical trial failures and drug withdrawals. We introduce ToxPredictor, a toxicogenomics framework combining RNA-seq data from primary human hepatocytes with pharmacokinetic data to predict dose-resolved DILI risks and safety margins. At its core is DILImap, an RNA-seq library tailored for DILI research, comprising 300 compounds at multiple concentrations. ToxPredictor achieves 88% sensitivity at 100% specificity in blind validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It flagged recent phase III clinical failures, including Evobrutinib, TAK-875, and BMS-986142, overlooked by animal studies. Beyond prediction, ToxPredictor provides mechanistic insights into hepatotoxic pathways, enabling early de-risking and actionable safety decisions. Unlike single-endpoint readouts—even from 3D models—transcriptomics offers a multi-dimensional system-level view of hepatocyte responses, capable of detecting diverse DILI mechanisms not captured by conventional assays. Scalable, actionable, and integrated into a broader AI/ML drug discovery platform, this work establishes toxicogenomics as a promising tool for developing safer therapeutics and addressing one of the most pressing challenges in toxicology.

Here, the authors report the development of emissive COFs from ACQ chromophores by an energy level matching strategy. 
 Most chromophores exhibit an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, resulting in minimal or weak emission when incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Consequently, the development of luminescent COFs, particularly those utilizing ACQ chromophores, presents both a compelling and formidable challenge. Herein, we report the construction of highly emissive ACQ chromophore-based COFs by an energy level matching strategy. This approach effectively modulates the electronic structures within the COFs, thereby suppressing intralayer charge transfer to ACQ chromophores, such as the imine linkage and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene unit, while simultaneously inhibiting interlayer charge transfer and non-radiative decay pathways. As a result, the undesired ACQ effect is mitigated, enabling the realization of highly emissive COFs. Notably, COF-BT-PhDBC demonstrates high brightness with a solid-state photoluminescence quantum yield of 14.7%, standing among the best ACQ chromophore-based COFs. Furthermore, COF-BT-PhDBC has been successfully utilized for in vivo three-photon fluorescence imaging of murine brain vasculature, achieving an impressive imaging depth of approximately 800 µm.

Here, the authors identify a role for DNAJA2 in regulating insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, loss of which causes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes phenotypes. 
 Dysregulation of heat shock protein DNAJA2 induces genomic instability and was consequently hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis. However, DNAJA2 knockout mice do not develop cancer but exhibit neonatal lethality and the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that DNAJA2 maintains homeostatic glucose metabolism by regulating insulin signaling. Mechanistically, DNAJA2 binds to the insulin receptor (IR) and prevents adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-mediated spontaneous IR endocytosis by inhibiting the IR-AP2 interaction. Thus, DNAJA2 defects lead to reduced IR localization on the plasma membrane and suppression of the insulin-stimulated signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting glycogen synthesis and storage in the liver during embryogenesis, further resulting in neonatal lethality of DNAJA2-deficient mice. Analysis of public datasets reveals a strong association between DNAJA2 and metabolic phenotypes, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, in both humans and mice. In conclusion, our study elucidates the mechanism by which DNAJA2 regulates IR endocytosis, insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, shedding light on the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.

Here, authors develop a scalable, potentially eco-friendly Li2S synthesis method that reduces its production costs, which could facilitate wider deployment of sulfide solid electrolytes. 
 We present a potentially eco-friendly, cost-efficient strategy for synthesizing high-purity Li2S, a key precursor for sulfide-based solid electrolytes. While these electrolytes surpass conventional organic counterparts in both safety and performance, their widespread application is hindered by the high cost of Li2S. Here, a solvent-free metathesis route is developed, in which thiourea serves as an S2⁻ donor to sulfurize LiOH, enabling scalable Li2S production (∼100 g per batch) with significantly reduced projected costs. During the process, intermediates (H2NCN, H2O) are transformed into benign gases (CO2, NH3) that spontaneously leave the system, thereby driving Li2S formation without ΔGmix limitations. The as-synthesized Li2S is successfully applied to prepare sulfide-based solid electrolytes such as Li10GeP2S12 and argyrodite-Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5, achieving laboratory-scale (1 kg) production costs reduction of up to 27.5% and 92.9%, respectively. Furthermore, all-solid-state batteries employing Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 demonstrate electrochemical performance comparable to those fabricate with commercial Li2S. This scalable methodology thus may provide a proming pathway to bridge low-cost Li2S synthesis with the practical deployment of sulfide-based solid electrolytes, which may accelerate the commercialization of high-performance all-solid-state batteries. Sulfide solid electrolytes show potential for safer, higher-performance batteries, but costly Li2S precursors hinder commercial adoption.

Here, the authors investigate ultrafast relaxation and structural evolution of morpholine with enhanced temporal resolution, following excitation via RDWs. 
 Optical sources exploiting resonant dispersive wave (RDW) emission are set to revolutionize ultrafast science. We demonstrate this approach by investigating excited state dynamics in morpholine using time-resolved photoelectron imaging. Excitation at 250 nm was achieved via RDW emission inside a helium-filled capillary fibre which, when combined with a short 800 nm probe, realized an instrument response of just 11 ± 2 fs. Two pathways initiate N–H bond fission: an extremely fast (<10 fs) process and a frustrated mechanism (380 fs) with hindered electronic ground state access. Photoelectron angular distributions also indicate average molecular geometry evolving on an intermediate (~100 fs) timescale. This clean distinction between population lifetimes and structural dynamics is enabled by the excellent temporal resolution inherent in RDW-based sources. Electronic structure and nonadiabatic surface hopping calculations support our data interpretation, and the synergy between experiment and theory is vital for developing a complete mechanistic picture.

 The evolution of seeds transformed life on earth and is responsible for our most important food crops. Gymnosperms, the oldest living seed plants, are an untapped genomic reservoir for genes involved in seed evolution. To tap this resource, we assemble deep transcriptomes of 14 gymnosperms, four angiosperms, and two ferns and identified 22,429 phylogenetically informative ortholog groups. We observe that genes differentially expressed in ovules or leaves provide the majority of phylogenomic support for the evolutionary splits between 1) seed and non-seed plants; 2) gymnosperms and angiosperms; and/or 3) within gymnosperms (conifers vs. “ancient” gymnosperms). Our gymnosperm data identifies unreported candidate ovule regulated genes in Arabidopsis. Moreover, prior knowledge from Arabidopsis helps uncover 4,076 candidate ovule genes that influence these evolutionary splits. We validate the expression of candidate ovule genes in gymnosperm-specific ovule structures. Our work provides a resource for seed gene discovery, conservation, and crop improvement.

 Arctic sea ice has undergone non-monotonic changes since the middle of the last century. Here, we investigate the cause of this behavior by isolating and quantifying the effects of anthropogenic aerosols, well-mixed greenhouse gases, and biomass burning on sea ice dynamics through climate model simulations. We find minimal changes in Arctic sea ice from 1956 to 1980, which largely reflect a balance between the warming effect of greenhouse gases and the cooling effect of aerosols. This balance, however, is disrupted in subsequent decades. Both sea ice area and volume exhibit marked declines between 1981 and 2005, owing primarily to intensified warming by greenhouse gases and a shift in aerosols’ role from mitigating to exacerbating sea ice loss. Our sea ice volume budget analysis demonstrates that sea ice changes since 1956 are mostly driven by thermodynamic processes: greenhouse gases significantly promote surface melting, whereas aerosols and biomass burning diminish surface melting by reducing surface shortwave radiation during boreal summer. From 1956–1980 to 1981–2005, the transitional effects of aerosols are associated with increased bottom ice melting and decreased bottom ice formation, which are primarily driven by changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation."

 California experiences hundreds of wildfires each year, posing increasing risks to ecosystems and communities. This study investigates how hydrometeorological drivers influence wildfire occurrence and severity across four ecological zones from 2000 to 2023, using satellite imagery and in situ data. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD), Pseudo–Tri-Dimensional CEEMD, and Time-Dependent Intrinsic Correlation (TDIC) were applied to decompose short- and long-term variability, and Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) curves were utilized to characterize event intensity and duration. Results show that wildfire severity has increased statewide even as occurrence rates diverged regionally. In the Sierra, the number of fires declined by approximately 25 %, yet the average daily burned area doubled, indicating fewer but more destructive events. In the North Coast, fire frequency decreased after 2010, but severity continued to rise, while the Central and South Coasts experienced more frequent ignitions that peaked around 2018. TDIC-based analysis revealed that wildfire occurrence decreases sharply with higher precipitation (≈ −0.7) and soil moisture (≈ −0.8), while hot and dry conditions strongly amplify fire activity, with temperature (≈ +0.8) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; ≈ +0.6) emerging as dominant drivers. Vegetation greenness, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), exerted contrasting effects: in the Sierra, dense summer biomass fueled larger fires once dried (+0.7), whereas in the South Coast, senescent grasses supported more ignitions (−0.8). IDF analysis further demonstrated that two- to five-day events often reached daily intensities exceeding 500,000 ha, while longer events accumulated greater total burned areas despite lower daily rates. These findings provide quantitative evidence that wildfire–climate interactions in California are region-specific and increasingly shaped by hotter, drier conditions, underscoring the need for adaptive fire management tailored to both short-term extremes and long-term fuel dynamics."

 Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and heavy rainfall can trigger landslide events hundreds or even thousands of times in a given area. Therefore, rapid and efficient intervention in affected regions is essential. Existing studies have demonstrated good detection performance using optical remote sensing images; however, optical data has significant limitations under cloud cover. Moreover, current multi-modal fusion methods struggle to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between different modes when processing data with large informational disparities. To address these issues, we developed the China Luding multi-modal landslide dataset, which includes optical and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. We also propose a multi-modal network for landslide detection based on multi-label classification, called multi-modal cross Swin Transformer network (MCSTNet). Additionally, a new weighted asymmetric loss function (WASL) is proposed to improve multi-label classification tasks. Our proposed network consists of two stages: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the first stage, two independent branches extract high-level semantic features from optical and PolSAR images. In the second stage, a multi-modal cross multi-head self-attention (MCMSA) mechanism fuses the high-level semantic features from the multi-modal information. Therefore, the model enhances the learning and feature representation capabilities through parallel processing the input data information in different representation subspaces. Compared to other recent landslide detection methods, our results indicate that the proposed method is more effective, achieving an F1 score of 88.24% for landslide detection, with greater accuracy in identifying landslide-prone areas. Therefore, our model can provide reliable and effective decision support for disaster emergency responses."

 Rapid expansion of China’s aquaculture ponds (APs) has significantly contributed to food security and economic development, yet simultaneously triggering ecological degradation. However, the absence of high-resolution national datasets has constrained systematic analyses of APs’ spatiotemporal dynamics and their transboundary environmental footprints. To fill this gap, we developed a robust approach for accurately monitoring APs across China and elucidating the spatiotemporal dynamics and underlying mechanisms driving their changes. The Optical-SAR Aquaculture Pond Mapper (OS-APM) was developed, a novel framework integrating spatiotemporal-spectral signatures to synergistically leverage multi-sensor time series for precision AP mapping. The OS-APM comprised a hierarchical segmentation strategy for large-scale AP delineation, multi-modal feature fusion to distinguish spectrally ambiguous classes, and an ensemble classifier integrating optical, SAR, geometric, and topographic features. The framework achieved individual-pond-scale extraction accuracy (OA > 90 %) and generated China’s first 10-m resolution annual AP dataset (China_AP), derived from 119,882 Sentinel-1 and 579,436 Sentinel-2 scenes (2016–2023). This dataset revealed previously undocumented spatiotemporal patterns, indicating a 2023 AP inventory of 19,919.52 km2, with inland systems (55.56 %) now surpassing coastal ones (44.44 %) to dominate China’s aquaculture landscape. Spatially, four provinces (Jiangsu, Hubei, Shandong, Guangdong) collectively host 56 % of national APs, with 58 % clustered in the Yangtze-Huaihe River corridors. Temporally, the AP area exhibited an inverted-U trajectory, increasing from 20,685.20 km2 (2016) to a peak of 23,256.84 km2 (2019), then contracting below initial levels to 19,919.52 km2 by 2023. This reversal strongly correlates with China’s ecological civilization initiatives, notably the 2017 Aquaculture Water and Tidal Flat Plan. This study establishes multi-sensor data for national AP monitoring, quantifies inland AP expansion patterns under policy regulation, and delivers a scientific foundation for reconciling aquaculture intensification with wetland conservation."

 Arctic lake color and quality are changing in response to the warming climate, permafrost degradation, and intensifying disturbances. These changes have important implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat, and water resources planning. However, the drivers, spatial distribution, and long-term trajectories of these changes remain poorly characterized on regional scales (∼100 km). In this study, we examined over 3,000 lakes in part of the Mackenzie Delta, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, and adjacent upland tundra in the Northwest Territories, Canada, to quantify both gradual and abrupt changes in lake color using harmonized Landsat time series from 1985 to 2022. Across the region, we found average declines of surface reflectance in the red and green bands by 13 % and 15 % over the last four decades, respectively. In comparison, the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) trends differed between sub-regions, with a decadal increase in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands and a decrease in the Mackenzie Delta. We identified a positive, lagged correlation between abrupt lake color change and mean summer air temperature (MSAT), particularly in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (R = 0.7, lag = 2 years), indicating a delayed impact of warm summers on lake color. One important mechanism of such impact was lakeshore thaw slumping intensified by rising summer temperatures, with slump-affected lakes experiencing abrupt increases in surface reflectance and NDTI driven by sediment input. We identified fire as another important driver of lake color dynamics, which led to greater changes in lake surface reflectance (p < 0.01) and NDTI (p = 0.1) compared to surrounding lakes. These findings demonstrate the value of harmonized Landsat time series for characterizing multifaceted Arctic lake color dynamics, along with their drivers and impacts."

Walkability was evaluated using a walk score that derived from geographic information systems (GIS) data and PM2.5 exposure levels were estimated by applying land use regression (LUR) models. Our primary outcome was osteoporosis, which was ascertained through diagnostic records from the Yinzhou Health Information System (YHIS). We employed Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the associations of walkability and PM2.5 with risk of developing osteoporosis. Furthermore, we investigated whether there were additive or multiplicative interactions between walkability and PM2.5. After a 111,464 person-years of follow-up period, we identified 3739 incident osteoporosis cases.

Moreover, a significant additive scale interaction between PM2.5 and walkability were identified. In conclusion, walkability was protectively associated with osteoporosis.

Green,How COVID-19 related policies reshaped organic aerosol source contributions in Central London,"This study quantified the impact of the COVID lockdown and the Eat Out To Help Out (EOTHO) on the sources/compositions of aerosols. The lockdown significantly reduced the primary emission sources. This study confirmed the important presence of cooking emissions from commercial kitchens in Central London by detecting the enhancement caused by the EOTHO policy after the lockdown. Biomass burning organic aerosol co-emitted with cooking activities from either the fuels or food ingredients used. 
 Organic aerosol (OA), a major component of submicron particulate matter (PM1), has significant impacts on both human health and climate. Quantifying its sources is therefore crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) applied to aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) mass spectral data offers a robust approach for quantifying OA sources. A year-long study of ACSM data from London's Marylebone Road monitoring station during the COVID-19 pandemic provides insights into the impact of lockdown and the Eat Out To Help Out (EOTHO) scheme, which offered support to the hospitality industry during the pandemic, on PM composition and OA sources. Five OA sources were identified including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, traffic-related, 11 % to OA), cooking OA (COA, 20 %), biomass burning OA (BBOA, 12 %), more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA, 38 %), and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA, 21 %). Lockdown significantly reduced HOA (−52 %), COA (−67 %), and BBOA (−42 %) compared to their pre-COVID levels, while EOTHO doubled COA (+100 %) compared to the post-lockdown period. However, MO-OOA and LO-OOA were less affected, as these primarily originated from long-range transport. This research has demonstrated the importance of commercial cooking as a significant source of OA (20 %) and PM1 (9 %) in urban areas. The co-emission of BBOA with COA observed in Central London showed a similar diurnal cycle and response to the EOTHO policy, indicating that cooking activities might be currently underestimated and contribute to urban BBOA. Therefore, more effort is required to quantify this source and develop targeted abatement policies to mitigate emissions as currently limited regulation is in force."

Researchers collected data from 40 beech and spruce forest sites in spring and summer 2023, using a standardized method to ensure consistency. The results show that water sources for trees change between seasons and vary by tree species. This large dataset offers valuable information for understanding plant water use, improving ecohydrological models, and mapping water cycles across Europe. 
 The stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) are useful for studying ecohydrological dynamics in forests. However, most isotope-based eco-hydrological studies are limited to single sites, resulting in a lack of large-scale isotope data for understanding tree water uptake. Here, we provide a first systematic isotope dataset for soil and stem xylem water collected during two pan-European sampling campaigns at 40 beech (Fagus sylvatica), spruce (Picea abies), or mixed beech-spruce forest sites in spring and summer 2023 (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.542, Lehmann et al., 2024). The dataset is complemented by additional site-, soil-, and tree-specific metadata. The samples and metadata were collected by different researchers across Europe following a standardized protocol. Soil samples were taken at up to 5 depths (ranging from 0 to 90 cm) and stem xylem samples from the trunks of three beech and/or spruce trees per site. All samples were sent to a single laboratory, where all analytical work was conducted. Water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation and analyzed with an isotope laser spectrometer. Additionally, a subset of the samples was analyzed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Data quality checks revealed a high mean total extraction efficiency, mean water amount (>1 mL), accuracy, and precision. The isotopic signature of soil and stem xylem water varied as a function of the geographic origin and changed from spring to summer across all sites. While δ2H and δ18O were strongly correlated, the soil water data plotted closer to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) than the stem xylem water.  Specifically, the δ2H values of the xylem water were more enriched than those of the soil water, leading to a systematic deviation from the GMWL. Isotopic enrichment of the stem xylem water at mixed forest sites was larger for spruce trees than for beech trees. This dataset is particularly useful for large-scale studies on plant water use, ecohydrological model testing, and isotope mapping across Europe."

The southern Adriatic, an important area for air-sea CO2 exchange, is still poorly characterized. Using high-resolution oceanographic measurements, local physical and biogeochemical changes were investigated, providing a dataset to improve future understanding of the role of the southern Adriatic as a carbon source or sink. 
 The rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere leads to an increase in CO2 uptake in the ocean and to significant changes in seawater chemistry. These changes, in turn, exert profound effects on marine ecosystems across multiple trophic levels. The Mediterranean Sea is considered a hotspot for climate change. Despite such relevance, observations and studies on its carbonate system remain limited, especially in regions that play a crucial role in regulating air-sea CO2 exchange like intermediate and dense water formation areas. The southern Adriatic Sea, a key site for dense water formation in the eastern Mediterranean, hosts the EMSO ERIC and ICOS ERIC South Adriatic observatory (EMSO-E2M3A), operated by the Italian National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics (OGS). This facility allows the study of physical and biogeochemical dynamics in the deepest area of the Adriatic Sea. The suite of sensors deployed on the surface buoy allows for the characterization of water mass properties, biogeochemical cycles, dense water formation process, and ocean acidification, particularly in relation to carbon sequestration dynamics. Here, time series of meteorological data (e.g., wind speed, wind direction), sea surface physical parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity), dissolved oxygen and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2sw) and pH from 2014 to 2024 will be presented (https://doi.org/10.13120/y2hw-1j63, Cardin et al., 2025). In particular, quality check and correction and post-processing methods applied to the data will be discussed. The validated surface dataset provides a consistent pCO2sw time series for the Adriatic Sea, with values and seasonal variability in agreement with previous observations across the Mediterranean. Associated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and wind measurements reproduce expected regional patterns, confirming the robustness and suitability of the presented dataset for further biogeochemical and climate-related analyses."

We also pinpoint specific areas where the model still struggles, providing valuable directions for future model development. This progress means scientists can now use this tool more confidently to understand how Arctic ocean layers work and change. 
 Advancing high-resolution Arctic ocean–sea ice modeling is critical for understanding polar amplification and improving climate projections but faces challenges from computational limits and cross-scale interactions. The simulation capabilities of the ocean–sea ice coupled model (E3SMv2-MPAS) from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) 2.1 for the Arctic ocean–sea ice system are systematically evaluated using multi-source observational data. The model employs a latitudinally varying mesh, with resolution increasing from 60 km in the Southern Hemisphere to 10 km in the Arctic. This design balances computational efficiency with the accurate integration of low-latitude oceanic influences, while the unstructured mesh also enhances the geometric representation of Arctic straits. Together, these features form a simulation framework capable of resolving processes from seasonal to decadal timescales. Numerical results demonstrate E3SMv2-MPAS's superior Arctic simulation performance: (1) accurate reproduction of spatial heterogeneity in sea ice concentration, thickness, and sea surface temperature, including their 1995–2020 trend patterns; (2) faithful reproduction of both the freshwater content and transports through key Arctic gateways; (3) successful reconstruction of three-dimensional thermohaline structures within the Atlantic Water layer, capturing Atlantic Water's decadal warming trends and accelerated Atlantification processes – specifically mid-layer shoaling, heat content amplification, and reduced heat transfer lag times in the Eurasian Basin. Persistent systematic biases are identified: 0.5–1 m sea ice thickness overestimation in the Canadian Basin; Coordinated sea surface temperature/salinity underestimation and sea ice concentration overestimation in the Greenland and Barents Seas; Atlantic Water core temperature overestimation; Regional asymmetries in decadal thermohaline field evolution."

 CIBUSmod 25.09 is an open-source, spatially disaggregated biophysical model designed to evaluate resource use and environmental impacts in agri-food systems on national and sub-national level under future scenarios involving changes in demand and agricultural production systems. It provides a flexible, modular framework that can integrate regionalised data on crop and livestock production systems at the spatial resolution and aggregation level available. In the model agricultural production is distributed regionally to meet an exogenous demand, while enforcing several constraints that ensure internally consistent scenarios that are biophysically and agronomically feasible. Using Sweden as a case study, the model's application is demonstrated by constructing and validating a baseline and conducting a scenario analysis. The results highlight CIBUSmod's ability to quantify trade-offs in land use, nutrient flows, and greenhouse gas emissions across different transition pathways. The model is designed to be accessible, utilising Python and Jupyter Notebooks with Excel-based input data management. It is publicly available under the GNU GPLv3 licence.

We introduce a novel method using coda wave interferometry (CWI) to monitor creep in 2‐D with high resolution. By calculating changes in ambient seismic noise travel times, we relate these measurements to creep offsets, bridging the gap between existing methods. Applied to seismic data from 2021 around the Hayward Fault, our CWI‐derived offsets aligned with creepmeter measurements, revealing continuous and episodic creep. A 2‐D regionalization identified a spatial boundary between these regimes, corroborating previous findings.

Emerging research focuses on characterizing multiscale bedform configurations, but their stability remains unknown. Here, we analyzed twelve flume experiments of varying sizes to uncover a sharp transition between two independent multiscale bedform configurations. Bedform groups—quasi‐stable collections of bedforms—that have similar heights and celerities as constituent bedforms are found in flows with suspension number (ratio of shear velocity to sediment settling velocity; u∗/ws ${u}^{\ast }/{w}_{s}$) less than 1. In contrast, large dunes with smaller, faster‐moving superimposed bedforms characterize flows with u∗/ws ${u}^{\ast }/{w}_{s}$ > 1. The transition between these two states abruptly occurs at u∗/ws=1.1±0.12 ${u}^{\ast }/{w}_{s}=1.1\mathit{\pm }0.12$ in low Froude‐number flows, and is further supported by distinct autogenic noise characteristics in bed evolution.

A subsequent observation of the same district by Cassini RADAR in altimetry mode during T126 intersected the bistatic track over one of these lakes, revealing uniform backscattering across several basins. Lakes observed in bistatic configuration exhibit similar characteristics to those observed in altimetry mode, suggesting that all the liquid bodies present at Titan's lake district may have similar composition and roughness."

This study highlights an additional role of land‐atmosphere interactions in modulating North American atmospheric circulation during ENSO‐post early summer. Using reanalysis data and numerical simulations, we identify an ocean‐land‐atmosphere relay mechanism. El Niño‐induced persistent upstream sea surface temperature anomalies enhance moisture transport into North America, which triggers a dipole pattern of land temperature anomalies—cooling in the midlatitudes and warming at higher latitudes—through surface turbulent latent heat flux and shortwave radiation. These land surface anomalies feedback on the atmosphere via modifications in sensible heat flux and longwave radiation, weakening low‐level meridional air temperature gradient and atmospheric baroclinicity. The resulting negative transient eddy vorticity forcing induces an equivalent barotropic geopotential high anomaly and weakens the westerly jet around 50°N. These findings underscore the essential role of land‐atmosphere coupling in extending ENSO's summer influence."

This enhancement stems from a mismatch in time scales between vortex evacuation and condensation. Inertial droplets are centrifuged out of vortical regions much faster than condensation can occur. They then grow by condensation, releasing latent heat locally. Our simulations reveal that vortical regions co‐locate with cooler temperatures and higher moisture, leading to sharp density gradients at their boundaries. These gradients drive baroclinic torque, generating small‐scale turbulence. The time scales involved align with our scaling estimates. While our earlier two‐dimensional model anticipated this effect, it underestimated its intensity and limited it to sub‐Kolmogorov scales. The enhancement of turbulence over inertial scales that we find here could drive rapid raindrop growth."

Notably, the derived interior EKE within the eddy boundary (EKElo) shows an increase, that is, an order of magnitude greater in the Lagrangian framework compared to the Eulerian one.

Two factors drive this frequency increase. First, a shift toward the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño pattern—characterized by higher frequencies and greater amplitudes relative to the Central Pacific (CP) pattern. Second, an overall increase in the frequency of both EP and CP variability. These changes scale with the intensity of anthropogenic forcing.

 Organ shortage remains a major challenge in transplantation, and gene-edited pig organs offer a promising solution1–3. Despite gene-editing, the immune reactions following xenotransplantation can still cause transplant failure4. To understand the immunological response of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation, we conducted large-scale multi-omics profiling of the xenograft and the host’s blood over a 61-day procedure in a brain-dead human (decedent) recipient. Blood plasmablasts, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells increased between postoperative day (POD)10 and 28, concordant with expansion of IgG/IgA B-cell clonotypes, and subsequent biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) at POD33. Human T-cell frequencies increased from POD21 and peaked between POD33-49 in the blood and xenograft, coinciding with T-cell receptor diversification, expansion of a restricted TRBV2/J1 clonotype and histological evidence of a combined AbMR and cell-mediated rejection at POD49. At POD33, the most abundant human immune population in the graft was CXCL9+ macrophages, aligning with IFN-γ-driven inflammation and a Type I immune response. In addition, we see evidence of interactions between activated pig-resident macrophages and infiltrating human immune cells. Xenograft tissue showed pro-fibrotic tubular and interstitial injury, marked by S100A65, SPP16 (Osteopontin), and COLEC117, at POD21–POD33. Proteomics profiling revealed human and pig complement activation, with decreased human component after AbMR therapy with complement inhibition. Collectively, these data delineate the molecular orchestration of human immune responses to a porcine kidney, revealing potential immunomodulatory targets for improving xenograft survival."

 Xenotransplantation of genetically-modified pig kidneys offers a solution to the scarcity of organs for end-stage renal disease patients.1 We performed a 61-day alpha-Gal knock-out pig kidney and thymic autograft transplant into a nephrectomized brain-dead human using clinically approved immunosuppression, without CD40 blockade or additional genetic modification. Hemodynamic and electrolyte stability and dialysis independence were achieved. Post-operative day (POD) 10 biopsies revealed glomerular IgM and IgA deposition, activation of early complement components and mesangiolysis with stable renal function without proteinuria, a phenotype not seen in allotransplantation. On POD 33, an abrupt increase in serum creatinine was associated with antibody-mediated rejection and increased donor-specific IgG. Plasma exchange, C3/C3b inhibition and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG), completely reversed xenograft rejection. Pre-existing donor-reactive T cell clones expanded progressively in the circulation post-transplant, acquired an effector transcriptional profile and were detected in the POD 33 rejecting xenograft prior to rATG treatment. This study provides the first long-term physiologic, immunologic, and infectious disease monitoring of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant and indicates that pre-existing xenoreactive T cells and induced antibodies to unknown epitope(s) present a major challenge, despite significant immunosuppression. It also demonstrates that a minimally gene-edited pig kidney can support long-term life-sustaining physiologic functions in a human."

 Seismic gaps are fault sections that have not hosted a large earthquake for a long time compared to neighbouring segments, making them likely sites for future large events. The 2025 Mw 7.7 Mandalay (Myanmar) earthquake, on the central section of the Sagaing Fault, ruptured through a known seismic gap and ~160 km beyond it, resulting in an exceptionally long rupture of ~460 km. Here we investigate the rupture process of this event and the factors that enabled it to breach the seismic gap by integrating satellite synthetic aperture radar observations, seismic waveform back-projection, Bayesian finite-fault inversion and dynamic rupture simulations. We identify a two-stage earthquake rupture comprising initial bilateral subshear propagation for ~20 s followed by unilateral supershear rupture for ~70 s. Simulation-based sensitivity tests suggest that the seismic gap boundary was not a strong mechanical barrier in terms of frictional strength, and that nucleation of the earthquake far from the gap boundary, rather than its supershear speed, allowed the rupture to outgrow the gap and propagate far beyond it. Hence, we conclude that the dimension of seismic gaps may not reflect the magnitude of future earthquakes. Instead, ruptures may cascade through multiple fault sections to generate larger and potentially more damaging events.

 Mangroves are recognized globally as important blue carbon ecosystems for mitigating climate change due to their remarkable carbon sequestration potential. However, methane emissions from these ecosystems can partially offset their net carbon burial capacity. Although methane oxidation within soils can minimize these emissions, the contribution of methane released directly through mangrove tree stems remains underexplored. Emerging evidence indicates that wetland trees may serve as conduits for soil-derived methane, potentially constituting a poorly quantified component of mangrove carbon cycling. Here we present a global quantification of methane emissions mediated by trees, leveraging field measurements, global datasets and machine learning-driven upscaling. Our analysis reveals that annual stem methane emissions total approximately 730.60 (95% CI: 586.09–876.93) gigagrams per year, offsetting sediment carbon burial by ~16.9%. When combined with soil methane emissions, stem fluxes increase the total methane budget, offsetting approximately 27.5% of blue carbon sequestration. Stem methane emissions were closely related to wood density, soil organic carbon content, salinity and soil methane flux, indicating that emissions originate primarily from mangrove sediments, with higher emissions correlated to lower wood density, lower salinity and greater wood water content. Our findings underscore the need to incorporate stem-mediated fluxes into blue carbon budgets and climate mitigation strategies.

The authors present a machine learning algorithm and web-app to rapidly predict carbapenemase-production in Enterobacterales. 
 Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) are considered among the highest threats to global health by WHO. Their detection is difficult and time-consuming. We developed a random-forest machine learning (ML) model, CarbaDetector, to predict carbapenemase production from inhibition zone diameters of eight antibiotics, using 385 isolates for training with whole genome sequencing as reference. Validation on two external datasets (A = 282, B = 518 isolates) shows high performance: sensitivity/specificity are 96.6%/84.4% (training), 96.3%/86.1% (A), and 91.2%/87.0% (B, five antibiotics). In contrast, the algorithms of EUCAST and the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM) exhibit lower specificity (8.2% and 40.1%, respectively on the training dataset). In this work, we show that CarbaDetector, available as a web-app, reduces unnecessary confirmatory testing and accelerates the time to result. This approach offers high sensitivity and improved specificity compared to standard algorithms and has the potential to improve CPE detection, especially in resource-limited settings.

Here, the authors develop a direct electrochemical growth technique for preparing ordered magnetic networks without the use of templates. 
 Ordered nanostructured magnetic networks offer a versatile platform for studying magnetic frustration, reconfigurable magnonics, and neuromorphic computing. Their fabrication, however, often relies on complicated and expensive nanolithography. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical strategy for growing large-area magnetic networks composed of self-organized triangular motifs separated by periodic parallel ridges. The ridges arise deterministically from voltage-controlled electrodeposition, while the regions between them undergo self-organization: cobalt nucleates, bifurcates, and assembles into either solid or hollow triangular units depending on the growth conditions. The global network morphology is dictated by the waveform of the applied voltage. These triangular structures host diverse magnetic states, including vortex-like and macro-spin-like configurations, and exhibit nonlinear responses to external magnetic fields. Our approach combines macroscopically controlled, deterministic growth and microscopic self-organization, providing a scalable pathway for fabricating complex nanostructures. The resulting magnetic networks show potential as physical reservoirs for neuromorphic computing.

 Janus fiber membranes enable directional liquid transport (DLT) for oil-water separation and moisture management, yet conventional pore-channel designs offer limited efficiency. Herein, we have developed a groundbreaking Janus nanofiber structure inspired by the structural characteristics of plant leaves, specifically the pore gradient and liquid transport channels within leaves. An innovative intermediate buffer layer composed of a three-dimensional helical nanofiber membrane was introduced to boost porosity and horizontal interconnectivity. A dopamine-controlled regulation mechanism synergistically optimized the pore structure and wettability of this layer. The resulting Janus membrane exhibits a remarkable unidirectional transport index (1250%), a high oil-water separation efficiency (98.92%), and an ultra-high flux (13860.77 L·m⁻²·h⁻¹).

Here, the authors discover that a preserved, DLD-mediated metabolic suppression by TGFβ undermines anti-TGFβ therapy, promoting gastric cancer growth. 
 Despite the well-known role of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway in cancer progression, therapies targeting it have largely failed in the clinic. This suggests our understanding of TGFβ’s function is incomplete. Here we show that this therapeutic failure is rooted in a fundamental paradox: while TGFβ promotes malignant traits in gastric cancer, many cancer cells remain sensitive to its potent tumor-suppressive effects. We uncover that this suppression works by impairing the cell’s energy metabolism through modulating dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD). Therefore, broadly blocking the TGFβ pathway can inadvertently release a natural brake on tumor growth. Based on this insight, we demonstrate that co-targeting this metabolic vulnerability with an inhibitor (devimistat) alongside an anti-TGFβ agent significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy in gastric cancer models. This combination approach presents a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of current therapies. The role of TGFβ in cancer is paradoxical and context-dependent.

 Graphene has received much attention due to its monoatomic, unique two-dimensional structure, which results in remarkable mechanical, physical, and electrical properties. However, synthesizing high-quality graphene-based composites with high conductivity and ionic mobility remains challenging. Here, we report an allotrope to the nanocarbon family, Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene, synthesized by inserting π-π-conjugated p-phenyls between graphene layers and connecting them via C–C σ bonds. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene is thermally and dynamically stable, as verified by density functional theory and molecular dynamics, and can be produced at kilogram scale. The p-phenyl bridges swell the layer spacing from ~0.34 to ~0.56 nm, reducing van der Waals forces and enhancing electron delocalization. Electrons in these separated graphene layers benefit from low mass and efficient 3D screening of charge scattering, resulting in high Hall mobility (10,000–13,000 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) in freestanding films. The expanded spacing also enables decoupling of layer electrons and rapid ion storage and transport—even for large ions. For example, potassium-ion batteries using Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene exhibit high reversible capacity, long-term stability, and high charge-discharge rates. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene holds promise for large-scale, portable, high-performance electronics with energy storage capabilities.

 Most climate change forecasts assume that longer growing seasons increase carbon storage through increased tree growth, but recent findings have challenged this assumption.

Current hypotheses for why longer growing seasons may not always increase tree growth include drought-related effects and internal constraints. These hypotheses, however, are generally tested in different ways by different fields on different species, and rarely consider how external drivers and internal constraints interact. We outline how bridging these divides while integrating evolutionary history and ecological theory could help build a unified model across species for when longer seasons will—or will not—lead to greater tree growth, with major forecasting implications.

Here the authors assess changes in subsurface soil moisture, finding that these droughts also become more persistent and intense than surface droughts. 
 Anthropogenic climate change has exacerbated soil moisture droughts globally, yet this exacerbation in their spatiotemporal evolution in terms of soil vertical structure remains unclear. Here we propose a Lagrangian four-dimensional tracking framework to identify a type of spatial (horizontal and vertical)–temporal contiguous drought events, that is, deep droughts characterized by bottom-heavy deep-dominated shapes, with more extensive moisture deficits in deep than surface soils. These deep droughts, accounting for a quarter of total events, are ignored in surface-based soil moisture monitoring. Both reanalyses and climate models show significantly increasing duration and intensity of the deep droughts over the past four decades, attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Relative to the past, future deep droughts are projected to become longer-lasting and more intense globally, with larger increases in deeper soil layers under higher-emission scenarios. These deep droughts hidden below the surface pose challenges for satellite-based agricultural drought monitoring and cause an underestimation of adverse impacts of droughts on ecosystems.

 Biodiversity hotspots often coincide with regions along subduction zones where tectonic activity continuously make and break geographic connections promoting biological diversification and speciation. A puzzling biodiversity hotspot is the northern Caribbean islands that contain endemic terrestrial and freshwater biotas mainly evolved from South American colonizers that dispersed during the Cenozoic. However, tectonic reconstructions have always assumed a mostly inactive and coherent eastern Caribbean plate, such that migration routes must either have been overwater, or through an inner-plate land bridge. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that the northeastern Caribbean region underwent tectonically induced uplift, subsidence and large-scale block rotations questioning the assumed plate coherency. Here we present a plate reconstruction including these novel constraints and reveals how tectonic and volcanic activity along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone have established a transient land corridor connecting South America and the Greater Antilles from ~45 to 25 Ma ago offering a new avenue to explain Caribbean biotic interchanges and diversification.

 Long-term time series of coastal bathymetric data are indispensable for analysing morphological resilience to climate change. Despite the increasing popularity of utilizing high-resolution digital elevation models for coastal management, potential errors in analysing the long-term trend of bed elevation change from historical datasets have attracted little attention. Here, we demonstrate that inconsistency in the spatial resolution of small-scale topographic features characterized by sharp bathymetric gradients could produce errors in the mean elevation that in individual years could exceed the sea level change rate and result in a statistically significant bias in the trend of the mean elevation. Neglecting this inconsistency may lead to a misconception of coastal resilience to sea level rise. We provide an analytical method to identify such inconsistency in bathymetric datasets and a homogenization method to minimise the errors. Our methods are broadly applicable for analysing time series of geospatial data and quantitative assessment of data consistency.

 Reduced and polymerized phosphorus species may have been crucial for the origin and early evolution of life, as they are more reactive and soluble than phosphate. Thermal processes could have produced these phosphorus species; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly constrained, and geological evidence of polymerized species in the Precambrian is so far absent. Here, we investigated contact-metamorphic rocks from the ca. 3.22 Ga Moodies Group (South Africa), where mafic dikes intruded into shallow-marine sediments. We provide evidence of magmatic phosphite (up to 2.85 ppm) and metamorphic polyphosphate (up to 39.3 ppm). Additional laboratory experiments suggest that carbon can facilitate the thermal production of polyphosphates and reduced phosphorus species, including phosphide, from less reactive minerals such as apatite and vivianite. We conclude that magmatic and thermal-metamorphic rocks could have provided soluble and reactive phosphorus species crucial for the origin and early evolution of life.

10.1016/j.rse.2025.115134,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,该论文主要关注利用遥感技术（特别是InSAR）对美国范围内的地面沉降进行制图和特征分析。研究重点在于地面沉降的识别、范围界定以及对人口、建筑物和基础设施的影响评估。虽然使用了卫星数据（Sentinel-1），但其核心在于地表形变的监测与分析，而非大气环境要素的探测，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、大气成分分析等）关联不大。,[],Zhiqiang Xiong;Guangcai Feng;Zefa Yang;Hua Gao;Wenbin Xu;Lei Zhang;Xiaohua Xu;Zhong Lu;Jun Hu;Zhiwei Li;Jianjun Zhu,Nationwide mapping and characterization of land subsidence in the United States using InSAR,"•We develop a strategy for mapping and identifying land subsidence on a nationwide scale. •This represents the first comprehensive, high-resolution subsidence map of the CONUS. •Approximately 73 % of subsidence occurs in cultivated lands and 10 % in wetlands. •We quantify the exposure of populations, buildings, and critical infrastructure to subsidence. 
 Land subsidence (LS) threatens public safety and sustainable socioeconomic development across the United States (US). Wide-area LS mapping plays a crucial role in improving the characterization of LS, thus contributing to a better understanding of its impacts beyond national borders. However, a nationwide LS map for the US is still lacking, and mapping LS at this scale faces challenges such as atmospheric artifacts, computational limitations, and data calibration issues. We develop a strategy for mapping and identifying LS on a nationwide scale. This strategy includes average deformation calculation, mosaicking of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results, and LS areas extraction using deep learning. Using this strategy and extensive SAR data, we present the first high-resolution, nationwide LS map for the contiguous U. S. (CONUS), derived from 23,391 ascending Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2021. Our analysis reveals that LS affects all 48 states and the District of Columbia, covering ∼45,666 km2. Approximately 73 % of LS occurs in cultivated lands, 10 % in wetlands, with groundwater overexploitation being the predominant driver of subsidence. These subsiding areas expose 6.26 million people, 160,071 buildings, and critical infrastructure, including thousands of kilometers of railways and roads. Although some measures have been implemented to mitigate LS, existing cases suggest that long-term groundwater management is essential, and significant challenges remain in addressing severe LS. This national-scale assessment provides critical data for targeted management and informs future monitoring and mitigation strategies."
10.1016/j.rse.2025.115135,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,该论文主要关注地表辐射平衡（SRB）的估算，利用MODIS卫星数据开发了一种新的深度学习模型，旨在提高SRB各分量的估算精度和能量守恒性。虽然使用了卫星观测数据，但其核心应用领域是气候、生态和水文研究，而非直接针对大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['Surface Radiation Budget', 'MODIS', 'Climate', 'Ecology', 'Hydrology']",Jianglei Xu;Shunlin Liang;Han Ma;Yongzhe Chen;Wenyuan Li;Yichuan Ma;Xiang Zhao;Bo Jiang;Xiaotong Zhang;Shikang Guan,Joint estimation of global daily 1 km surface radiation budget components from MODIS observations (2000−2023) using conservation-constrained deep neural networks,"•We developed MTL-DenseNet models to jointly estimate all SRB components. •A new set of MTL-SRB component products at 1 km resolution from 2000 to 2023. •The new SRB component product shows high accuracy and great conservation. •MODIS reflectance and thermal radiance are complementary for jointly estimating the SRB components. 
 Accurate characterization of the surface radiation budget (SRB) is essential for understanding the Earth's climate. Satellite-based SRB products are typically generated through estimating different components separately using various algorithms, thereby resulting in varying uncertainties and poor conservation. This study developed the SRB conservation constraint multi-task learning densely connected convolutional neural network models to jointly estimate global daily SRB at 1 km spatial resolution from MODIS observations spanning 2000–2023. These observations include reflectance from bands 1–5, 7, and 19; thermal radiance from bands 28–29 and 31–34; and ancillary information such as elevation, solar-viewing geometry, and GLASS-MODIS surface longwave radiation. Validation results against 224 sites over three years showed that the RMSEs of daily estimates for downward, upward, and net shortwave radiation were 29.38, 20.73, and 23.14 Wm−2, respectively; for downward, upward, and net longwave radiation, they were 19.98, 15.69, and 14.70 Wm−2; and for net radiation, it was 24.28 Wm−2. This method improves the underestimations of downward and net shortwave radiation in the MCD18A1, GLASS-MODIS, and BESS products; the accuracy of retrievals for downward and net longwave radiation is better than those from GLASS-MODIS and CERES-SYN. The estimates also reduce the non-conservation by 26.69 % compared to GLASS-MODIS. These improvements lie in the method's ability to enhance retrieval accuracy by utilizing cross-domain features from all components and to address non-conservation issues in SRB retrievals through the constraint of SRB conservation in the training. The SRB estimates exhibit great spatiotemporal consistency with other SRB products, except for regional reflected solar radiation and net radiation. The high accuracy and great conservation facilitate understanding of the coordinated variation of the SRB components, and these new SRB products would benefit a variety of fields, such as climate, ecology, and hydrology.

 While particulate matter (PM) exposure and aging are known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), large-scale studies focusing on older adults remain limited. This population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the long-term impact of PM2.5 exposure on CVD risk using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database on a total of 1,708,942 individuals aged 65 years and older without a history of CVD. The subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for the association between PM2.5 exposure and CVD risk were estimated using the Fine–Gray model, treating overall death as a competing risk, with adjustment for demographic, clinical, lifestyle, co-pollutants, and meteorological variables. A significant association was observed between higher concentrations of PM2.5 and an increased risk of CVD (P for trend <0.001). Individuals residing in areas with the highest concentrations of PM2.5 (Q4) had a higher risk of CVD (sHR, 1.06; 95 % CI, 1.05–1.08) compared to those living in areas with the lowest concentrations (Q1). These findings suggest that high concentrations of PM2.5 exposure may contribute to an increased risk of CVD in older adults. Stronger regulations and proactive efforts to reduce air pollution exposure may be promising against the risk of CVD in the older population."

 Fog water deposition remains a poorly quantified yet important pathway for atmospheric inputs in forested mountain regions. We conducted multi-site observations at seven mountainous locations in Japan, collecting bulk deposition, throughfall, and fog water. Using an improved canopy water balance method, we estimated fog water precipitation on canopies and its associated acid deposition. Fog water precipitation in forests varied substantially across sites, with the highest value at Mt. Oyama (9.25 mm day−1) and the lowest at Mt. Iizuna (0.86 mm day−1). Sites along the Sea of Japan coast showed higher proportions of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO₄2−), largely due to continental air masses, whereas Pacific-side sites were more influenced by nitrate from domestic vehicle emissions. Backward trajectory analysis and meteorological observations revealed that fog water deposition is significantly influenced by fog occurrence frequency, wind speed, and characteristics of the canopies and their locations in mountains. These factors together shape the spatial variability of fog water and acid inputs. Our findings highlight the substantial role of fog in the deposition of acidic substances to forest canopies, particularly in high-altitude regions with frequent fog events. This study underscores the need to incorporate fog water deposition into forest ecosystem assessments and long-term monitoring programs, especially in regions where traditional rain-based models may underestimate total atmospheric inputs."

 Summer precipitation over the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLYR) exhibits pronounced quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO), yet its dynamical mechanisms remain incompletely understood, limiting the subseasonal rainfall predictability. Based on observed precipitation and ERA5 reanalysis data from 1983 to 2022, this study analyzes the circulation patterns and dynamical mechanisms associated with the wet and dry phases of summer precipitation QBWO over the MLYR. The results reveal a tight coupling between the quasi-biweekly precipitation and low-level (850 hPa) vorticity anomalies. The wet phase features a low-level (850 hPa) quasi-biweekly cyclonic anomaly enhancing convergence, coupled with an upper-level (200 hPa) anticyclonic anomaly promoting divergence, creating favorable dynamic conditions. The dry phase shows opposite anomalies suppressing convection. Vorticity budget analysis clearly demonstrates that quasi-biweekly low-level vorticity development is primarily maintained through the dynamical process of vortex tube stretching, driven both by quasi-biweekly divergence acting on both planetary and background vorticity and by background wind convergence acting on quasi-biweekly vorticity. Multiscale vorticity budget also reveals that synoptic-scale vorticity and synoptic-scale divergence always generate positive vorticity, with particularly enhanced generation during the wet phase that reinforces the QBWO through positive contribution. In contrast, relative vorticity advection generally inhibits vorticity maintenance through the stronger negative contribution of synoptic-scale vorticity advection in the wet phase and the north-south asymmetric advection effect dominated by the monsoon southerly wind. This study clarifies how the monsoon background circulation and synoptic-scale nonlinear processes collectively modulate the QBWO of summer precipitation in the MLYR, advancing understanding of multiscale interactions in monsoon intraseasonal variability."

 The weather radar network in China exhibits an uneven spatial distribution, with dense coverage in the eastern regions and sparse deployment in the west, resulting in substantial detection blind spots in areas with complex terrain. This severely limits the continuity and precision of weather monitoring and early warning in these regions. To address this challenge, a multi-channel deep learning model, MCDA-UNet, is proposed for radar composite reflectivity retrieval, aiming to reconstruct and enhance radar echo patterns in regions lacking radar coverage by leveraging the extensive spatial coverage and continuous observation capabilities of geostationary meteorological satellites. The model employs a multi-channel input architecture to extract features from different spectral bands, while spatial and channel attention models are incorporated to improve the representation of key meteorological information, thereby enhancing retrieval accuracy and regional adaptability. Comparative experiments conducted under varying precipitation intensities demonstrate that MCDA-UNet consistently outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly in reconstructing weather radar echo structures and edge details. These results validate the model’s capability to adapt to the full dynamic range of weather radar reflectivity and highlight its potential for accurate precipitation retrieval in radar blind-spot regions."

There is also evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in the siting of this infrastructure for select components. However, population counts and demographic composition near fossil fuel energy infrastructure have not been systematically characterized across all types, supply chain stages, and predominant fuel types. Here, we construct a dataset of 25 elements of fossil fuel energy infrastructure and characterize the populations living near this infrastructure (defined as within 800 m [∼0.5 mile] or 1.6 km [∼1 mile]). We estimated that 46.6 million people in the contiguous U.S., representing 14.1% of the population, live within 1.6 km of at least one piece of energy infrastructure, with racial/ethnic disparities observed across nearly all stages of the supply chain. End use infrastructure has the most people residing within 1.6 km, with 20.9 million people, followed by extraction (20.3 million), and storage (6.16 million). Storage infrastructure has an average of ∼2,900 people living within 1.6 km of each element; end use infrastructure has an average of 1,900 people residing within 1.6 km of each element; extraction infrastructure has an average of 17 people residing within 1.6 km of each element. Almost 90% of the population near end use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure are in urban areas. Our results represent a substantial population in the U.S. that is potentially exposed to hazards that are not well-characterized, with unknown cumulative impacts, and which constitute a major environmental justice issue."

However, the extent to which phytoplankton feedback influences ENSO remains unclear. Chlorophyll in phytoplankton warms the upper ocean by absorbing solar radiation, and this effect weakens during El Niño and strengthens during La Niña, yet its overall impact is not well quantified. Using a simple nitrogen-based Nitrate–Phytoplankton–Zooplankton–Detritus pelagic model, here we show that phytoplankton concentration anomalies significantly dampen ENSO by cooling sea surface temperature by 0.69 °C during El Niño development and warming it by 1.09 °C during La Niña, with mean amplitudes of 1.71 °C and 1.42 °C, respectively. This may partially contributes to the amplitude asymmetry of ENSO, and accounts for 16.8% of total shortwave radiation-related damping during El Niño and 17.4% during La Niña. Our offline modeling approach successfully isolates this direct heating effect by excluding indirect dynamical effects of phytoplankton to physical variables."

Zorn;Thomas F. Mentel,Formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules from α-pinene photooxidation: evidence for the importance of highly oxygenated alkoxy radicals,"Highly oxygenated organic molecules by atmospheric oxidation of plant emitted monoterpenes are important components in secondary organic aerosol formation. Autoxidation of organic peroxy radicals is one important pathway of their formation. We show that isomerization of highly oxygenated alkoxy radicals leads to highly oxygenated peroxy radicals that continue the autoxidation chain. Alkoxy-peroxy steps may dominate the formation of highly oxygenated molecules at high nitrogen oxide levels. 
 Highly oxygenated organic compounds (HOMs) from α-pinene oxidation are of great interest because of their importance in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Despite intensive investigations, the mechanisms of HOM formation from first-generation peroxy radicals to HOM-peroxy radicals (HOM-RO2•) and to HOM-closed shell products are not well understood. One reason is that HOM-alkoxy radicals (HOM-RO•) are likely to contribute to the propagation of oxidative radical chains (alkoxy-peroxy pathway) because isomerization of functionalized alkoxy radicals can compete with their fragmentation (and reaction with O2), as shown by theoretical kinetics. However, HOM-RO• reaction steps are difficult to verify in mechanisms. In this work, we have investigated HOM formation by varying the significance of the alkoxy-peroxy pathway as a function of NOx, OH•, and CO. HOM-RO• are likely formed with high branching ratios in reactions of HOM-RO2• with peroxy radicals and NO in analogy to simpler alkoxy radicals. We provide experimental evidence that for HOM-RO• the branching into isomerization is about 50 % (±14 %). Thus, HOM-RO• can play a central role in HOM formation, since alkoxy-peroxy pathways can compete with direct autoxidation. We observed significant concentrations of HOM-RO2•, despite fast termination by NO, and shifts to higher O/C for HOM-RO2• and termination products with increasing NO. At NO concentrations > 1.5 ppb, the alkoxy-peroxy pathway may even prevail in propagating the oxidative radical chain leading to HOM formation. The increasing sink of HOM-RO2• with increasing concentration of peroxy radicals and NO is compensated by an increasing source via the alkoxy-peroxy pathway.This manuscript is dedicated to Astrid Kiendler-Scharr (deceased, 6 February 2023)."

Because each laboratory uses slightly different methods, we adjusted the data to make it directly comparable. This allowed us to create a consistent record of atmospheric methane concentration and its isotopes from 1988 to 2023. 
 Establishing interlaboratory compatibility among measurements of stable isotope ratios of atmospheric methane (δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4) is challenging. Significant offsets are common because laboratories have different ties to the VPDB or SMOW-SLAP scales. Umezawa et al. (2018) surveyed numerous comparison efforts for CH4 isotope measurements conducted from 2003 to 2017 and found scale offsets of up to 0.5 ‰ for δ13C-CH4 and 13 ‰ for δD-CH4 between laboratories. This exceeds the World Meteorological Organisation Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO-GAW) network compatibility targets of 0.02 ‰ and 1 ‰ considerably.We employ a method to establish scale offsets between laboratories using their reported CH4 isotope measurements on atmospheric samples. Our study includes data from eight laboratories with experience in high-precision isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) measurements for atmospheric CH4. The analysis relies exclusively on routine atmospheric measurements conducted by these laboratories at high-latitude stations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, where we assume each measurement represents sufficiently well-mixed air at the latitude for direct comparison. We use two methodologies for interlaboratory comparisons: (I) assessing differences between time-adjacent observation data and (II) smoothing the observed data using polynomial and harmonic functions before comparison. The results of both methods are consistent, and with a few exceptions, the overall average offsets between laboratories align well with those reported by Umezawa et al. (2018). This indicates that interlaboratory offsets remain robust over multi-year periods. The evaluation of routine measurements allows us to calculate the interlaboratory offsets from hundreds, in some cases thousands of measurements. Therefore, the uncertainty in the mean interlaboratory offset is not limited by the analytical error of a single analysis but by real atmospheric variability between the sampling dates and stations. Using the same method, we assess this uncertainty by investigating measurements from four high-latitude sites analysed by the INSTAAR laboratory. After applying the derived interlaboratory offsets, we present a harmonised time series for δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4 at high northern and southern latitudes, covering the period from 1988 to 2023."

However, methods used to advect them typically do not respect the mass conservation equation, resulting in gaps and bunches in the tracer distribution. Here a method to correct this, based on nudging tracer positions in order to respect mass conservation, is presented. Tests show that it is effective and has a low computational cost. 
 Tracers/markers/particles are commonly used in geodynamical models to track composition and sometimes other quantities throughout the domain. A common problem is that over time, gaps in the tracer distribution can develop, often resulting in cells with no tracers as well as bunching of tracers. These arise when tracer advection does not perfectly respect the mass conservation equation, so here this equation is used to derive a correction method that perturbs or “nudges” the positions of tracers in such a way as to close gaps and eliminate bunching. Test results show that this tracer nudging method is highly effective. Starting from an extremely heterogeneous tracer distribution with large regions of the domain devoid of tracers, it can produce an even distribution in only a few nudge iterations. In a time-stepping situation with a nudge every time-step, the amplitudes of the nudges are small yet sufficient to prevent gaps and bunches, allowing a low-order tracer advection method to be used while maintaining a tracer distribution that is more even than that obtained using higher-order advection methods alone. The computational cost is small – slightly larger than that of a first-order tracer advection step alone - because the method simply requires solving a Poisson equation. If an accuracy threshold is applied, a nudge correction may be necessary in only a fraction of time steps, with tests indicating that it is fastest to use low order advection with more frequent nudges than high order advection with less frequent nudges."

We validate GAMCR on synthetic data and demonstrate its ability to investigate the characteristic runoff responses from real-world hydrologic series. GAMCR provides new data-driven opportunities to understand and compare hydrological behavior across different catchments. 
 Estimating the hydrologic response of watersheds to precipitation events is key to understanding streamflow generation processes. Impulse Response Functions, commonly referred to as the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) in hydrology, have been used for over 50 years to predict stormflow and compare catchment behaviors. These response functions are often strongly affected by modelers' choices of parameters and data preprocessing procedures, limiting their diagnostic utility and generalizability across different sites and time periods. With the increasing availability of compiled rainfall-runoff series, there is now a growing opportunity to develop new approaches that fully exploit such datasets. This paper introduces GAMCR, a novel data-driven approach that employs Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to estimate time-dependent Catchment Responses (CR). GAMCR is designed to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between precipitation and runoff, offering a flexible and interpretable framework for the systematic analysis of hydrological responses. The model is successfully validated on synthetic data, where the true response functions are known. Additionally, we demonstrate the model's potential using observed data from six Swiss basins with distinct hydrological behaviors. Results are fully consistent with those obtained from ERRA, another recent data-driven approach with a very different architecture, as well as with the climate and physical properties of the sites. Overall, GAMCR is a modern and effective tool for leveraging rainfall-runoff datasets to investigate the controls on hydrologic responses in small to midsize basins under conditions similar to those studied here, and it provides a framework that can be further explored in other climatic and physiographic settings in future research."

Although the combined effects of stressors are recognized, the manner in which the prestress state determines the basic response mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the “natural experiment” methodology to compare two major extreme events within a monsoon‐influenced, low‐latitude highlands setting to explain mechanistic changes in land‐atmosphere interactions. By analyzing an extensive set of remote sensing and reanalysis data with nonlinear structural equation modeling, we show that the ecosystem response shifted from a traditional water‐limited paradigm during the 2010 drought to an energy‐governed paradigm during the 2019 heatwave. Our results suggest that this transition is governed by the antecedent root zone soil moisture status, which acts as a tipping point fundamentally shifting the impact of atmospheric factors on canopy evapotranspiration screens, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit. This study highlights a possible threshold‐type state dependence non‐linearity, which is lacking in major Earth System Models. Incorporating this “hydrological memory” is crucial for minimizing uncertainties in climate projections and for correctly assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems in a warming world."

Here, we report on the results of a controlled laboratory experiment focusing on the excitation of whistler waves via temperature anisotropy instabilities–the same mechanism responsible for their generation in space. In our experiments, anisotropic energetic electrons, produced by perpendicularly propagating microwaves at the equator of a magnetic mirror, provide the free energy for whistler excitation. The observed whistler waves exhibit a distinct periodic excitation pattern, analogous to naturally occurring whistler emissions in space. Particle‐in‐cell simulations reveal that this periodicity arises from a self‐regulating process: whistler‐induced pitch‐angle scattering rapidly relaxes the electron anisotropy, which subsequently rebuilds due to continuous energy injection and further excites wave. Our results have direct implications for understanding the process and characteristics of whistler emissions in near‐Earth space."

The resulting TUC feedback parameter, estimated from RCE experiments with observationally constrained versus CMIP6‐derived TUC fractions, is more negative for observational inputs (−1.66 to −1.24 W m−2 K−1) and spans a much broader range for CMIP6 inputs (−1.34 to +1.78 W m−2 K−1).

The explosive escape flux exceeds the average plume and tailward escape flux by an order of magnitude and is comparable to that of reconnection processes above strong crustal field regions.

The model predicts the seasonal (monthly moving average) salinity at a given location using a single dimensionless variable that represents the ratio of freshwater discharge to tidally driven discharge. The model is validated using data from 11 estuaries globally, showing strong predictive performance for seasonal salinity time series in each estuary, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.5 ± 1.3 psu across all estuaries.

To resolve this paradox, we re‐visit the sedimentary CaCO3 distribution and carbonate chemistry across the western Pacific with a carbonate accumulation model. Our results show that CSD shoals along the route of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water, resulted from respiration‐driven declining [CO32−]. In contrast, the development of mid‐depth carbonate undersaturation, caused by enhanced particulate organic carbon (POC) remineralization driven by high productivity, sharply raises the CSD in northern Northwest Pacific and substantially lowers the regional CaCO3 preservation.

The large ensemble size (at least 10, and in many cases 50) allows for the isolation of weak signals that are usually hidden by internal variability. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations lead to weakening of the Quasi‐biennial Oscillation (QBO) and an increased likelihood of a disruption event, with the effect most pronounced in the lower stratosphere. Increasing aerosols lead to a strengthening of the QBO. Explosive volcanic eruptions lead to a weakening, and for some phases also a stalling, of the QBO. Volcanic eruptions can also help trigger a QBO disruption. The ozone forcing used for LESFMIP helps synchronize the QBO phase across ensemble members, and also increases the strength of the QBO.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties in the simulated precipitation variability over dry and wet regions of China based on a 40‐year parameter‐perturbed ensemble spanning 1975 to 2014. The dynamic and thermodynamic contributions of physical parameters to precipitation variability are quantified. The results demonstrate that precipitation variability is mainly attributed to the change in the thermodynamic component of precipitation in China. However, the uncertain range of the dynamic component is comparable with that of the thermodynamic component, particularly at interannual timescale. Parametric sensitivity analyses suggest that at interdecadal timescale, most of the uncertainty in precipitation variability arises from internal model stochasticity. At interannual timescale, nearly 50% of the uncertainty is contributed by the parameter related to convective precipitation evaporation. Stronger convective precipitation evaporation rate simultaneously increases the dynamic and thermodynamic components of precipitation, suggesting the responses in the two components are tightly interconnected. The increased evaporation rate suppresses local convective precipitation but, via increasing low‐level water vapor and promoting remote moisture transport, strongly enhances large‐scale precipitation, leading to a net increase in total precipitation in convergence zones over tropical and subtropical monsoon regions and then enhancing upward motion in turn. Compared to drier years, stronger convergence in wetter years is more favorable for the long‐range transport of moisture to mid‐high latitudes, thereby enhancing precipitation interannual variability in China."

However, few studies have systematically explored the hierarchical drivers of SOC. This study addresses this gap by integrating multiple independent datasets—covering productivity, carbon allocation, carbon turnover, and carbon fractions—to construct a comprehensive framework for the hierarchical drivers shaping global SOC patterns. Using this framework, we examine the impact pathways and contributions of primary drivers. Our findings show that climate, as the fundamental primary driver, mainly influences SOC through carbon input pathways, while soil properties, as a secondary driver, predominantly affect SOC via carbon output pathways. Further analysis reveals that carbon input plays a key role in shaping topsoil SOC distribution, while carbon output is more influential in regulating subsoil SOC. In both cases, these drivers exert their effects primarily through stable organic carbon fractions, particularly mineral‐associated organic carbon (MAOC). The influence of these drivers on particulate organic carbon (POC), however, is in the opposite direction. This study provides the first quantification of the impact pathways and relative strengths of the hierarchical drivers shaping global SOC. It also underscores the need to consider the hierarchical structure of these drivers when assessing the magnitude, distribution, and dynamics of SOC, particularly in relation to its fractions."

However, the biophysical impacts of anthropogenic land use and land cover change (LULCC), particularly deforestation and afforestation, on extreme weather events in West Africa remain poorly understood at the regional scale. In this study, we present the first high‐resolution LULCC experiments (at 3 km resolution, covering 2012–2022) using the advanced fully coupled atmosphere‐hydrology WRF‐Hydro model system to assess the potential impacts of idealized land use and land management scenarios on extreme events in the West African savannah region. By analyzing 18 extreme weather indices, we show that deforestation significantly affects temperature extremes (up to 0.45 ± 0.04°C), with effects on regional rainfall extremes being approximately twice as pronounced as those on mean rainfall conditions, along with a significant increase in the number of dry days. Conversely, afforestation generally leads to increases in both mean and extreme precipitation, along with fewer dry days and shorter drought durations. Notably, afforestation produces contrasting responses in temperature extremes depending on vegetation type: converting grassland to mixed or evergreen forest reduces extreme heat via increased transpiration, while conversion to savanna or woody savanna may intensify heat extremes due to albedo‐induced warming effects."

Our H++ screening storyline is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report low‐likelihood high‐impact sea level rise assessment. In response to user needs, all storylines within the H++ framework provide time‐continuous, geographically‐specific sea level rise projections for the UK to 2300 and information on sea level rise rates.

 Structures that can be stimulated to change shape may be utilized for a variety of applications, but they frequently need to be processed and modified. We propose here a simple, straightforward strategy of actuation based on bipolar electrochemistry driving asymmetric reactions at the surface grooves of pristine carbon fibers. In the first set of proof-of-principle experiments, a free-standing carbon fiber is polarized in a closed bipolar cell to trigger asymmetric benzoquinone/hydroquinone redox reactions in the two distinct compartments. Beyond a particular threshold potential, ion transfer occurs, and the part of the fiber involved in the anodic reaction exhibits reversible directional motion. Elemental surface characterization of the polarized carbon fiber indicates that the deflection is due to the intercalation/deintercalation of ions accompanying the oxidation/reduction of the fiber. The simultaneous local surface ionic adsorption/desorption is responsible for the fiber deflection. The length of the fiber part exposed to the electrochemical reduction reaction in the opposite compartment of the closed bipolar cell, as well as the groove orientation, determines the motion’s intensity and direction, respectively. Effective bending is achieved by optimization of fiber alignment and stimuli parameters. Actuation of two parallel fibers, oriented in opposite directions, leads to microtweezer-type behavior. We anticipate that these results will enrich the tool case for research in the field of soft robotics and micromechanics.

 Limited identification of insulin resistance-associated loci hinders understanding of its role in cardiometabolic health, impeding therapeutic strategies. We apply three multivariate genome-wide association study approaches on homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, insulin resistance index, fasting insulin, and ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from MAGIC and UK Biobank to develop a comprehensive phenotype (‘mvIR’), and identify 217 independent loci, including 24 novel loci. The mvIR is causally associated with higher risks of 17 cardiometabolic diseases and five aging phenotypes, independent of adiposity and sarcopenia. We outline 21 of 2644 druggable genes for insulin resistance by Mendelian randomization and colocalization, where six genes (AKT1, ERBB3, FCGR1A, FGFR1, LPL, NR1H3) encode targets for approved drugs with consistent directions in alleviating insulin resistance, with no significant side effects revealed by phenome-wide association study. This study uncovers novel loci and therapeutic targets to inform strategies promoting insulin resistance-centered cardiometabolic health and longevity.

 Photocatalytic methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME) offers a sustainable alternative to energy-intensive thermocatalysis, yet its practical application remains constrained by low efficiency. Herein, we designed Ni-doped plasmonic W18O49 nanowires that synergistically integrates low-coordinated W and Ni dual active sites with surface plasmon resonance for enhanced photocatalytic performance. The synergistic effect of W and Ni dual sites is amplified by plasmonic electron oscillations to facilitate the C-O bond cleavage and C-O-C coupling, driving efficient methanol-to-DME conversion. The optimized Ni0.66-W18O49 achieves a DME yield of 133.7 ± 3.3 mmol g-1 h-1 with 98.7% selectivity under 400 mW cm-2 illumination. The versatility of the catalyst is demonstrated through C2+ alcohol dehydration, achieving 40-80% rate enhancements and a recorded isobutylene yield of 3.7 mol g-1 h-1.

Analyzing transcriptional data from two clinical trial cohorts, GO30140 and IMbrave150, we find B cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9), a Wnt/β-catenin co-factor, associated with resistance. We develop a BCL9-targeting peptide, hsBCL9Z96, which suppresses tumor growth in combination with anti-PD-L1 ab in preclinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models. Multi-omics analyses implicate targeting BCL9 inhibits BMP4 secretion and downregulates CD24 on tumor cells, reprogramming macrophages toward a tumor-suppressive phenotype and promoting macrophage phagocytosis. This in turn rejuvenates T cell immunity via enhanced macrophage-mediated antigen presentation. Our data extend our understanding of how tumor-derived Wnt/β-catenin signaling impedes the innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and provide preliminary evidence that targeting BCL9 is a promising preclinical strategy to mitigate ICI resistance in HCC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in tumour immunotherapy but resistance has been seen. Here using pre-treatment hepatocellular carcinoma patient biopsies from patients scheduled for immunotherapy, the authors implicate BCL9 and show that a BCL9-targeting peptide promotes anti-tumour immunity in mouse models through targeting macrophages and promoting anti-tumour T cell responses."

Here the authors use sea surface height to show that a poleward shift of the northern boundary and changing dynamics maintain the circumpolar transport. 
 Over recent decades, the Southern Ocean’s westerly winds have intensified and shifted poleward, whereas the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport through the Drake Passage has remained stable. Here using satellite altimetry data, we define the interannual evolution of the ACC’s dynamical boundaries and identify a significant southward shift of its Northern Boundary (NB) over the past three decades, with the most rapid migration (up to 1.1° per decade) occurring in the Southeast Pacific. Ocean reanalysis confirms that volume transport within the ACC’s boundaries remains stable across the circumpolar Southern Ocean, despite a strengthening eastward flow concentrated near the migrating NB. The migrating NB redirects this intensified flow into the subtropical gyre, strengthening the Southern Ocean supergyre while maintaining stable ACC transport. These results resolve the paradox of stronger zonal flows coexisting with stable ACC transport, providing insight into changing Southern Ocean dynamics and their climate implications. Climate change is altering the strength and position of Southern Ocean westerly winds but the ocean transport is stable.

 Summer precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) significantly affects the regional and global climate. In this paper, the orographic gravity wave drag (OGWD) parameterization is revised by incorporating the moisture effect of saturated air into the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Seasonal simulations are performed for the summer rainfall over the TP during 2003–2023 employing the original and modified OGWD schemes. The results indicate that the rainfall and thus the wet biases over the southeastern TP are reduced when the moist OGWD scheme is employed. The moisture effect first enhances the lower-tropospheric OGWD over the Indian Peninsula, thereby weakening the low-level winds. The decrease in the horizontal wind speed leads to a reduction of the surface gravity wave momentum flux and thus the OGWD, which in turn strengthens the low-level flow. The latter process initiates intensification of the monsoon circulation over the Bay of Bengal (BOB). During mid-to-late summer, the monsoon circulation is continuously intensified through the circulation–precipitation interaction. The enhanced cyclonic circulation over the BOB induces an easterly flow to the south of the TP, which is opposed to the climatological southwesterly monsoon circulation. Therefore, the water vapor transport toward the TP is decreased."

 Arctic spring surface air temperature (SAT), as a critical climate indicator of spring climate change in the region, exhibits notable interannual variability amid rapid Arctic warming. However, the extent to which this variability is linked to the tropics remains unclear. This study identifies a reversal of the interannual relationship between winter (December–January–February) El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and subsequent spring (March–April–May) Arctic temperatures during recent decades. During the negative impact period, Arctic geopotential height anomalies associated with ENSO led to negative anomalies in atmospheric heat and water vapor transport from mid-latitudes to the Arctic, ultimately resulting in the cooling of Arctic SAT. In contrast, during the positive impact period, Arctic geopotential height anomalies linked to ENSO generated positive anomalies in atmospheric heat and water vapor transport from mid-latitudes to the Arctic, consequently resulting in Arctic SAT warming. The varying responses of high-latitude atmospheric circulation to ENSO during different periods are key drivers of the reversal in the tropical-Arctic teleconnection, which is closely tied to changes in the climatic state of the westerly jet induced by SST under climate change. This study advances understanding of the interannual variability mechanism of Arctic spring climate in the context of climate change and offers new insights into improving predictive capabilities."

 Global warming is expected to substantially weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). However, climate models disagree greatly on the magnitude of AMOC weakening. This adds uncertainties in climate change projections, across the globe, through influencing poleward ocean and atmospheric energy transports. Here, we show through multi-model analysis of future climate change projections that AMOC weakening during this century will strongly influence precipitation and its extremes over Brazil. Such weakening dominates over the direct global warming impacts, causing drying in the Amazon, while completely mitigating them in northeast Brazil. We trace this to a tropical Atlantic warming, consistent with weakened heat transport along the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current. This induces a cross-equatorial sea surface temperature gradient and changes in latent heat flux, shifting the intertropical convergence zone southward. Our findings highlight the need to reduce uncertainties in the AMOC response to global warming and its oceanic mediated influences on Brazilian climate."

 Whether the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) warming pattern under global warming resembles El Niño or La Niña remains uncertain, partly due to unrealistically simulated El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) asymmetry in climate models. Here, using a newly defined normalized mean state framework, we isolate the ENSO asymmetry-related rectification effect and find that traditional methods underestimate El Niño-like warming by 14.5% ± 11.9% because ENSO asymmetry weakens under global warming. This asymmetry reduction induces La Niña-like influences through cloud radiative and atmospheric convection processes in the equatorial western Pacific. The contribution of ENSO rectification to warming patterns correlates with simulated historical ENSO asymmetry in climate models. These findings clarify how ENSO nonlinearity shapes tropical Pacific warming patterns and provide an improved framework for climate projections."

 Warming and extreme precipitation events frequently occur in the Asian summer monsoon during autumn, and their causes are still unclear. In this study, we investigate variations in the monsoon and autumn precipitation over the Indochina Peninsula (ICP) using reanalysis data, observational datasets, and ensemble simulations from the CMIP6 Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP). The results show that from 2005 to 2023, a delayed retreat of the ICP monsoon led to increased autumn precipitation. Arctic sea ice loss associated with Arctic amplification is identified as one of the primary forcing factors. Reduced Arctic sea ice influences the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the tripole sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, which in turn excite Rossby wave sources in the mid-latitude North Atlantic. The resulting wave train propagates from Western Europe to Asia, inducing an anomalous anticyclone extending from Asia to the Western Pacific and promoting a northward displacement of the South Asian High (SAH). This shift drives a northward movement of the East Asian Subtropical Jet (EASJ) and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH). The SAH “pumping” enhances mid-tropospheric latent heat release and surface warming, strengthening the land–sea thermal contrast, thereby intensifying the monsoon circulation and delaying its retreat. These circulation changes enhance moisture convergence, increasing autumn precipitation over the ICP, highlighting the critical role of Arctic sea ice loss in modulating regional monsoon dynamics."

 The chaotic nature of the climate has motivated the production of large ensembles of simulations. To exploit those ensembles for impact or attribution studies, models are either considered separately or pooled together to increase the statistical significance of the results. The latter assumes that models are interchangeable. Care is necessary when fields, like temperature, yield obvious biases. Synoptic fields like SLP do not yield obvious biases, which might justify their use to enrich reanalysis data. Here, we examine this hypothesis through a neural network classification approach. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to recognize a climate model from a single SLP map over the North Atlantic. We find that models are highly identifiable in the summer (and less so in other seasons). From this classification, we identify families of climate models and investigate how climate change can affect SLP daily patterns toward the end of the 21st century.

Our analysis reveals that the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (SST) feedback is not the primary mechanism. Instead, the southward advection of the upper extratropical North Atlantic signal by the North Atlantic subtropical gyre along a horseshoe pathway is a key mechanism for forming the horseshoe pattern of cold SST anomalies. Additionally, the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation changes the upper tropical North Atlantic western boundary current. This change is amplified by enhanced surface wind stress curl over the tropical North Atlantic, contributing to warmer tropical Atlantic subsurface thermocline temperature and SST in the tropical South Atlantic.

 To understand magmatic processes within the silicate planets, accurate pressure and temperature estimates are essential. These conditions are often measured using thermobarometers based on mineral equilibria, but their precision is limited, particularly for barometers, with standard error estimates often exceeding 200 megapascals. Here we present an approach combining thermodynamics and statistics to rigorously investigate these uncertainties. Uncertainty propagation and Sobol analysis reveal that thermometer uncertainties are primarily driven by compositional analytical uncertainty, while barometer uncertainties are dominated by model parameters. Given the quality of current calibration data, even a perfect thermodynamic model has a built-in minimum uncertainty of 120–240 megapascals for barometer and 22–41 °C for thermometer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pressure and temperature estimates are interdependent; an error in one inevitably compromises the other. Our work provides a pathway for building more reliable thermobarometric models and underscores the need for new, high-quality experimental data.

These results demonstrate the significant control of structural inheritance on fault geometric architecture and highlight the complexity of seismic activity and rupture behavior of the yielding fault network. The 2024 Wushi earthquake ruptured an oblique-reverse network of subsidiary faults, which hosted the majority of aftershocks and generated surface rupture, while the mainshock did not, according to an analysis of local seismic, geodetic and field data."

 Multiple lines of evidence support permanent oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere during the early Paleoproterozoic (~2.5–2.1 billion years ago). Here, we report geochemical data, along with sulfide textures, for >2.31-bilion-year-old sedimentary rocks from the upper Espanola and Serpent formations that underlie the third glacial diamictite of the Huronian Supergroup, Canada. Redox-sensitive element contents and the isotopic compositions of molybdenum and sulfur are comparable to upper continental crust value. Subangular to rounded pyrite grains of detrital origin are observed in sandstones of the Serpent Formation. Our data indicate limited oxidative weathering of crustal sulfide prior to the third glaciation of the Huronian succession, consistent with low atmospheric oxygen levels (<5×10−4 of the present atmospheric level). We suggest that such low atmospheric oxygen levels persisted for long periods prior to the final glaciation of the Huronian succession.

 Rapid Arctic warming accelerates the erosion of permafrost coasts rich in terrestrial organic carbon (terrOC). Once released into the ocean, terrOC can degrade or get buried in shelf sediments, yet its transport pathways and fate remain poorly understood. We collected permafrost material, sediment and surface water along the Canadian Beaufort Sea coast, fractionating samples by density (cut-off 1.8 g/cm3) and size (38, 63 and 200 µm) before performing geochemical and microscopic analysis. Our results show that ~43% of terrOC is trapped in low-density fractions, mainly as vascular plant debris. Surprisingly, this material is trapped within shallow (0-5 m) waters where waterlogging and large particle size increase its density and settling velocity. Less than 10% is transported to deeper waters (30-55 m), indicating that the shallow coastal zone acts as a trap and biogeochemical reactor. These findings challenge the source-to-sink paradigm and highlight the overlooked and undersampled ( < 6% of pan-arctic shelf data) nearshore zone.

 The increasing frequency and severity of hydrological extremes demand the development of early warning systems and effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Such systems and strategies require spatially detailed hydrological predictions, mostly provided by hydrological models. However, current state-of-the-art hydrological predictions remain limited in their spatial resolution. A proposed solution is the integration of high-resolution (<1 km) Earth observation (EO) products in hydrological modelling in order to reach hyper-resolution (approximately 1 km2). Nonetheless, proper use of these data in hydrological modelling requires a comprehensive characterization of their uncertainties. Here, we evaluate the performance of high-resolution EO products of four hydrological variables (7 precipitation products, 5 snow cover area products, 6 surface soil moisture products, and 6 actual evapotranspiration products) against observational references. Two merged EO precipitation products at 1 km resolution (merged IMERG-SM2A and merged ERA5-IMERG-SM2A) reached correlation coefficients >0.5 with the benchmark reference over most areas and are recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling over Europe. The MODIS (resolution of 250 m) and Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 (resolution of 20/30 m) snow cover products showed the highest classification accuracy and were selected as the best choice for the use of snow cover area products in hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. For surface soil moisture, the NSIDC SMAP product at 1 km resolution yielded correlation coefficients >0.6 at most stations and is recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Finally, evapotranspiration products showed similar performances at the selected flux sites (correlations coefficients > 0.8). While the MODIS-Terra/Aqua evapotranspiration products (MOD16A2/MYD16A2) offer higher spatial resolution (500 m), making them potentially advantageous for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling, their temporal resolution is coarser (8-day intervals). In contrast, products like ETMonitor (1 km), ALEXI, and HOLAPS (5 km) provide daily estimates, albeit at lower spatial resolution. The assimilation of the proposed high-resolution products in models individually or in combination could lead us to hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Still, developing integration workflows is required to overcome difficulties related to scale mismatches and data-gaps."

 Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on ground truth data for training/calibration. Such data are collected via field trials or surveys. This reliance on ground survey data confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop progress data generated for an unsurveyed region of interest. Corn-growing zones in Argentina were used as surrogate ‘unsurveyed’ regions. These zones have climates and dual planting systems which differ from the single planting system in the US Midwest – the surveyed region in this study. Existing weather generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. These data mimic weather, cultivars, and cropping practices in the unsurveyed region. A neural network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. In the absence of real validation data in unsurveyed regions, a stopping criterion was developed which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation loss. F1 score was modified to measure CPE accuracy when the NN was trained on each data combination, with scores based on over- and under-estimates of crop progress throughout the season. Including synthetic data during training improved performance in 9 out of 11 corn-growing zones in Argentina. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall performance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data."

 Operational national forest monitoring requires frequent, reliable observations for timely detection of deforestation and other forest changes. However, tropical forests, which encompass all current major deforestation fronts, are often hampered by persistent cloud cover. While radar remote sensing offers a compelling complement to optical data, a significant research gap remains in distinguishing the strengths and limitations of different radar sensors to the multiple stages of forest disturbance. Given the impending rapid expansion of available data outside the C band, it is imperative to assess the ability of these sensors to rapidly and accurately detect changes of high importance to the remote sensing community.To address this gap, we investigated the sensitivity of two freely available radar datasets — JAXA’s ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (L-band) and ESA’s Sentinel-1 (C-band) — to distinct stages of tropical forest loss. With a particular focus on detecting the earliest stage of deforestation, we compared backscatter values, SAR indices, and statistical metrics against time series data from 92 locations over three years in the Amazon. In these locations, early deforestation, biomass burning, and vegetation regrowth were occurring in different stages of the full conversion process. Our analysis revealed that the L-band-derived Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI) is highly sensitive to early deforestation, even when biomass remains on the ground soon after cutting. In contrast, C-band information showed limited ability to sense this critical initial stage of change, but was much stronger at detecting later deforestation stages. Our results point the way toward combining information from the upcoming L-Band NISAR mission with the existing C-band information to produce a multi-component system that can accurately detect deforestation in all its temporal stages."

 Spatiotemporal fusion is recognized as a feasible approach for reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing imagery. The recently proposed ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model has attracted attention for its efficiency, accuracy, and simple parameterization, and has been applied to seamless global data cube reconstruction. However, its sliding-window strategy often leads to block artifacts, while cloud contamination in auxiliary images further degrade the reconstruction quality and reliability. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved version of ROBOT (iROBOT). By replacing fixed rectangular patches with spectrally and spatially homogeneous segments, iROBOT effectively suppresses block artifacts and better preserves structural details. In addition, an adaptive gap-filling strategy is applied to temporally nearest auxiliary images prior to fusion, and a low-quality information detection module is introduced to filter unreliable cloud-contaminated data from the regression and residual allocation steps, thereby enhancing reliability under cloud contamination. A total of 28 experiments conducted across two representative areas demonstrate that iROBOT consistently outperforms ROBOT, OL-HSTFM, and FSDAF under both cloud-free and cloud-contaminated scenarios. Moreover, compared with ROBOT, iROBOT exhibits superior capability in selecting reliable information from multi-temporal auxiliary images, with its accuracy advantage becoming more pronounced as the number of auxiliary inputs increases, and with notably enhanced robustness in cloud-prone environments. These findings highlight the potential of iROBOT for improving the accuracy of global-scale spatiotemporal image reconstruction.

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a powerful proxy for vegetation photosynthesis. However, its broader application remains constrained by the insufficient understanding and quantification of canopy spatial heterogeneity. We used the 3D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate SIF. Heterogeneous and homogeneous canopies were compared to quantify the impact of canopy spatial configuration on total leaf-emitted SIF (SIFtotal) and hemispherically integrated top-of-canopy SIF (SIFhemi). Angular effects were examined by comparing top-of-canopy SIF (SIFtoc) with SIFtotal estimated at different viewing angles. We also compared the relationships of simulated SIFtotal and SIFtoc with fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and vegetation indices (VIs). In addition, we evaluated the relationships between the coefficient of variation (CV) of VIs and SIF, and developed a correction function for estimating heterogeneous-canopy SIF using homogeneous-canopy SIF. The results reveal that (1) both SIFtotal and SIFhemi are significantly higher in homogeneous than in heterogeneous canopies; (2) estimating SIFtotal from SIFtoc effectively reduces angular dependency; (3) SIFtotal exhibits the strongest correlation with fAPAR, while SIFtoc aligns better with NIRv and EVI; and (4) VI-derived CVs are negatively correlated with SIF, with CVNIRv and CVEVI at 10 m resolution demonstrating robust performance in fitting the ratio of heterogeneous-to-homogeneous canopy SIF, validating the proposed correction function. This study highlights the critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in shaping SIF and presents an approach to convert homogeneous-canopy SIF to heterogeneous-canopy conditions, offering a novel pathway toward more accurate SIF estimation and application."

 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) based on microwave remote sensing has become an essential indicator for monitoring large-scale vegetation conditions. The relatively long-term record of satellite-based passive C-band observations offers the potential for assessing dynamic vegetation changes. Due to the limited operational lifetime of individual microwave sensors, retrieving a long-term C-band VOD (C-VOD) dataset often requires combining multiple sensors, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS Aqua (AMSR-E, 2002–2011), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2, 2012–present) and WindSat (2003–2020). Retrieving a long-term C-VOD from their C-band brightness temperature (TB) observations faces two major challenges: (i) non-negligible systematic biases exist between the TB observations among the three sensors; (ii) TB from different sensors may not be strongly associated, especially in tropical forests with small seasonal variations. To address these challenges, we employed a combined inter-calibration method, using linear regression in sparse vegetation and linear rescaling in dense vegetation, to merge TB from three sensors. Results showed that: (i) in undisturbed dense forests where minimal emissivity variation can be assumed, the merged TB (2002–2022) exhibited strong temporal correlations with skin temperature (H polarization: R = 0.90, V polarization: R = 0.86); (ii) the merged C-VOD retrieved from the merged TB exhibited substantially improved temporal consistency across three sensors, reducing global discrepancies between AMSR-E and AMSR2 from 6.20 % to 0.34 %. Furthermore, the merged C-VOD showed stable long-term consistency across sensors, with paired t-tests indicating no significant differences (P-value > 0.01) at the global and vegetation-type scales, confirming reliable cross-sensor continuity; (iii) the merged C-VOD showed stronger temporal correlations with normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and site-level gross primary production across more vegetated areas globally, and exhibited higher and more stable spatial correlations with vegetation variables across sensor transitions compared to the existing merged C-VOD product."

 Accurate paddy rice cropping intensity (PRCI) information is crucial for yield estimation, food policy formulation, and water resources management. However, the high cultivation intensity, fragmented farmland, complex crop rotation systems, and overlapping crop growth stages in southern China make it challenging to differentiate rice varieties from other crops. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-automatic framework for mapping PRCI in southern China. This framework first fused MODIS and Sentinel-2 data to generate high-spatiotemporal-resolution vegetation indices, forming the data foundation to identify the key phenological stages of paddy rice. Then, an automated division approach is designed to divide crop-growing seasons. Based on that, we developed a discriminant feature set for rice and identified potential rice-planting regions using an unsupervised Gaussian mixture model. Finally, we obtained reliable 10-m PRCI maps from PRP regions by integrating statistical data, Sentinel-1 data, limited rice samples, and the time-weighted dynamic time warping algorithm. Experimental results showed that our framework consistently achieved a high mapping accuracy of 87 % across various regions with diverse landforms and agricultural practices. Furthermore, the framework showed a strong correlation with municipal-level statistical data (R2 = 0.99) and ideal adaptability to complex landscapes and crop rotation systems."

 In indoor environments, the presence of particulate matter promotes SVOCs volatilization, increasing their overall concentration in the air. This effect arises from the partition of SVOCs between the gas and particulate phases. The particle-gas partition ratio (Kp) is a critical parameter influencing the fate, transport, and human exposure to indoor SVOCs. Air exchange rate (AER) is a pivotal factor in closed spaces as it regulates the residence time of airborne SVOCs in an indoor environment. It has been reported that AER (or residence time) can affect particle-gas partitioning behavior for organic particles when equilibrium between gas and particle phases is not reached; however, its effect on inorganic particles has not been thoroughly investigated. This study develops an experimental procedure to measure Kp of Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and Diethyl phthalate (DEP) with inorganic sodium chloride (NaCl) particles. Results shows that DnBP had higher Kp values than DEP. Positive correlation of Kp values and mixing time was observed. These findings are consistent with model predictions. Further experiments were carried out to study the impact of AER on Kp, and the results shown that higher air exchange rates (lower residence time) result in lower particle-phase concentrations of SVOCs due to increased dilution and reduced interaction time with particles. These findings have important implications for indoor air quality assessments, highlighting the influence of ventilation strategies on SVOCs behavior in indoor environments."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108620,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注中国地区湿热浪的强度和变化趋势。它使用均一化的湿球温度数据，通过累积强度来量化湿热浪的严重程度。研究发现，经过均一化处理后，湿热浪的强度显著增加，尤其是在1990年之后。论文强调了观测数据均一化对于准确评估湿热浪风险的重要性。虽然该研究涉及大气温度和湿度的分析，但它主要侧重于气候变化和极端天气事件的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联较弱。,"['wet-bulb temperature', 'humid heatwaves', 'homogenized data', 'cumulative intensity', 'air temperature', 'relative humidity']",Linghong Chen;Hongze Cai;Changjian Yin;Kaicun Wang,Stronger rise in humid heatwaves over China shown by homogenized data from 1961 to 2022,"•A homogenized, high-resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) wet-bulb temperature dataset is used to quantified humid heatwaves. •Humid heatwave severity is characterized using cumulative intensity, demonstrating higher positive trend (1.71 °C/decade) than unhomogenized heatwave (1.29 °C/decade). •After homogenization, the humid heatwave severity increased by 26.6 % during 2010–2022. 
 A growing body of evidence has established the intensification of global humid heatwaves. With a large population and diverse ecosystem, humid heatwave in China has garnered scientific attention. Divergent conclusions across previous research of humid heatwave severity stem from the variations in wet-bulb temperature data source and heatwave characteristics. Robust wet-bulb temperature with high spatiotemporal resolution and cumulative heatwave characteristics, would enable more consistent assessments of humid heatwaves. Here, we generate regular gridded data of wet-bulb temperature, based on homogenized air temperature and relative humidity from station observational records across China. Meanwhile, we propose a cumulative heatwave intensity characteristic to quantify humid heatwaves severity, with inter-annual and cross-regional comparisons. The homogenized cumulative intensity characteristic reveals a significant increasing trend from 1961 to 2022. The national time-averaged value of the cumulative intensity during 1990–2022 (8.11 °C) exceeds twice the value of 1961–1990 (2.94 °C). The analysis identifies the Tibetan Plateau and Northwestern China as hotspots for humid heatwaves. These regions exhibit both higher multi-year mean severity and stronger intensification trends. The homogenization procedure reveals more extensive regions across China exhibiting both stronger and statistically significant intensification trends in heatwave severity. Additionally, the homogenized national mean trend of cumulative intensity of humid heatwave (1.71 °C/decade) surpass that derived from unhomogenized data (1.29 °C/decade). The cumulative intensity of humid heatwaves exhibits considerable discrepancy after homogenization, especially in post-1990. The relative discrepancy reaches 26.6 % during 2010–2022, while partial homogenization of temperature contributes − 9.3 %, partial homogenization of relative humidity contributes 48.0 %. This study investigates the rapid intensification of humid heatwaves across China under global warming, while highlighting how observational inhomogeneity systematically underestimate associated risks."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108626,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注华北雨季期间的强降水特征以及NCEP S2S模型的预测能力。论文将华北地区的强降水分为两类，并分析了不同类型强降水形成的原因，以及NCEP S2S模型对不同类型强降水的预测技巧。研究发现，模型对第一类强降水（集中在京津冀地区）的预测技巧较低，主要是因为模型未能准确预测西太平洋副热带高压（WPSH）的北抬。而对于第二类强降水（发生在华北南部），模型具有较高的预测技巧，这归因于其能够预测南亚高压（SAH）的东伸。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联，主要侧重于气象学和气候预测。,"['heavy rainfall', 'North China rainy season', 'precipitation forecast', 'WPSH', 'SAH', 'NCEP S2S model']",Ting Zheng;Zhihai Zheng;Peiyi Fan;Xintong Hou;Guolin Feng,The characteristics of heavy rainfall during the rainy season over North China and prediction skill of NCEP S2S,"•The heavy rainfall in North China are divided into two types: one type is concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, while the other occurs in southern North China. •The first type of heavy rainfall is mainly due to the PJ pattern strengthening the WPSH. The second type is due to the eastward extension of the SAH. •The low forecast skill of the NCEP S2S for the first type is primarily because the model fails to predict the WPSH. The model exhibits higher forecasting skill for the second type and the SAH. 
 The North China region is one of the most core areas in China. Understanding the characteristics of heavy precipitation during the North China rainy season is of great significance for predicting and preventing flood disasters in this region. Precipitation in North China in 2024 ranked fourth in the past 45 years. Therefore, we conducted a study of the precipitation in North China in 2024 and found that the precipitation anomaly center was located in the eastern part of North China. Based on this, we conducted an analysis of the distribution characteristics of heavy rainfall of North China and found that it can be divided into two types: one type of heavy rainfall is concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, while the other occurs in southern North China. Heavy rainfall concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is mainly due to the descending branch of the Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern coinciding with the center of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), thereby strengthening the northward-jumping WPSH. The low forecast skill of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Sub-seasonal to Seasonal (S2S) model for the first type of heavy rainfall is primarily because the model fails to predict the northward shift of the WPSH, leading to a southern bias in the forecasted anomaly center. Heavy rainfall occurring in the southern part of North China is due to the eastward extension of the eastern boundary of the South Asian High (SAH), which brings a large amount of moisture and strengthens the WPSH. The NCEP S2S model exhibits modestly higher forecasting skill for the second type of heavy rainfall compared to the first, attributed to its ability to predict the eastward extension of the SAH. The 2024 precipitation anomaly in North China aligns more closely with a hybrid of the first and second rainfall types. This pattern correlates with an unusually intense and northward-displaced WPSH, coupled with an exceptionally eastward-extended eastern boundary of the SAH. Consequently, the model successfully predicted the precipitation anomaly in southeastern North China but exhibited limited skill in forecasting anomalies across the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region."

 Ultrafine particles (UFPs) have attracted interest as perhaps the most dangerous fraction of atmospheric PM. This study focuses on the ultrafine particulate matter (PM0.1) mass concentrations and their chemical composition during a summer and winter period in Europe.Predicted levels of PM0.1 varied substantially, both in space and in time. The average predicted PM0.1 mass concentration was 0.6 µg m−3 in the summer, higher than the 0.3 µg m−3 predicted in the winter period. PM0.1 chemical composition exhibited significant seasonality. In summer, PM0.1 was mostly comprised of secondary inorganic matter (38 % sulfate and 13 % ammonium) and organics (9 % primary and 32 % secondary). During the winter, the fraction of secondary inorganic matter increased, with sulfate contributing 47 % and ammonium 19 %, on average. Primary organic matter contribution also increased from 9 % in summer to 23 % in winter, while secondary organic matter decreased significantly to 6 % on average during winter.During summertime, the model performance at 12 sites for daily average ultrafine particle volume (PV0.1) concentrations was considered good, with normalized mean error (NME) equal to 46 % and normalized mean bias (NMB) equal to 15 %. For the winter period, the corresponding values for daily average levels were −27 % for NMB and 64 % for NME, indicating an average model performance.Correlations between PM0.1 and the currently regulated PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 µm) were generally low. Better correlations were observed in cases where the primary component of PM0.1 was significant.

Findings highlight the impact of solid fuels and aging vehicles and stress the need for regional mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution-related health risks. 
 Ambient air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, particularly in low and middle-income countries, where detailed data on particulate matter (PM) mass and composition are scarce. We conducted a year-long study on PM composition and sources in Eastern Africa (Kigali, Rwanda). The annual mean concentration of PM1 was 31±15µgm-3 , with slightly higher concentrations during the dry season. Organic aerosols (OA) contributed 73 % of the observed PM1 mass, black carbon (BC) 16 %, nitrate 6 %, sulfate and ammonium 2 % each, and chlorine 1 %. BC is approximately 60 % due to fossil fuel emissions and 40 % from biomass burning emissions. Tracer ions detected by the aerosol mass spectrometer suggest that photochemistry plays a significant role in the formation of secondary OA during the daytime (06:00 a.m.–06:00 p.m.), while primary OA dominates in the morning and evening due to increased anthropogenic activity and shallower boundary layer height. PM1 OA in Kigali is primarily composed of Oxygenated Organic Aerosols (OOA, 45 %), Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, 32 %), and Biomass Burning OA (BBOA, 23 %). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) accounted for 47 % and 41 % of PM1 OA during the rainy and dry seasons, while primary OA (POA: BBOA + HOA) contributed 53 % and 59 %.

PaleoRiada, the first open palaeoflood database for Spain, addresses these issues by compiling data from 299 palaeoflood records, accessible through an open-access web platform. The database supports the revision of Potential Significant Flood Risk Areas and provides insights for regions not included in current national flood maps. 
 Palaeoflood records are natural evidence of past flood events (typically found in landforms, sediments, or vegetation). Over the last 25 years, several palaeoflood record databases have been implemented. However, many of these databases are outdated, lack accessible or comprehensive palaeohydrological information, and present challenges in terms of data accessibility and reuse, particularly for non-research communities (e.g. planning administrations or flood risk managers). This work introduces PaleoRiada, the first open database that compiles published palaeoflood records from Spain. PaleoRiada stores typological, hydrological, temporal, and spatial data collected from approximately 126 publications (including journal articles, scientific reports, and book chapters). This database has been implemented using a simple Relational Database Management System (RDMS), integrated into a web platform, and is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17391823 (Sandoval-Rincón et al., 2025). The PaleoRiada database contains 299 palaeoflood records (both geological and biological) dated between 2014 CE and 97 000 BP and distributed across both Atlantic (164) and Mediterranean (135) catchments. PaleoRiada includes 157 records with specific discharge values ranging from 0.02 to 320 m3km-2s-1. These records are associated with a variety of river systems, including wide alluvial plains (25), Mediterranean ephemeral streams (17), mountain torrents (36), and confined valley rivers (79). Additionally, they encompass overbank flood events (102), flash floods (48), dam failures (1), and hyperconcentrated flow events (6). The relationship between PaleoRiada and the Spanish Flood-prone Mapping Project (SNCZI) indicates that approximately 80 % of the PaleoRiada records are not included in the flood-prone areas defined by SNCZI. Therefore, several records can be consulted to prioritise or propose new areas for preliminary flood risk assessment. Accessibility and simplified data query and entry in PaleoRiada can facilitate the application of palaeoflood data in land planning and flood risk management."

To help improve emergency response, we created a global dataset called BRIGHT using both optical and radar images to detect building damage in any weather. We tested many artificial intelligence models and showed how well they work in real disaster scenes. This work can guide better tools for future disaster recovery and help save lives faster. 
 Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment, an essential capability crucial in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to accurately map unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. These solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal EO data, particularly combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the lack of suitable benchmark datasets has constrained the development of robust multimodal AI models. In this paper, we present a Building damage assessment dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (Bright) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, Bright is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse multimodal dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of human-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, focusing on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The dataset's optical and SAR images with spatial resolutions between 0.3 and 1 m provide detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise damage assessment. We train seven advanced AI models on Bright to validate transferability and robustness. Beyond that, it also serves as a challenging benchmark for a variety of tasks in real-world disaster scenarios, including unsupervised domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised multimodal change detection, and unsupervised multimodal image matching. The experimental results serve as baselines to inspire future research and model development. The dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14619797, Chen et al., 2025a), along with the code and pretrained models, is available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT (last access: 7 November 2025) and will be updated as and when a new disaster data is available. Bright also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track II. We hope that this effort will promote the development of AI-driven methods in support of people in disaster-affected areas."

Wijngaard,A computationally efficient method to model similar and alternate stratospheric aerosol injection experiments using prescribed aerosols in a lower-complexity version of the same model:  a case study using CESM(CAM) and CESM(WACCM),"Injection of reflective sulfate aerosols high in the atmosphere is a proposed method to mitigate global warming. Climate simulations with injection are more expensive than standard future projections. We propose a method that dynamically scales the forcing fields based on pre-existing full-complexity data. This opens up possibilities for ensemble generation, new scenarios and higher resolution runs. We show that our method works for multiple model versions, injection scenarios and resolutions. 
 Climate model simulations incorporating stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) generally require more computational resources compared to out-of-the-box applications, due to the importance of stratospheric chemistry. This presents a challenge for SAI research, especially because there are numerous ways and scenarios through which SAI can be implemented. Here, we propose a novel application of pattern-scaling techniques that allows us to generate SAI forcing in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) – a model without interactive stratospheric chemistry – using pre-existing data from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a state-of-the-art model with interactive stratospheric chemistry, but expensive to run. In doing so, a significant portion of the computational budget is saved. The present method requires a pre-existing dataset of a representative SAI experiment and its corresponding control experiment, with interactive stratospheric chemistry. The data is converted into a set of relations to determine the forcing fields given any required optical depth of the aerosol field. The present method is suitable for applications that use dynamical feedback controllers and is intended to aid impact research into the tropospheric and (sub)surface climate changes due to SAI. The results of climate simulations with aerosols prescribed by the present procedure are in close agreement with those from the full-complexity model, even for different model versions, horizontal resolutions and SAI forcing scenarios."

These pressure‐balanced structures span a broad range of scales in space, from fluid to kinetic regimes. The kinetic‐scale MHs are ubiquitous in the solar wind; however, the exploration is limited due to the lack of high‐resolution particle measurements. Here, we utilize Solar Orbiter observations to explore ion dynamics within an ion‐scale MH. The ion energy spectrum exhibits enhanced and depressed phase‐space densities for ions above and below 10 eV, respectively. The enhancements of perpendicular and parallel temperatures in this deep MH result in a quasi‐isotropic ion pitch angle distribution. The ion diamagnetic drift contributes to the agyrotropy around the boundaries, forming an ion vortex consistent with the magnetic field depression. These results align well with a kinetic equilibrium model, confirming the stability and self‐consistency of ion‐scale MHs in the solar wind."

 Extreme precipitation events are driven by complex multiscale atmospheric dynamic interactions, fuelled by available moisture. They are expected to intensify with climate change, posing increasing risks to human communities and ecosystems. However, current low-resolution climate models struggle to accurately represent key extreme precipitation-generating phenomena, limiting our ability to generate robust and reliable future projections. Here we present an ensemble of climate simulations with a 10-to-25-km resolution and an improved representation of mesoscale convective systems to assess future changes in daily extreme precipitation and its drivers. Our high-resolution simulations more realistically capture the observed spatial distribution and intensity of daily extreme precipitation over the historical period than the 100-km resolution counterparts. In a future scenario with high carbon dioxide emissions, daily extreme precipitation over land could increase by about 41% by 2100, mainly as a result of increased mesoscale moisture convergence. The impact of this dynamical contribution to extreme precipitation is underestimated by a factor of three in the low-resolution model. These results highlight the crucial role of high-resolution climate modelling in constraining future extremes and informing more effective climate risk assessments and adaptation strategies.

 Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers—located in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica—are responsible for more than one-third of the total ice loss from Antarctica. These glaciers are experiencing accelerated retreat due to a combination of complex air–sea-ice processes. The ice cavities—the ocean-filled spaces beneath glaciers where the ice becomes afloat in the form of ice shelves—are particularly vulnerable to warm water intrusions but remain severely understudied due to their remote location and the lack of numerical models capable of resolving small-scale ice–ocean processes. Here we show that ocean submesoscale features (1–10 km size) regularly form in the open ocean, propagate towards Thwaites Glacier, intrude its cavity and melt the ice from below. We use an ice–ocean numerical model at 200-m resolution and observations below the ice to reveal that submesoscale motions are ubiquitous year round in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Results show that submesoscales account for one-fifth of the total submarine melt variance in the area and highlight a positive feedback loop between submesoscale motions and submarine melting. Following this loop, as future climate warming implies greater ocean-induced melting, these events will become increasingly frequent, with far-reaching implications for ice-shelf stability and global sea-level rise.

 Therapeutic options for refractory depression are urgently needed. We conducted a deep brain stimulation (DBS) randomized controlled trial of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an extended amygdala structure, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in 26 refractory depression patients to assess treatment efficacy and predictors of response. BNST-NAc DBS had a 50% depression response rate and 35% remission rate in the open-label phase. We identified an objective intracranial physiological biomarker using acute and chronic intracranial recordings, machine learning, and an integrated framework combining electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and behavior: lower BNST theta and prefrontal-BNST coherence with top-down connectivity predicted better depression outcomes and quality-of-life after chronic stimulation at 3, 6 and 12 months, confirmed across eyes -open and -closed states and machine learning. We identified a physiology-guided connectivity network involving dorsal anterior cingulate and lateral inferior frontal cortex tracts. These biomarkers, linked to negative emotional bias and anxiety, highlight the efficacy of BNST-NAc DBS for refractory depression and has potential broader clinical implications.

 Spiders’ ability to spin foraging webs using silk from specialized glands represents a remarkable evolutionary innovation, yet the molecular evolution of silk glands remains unclear. Here, we investigated the evolution of silk glands in Araneoidea spiders through genomic and transcriptomic mining. After the divergence of the Araneoidea clade, numerous new genes with simplified structures and constrained expression emerged, expressed predominantly in silk glands and coexpressed with ancient genes to drive the evolution of silk glands. Among these, SpiCE-DS8, a newly evolved small secretory peptide unique to the Nephilinae subfamily, interacted with the N-terminal of MaSp1b and was incorporated into dragline silk, potentially aiding in silk solidification. In vitro wet-spinning experiments demonstrated that SpiCE-DS8 enhanced fiber properties, likely enabling spiders to arm their foraging webs for more efficient prey capture. These findings highlight the pivotal role of lineage-specific genes in silk gland evolution and provide insights for synthetic silk development.

 Non-invasive systemic visualization is crucial in biomedical research. Photoacoustic imaging transcends the optical scattering limitations, capturing optical absorption from deep tissue at high resolution. Nevertheless, the full exploitation of its physical advantages faces challenges due to unsatisfactory field of view (FOV), spatiotemporal resolution, and imaging quality. Here, we demonstrate that 3D panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography (3D-PanoPACT) mitigates these limitations by combining dynamical and functional contrasts, high spatiotemporal resolution, and broad three-dimensional FOV, allowing for visualizing cross-regional dynamics from organ to whole-body level. Leveraging its single-pulse-volumetric imaging capability, 3D-PanoPACT imaged the whole liver at 25 Hz, facilitating the extraction of arterial networks. Real-time monitoring of whole-brain vasculatures and functional hemodynamics induced by pharmacological action and physical stimulation was demonstrated, especially in the Circle of Willis. The dynamic visualization of the whole trunk at 10 Hz further substantiates its capacity for systemic imaging. We tracked the metabolic pathways of a small-molecule probe across multiple organs using 3D-PanoPACT, highlighting its value in whole-body, cross-regional dynamic studies. 3D-PanoPACT, being a potent novel imaging tool, exhibits substantial potential for advancing biotechnology.

Here, the authors show that cytosolic TBC1D1 inhibits nuclear entry of the AS160-STAT3 complex and regulates MuSC proliferation. Deficiency of TBC1D1 improves muscle regeneration. 
 The Rab GTPase activating protein (RabGAP) AS160 translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus acting as a transcriptional co-activator of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) to regulate proliferation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). How this AS160–STAT3 complex is regulated remains largely unclear yet. Here, we show that TBC1D1, a RabGAP related to AS160, forms a super-complex with AS160 and STAT3 to retain the AS160–STAT3 complex in the cytosol. Phosphorylation of TBC1D1-Thr596 by protein kinase B dissociates TBC1D1 from AS160 thus releasing the cytosolic retention of the AS160–STAT3 complex. A non-phosphorylatable alanine substitution of Thr596 inhibits MuSC proliferation and impairs repair of injured muscle. In contrast, TBC1D1 deficiency, but not its GAP-inactive mutation, promotes MuSC proliferation and muscle regeneration. Thus, TBC1D1 is a negative regulator of MuSC proliferation through cytosolic retention of the AS160–STAT3 complex and might be a valuable therapeutic target for muscle regeneration.

 Strong coupling between distinct quasiparticles in condensed matter systems gives rise to hybrid states with emergent properties. We demonstrate the hybridization of confined phonons and finite-wavelength magnons, forming a magnon-polaron cavity with tunable coupling strength and spatial confinement controlled by the applied magnetic field direction.

The observed mode hybridization is well described by a phenomenological model incorporating the spatial profiles of magnon and phonon modes. Furthermore, we report the first observation of Rabi-like oscillations in a coupled SAW-spin wave system, revealing the dynamical formation of magnon-polarons in the time domain.

 Zygotic genome activation is tightly associated with the modulation of chromatin accessibility via maternal transcription factors. Understanding how chromatin accessibility is established and identifying key maternal regulators are crucial to comprehending this process. Here, by developing CANTAC-seq, we generate a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin of early Xenopus tropicalis embryos and find that the open chromatin landscape is progressively established at cis-regulatory elements during zygotic genome activation. Based on the motif analysis and perturbation experiments, we demonstrate that E2f1 maintains a repressive chromatin environment and inhibits zygotic gene transcription before the mid-blastula transition. Moreover, we identify that Otx1, another maternal transcriptional activator, coordinates with E2f1 in regulating chromatin accessibility and zygotic genome activation. Together, E2f1 and Otx1 determine the timely expression of a subset of genes required for zygotic gene transcription and germ layer differentiation.

 The potential death toll of exceptional extreme heat events is crucial for climate risk analysis and adaptation planning but may not be captured by existing projections. Here we combine machine learning-based projections of five historical European heat waves under present or future global temperatures with empirical exposure–response functions to quantify the potential for extreme heat events to generate mass mortality.

This mortality is comparable to peak COVID-19 mortality in Europe and is not substantially reduced by climate adaptation currently observed across Europe. Our results suggest that while mitigating further global warming can reduce heat mortality, mass mortality events remain plausible at near-future temperatures despite current adaptations to heat.

 Soil moisture is a critical variable for hydrology, agriculture and climate. However, large-scale soil moisture observation remains difficult due to sparse in situ networks and the inability of optical sensors to capture it under cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions, e.g., Sentinel-1, yield unique all-weather, day and night observations with a fine spatial and temporal resolution that makes them of interest for development of global soil moisture monitoring. Consequently, this review discusses the application of C-band SAR observations from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to estimate high-resolution near-surface soil moisture. First, the importance of SAR backscatter monitoring from Sentinel-1 is emphasized. Next, the current state-of-the-art in soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 is presented. Although considerable progress has been made in near-surface soil moisture retrieval, several limitations remain. Factors such as the effects of vegetation and surface roughness on the signal, sensor and scattering model limitations, spatial and temporal constraints, and uncertainties, e.g. in data assimilation, pose challenges to its usage. While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based retrieval methods have shown promise, their interpretability, dependence on large datasets, vulnerability to data quality, and computational burden have been major challenges. Beyond methods that rely on backscatter, there have been recent works indicating that SAR interferometric observables have the potential to estimate soil moisture, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where these are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. To address these challenges, this paper recommends integrating Sentinel-1 with other satellite mission data for a multi-sensor data integration approach (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Soil Moisture Active Passive - SMAP data), refining physical and semi-empirical models, developing advanced AI techniques able to consider physical principles, and combining with emerging data from other high temporal resolution SAR missions (e.g., NASA-ISRO SAR). The review concludes with identification of key research priorities, including standardization of retrieval frameworks, improved validation efforts on standardized reference sets, and cloud processing for real-time user cases. Overall, the review provides a thorough foundation for understanding, refining, and advancing Sentinel-1 based soil moisture retrieval methods."

 Soil moisture plays a crucial role in regulating land-atmosphere interactions, directly influencing hydrological and ecological processes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has significant advantages in soil moisture retrieval; however, the accuracy of retrieval under different land cover conditions requires further investigation. This study systematically evaluates the performance of optical and radar-derived Vegetation Indices (VIs) in the WCM-Oh coupling model using Sentinel-1C-band dual-polarization SAR data, covering five land cover types (grassland, crops, shrubland, forest and desert). Additionally, a new radar-based vegetation index, SVIdp, is proposed and tested for the first time. This index is based on the interaction of dual-polarization scattering components. The results show: (1) The WCM-Oh model significantly improved retrieval accuracy in typical vegetation areas (grasslands and crops), with the correlation coefficient (R) increasing by 0.10 and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 2 %–14 %, compared to the independent WCM model; (2) Under different land cover types, the WCM-Oh2004 coupling model based on GNDVI demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R = 0.66–0.85, ubRMSE = 0.0392–0.0698 m3/m3) in areas with moderate vegetation cover (e.g., grassland A, herbaceous vegetation A/B, wheat/corn rotation areas).

 Plant traits serve as critical indicators of how plants adapt to environmental changes and influence ecosystem functions. While airborne hyperspectral remote sensing effectively maps plant traits through detailed reflectance properties, it is limited by cost and scale, making large-scale and temporal studies challenging. The recently launched spaceborne hyperspectral imager, PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), offers frequent, large scale and high-fidelity observations on a spatial resolution of 30 m and a revisit time of around 29 days, making it suitable for large-scale seasonal trait mapping. However, their potential remains largely unexplored. This study developed a multi-stage framework by leveraging the PRISMA spaceborne hyperspectral data and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) hyperspectral data to investigate the seasonal dynamics of four key plant traits — chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, equivalent water thickness, and nitrogen content — across eleven NEON sites representing diverse forest types and ecoregions in the contiguous U.S. Our results demonstrated that PRISMA hyperspectral data can reliably track seasonal variability in plant traits, achieving overall R2 values ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values ranging from 5.4 % to 8.4 % for the four traits. Seasonal patterns revealed bell-shaped trajectories for chlorophyll and carotenoids, while equivalent water thickness decreased steadily across most sites, driven by structural changes during leaf maturation and senescence. Nitrogen content exhibited less pronounced seasonal variation but followed expected nutrient resorption patterns. Analysis of environmental drivers showed that seasonal variability is primarily controlled by solar radiation and day length in northern sites, vapor pressure in semi-arid regions, and temperature in mid-southeastern sites. Spatial variability, meanwhile, was primarily driven by soil properties, particularly during the peak growing season. However, the influence of soil variables slightly declines toward the end of the season at several sites, as climatic factors become more prominent. This study highlights the capability of PRISMA, and potentially other similar spaceborne hyperspectral data for large-scale, time-series plant trait mapping and provides valuable insights into the interactions between plant traits and environmental factors. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of plant functional ecology and improving predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental changes."

 Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is the most promising remote-sensing proxy of Gross Primary Production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the estimation of GPP using SIF is challenging when plants experience stress, particularly during extreme climatic events whose frequency is projected to increase in the future. Recently, the feasibility of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (LED-induced chlorophyll fluorescence), which directly measure the apparent fluorescence yield (FyieldLIF), has provided new perspectives on detecting the responses of plants to stress. This study was conducted during the summer 2022 European heat waves in a mixed temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, located in the French Fontainebleau-Barbeau station. Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy exchanges, SIF, FyieldLIF, and ancillary environmental variables were acquired. We investigated how heat-wave induced high atmospheric dryness, measured as Vapor Pressure Deficit, affected canopy chlorophyll fluorescence (both SIF and FyieldLIF) and GPP, as well as their relationships. At the half-hourly scale, our results revealed a decrease of the correlation between SIF and GPP (R2 decreased from 0.49 to 0.17) at high atmospheric dryness. In contrast, the correlation between FyieldLIF and GPP increased significantly under high atmospheric dryness (R2 increased from 0.07 to 0.43). However, at the daily scale, the correlations between SIF and GPP and between FyieldLIF and GPP showed an overall increase compared to the half-hourly scale, suggesting a time-scale-dependent response of these relationships to atmospheric dryness. This study also highlighted FyieldLIF's advantage in detecting plant responses to high atmospheric dryness, and emphasized the potential of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence for assessing the chlorophyll fluorescence-photosynthesis relationship under extreme climatic conditions."

 Recently developed documentation technologies in the science of aquatic ecosystems can provide a large volume of new data. Some sets of documentary data, although developed for a different purpose, can be used to increase the effectiveness of water management and possibly help to better protect riverscapes. Such a source of data is riverscape photos can be used to assess the state of the river environment. In our article, we attempted to assess the hydromorphological condition of rivers based on available riverscape photos in Google Street View (GSV). In accordance with the River Habitat Survey protocol, one of the classic methods of assessing the hydromorphological condition implemented worldwide, we assessed the parameters of the hydromorphological condition of 60 stretches of selected Polish rivers located in different regions of the country, having specific and different physiographic features (slope, flow velocity, discharge, degree of modification). Then, based on available multimedia materials (GSV photos), we independently assessed the same parameters affecting the class of the hydromorphological condition of rivers and performed a comparative statistical analysis. No statistically significant difference between the assessment of the hydromorphological river status using the standard RHS field protocol and the assessment using GSV (p values of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test 0.19 – 0.98). Although the results require further verification on larger data sets, we see significant potential for using GSV in supplementing field methods of river hydromorphology assessment with this data. We postulate that in the absence of field analyses and with the availability of GSV materials or other photographic materials from rivers (e.g., citizen science), a reliable assessment of the hydromorphological state of rivers can still be made."

 Mitigating volcanic eruption disasters is a key priority in Indonesia’s national development agenda. Due to the high density of active volcanoes near populated areas, even eruptions with a relatively low Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) can result in significant fatalities and losses. Therefore, rapid mapping of eruption impacts is essential both during and following an eruption. Machine learning with Earth Observation (EO) data enhances the speed and accuracy of volcanic impact mapping, critical for timely disaster response. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three machine learning classifiers − Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost – for mapping land surface changes resulting from volcanic deposits (e.g. lahars, pyroclastic density currents and lava) across three different data availability scenarios using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data. Scenario I use a traditional approach, where training and validation data are sourced from the same eruption event. In Scenario II, the spatial transfer scenario, we simulate the absence of local training data by using data from different volcanoes. In Scenario III, the spatial–temporal transfer scenario, we include training data from past eruptions of the target volcano in addition to other events. Our results demonstrate that Scenario I achieve the highest classification accuracy, with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperforming SVM, achieving f1-scores exceeding 0.90. Scenario III improves average model performance compared to Scenario II (Δf1-score – 0.12), highlighting the value of historical eruption data for enhancing classification accuracy in data-scarce environments. These findings underscore the critical role of integrating EO data and machine learning in advancing volcanic impact mapping, offering a scalable and efficient approach to support disaster management efforts globally."

 Excessive groundwater pumping is a significant driver of land deformation, potentially threatening regional geological stability. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely used to monitor such deformation. However, existing studies primarily focus on retrieving InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) or ground vertical deformation, limiting insights into three-dimensional (3D) ground displacements driven by subsurface processes. To address this, we propose a novel approach for modeling 3D surface displacement by integrating dual-orbit Multi-Temporal InSAR measurements with multiple prior deformation models. Specifically, we first estimate two sets of 3D displacements using a Bayesian approach by integrating dual-orbit InSAR measurements into prior models. Subsequently, bidirectional matching is employed to identify reliable homologous points, which are then used to reconstruct the complete horizontal displacement fields through the surface horizontal force equilibrium equation. Following the proposed methodology, for multi-track and high-coherence data, minimum acceleration (MinA) combination, multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) techniques can serve as alternatives to conventional approaches. Moreover, incorporating along-track motion will further enhance 3D deformation estimation using SAR data. In the Lorca basin, Spain, we utilized Sentinel-1A ascending and descending SAR images to construct high-precision 3D cumulative displacement fields between October 7, 2015, to March 24, 2017. The experimental results reveal a maximum cumulative subsidence of 121.5 mm and notable horizontal displacements with a peak magnitude of 18.6 mm, a component that has received limited attention in earlier studies. The proposed approach eliminates the need for ground-based observations and yields improvements of 33.7 %, 51.3 %, and 43.9 % in the accuracy of vertical, east–west, and north–south deformation components, respectively, compared to the SMVCE method that integrates both InSAR and GNSS data. This study addresses the low sensitivity of InSAR in monitoring north–south displacement induced by groundwater extraction, offering new evidence to elucidate deformation mechanisms and providing valuable implications for sustainable groundwater management and geohazard mitigation."

 Mapping forest landscape fragmentation (FLF) after fires is essential for maintaining ecosystem balance, reducing fire-related losses, and minimizing environmental damage. However, the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon complicates accurate FLF mapping at fine resolutions (≤ 10 m) in mountainous regions. To relieve the phenomenon, this study used the multi-vegetation index (MVI) to represent FLF and applied the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to convert pixels into objects before classification, and then SNIC-MVI RF was introduced to map FLF using Sentinel-2 imagery and land use data. In combination with topographical and meteorological data, the Geodetector was employed to analyze the influencing factors on FLF patterns across different fire severity ranges. The results indicate that: (1) The proposed SNIC-MVI RF can accurately retrieve FLF across a range of fire severity using 10-m Sentinel-2 imagery while mitigating the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon, with an average precision of 96.2 % and an average F1-score of 97.4 %. (2) The FLF spatial patterns exhibit significant differences across fire severity. Low fire severity (LFS) leads to an increase in the number of small patches, moderate fire severity (MFS) results in more complex patch edges, and high fire severity (HFS) promotes greater patch aggregation. (3) Pre-fire meteorological conditions and vegetation cover are major influences on the spatial patterns of FLF under different fire severities. This study will provide a new method for exploring the impact of different fire severities on FLF in central Yunnan. As an important indicator for assessing ecological disturbance and habitat degradation, analyzing the response of fragmentation to different fire severities can help administrators evaluate the impacts of fire on FLF more scientifically and develop more targeted and sustainable forest management and ecological restoration strategies."

 Despite increasing concern over PM2.5 exposure, high-resolution, real-time assessments of elemental health risks, integrated with source attribution and diurnal variability, remain scarce in rapidly urbanizing cities. This study presents near-real-time, multi-site monitoring of PM2.5-bound trace elements through a mobile laboratory platform-assisted campaign using an Xact-625i in a major city of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in India. We conducted measurements across four land-use categories, residential, industrial, commercial, and traffic-dominated, over two seasonal cycles: Cycle-I (post-monsoon to early winter) and Cycle-II (late winter to early summer). Elemental concentrations showed a twofold increase during Cycle-I, driven by poor atmospheric dispersion and enhanced combustion activities. Across both cycles, the industrial site consistently recorded the highest concentrations due to proximity to continuous emissions. An episodic event, the Diwali fireworks period, resulted in extreme concentration spikes, peaking at 367.5 μg/m3. Health risk assessment, conducted with and without the episodic event, employed deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) approaches across both cycles. Mn and Cr6+, emitted primarily from traffic-related sources, dominated non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, respectively. The event increased the non-carcinogenic risk from 1.44 to 1.98 and doubled the probability of risk exceedance from 49.8 % to 99.67 %. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization resolved traffic, industrial, combustion, and fireworks-related emissions, with the non-exhaust factor contributing >35 % to both risk categories. Diurnal risk analysis identified high exposure windows during morning and evening hours across both cycles, aligned with urban activity patterns. This mobile laboratory platform framework enables real-time urban pollution hotspots mapping, identification of high-exposure windows, and source characterization to support targeted air quality and public health interventions."

 Based on CLARA-A2, TRMM-3B43, and ERA5 datasets, this study analyzes the influence of environmental conditions and cloud properties on Potential Cloud Precipitation Capacity (PCPA) over China, with a specific focus on the physical mechanisms underlying their differential dependence between dry and wet years. Results show that annual precipitation in wet years is significantly higher than in dry years, particularly in South China (SC), the Sichuan Basin (SB), and Northeast China (NE), where the difference exceeds 50 mm. Increased cloud fraction cover (CFC), liquid water path (LWP), and ice water path (IWP) during wet years provide more favorable conditions for precipitation. Among meteorological environmental factors, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), low-level relative humidity (RH), and surface latent heat flux (SLHF) significantly influence PCPA. CAPE increases in wet years, promoting precipitation, the positive influence of RH on PCPA strengthens when RH exceeds 50 %, and SLHF exhibits a significant positive correlation with PCPA in the wet years over the Tarim Basin (TB) and NE. Correlation analysis between cloud attributes and PCPA indicates that CF, LWP, and IWP are generally positively correlated with PCPA. However, within perennial cloudy background in SB, LWP shows a negative correlation with PCPA. The liquid cloud particle effective radius (LREF) is positively correlated with PCPA in SC and NE, whereas the ice cloud particle effective radius (IREF) generally exhibits a negative correlation. Comparing dry and wet years reveals that PCPA in the TB and NE is more sensitive to changes in cloud properties during wet years. This study highlights distinct cloud-precipitation interactions across different typical regions over China, providing a scientific basis for cloud water resources development and utilization."

 We reported on the nighttime observations of totally 20 transient luminous events (TLEs), including ten produced by negative cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes, over a coastal thunderstorm in South China on August 28, 2021. The lightning activity in this thunderstorm exhibited typical characteristics for coastal thunderstorms, with intense negative single-stroke flashes accounting for 76 % of all flashes with peak current exceeding −200 kA. Remarkably, most of the negative CG flashes related to TLE observations spawned only one negative CG stroke with high peak current (typically > −100 kA). Moreover, the outbreak of TLEs with elves and halo features requiring high peak current is likely linked to the intensification of convection in the thunderstorm, which occurred while the thunderstorm approached the coastline from the open sea, followed by a substantial growth in the cloud-top height and radar reflectivity. On the other hand, red sprites produced by positive CG strokes were observed almost throughout the observation period, with peak currents (averaging at +63 kA) much smaller than that of negative sprite-producing CG strokes. Overall, the TLE observations over this particular thunderstorm provide more insights into the TLE phenomenology of oceanic thunderstorms, and our analyses contribute to a better understanding on how oceanic thunderstorms affect the middle and upper atmosphere by producing intense negative CG strokes."

 Skillful prediction of large-scale environmental conditions is essential for reliable seasonal forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) activity. However, the capability of current state-of-the-art operational models in predicting these conditions remains unclear due to limited evaluation. This study evaluates the performance of the Climate Forecast System (CFS) in predicting the Dynamic Genesis Potential Index (DGPI)—a metric that integrates large-scale conditions influencing TC genesis—in the Western North Pacific (WNP), focusing on interannual variability in both spatial distribution and basin-wide mean values. Results show that CFS exhibits limited skill in capturing DGPI spatial variability, with a mean spatial correlation of only 0.21 during 1990–2022. While CFS Reforecast predictions (1990–2010) capture interannual variability well in basin-mean DGPI (r = 0.71), the operational CFSv2 forecasts (2011−2022) perform poorly (r = 0.19), mainly due to an inability to reproduce mean state changes. To address this limitation, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed, initially trained on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) historical simulations and then refined through transfer learning with reanalysis data. The CNN models significantly improve DGPI prediction skill, achieving a mean spatial correlation of 0.85 for anomaly fields during 2011–2022 and a strong correlation with observed basin-mean DGPI (r = 0.88), markedly outperforming CFSv2.

By comparing the snow chemical composition of the 2019–2020 season with 2018–2019 and 2020–2021, we provide an overview of the seasonal and interannual variability of several chemical species on the Svalbard snowpack, furnishing insights into the interplay between short-term meteorological variability and the long-term climatic impacts of climate changes. 
 The Svalbard Archipelago, highly sensitive to rapid environmental changes, offers an ideal physical laboratory to investigate how environmental drivers can shape the seasonal chemical composition of snow in a warming climate. From 2018 to 2021, sampling campaigns at the Gruvebadet Snow Research Site in Ny-Ålesund, in the North-West of the Svalbard Archipelago, captured the interannual variability in ionic and elemental impurities within surface snow, reflecting seasonal differences in atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Notably, warmer conditions prevailed in 2018–2019 and 2020–2021, contrasting with the relatively colder season of 2019–2020. Our findings suggest that impurity concentrations in the 2019–2020 colder season are impacted by enhanced sea spray aerosol production, likely driven by a larger extent of sea ice, and drier, windy conditions. This phenomenon was particularly evident in March 2020, when extensive sea ice was present in Kongsfjorden and around Spitsbergen due to an exceptionally strong, cold stratospheric polar vortex and unusual Arctic Oscillation (AO) index positive phase. This study provides a detailed characterization of how snow chemistry in this area responds to major environmental conditions, with particular attention to sea-ice extent, atmospheric circulation, synoptic conditions, and Arctic climate variability."

 The western coast of southern Africa is a region of particular climate interest and crossroads for aerosols of different origins as well as fog occurrences. In this study, we present a comparison between the concentration of dissolved trace metals in pairs of total suspended particulate (TSP) and fog water samples collected in Henties Bay, Namibia, during the AErosols, Radiation and CLOuds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) field campaign in September 2017. From inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements, we found that the concentration of dissolved Al, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Cr is enhanced in fog samples compared to the TSP samples. We found that thermodynamic modelling predicts the formation of soluble complexes with inorganic and organic ligands in fog for Cu, Cr, and Ni, but it would predict Al and Fe to precipitate as hydroxides given the neutral pH of fog. In contrast, X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements showed the presence of oxalate of Fe complexes that could explain its enhanced dissolved concentration in fog samples, despite a neutral pH. In addition, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed the presence of nano-sized colloidal particles containing Fe and Al in filtered fog samples that may appear soluble in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) measurements. We hypothesise that these complexes are formed in the early stages of particle activation into droplets when water content and, therefore, pH are expected to be lower and then remain in fog in a kinetically stable form or lead to the formation of colloidal nanoparticles."

 The Mount Brown South ice core (MBS 69.111° S 86.312° E) is a new, high resolution ice core drilled in coastal East Antarctica. With mean annual accumulation estimated to be ∼ 30 cm ice equivalent throughout the length of the core (∼ 290 m), MBS represents a high resolution archive of ice core data spanning 1137 years (873–2008 CE), from an area previously underrepresented by high resolution ice core data.Here, we present a high-resolution dataset of chemistry and impurities obtained via continuous flow analysis (CFA). The dataset consists of meltwater electrolytic conductivity, sodium (Na+), ammonium (NH4+), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and insoluble microparticle measurements. The data are presented in three datasets: as a 1 mm depth resolution record, 3 cm averaged record, and decadal average record. The 1 mm record represents an oversampling of the true resolution, as due to smoothing effects the actual resolution is closer to 3 cm for some species. Therefore, the 3 cm resolution dataset is considered to be the minimum true resolution given the system setup. We also describe the current Copenhagen CFA system, and provide a detailed assessment of data quality, precision, and functional resolution.The 1 mm averaged, 3 cm averaged, and MBS2023 decadal averaged datasets are available at the Australian Antarctic Data Center: https://doi.org/10.26179/9tke-0s16 (Harlan et al., 2024)."

For the first time, FWI calculations use surface weather readings taken at the local solar noon. This new method enables a more physically realistic spatial distribution of FWI components values across all boreal forest ecosystems, in particular along the time zones. 
 This article summarizes the work carried out at the ESCER (Étude et Simulation du Climat à l’Échelle Régionale, UQAM) Centre to develop the ERA5-FWI-SN dataset — a new automated, gridded dataset of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System components for Canada, at a spatial resolution of approximately 31 km. The ERA5-FWI-SN dataset is derived from the hourly ERA5 reanalysis using a new method, called the solar noon method, which is based on the sun's elevation above the local horizon at noon. This method aims to improve the conventional method for calculating the FWI System components, the UTC method, based on the maximum insolation defined via time zones (or specific areas covered by one Coordinated Universal Time zone, i.e. UTC zone), which can cover a wide longitudinal region where the same time prevails. The classical method relies on the principle that the average solar time over the territory covered by the same time zone is not too far from legal time (i.e., solar noon is not too far from legal noon), which can be problematic in regions that are very extensive in longitude, such as in Canada where only six time zones have been defined over more than 95° of longitudes. The solar noon method also allows for the correction of systematic biases associated with the UTC method, particularly those arising in gridded datasets near time zone boundaries or across the east–west extent of a single time zone. The dataset spans from 1950 to the present and is updated daily through an automation process that allows the calculation of the FWI components with a six-day lag, corresponding to the latest ERA5 available reanalysis data for download, resulting in a rapid (i.e., 6-days lag) monitoring of recent wildfire danger throughout Canada. Data were compared between solar noon and UTC methods and were tested against the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS) FWI calculated from observation station data. The dataset is available for download at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/4B18XZ, and derived visualization products can be accessed across the web platform http://feux.escer.uqam.ca/. "

Our results show these models struggle to accurately capture trends in variables related to carbon cycle, because the models can’t respond to human and environmental influences. This evaluation is crucial because improving these models will lead to more reliable forecasts of how ecosystems and the climate will change in the future. 
 Systematic evaluation of the carbon cycle physical and biological variables simulated in Earth System Model (ESM) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP 6) is fundamental to the understanding of terrestrial ecosystems, as well as to future projections. Leaf Area Index (LAI), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) as key indicators of carbon cycle performance in ESM outputs, play a critical role in evaluating ecosystem functions. Assessing these metrics can provide valuable insights into the biases in model-simulated ecosystems and offer guidance for model improvement. In this study, we assessed the interannual trends performance of LAI, GPP, NPP, NEP and LST simulated by 12 CMIP6 ESMs during the historical period by using satellite LAI, NPP, NEP, LST and CSIF data as observations. The findings indicate that: (1) There are significant uncertainties in the overall trends and interannual variability in LAI, NPP, and LST captured by the CMIP6 ESM. Meanwhile, simulated GPP and NEP trends were lower than observations with discrepancies reaching 0.03 yr−1 for GPP and 2.46 gCm-2yr-1 for NEP. (2) Spatially, CMIP6 ESMs exhibited widespread underestimation of trends in LAI, GPP, NPP, and NEP across China. The MME underestimated these variables in 46.29 % (LAI), 43.47 % (GPP), 49.81 % (NPP), and 61.34 % (NEP) of the study area. Meanwhile, the simulated LST trend is underestimated in northern China, while its overestimations in western and southern China.

Our findings reveal that the SPV showed a weakening trend from 1980 until the early 2000s, but a strengthening trend after the 2000s. This change is attributed to the weakening of the planetary wave (PW) activities, particularly the wavenumber‐1, which can be driven by long‐term Arctic surface changes. A strong link has been found between the observed PWs activity and the increasing sea surface temperature (SST) over/nearby the Barents‐Kara Sea before early 2000s and over the Central North Pacific region after the 2000s. Furthermore, we observe that the SPV trend influences the zonal mean zonal winds and migrating solar semidiurnal tide (SW2) in the MLT. The SW2 exhibits a ∼13%/decade positive trend from 1980 to the early 2000s and a ∼14%/decade negative trend after 2000s. These results provide evidence of the impact of Arctic surface variabilities, including sea‐ice, on the MLT dynamics, especially SW2 tide."

The model reproduced Lekima's track, intensity changes, and persistent concentric eyewall structure well. Consistent with previous findings, before SEF, the deep‐layer asymmetric inflow and updrafts in the upwind region and descending inflow in the downwind region of the outer rainbands contribute to the expanding tangential wind first in the downshear region through the advection of momentum. The convection in the upshear‐left region is triggered by the convergence induced by the descending inflow in stratiform precipitation of outer rainbands, and enhanced by the phase locking occurring between the radial‐propagating wavenumber‐1 vortex Rossby waves (VRWs) from the primary eyewall and inner rainbands and the azimuthal‐propagating wavenumber‐1 (wavenumber‐2) VRWs at the inner (outer) edge of the developing outer eyewall. The filamentation effect causes the rainband‐associated convection to have a more concentric structure, ultimately leading to SEF. Our findings suggest that the convection generation in the upshear‐left region may be critical to SEF in sheared tropical cyclones (TCs)."

However, the attribution of GPP trends predominantly focus on interannual timescales, potentially obscuring the differences in dynamic seasonal responses of GPP to meteorological variations. Here, a machine learning model to invert GPP in China's drylands using meteorological data including temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation from 2001 to 2020 was developed. The model was subsequently used to quantify the contributions of these meteorological factors to GPP trends and their regional variations. Results showed that declining solar radiation caused an average GPP decrease of 0.13 gC m−2 yr−1, whereas increased precipitation contributed to an average GPP increase of 0.11 gC m−2 yr−1, partially offsetting the radiation‐induced loss. Temperature effects were relatively minor due to seasonal compensations, with spring and autumn warming enhancing photosynthesis but summer warming suppressing vegetation growth. The combined effects of these three meteorological factors led to a slight decline of approximately 0.03 gC m−2 yr−1 in annual mean GPP across China's drylands. Spatially, GPP variations reflected the dominance of temperature in the Tibetan Plateau, precipitation in North China, and solar radiation in Northeast China. The Tibetan Plateau's low baseline temperature allowed warming to enhance GPP throughout the year. In Northeast China, the significant decline in solar radiation and the radiation sensitivity of forest canopies explained the observed GPP reduction. In North China, pronounced wetting trends established precipitation as the dominant controlling factor. These findings enhance our understanding of climate‐GPP relationships in dryland ecosystems."

The first leading mode reveals an in‐phase variation during spring‐summer, where a positive (negative) phase of the corresponding time series indicates consistent wetness (dryness) across both seasons. Further analysis demonstrates that soil moisture in spring over the Eastern Iranian Plateau (EIP) plays a crucial role in shaping this consistent mode. During spring, enhanced soil moisture over the EIP boosts local convective precipitation through positive soil moisture‐precipitation feedback. The anomalous diabatic heating, driven by increased precipitation, intensifies with altitude, triggering a mid‐upper tropospheric cyclone anomaly over the EIP. Therefore, the East Asian subtropical westerly jet strengthens and shifts southward during spring. Concurrently, an anomalous anticyclone dominates the lower troposphere over the Bay of Bengal, weakening the Southern Branch Trough and suppressing water vapor transport and precipitation over Yunnan and the Indochina Peninsula (ICP). These circulation anomalies contribute to spring dry conditions and reduced soil moisture over these regions. Persistently low soil moisture from spring to summer over Yunnan and the ICP favors an equivalent barotropic high‐pressure anomaly over the region, reinforcing westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high and eastward displacement of the South Asian high. This atmospheric configuration maintains dry conditions during summer in Yunnan. Analysis using the Linear Baroclinic Model further supports this physical mechanism."

However, while the selective chemical synthesis of molecules where the stereogenicity arises from a carbon atom is well-established, enantioselective approaches to nitrogen-stereogenic molecules are much less common,1-3 and in case of acyclic, N-stereogenic amines, even elusive, due to their rapid pyramidal inversion. We describe here the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of stable, acyclic N-stereogenic amines by the addition of enol silanes to nitronium ions that ion pair to a confined chiral anion. In the produced so-called anomeric amines, the commonly observed isomerization is slowed down by two N-oxy-substituents, which hamper nitrogen inversion. The critical stereogenicity creating step challenges previously established stereochemical descriptors of enantiodifferentiation. Computational studies provide additional insight into the origin of the observed stereocontrol.

 Neural representations of information are shaped by long-range input and local network interactions. Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity have focused on input-driven activity in the sensory cortex1–3. Here we studied neural activity in the motor cortex while mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behaviour does not require training, allowing us to probe neural coding and connectivity before activity is shaped by extended learning. Motor cortex neurons were tuned to target location and reward outcome, and typically responded during and after movements. We studied the underlying network interactions in vivo by estimating causal neural connections using an all-optical method3–6. Mapping connectivity between more than 20,000,000 excitatory neuron pairs showed a multi-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (less than 100 µm) like-to-like excitatory connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant sparsely connected neurons and rare densely connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target location and reward outcome but influenced more neighbouring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviours.

 Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing1,2 and prime editing3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases.

 Ribosome collisions activate the ribotoxic stress response mediated by the MAP3K ZAK, which in turn regulates cell-fate consequences through downstream phosphorylation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK1. Despite the critical role of ZAK during cellular stress, a mechanistic and structural understanding of ZAK–ribosome interactions and how these lead to activation remain elusive. Here we combine biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to discover distinct ZAK–ribosome interactions required for constitutive recruitment and for activation. We find that upon induction of ribosome collisions, interactions between ZAK and the ribosomal protein RACK1 enable its activation by dimerization of its SAM domains at the collision interface. Furthermore, we discover how this process is negatively regulated by the ribosome-binding protein SERBP1 to prevent constitutive ZAK activation. Characterization of novel SAM variants as well as a known pathogenic variant of the SAM domain of ZAK supports a key role of the SAM domain in regulating kinase activity on and off the ribosome, with some mutants bypassing the ribosome requirement for ZAK activation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic blueprint of the kinase activity of ZAK at the collided ribosome interface.

 Generative genomic models can design increasingly complex biological systems1. However, controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains challenging. Here, we show that Evo, a genomic language model, can leverage genomic context to perform function-guided design that accesses novel regions of sequence space. By learning semantic relationships across prokaryotic genes2, Evo enables a genomic ‘autocomplete’ in which a DNA prompt encoding genomic context for a function of interest guides the generation of novel sequences enriched for related functions, which we refer to as ‘semantic design’. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and type II and III toxin–antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant sequence similarity to natural proteins. In-context design of proteins and non-coding RNAs with Evo achieves robust activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural priors, known evolutionary conservation or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to complete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a database containing over 120 billion base pairs of artificial intelligence-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic design across many functions. More broadly, these results demonstrate that generative genomics with biological language models can extend beyond natural sequences.

 Neurons exhibit extraordinary precision in selecting synaptic partners. Although cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that mediate attractive interactions between developing axons and dendrites have been shown to instruct synaptic partner matching1,2, the degree to which repulsive interactions have a role is less clear. Here, using a genetic screen guided by single-cell transcriptomes3,4, we identified three CSP pairs, Toll2–Ptp10D, Fili–Kek1 and Hbs/Sns–Kirre, that mediate repulsive interactions between non-partner olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons and projection neuron (PN) dendrites in the developing Drosophila olfactory circuit. Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select ORN–PN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP. All CSP pairs are also differentially expressed in other brain regions. Together, our data reveal that multiple repulsive CSP pairs work together to ensure precise synaptic partner matching during development by preventing neurons from forming connections with non-cognate partners.

 Most human secretory pathway proteins are N-glycosylated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes as they enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1–3. Recent work revealed a substrate-assisted mechanism by which N-glycosylation of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is regulated to control cell surface receptor signalling4. Here we report the structure of a natively isolated GRP94 folding intermediate tethered to a specialized CCDC134-bound translocon. Together with functional analysis, the data reveal how a conserved N-terminal extension in GRP94 inhibits OST-A and how structural rearrangements within the translocon shield the tethered nascent chain from inappropriate OST-B glycosylation. These interactions depend on a hydrophobic CCDC134 groove, which recognizes a non-native conformation of nascent GRP94. Our results define a mechanism of regulated N-glycosylation and illustrate how the nascent chain remodels the translocon to facilitate its own biogenesis.

 Emerging evidence suggests a correlation between CD8+ T cell–tumour cell proximity and anti-tumour immune response1,2. However, it remains unclear whether these cells exist as functional clusters that can be isolated from clinical samples. Here, using conventional and imaging flow cytometry, we show that from 21 out of 21 human melanoma metastases, we could isolate heterotypic clusters, comprising CD8+ T cells interacting with one or more tumour cells and/or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that T cells from clusters were enriched for gene signatures associated with tumour reactivity and exhaustion. Clustered T cells exhibited increased TCR clonality indicative of expansion, whereas TCR-matched T cells showed more exhaustion and co-modulation when conjugated to APCs than when conjugated to tumour cells. T cells that were expanded from clusters ex vivo exerted on average ninefold increased killing activity towards autologous melanomas, which was accompanied by enhanced cytokine production. After adoptive cell transfer into mice, T cells from clusters showed improved patient-derived melanoma control, which was associated with increased T cell infiltration and activation. Together, these results demonstrate that tumour-reactive CD8+ T cells are enriched in functional clusters with tumour cells and/or APCs and that they can be isolated and expanded from clinical samples. Typically excluded by single-cell gating in flow cytometry, these distinct heterotypic T cell clusters are a valuable source to decipher functional tumour–immune cell interactions and may also be therapeutically explored.

 Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behaviour1–4. Before volitional movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets5–12. This activity in the cortico-basal ganglia loop may function as an adjustable ‘timer,’ triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviours, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. Here, to address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a flexible lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. These findings are consistent with a model in which the striatum is part of a network that temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex and generates ramping activity that regulates motor timing. How the mouse frontal cortex and striatum interact to implement integrator dynamics controlling movement timing is explored."

 Oncogenic mutations in phenotypically normal tissue are common across adult organs1,2. This suggests that multiple events need to converge to drive tumorigenesis and that many processes such as tissue differentiation may protect against carcinogenesis. WNT–β-catenin signalling maintains zonal differentiation during liver homeostasis3,4. However, the CTNNB1 oncogene—encoding β-catenin—is also frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in aberrant WNT signalling that promotes cell growth5,6. Here we investigated the antagonistic interplay between WNT-driven growth and differentiation in zonal hepatocyte populations during liver tumorigenesis. We found that β-catenin mutations co-operate with exogenous MYC expression to drive a proliferative translatome. Differentiation of hepatocytes to an extreme zone 3 fate suppressed this proliferative translatome. Furthermore, a GLUL and Lgr5-positive perivenous subpopulation of zone 3 hepatocytes were refractory to WNT-induced and MYC-induced tumorigenesis. However, when mutant CTNNB1 and MYC alleles were activated sporadically across the liver lobule, a subset of mutant hepatocytes became proliferative and tumorigenic. These early lesions were characterized by reduced WNT pathway activation and elevated MAPK signalling, which suppresses zone 3 differentiation. The proliferative lesions were also dependent on IGFBP2–mTOR–cyclin D1 pathway signalling, in which inhibition of either IGFBP2 or mTOR suppressed proliferation and tumorigenesis.

 Lanthanide nanocrystals offer unique advantages for electroluminescence (EL) applications, including narrow-band emission, high colour purity and compositionally tunable output1–4. However, their insulating nature poses a challenge for carrier transport and injection, impeding their application in electrically driven optoelectronic devices5. Here we demonstrate efficient EL from insulating lanthanide fluoride nanocrystals (4 nm; NaGdF4:X; X = Tb3+, Eu3+ or Nd3+) coated with a series of functionalized 2-(diphenylphosphoryl)benzoic acids (ArPPOA). These ligands, featuring donor–phosphine oxide acceptor hybrids with carboxyl and P=O coordination sites, effectively sensitize the luminescence of lanthanide nanocrystals by modulating the intraligand charge transfer characteristics. Ultrafast spectroscopic investigations reveal that strong coupling between ArPPOA and lanthanide nanocrystals facilitates intersystem crossing (ISC; <1 ns) and highly efficient triplet energy transfer to nanocrystals (up to 96.7%). Through careful control of dopant composition and concentration in nanocrystals, we also achieve wide-ranging multicolour EL without altering the device architecture, reaching an external quantum efficiency exceeding 5.9% for Tb3+. This ligand-functionalized nanocrystal platform provides a modular strategy for exciton control in insulating nanocrystal systems, offering a pathway for spectrally precise electroluminescent materials.

 Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets1,2, it remains mostly unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit3,4 to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male–male courtship, we switched its connection nearly completely from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type to a new PN type that promotes courtship. From this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attraction between synaptic partners and repulsion between non-partners5,6. The anatomical switch changed the odour response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male–male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring—increasing repulsion with the old partner, decreasing repulsion with the new partner and matching attraction with the new partner—to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work shows that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving the way to investigations of how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity. In Drosophila, changing the expression of a small set of cell-surface proteins in just one type of olfactory neuron rewires its connections almost entirely to a new postsynaptic partner neuron type, altering the fly’s odour response and courtship behaviour."

 Insulating nanomaterials have large energy gaps and are only electrically accessible under extreme conditions, such as high-intensity radiation and high temperature, pressure or voltage1,2. Lanthanide-doped insulating nanoparticles (LnNPs) are widely studied owing to their exceptional luminescence properties, including bright, narrow-linewidth, non-blinking and non-bleaching emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) range3,4. However, it has not been possible to electrically generate excited states in these insulating nanomaterials under low biases and, therefore, not possible to fabricate optoelectronic devices from these systems. Here we report an electrical excitation pathway to obtain emission from LnNPs. By forming LnNP@organic molecule nanohybrids, in which the recombination of electrically injected charges on the organic molecule is followed by efficient triplet energy transfer (TET) to the LnNP, it is possible to turn on LnNPs under a low operating bias. We demonstrate this excitation pathway in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with low turn-on voltages of about 5 V, very narrow electroluminescence (EL) spectra and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) greater than 0.6% in the NIR-II window5. Our LnNP-based LEDs (LnLEDs) also allow for widely tunable EL properties, by changing the type and concentration of lanthanide dopants. These results open up a new field of hybrid optoelectronic devices and provide new opportunities for the electrically driven excitation sources based on lanthanide nanomaterials for biomedical and optoelectronic applications.

 Non-invasive skin permeation is widely used for convenient transdermal delivery of small-molecule therapeutics (less than 500 Da) with appropriate hydrophobicities1. However, it has long been deemed infeasible for large molecules—particularly polymers, proteins and peptides2,3—due to the formidable barrier posed by the skin structure. Here we show that the fast skin-permeable polyzwitterion poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OP) can efficiently penetrate the stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis into circulation. OP is protonated to be cationic and is therefore enriched in the acidic sebum and paracellular stratum corneum lipids containing fatty acids, and subsequently diffuses through the intercorneocyte lipid lamella. Beneath the stratum corneum, at the normal physiological pH, OP becomes a neutral polyzwitterion, ‘hopping’ on cell membranes, enabling its efficient migration through the epidermis and dermis and ultimately entering dermal lymphatic vessels and systemic circulation. As a result, OP-conjugated insulin efficiently permeates through the skin into the blood circulation; transdermal administration of OP-conjugated insulin at a dose of 116 U kg−1 into mice with type 1 diabetes quickly lowers their blood glucose levels to the normal range, and a transdermal dose of 29 U kg−1 normalizes the blood glucose levels of diabetic minipigs. Thus, the skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin, relieving patients with diabetes from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery.

 Most superconducting materials are well understood and conventional—that is, the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductors1. Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of d-wave symmetry. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi2 harbours nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional i-wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below 10 K, the superconductivity in PtBi2 gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, whereas its bulk states remain normal2. The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the centre of the Fermi arcs and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This establishes PtBi2 surfaces not only as unconventional, topological i-wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.

 During the past decade, our understanding of eukaryotic evolution has increased immensely. Newly recognized eukaryotic supergroups have been established1–3, and most enigmatic orphan lineages have had their relationships resolved4–6. Studies on unicellular protist eukaryotes have also been key to understanding the evolution of mitochondria, the fundamental organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which originated from an alphaproteobacterial ancestor. The retention of ancestral alphaproteobacterial pathways in some protist lineages reveals that the mitochondrion of the last eukaryotic common ancestor was more metabolically versatile than are the highly derived mitochondria that are found in most modern eukaryotes7,8. Here we report the discovery of such a unicellular eukaryote, Solarion arienae gen. et sp. nov., an inconspicuous, free-living heterotrophic protist with two morphologically distinct cell types and a novel type of predatory extrusome. We assign Solarion to the new phylum Caelestes. Together with Provora, hemimastigophoreans and Meteora, they form a new eukaryotic supergroup, Disparia.

 Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent and devastating form of oncogene amplification in cancer1,2. Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres, stochastically segregate during cell division3–6 and persist over many generations. It has been more than 40 years since ecDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear3,7. Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. Using Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that we developed, we reveal thousands of human retention elements that confer generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions that are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins. This activity intermolecularly recapitulates promoter–enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated. Targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, which suggests that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, and reveal the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.

 All spoken languages are produced by the human vocal tract, which defines the limited set of possible speech sounds. Despite this constraint, however, there exists incredible diversity in the world’s 7,000 spoken languages, each of which is learned through extensive experience hearing speech in language-specific contexts1. It remains unknown which elements of speech processing in the brain depend on daily language experience and which do not. In this study, we recorded high-density cortical activity from adult participants with diverse language backgrounds as they listened to speech in their native language and an unfamiliar foreign language. We found that, regardless of language experience, both native and foreign languages elicited similar cortical responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), associated with shared acoustic–phonetic processing of foundational speech sound features2,3, such as vowels and consonants. However, only during native language listening did we observe enhanced neural encoding in the STG for word boundaries, word frequency and language-specific sound sequence statistics. In a separate cohort of bilingual participants, this encoding of word- and sequence-level information appeared for both familiar languages in the same individual and in the same STG neural populations. These results indicate that experience-dependent language processing involves dynamic integration of both shared acoustic–phonetic and language-specific sequence- and word-level information in the STG.

Here, the authors present a coupled strategy that combines PDH with the reverse water–gas shift reaction through a tandem catalytic system. 
 The integration of CO2 into the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) holds significant promise for both propylene production and greenhouse gas utilization. However, a pivotal challenge lies in mitigating the undesirable dry reforming of propane (DRP), which diminishes propylene selectivity compared to direct PDH processes. Herein, we describe a coupled process that integrates PDH with reverse water gas shift (RWGS) using a tandem catalytic system. The PtSn/Al2O3 analogue performs the dehydrogenation reaction, while an adjacent defective CeOx/Al2O3 at nanoscale acts as the hydrogenation sites for CO2. Catalysis and kinetic studies demonstrate the in-situ removal of hydrogen from PtSn/Al2O3 to adjacent CeOx/Al2O3, facilitated by CO2, shifts the quasi-equilibrium of PDH towards propylene production, while suppressing the competitive DRP side reaction. This hydrogen spillover-mediated coupling mechanism enables superior propylene selectivity of ~98.8%, along with high CO2 (~43.9%) and propane conversion (~44.2%) at 550 °C, outperforming direct PDH (~40.6%). Analysis of CO2 footprint indicates the PDH-RWGS tandem process has the potential for carbon utilization to mitigate detrimental CO2 emissions.

 Engineering the topological properties of the system has been a longstanding subject in physics. Here, we propose a scheme to simulate topological materials with a non-Abelian gauge field in synthetic space-frequency dimensions where the symmetry between spin-flipped hoppings can be levitated by using coupled photonic molecules under dynamic modulations. The frequency-split supermodes in these photonic molecules can serve the pseudospin degree of freedom, which can further be connected along the frequency axis in an independent way, offering the unique opportunity to explore topological physics with imbalanced spin-flipped hoppings leading to a complex generalization of the conventional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge field, i.e., an SL

This cryptic conformation is shaped by increased mannosidic glycosylation and furin cleavage shielding conformational epitopes enable virus to persist in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. 
 SARS-CoV-2 Spike - the sole neutralization target, is highly resilient to the immune pressure driving genetic evolution. While potency and breadth of neutralization are widely studied, the incomplete neutralization - the mechanism of resistance without needing genetic change - remains unexplored. Several monoclonal antibodies, although potent, showed incomplete neutralization of genetically homogeneous pseudovirus suggesting the existence of distinct spike conformations. The residual infectivity at high antibody concentration indicates a viral fraction with intrinsic resistance to the antibody. Although the published studies on spike glycosylation, structure, and conformations provide evidence of spike heterogeneity the precise mechanism for the incomplete neutralization has not been established. In this study, we devise a method to separate the un-neutralized virion population, called as persistent fraction of infectivity (PF), and characterize the viral spike protein. The neutralization resistance of PF is stable and unrelated to the conformational equilibrium that exists in the pseudovirus stock. The spike on the PF is highly cleaved between S1 and S2, adopts the closed conformation, and express more mannosidic glycans on RBD than the total virus population. Our study provides possible explanations for the incomplete neutralization by antibodies and delineates the association between furin cleavage of spike, its conformation and glycosylation.

 Different types of violence are commonly linked with large urban areas, often presumed to scale superlinearly with population size (i.e., to be disproportionately higher in larger cities). This study explores the hypothesis that smaller, isolated cities in Africa may experience a heightened intensity of violence against civilians. It aims to investigate the correlation between the risk of experiencing violence, a city’s size and its geographical isolation. Between 2000 and 2023, incidents of civilian casualties were analysed to assess lethality in relation to varying levels of isolation and city size. African cities are categorised by isolation (measured by the number of highway connections) and centrality (the estimated frequency of journeys). We show that violence against civilians exhibits a sublinear pattern, with larger cities witnessing fewer events and casualties per 100,000 inhabitants. Individuals in isolated cities face a fourfold higher risk of becoming casualties compared with those in more connected cities.

 The mammalian brain comprises a vast number of neurons, exhibiting remarkable diversity in both molecular composition and spatial distribution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these neurons are organized within the brain remains elusive, largely due to the lack of systematic studies providing three-dimensional coverage of molecularly defined neurons across the entire brain. In this study, we utilized transgenic mice and fMOST imaging to map the spatial distribution of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and modulatory neurons at the single-cell level throughout the whole brain. Our approach enabled precise registration of individual cells to the standardized brain coordinate framework, facilitating the construction of whole-brain cell atlases for commonly used Cre recombinase driver lines. Analysis revealed diverse cellular composition patterns across the brain, aligning with the boundaries of known brain regions in some areas while uncovering previously uncharacterized subdivisions in others. Notably, cortical and subcortical nuclei as small as approximately one millimeter in size exhibited intricate three-dimensional organization, suggesting the presence of finer functional zones.

 Endometrial regeneration is essential for reproductive cycles and pregnancies, allowing the endometrium to undergo estrogen-driven repair, growth, and renewal after menstruation and parturition. Epithelial cells lining the uterine cavity undergo apoptosis during estrous cycles, and remnant cells can quickly restore this lining through a process known as re-epithelialization. It is presumed that adult stem/progenitor cells in the uterine stroma also contribute to re-epithelialization. However, the specific cell type(s) and the underlying mechanisms have not been determined. Herein, we use genetic lineage tracing assays in mice to identify Nestin+ perivascular cells as active contributors to re-epithelialization. Notch signaling maintains Nestin+ perivascular cells in a quiescent state, but these cells re-enter the cell cycle and differentiate into epithelial cells via estrogen-stimulated suppression of Notch signaling dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1). These findings demonstrate that perivascular cells support re-epithelialization and reveal a mechanism regulating the quiescence and activation of uterine perivascular cells.

 A growing number of compounds are reported to extend lifespan, but it remains unclear whether they reduce mortality across the entire life course or only at specific ages. This uncertainty persists because the commonly used log-rank test cannot detect age-specific effects. Here, we introduce a new analytical method that addresses this limitation by revealing when, how long, and to what extent interventions alter mortality risk. Applied to survival data from 42 compounds tested in mice by the National Institute on Aging Interventions Testing Program, it identified 22 that reduced mortality at certain ages, more than detected by the log-rank test, while 15 increased mortality at certain ages. Most compounds were effective only within restricted age ranges; just 8 reduced mortality late in life, when burdens of aging are greatest. Compared to conventional methods, this approach uncovers more beneficial and harmful effects, offers deeper insight into timing and mechanism, and can guide development of future anti-aging therapies.

 In vivo characterization of protein structures and structural changes after perturbation is still a major challenge and has impacted our understanding of the molecular events involved in protein misfolding diseases. To identify the true conformational space occupied by proteins in their native state in vivo, we recently developed a structural proteomics method named Covalent Protein Painting (CPP). Here, we show how CPP can be used to identify and quantify the conformational defects of proteins in the misfolding disease Cystic Fibrosis. We first report the discovery of a previously unreported opening mechanism for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) as well as its conformational changes during biogenesis. Then we further reveal how misfolding of different CFTR variants in Cystic Fibrosis disturbs these conformational changes even upon treatment with current approved drugs and suggest possibilities to stabilize misfolded CFTR variants not or less responsive to these drugs such as N1303K CFTR. Protein misfolding drives many diseases, but detecting and characterizing misfolding in living cells remains challenging.

 Previous studies have primarily examined the impacts of tropical North Atlantic or uniform extratropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) on El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, how the dominant tripole SSTAs mode in the North Atlantic and its three individual components influence interannual ENSO evolution remains poorly understood. In this study, observational analyses reveal a significant connection between the winter–spring North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode and ENSO development in the following autumn–winter. Model simulations demonstrate that a positive winter–spring North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode (negative-positive-negative) results in spring westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific through both tropical and mid-latitude pathways, ultimately contributing to an autumn–winter El Niño event. The tropical pathway triggers a westward Gill-type Rossby wave to induce the westerly wind anomalies. The mid-latitude pathway generates an eastward Rossby wave train that induces the westerly wind anomalies by modulating both tropical Indo-Pacific zonal-vertical circulations and North Pacific air-sea interactions. Further model analysis reveals that the relative contributions of tropical, mid-latitude, and high-latitude SSTAs of the North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode to El Niño formation are approximately 43%, 34%, and 23%, respectively. The tropical SSTAs contribute to an El Niño event through both tropical and mid-latitude pathways, while mid-latitude and high-latitude SSTAs exert their influence exclusively via the mid-latitude pathway. This study can advance current theories on the North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode in driving ENSO variability."

 The Lower Mekong River Basin faces growing challenges in deploying variable renewable energy under intensifying hydroclimatic extremes. To evaluate these impacts, we develop an integrated modeling framework that links an energy expansion model with a synthetic streamflow generator. The results indicate that severe extended periods of low flows (10,000-year events) reduce hydropower output by 24.3 ± 8.7 terawatt-hour (−13.7% ± 4.9%), increasing wind capacity requirements by 10.6 ± 12.5 gigawatts (1.15% ± 1.36%) and raising system-wide costs by 8.7 ± 3.2 billion U.S. dollars. Conversely, extended periods of high flows of similar severity boost hydropower generation by 23.3 ± 9.2 terawatt-hours (+ 13.1% ± 5.2%), decreasing wind capacity needs by 9.3 ± 11.7 gigawatts (1.02% ± 1.27%) and lowering system costs by 7.8 ± 3.0 billion U.S. dollars. Prolonged drought conditions accelerate wind development to sustain decarbonization, while surplus flows from floods may delay investment—introducing long-term uncertainty for energy system resilience. These findings underscore the need for proactive, region-specific strategies to ensure resilient and sustainable energy transitions under intensifying hydroclimatic extremes.

Combining observations and numerical model simulations, we show that amplified High Mountain Asia warming has substantially enhanced summer synoptic temperature variability (>21%) in Canada and Russia while reducing winter variability (>19%) in Eastern Europe and the Nordic Seas during 1940–2022. These changes are primarily driven by altered high-frequency temperature advection. High Mountain Asia warming modifies horizontal temperature gradients, strengthening them in Canada and Russia in summer but weakening them in the Nordic Seas and Eastern Europe in winter. These patterns arise from hemispheric teleconnections that redistribute temperature and modulate atmospheric circulation stability via changes in jet streams, Rossby waves, and air-sea interactions. Our findings highlight High Mountain Asia warming’s far-reaching impacts on Northern Hemisphere weather variability, extending beyond its well-known local climate effects.

 Seismic velocity variations before and after major earthquakes, measured with ambient noise interferometry, reveal time-dependent changes in subsurface properties, but the physical mechanism that causes them remains difficult to identify. Using noise interferometry, we observed a 0.5–1.3% velocity reduction within the upper-crust where the Mw 6.2 Northern Nagano earthquake rupture reached the surface. We combined the inverted 2D image with depth sensitivity to reconstruct the distribution of velocity changes in the shallow crust and show its correlation with the surface rupture and high-slip zones. Our results suggest that the main cause of velocity drop in the first kilometers of depth is damage induced by the mainshock rupture. Both fault-zone damage and near-surface damage from strong ground-shaking are involved, supported by the spatial correlation of velocity perturbations with peak ground acceleration and coseismic slip. These findings highlight fault zone weakening and shaking-induced damage as key drivers of post-earthquake velocity variations.

 Biological nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs is vital for nitrogen supply and marine productivity. Despite extensive documentation of diverse diazotrophs, their functional diversity and adaptive strategies across ecosystems remain largely underexplored. Here, we analyzed 561 metagenomes from 16 distinct marine environments to characterize the distribution, functional diversity, and ecological adaptations of marine diazotrophs on a global scale. Our results reveal a high relative abundance of diazotrophs in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, underscoring their roles in biogeochemical processes of these ecosystems. Analysis of 167 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 22 phyla revealed considerable metabolic versatility among diazotrophs, along with habitat-specific functional adaptations that facilitate their survival in diverse marine environments. For example, diazotrophs in the coastal area have adapted to utilize readily available energy sources such as starch and sucrose, while those in the open ocean have developed mechanisms to degrade refractory organic matter. In the chemosynthetic ecosystem, diazotrophs closely associate with methane and sulfur metabolism, demonstrating their capacity to thrive in extreme environments. Diazotrophs affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria and Desulfobulbia were found to be ubiquitous in aerobic and anaerobic environments, respectively. This study sheds light on the ecological significance and adaptive mechanisms of diazotrophs across diverse marine ecosystems.

 Ancient trees are vital evolutionary resources for ecosystems in a changing world. Although being fundamental anchors of many natural processes, the causes leading to their extreme longevity are still partly unknown. Here, we aim to unveil how specific habitat features and selective pressures influence functional traits of long-living trees that support extreme tree age. During the period 2022-2024, we monitored 13 forests covering the entire age range of mountain pine and silver fir in the Pyrenees. Results reveal that extreme tree longevity requires the prevalence of complex habitat structures settled over millennia. Lifespan is limited in forests with common and homogeneous habitat attributes, preventing the maximum attainable lifespan of trees to occur. In longevity hotspots, however, some functional traits deployed in response to specific habitat features and evolutionary pressures lengthen longevity for several centuries. Our findings revitalise the idea of extreme tree longevity as a fundamental spatiotemporal process that depends on habitat structure. Moreover, we show that current maximum attainable lifespan has been reduced in most forests due to habitat alteration.

 Legumes play a crucial role in nitrogen cycling; however, it is unclear how this effect is related to soil organic carbon dynamics in grassland across climatic gradients. Here, we investigate how legumes affect soil nitrogen levels and thus microbial necromass accumulation across a 2500 km climatic gradient, using nitrogen-fixing Caragana shrubs as indictors for legumes. We show that microbial necromass and its contribution to organic carbon were markedly lower in warm-arid than in cold-humid grasslands, associated with lower soil nitrogen availability in arid environments. The impacts of legumes on increasing soil nitrogen availability in warm-arid grasslands were greater than in cold-humid regions. This led to a 64–112% increase in microbial necromass under legumes relative to non-legumes in warm-arid regions, whereas a 6–29% increases in cold-humid regions, contributing to more pronounced soil carbon gains under legumes in arid areas. Our findings indicated microbial necromass as a key mediator linking legume-driven nitrogen enrichment to soil carbon storage.

 Sea ice type information is important for climate change research and human activities in polar regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly from the Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, has become a key source for high-resolution sea ice mapping. With the growing volume of S1 SAR data, deep learning (DL) methods have been explored for sea ice classification. However, the limited availability of fine labels and overlapping backscatter intensity among ice types remain major obstacles to achieving automated fine-scale sea ice classification across the pan-Arctic region. This paper proposes a model, named IceDeepLab, for the automatic mapping of sea ice type across the pan-Arctic region in winter using S1 dual-polarized SAR images, based on the Deep Learning framework DeepLabv3+. The IceDeepLab can identify open water, young ice, first-year ice and old ice, generating pixel-wise classification maps at 400 m resolution. A sea ice type dataset, comprising 174 finely labelled S1 images from November 2019 to March 2020 and covering the pan-Arctic region with diverse sea ice conditions, is established for model training and validation. In particular, radar incidence angle is included as an input to mitigate its effects on HH-polarized SAR data. The model integrates the spatially optimised ConvNeXt backbone, the newly proposed Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and tailored training and inference schemes. These designs make it more suitable for processing whole SAR images, effectively reducing ambiguity between different sea ice types and eliminating stitching lines, thereby improving overall performance. Experiments on the test dataset show that IceDeepLab achieves an overall accuracy of 91.9%, a mean intersection over union of 82.3%, and a mean F1-score of 90.2%, significantly outperforming the traditional DeepLabv3+ by 16.0%, 10.0%, and 11.1%, respectively. When applied to 4153 S1 images collected from November 2020 to March 2021, IceDeepLab maintains over 90% agreement with operational ice charts in the pan-Arctic region, demonstrating the model's robustness across different years. Ablation experiments, feature visualizations, and statistical analyses further validate the model's effectiveness and offer insights for future improvements in sea ice classification algorithms. Furthermore, evaluations using both the radiometer-derived sea ice concentration product and a year-round ice type dataset are conducted to explore its potential for broader applications in operational sea ice monitoring."

 Irrigation is the major consumer of freshwater resources on Earth and represents the largest human intervention in the water cycle. Most irrigation modeling frameworks rely on simplified assumptions regarding the timing of irrigation that result in significant error in the irrigation water use estimation. In this study, we developed a generalized data-driven approach for estimating these irrigation timing attributes using a change point detection algorithm applied to thermal remote sensing data. Land surface temperature at cropland pixels was compared with hydrologically similar natural land cover pixels nearby to extract irrigation attributes. The approach was evaluated over two areas: Nebraska (NEB) and Mahabad, Iran (MAH), for which we had the in situ irrigation data. The method detected the start and end of the irrigation season with reasonable accuracy, exhibiting errors of 18 % and 15 % in estimating the duration of season, in NEB and MAH respectively. The cloud cover either at the start or the end of season was the primary source of error in both cases. Irrigation event detection accuracy across 10 NEB sites yielded F1-scores (Precision & recall combined score) of 0.59–0.74, varying with change point detection algorithm parameters. To optimize these parameters, extensive hyperparameter tuning was performed, leading to specific suggestions tailored for different irrigation practices. The results presented here demonstrate that the LST-based approach can be effective in characterizing interannual variations in irrigation timing attributes."

 Pre-monsoon season (March–April–May, MAM) constitutes the primary heat season across the Indian Peninsula (0°–40°N, 60°–100°E), marked by frequent occurrences of extreme surface air temperature (SAT) events. These extreme heat conditions not only impact regional climate but may also propagate remotely to East Asia via atmospheric teleconnections. Despite their significance, the monthly evolution of SAT over the Indian Peninsula and its governing mechanisms remain inadequately quantified. This study investigates the monthly variability of pre-monsoon SAT over the Indian Peninsula during the period 1970–2024, emphasizing synergistic roles of internal atmospheric dynamics and sea surface temperature (SST) forcing. Results show that SAT anomalies in March and April exhibit a spatially coherent pattern across the the peninsula, associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), respectively. Notably, April SAT anomalies are further modulated by SST anomalies south of Greenland through wave-mean flow interactions. In contrast, May SAT anomalies display a distinct east–west dipole pattern, characterized by opposing SAT anomalies between northwestern (22°–40°N, 60°–82°E) and eastern (10°–30°N, 82°–100°E) peninsula sectors. The May dipole arises from a “Z-shaped” SST anomaly pattern in the eastern Pacific, which initiates a Rossby wave train. During its propagation across Greenland, this wave train undergoes amplification via air–sea coupling with local SST anomalies, ultimately intensifying downstream impacts on the Indian Peninsula."

McCoy;Sunil Baidar;Paquita Zuidema;Jan Kazil;W. Alan Brewer;Wayne M. Angevine;Graham Feingold,Increased dynamic efficiency in mesoscale organized trade wind cumulus clouds,"We use ship observations to investigate the dynamics of small clouds over the tropical oceans. When these cumulus clouds cluster together, they more efficiently move moisture into the cloud layer due to strengthened updrafts. This encourages further clustering, increases local cloud development success, and may help sustain clouds against diurnal variations in their environment. These results have implications for cumulus feedback on the climate, a significant uncertainty in future projections. 
 Mesoscale organization of boundary layer clouds modulates their radiative properties and contributes to the tropical hydrologic cycle. Trade wind cumuli (Cu) have varying organization and are a source of uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs). The linkage between Cu development and dynamics is difficult to capture, impacting low cloud feedback estimates. We investigate the relationship between mesoscale organization and Cu updraft dynamics in their early development stages using wintertime shipborne observations. We contrast two periods with similar cloud sizes but more (MO) and less (LO) organized states. MO clouds are dynamically more efficient than LO clouds: for a given core size, MO clouds have stronger sub-cloud and cloud-base updrafts, implying greater vertical moisture transport. Despite similar background plume behaviors, cloud-topped plumes are wider and more frequently successful for MO than LO. Updraft strength is persistent despite diurnal environmental variations. MO turbulence is enhanced by early-morning surface flux maximization and LO updrafts may be assisted by daytime environmental conditions. MO cloud amount persists, while LO clouds suffer daytime depredations. We hypothesize that, once established, MO clouds are maintained through the assistance of cloud-layer-driven mesoscale circulations that increase dynamic efficiency through reinforcing plumes and their updrafts. Dynamic efficiency is likely a key contributor to the moisture–convection feedback critical to mesoscale organization. Organizational modulation of cloud dynamics through enhancing updrafts is another unresolved factor in GCM parameterizations. Understanding this efficiency, and the potential environmental resilience of MO clouds, will be informative for simulating Cu behaviors under current and future climates."

This approach captures the character of the tropopause remarkably well, both in individual vertical profiles and in long-term averages, providing a consistent and physically meaningful representation of the transition between the troposphere and the stratosphere. 
 The tropopause represents a central feature of the atmospheric vertical structure, marking the transition between the troposphere and stratosphere. While common definitions rely on quantities conserved under adiabatic changes, diabatic effects, resulting from radiation, cloud processes or turbulence are also decisive for the tropopause structure. Therefore, we propose a new definition based on the vertical gradient of the relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi). RHi is the key variable for ice cloud formation and incorporates both diabatic and adiabatic processes. Based on high-resolution radiosonde data, we can show that our RHi-GT-based definition is generally consistent with, and often provides a clearer characterization than the thermal tropopause. This is not only evident in individual vertical profiles, but also when looking at statistics of many profiles with a tropopause-relative height axis. Last but not least, the robust and simple calculation of our definition makes it an ideal tool for studies involving the tropopause."

Urban OA was enriched in aromatic species, while seaside OA featured aliphatic and highly oxidized compounds. Marine-derived humid air masses promoted aqueous/heterogeneous phase OA formation, leading to a higher oxidation state. 
 Organic aerosol (OA), as a key component of particulate matter, exerts significant impacts on public health and the environment. However, understanding of molecular characterization of OA under diverse environments remains limited. This study employed offline FIGAERO-I-CIMS (Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols coupled with iodide-adduct Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry) to analyze the molecular composition of OA in PM2.5 samples collected from a coastal city (urban and seaside sites) in Southeast China during spring 2024. A total of 737 and 768 CHOX compounds were identified at the urban and seaside sites, respectively. CHO compounds dominated in signal intensity (>70 %) at both sites, while CHON were more abundant at the urban site and S-containing compounds at the seaside site. The weighted effective oxygen to carbon content (Oeff/C) ratios (urban 0.82, seaside 0.85) indicated the highly oxidized nature of coastal compounds. Seaside CHOX exhibited lower unsaturation, reduced aromaticity, and higher oxidation states. Categorization showed that urban OA was more influenced by aromatic compounds, whereas seaside OA contained higher proportions of aged aliphatic compounds. Two distinct pollution episodes were selected to investigate CHOX evolution. Case 1 (local accumulation) exhibited enhanced CHON signals attributable to increased organonitrate formation under elevated NOx levels, whereas Case 2 (marine air masses) showed enhanced CHO signals and a higher CHOX oxidation state likely resulting from intensified aqueous/heterogeneous reactions under humid conditions.

 We present a novel, fine-resolution temperature profiling method based on Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) that is adaptable, reproducible, and fully FAIR. Accurate probing of near-surface temperature gradients requires sub-centimeter resolution, particularly in environments with short vegetation such as grass, where strong insulating properties promote steep gradients. Conventional DTS systems provide spatial resolutions of approximately 25 cm along fiber optic cables that can span several kilometers. By compacting such cables into a helical coil supported by a laser-cut frame, the Fine Resolution Adaptable Distributed Temperature Sensing (FRADTS) method attains vertical resolution and accuracy at the millimeter scale. The frame design is generated by a parametric script that outputs laser-cutting files, enabling users to assemble coil structures from sheet material with identical or easily adapted geometries. We demonstrate the method in both laboratory tests and a field campaign at the CESAR atmospheric observatory in Cabauw, the Netherlands, where a prototype coil captured high-quality vertical temperature profiles within the lowest meter above the soil, including a 10 cm grass layer. A resolution of 1.3 mm was attained and verified, and the influence of environmental factors such as solar radiation and precipitation on measurement biases was mapped and quantified. Despite minor artifacts, the method proved robust and effective, providing high-quality profiles under a wide range of weather conditions. As the method is modular and parametric, it can easily be applied in other research, potentially extending its application to other fields."

This detailed FT record provides valuable information to enhance the understanding of global hydrological and ecological impacts. 
 The global near-surface soil freeze-thaw (FT) states are crucial for understanding complex interactions with hydrological, ecological, and climatic processes. However, current remote sensing of FT states primarily relies on passive microwave remote sensing, which, despite its all-weather monitoring capabilities, suffers from low spatial resolution. This limitation restricts its application to hydroclimatological scales, precluding its use in finer-scale studies such as soil erosion and hydrometeorological applications. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel downscaling approach that integrates passive microwave and optical satellite data to generate a long-term (2002–2023), high-resolution (0.05°) dataset of global near-surface FT states, ensuring daily seamless continuity. The dataset was validated against in situ measurements, demonstrating that the high-resolution product maintains an overall accuracy of 83.78 %, consistent with the coarse-resolution microwave-based dataset, while offering enhanced spatial detail. Comprehensive global trend analyses provided new insights into the dynamics of FT cycles, revealing that the average annual number of frost days in regions north of 45° N is 187.8 ± 12.7 d, with 14.35 % of the area showing a decreasing trend in frozen persistence. Additionally, the average annual number of freeze onset dates is 240.3 ± 7.2, and 9.10 % of the area exhibits a trend of delayed freeze onset. The high-resolution record enables accurately monitoring FT states and providing detailed information for a refined understanding of hydrological and ecological effects globally.

Salinity increased significantly in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset can contribute to research on salinization prevention and salinity budget research. 
 Lake salinity is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes and a fundamental indicator to evaluate lake water quality. However, its estimation in inland waters has been challenging because passive microwave salinity satellites lack sufficient spatial resolution, and optical satellites cannot directly measure it. To address it, we constructed a framework for estimating lake salinity by combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. It can be summarized in step 1: construct a salinity mechanism model based on SAR data using the Elfouhaily spectrum, dielectric constant, and small perturbation method (SPM) models; step 2: develop four machine learning (ML) salinity algorithms using quasi-synchronous salinity and MSI with SAR imagery; and step 3: build an ensemble model to estimate salinity by coupling the mechanism and ML models via a generalized additive model. The proposed integrated algorithm (N = 84, RMSE = 0.60 ppt, and MAPE = 2.3 %) outperformed single-satellite microwave mechanistic or ML models across all eleven lakes in the Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Lake zone. On this basis, we reconstructed the lake salinity dataset for 2016–2024 and conducted independent validation (N = 65, R2 = 0.97, and RMSE = 0.89 ppt) and pixel-level histogram validation confirmed dataset quality, with no significant systematic bias across lake types. The reconstruction revealed a spatial pattern of smooth transition from the nearshore to the center and trends with significant increases in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset and its development framework will facilitate exploration of salinity status and trends in inland lakes, providing scientific evidence and methodological support for salinization prevention and global lake salinity budget research.

We propose novel autoencoder models to automatically extract features and compare them with engineered seismic features. These features are then used to classify avalanches and noise events. The autoencoder feature classifiers exhibit the highest sensitivity in detecting avalanches, while the engineered seismic classifier performs better overall. 
 Monitoring snow avalanche activity is essential for operational avalanche forecasting and the successful implementation of mitigation measures to ensure safety in mountain regions. To facilitate and automate the monitoring process, avalanche detection systems equipped with seismic sensors can provide a cost-effective solution. Still, automatically distinguishing avalanche signals from other sources in seismic data remains challenging. This is mainly due to the complexity of seismic signals generated by avalanches, the complex signal transmission through the ground, the relatively rare occurrence of avalanches, and the presence of multiple sources in seismic data. To study and interpret the variety of these signals, we compiled a dataset of seismograms recorded with an array of five seismometers installed in an avalanche study site above Davos, Switzerland. For the winter seasons of 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, this dataset comprised 84 avalanches and 828 noise (unrelated to avalanches) events. An approach to automate the detection of avalanches in seismic data is by applying machine learning methods. So far, research in this area has mainly focused on extracting domain-specific signal attributes as input features for statistical models. In contrast, we propose a novel application of representation learning from seismograms using autoencoder models to automatically extract features from 10 s seismic signals of snow avalanches. On top of that, we applied random forest classifiers to evaluate whether these features facilitate the detection of avalanches. Concretely, we trained one random forest classifier each on a set of expert-engineered seismic attributes (baseline), temporal autoencoder features and spectral autoencoder features. The classifiers achieved an avalanche recall of 0.67 (±0.00) (baseline), 0.71 (±0.02) (temporal autoencoder) and 0.70 (±0.01) (spectral autoencoder) and macro average f1-scores of 0.78 (±0.00) (baseline), 0.70 (±0.01) (temporal autoencoder) and 0.77 (±0.01) (spectral autoencoder). The developed approach could be potentially used as an operational, near real-time avalanche detection system. Yet, the relatively high number of false alarms still needs further implementation of the current automated seismic classification algorithms for effective avalanche detection."

However, in mountain regions, temperature sensors are often placed higher up to avoid being buried in snow in winter. We show that the measurement height is of high importance when quantifying the errors made by weather prediction models. Also, it should be accounted for when these observations are used to correct the models in real time, as doing otherwise degrades their forecasts at high altitudes. 
 The near-surface air temperature, considered to be measured at about 2 m above the ground, is a key meteorological parameter with a wealth of uses for humankind. However, its accurate estimation in mountain regions is impeded by persistent limits inherent to atmospheric modeling over complex terrain. In the present study, we analyze the role of structural inhomogeneities of the valleys and mountains observational network in France to highlight their contribution to  the misrepresentation of near-surface air temperature over mountain regions in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) system Arome-France. We examine in particular the effects of the disparity in height above ground of the temperature measurements, of the inhomogeneous geographical distribution of stations that are preferentially located in valleys, and of the relief mismatch between station location and model grid points. The consequences of these inhomogeneities are analyzed through their effect on model performance evaluation and on the assimilation, with a focus on the winter season. In France, high-altitude stations usually measure temperature at about 7 m over the snow-free ground and on average 1 to 2 m lower when the ground is snow-covered in winter. We show that this height difference with respect to standard stations measuring at 2 m should be considered both when evaluating the model performances and in assimilation. In terms of scores, model behaviors can be highly different at 2 m vs.  5 m so that confounding the two levels can lead to a strong mischaracterization of model biases. This confusion additionally makes the assimilation of high-altitude stations detrimental to the analysis for the Arome-France NWP system. We also show that due to the current 3DVar assimilation system, the assimilation of valley stations affects the near-surface temperature analysis at all altitudes in the mountains. On the other hand, the altitude mismatch between observation points and model grid points does not play an important role, probably in part due to its relatively marginal occurrence in an NWP system with 1.3 km grid spacing. In summary, this study describes new methods and provides guidelines for comparing models with mountain observation data in terms of both assimilation and performance assessment."

It offers a detailed yield estimation. Parameter tuning in the model used literature and field experiments. The model shows a moderate correlation with observed yields at the global, national, and grid-cell levels. Development of this model enhances crop modeling diversity approaches, particularly in climate change impact studies. 
 MATCRO-Soy is an eco-physiological process-based crop model for soybean (Glycine max L. (Merr.)). It was developed by modifying the parameters of MATCRO-Rice, which integrates crop growth processes with a land surface model. The original model was modified using data from the literature and field experiments conducted in countries around the world. The reliability of the model was extensively validated by comparing the simulated yields with observed yields at global, national, and grid-cell levels. Moderate correlations were detected between the yields predicted by MATCRO-Soy and yield data in the Food and Agriculture Organization's FAOSTAT database, with correlation coefficients of 0.81 (p<0.001) for the global average yield and 0.45 (p<0.01) for the global average detrended yield over a 34 year period (1981–2014). Furthermore, validation at the grid-cell level revealed a statistically significant correlation between the MATCRO-Soy simulated yield and the observed yield in 66 % of the grid cells in the global yield map. These results highlight the model's ability to reproduce soybean yield under different environmental conditions, integrating soil water availability and nitrogen fertilizer levels. The MATCRO-Soy model may enhance our understanding of crop physiology, especially crop responses to climate change. Its application may support efforts to reduce uncertainty in projections of the effects of climate change on soybean crops."

This study investigates how midlatitude atmosphere–ocean interactions, as a feedback process, influence EAWM variability. Strong EAWM brings lower‐tropospheric cold air in early winter, enhancing upward surface heat fluxes over the midlatitude western North Pacific (WNP) around 30°N. These anomalous fluxes progressively cool sea surface temperature (SST) south of Japan until late winter. Atmospheric general circulation model experiments revealed that the resulting cold SST anomalies modulate storm‐track activity and transient eddy‐mean flow interaction, facilitating an EAWM‐related cyclonic anomaly east of Japan in late winter. This circulation response acts to reinforces the EAWM, leading to further lower‐tropospheric cooling around Japan.

In this study, we analyzed more than 40 years of observational data to examine long‐term variations in both temperature and salinity. Surface‐limited freshening was found in the southeastern SJ, whereas a robust subsurface freshening emerged in the central SJ off the coast of Japan in spring. This trend is driven by increased river discharge due to enhanced precipitation over Japanese mainland and intensified mesoscale eddy activity, which remotely facilitates offshore freshwater transport. Springtime freshening may shoal the mixed layer, reduce heat content, and promote marine heat waves, potentially affecting marine organisms. Given its broad implications for climate and ecosystems, this phenomenon represents a key aspect of oceanic change in the SJ."

A key challenge has been the prior inability of the higher‐frequency Shallow Radar (SHARAD) to detect this basal zone, hindering potential diagnostic cross‐frequency comparisons. Due to a novel spacecraft maneuver, SHARAD has now obtained a basal return associated with the putative body of water. Modeling of the radar response is not consistent with the liquid water explanation, instead suggesting a localized, low roughness region of dry rock/dust beneath the ice could explain the SHARAD response.

Recent theoretical studies have hypothesized that such upwelling may primarily occur within a bottom boundary layer (BBL) along the sloping seafloor. A dye experiment in a continental‐slope canyon during the BLT‐Recipes program revealed very rapid BBL‐focussed upwelling, endorsing this notion. Here, we elucidate the dynamical connection between the mixing and the upwelling. We show that along‐canyon upwelling stems from episodic turbulent mixing cells up to 250 m high, generated by tides sweeping up‐ and down‐canyon. The tidal currents support a vertical shear that periodically advects dense waters over slower‐flowing lighter waters, reducing BBL stratification. This triggers instabilities that mix the dense waters with neighboring lighter waters, resulting in net along‐boundary upwelling. Our findings substantiate the view that deep‐ocean upwelling can predominantly occur along the ocean's sloping boundaries."

High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) forms from mCDW during sea ice formation and is further modified by mixing with GMW, resulting in distinctly low δ18O of <−0.8‰. In 2020, HSSW δ18O averaged 0.25‰ lower than in 2000, suggesting freshwater from the Amundsen Sea and local ice shelf melting contribute to the Ross Sea's freshening.

Here, Wang et al. report a nanozyme-functionalized hydrogel that interrupts the ROS-ferroptosis-inflammation cycle central to degeneration, effectively promoting disc repair. 
 Intervertebral disc degeneration is a major cause of low back pain and is driven by a vicious cycle of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ferroptosis, and inflammation, afflicting millions of people worldwide. Breaking this cycle represents a significant therapeutic challenge. Here, we develop a ROS-responsive hydrogel loading a resident nanozyme system composed of nucleus pulposus cell membrane-coated black phosphorus@cerium oxide to disrupt this degenerative cascade. Specifically, the nanozyme exhibits a self-sustaining cerium redox cycle due to the incorporation of black phosphorus nanosheets into cerium oxide, conferring durable antioxidant capacity for scavenging ROS. Furthermore, it suppresses the inflammatory cytokine IL6 by inhibiting HuR-mediated mRNA stabilization, thereby blocking the pro-inflammatory and pro-ferroptotic IL6/STAT3 axis. Together, this dual mechanism enables our nanozyme-functionalized hydrogel to break the ROS-ferroptosis-inflammation feedback loop, thus effectively promoting structural and functional disc repair.

Electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) over Cu offers a sustainable route to acetate from waste carbon, but identifying catalysts with high CO-to-acetate selectivity remains challenging due to limited mechanistic understanding. Here, we establish an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven multi-scale simulation framework integrating grand-canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT), microkinetic modeling (MKM), and active learning to elucidate the CORR mechanism and guide catalyst discovery. The DFT-based MKM reveals that acetate forms via CO-CH coupling, with CH* binding energy identified as the key descriptor governing selectivity of acetate production from CORR. Active learning optimization predicts Cu/Pd (2:1) and Cu/Ag (3:1) as the most selective catalysts. Zero-gap electrolyzer experiments confirm their effective performance, achieving acetate Faradaic efficiencies of 50% and 47%, respectively, compared to 21% for pure Cu. This study demonstrates a data-driven catalyst design strategy for advancing selective electrocatalysis. CO electroreduction offers a sustainable route to acetate production but remains mechanistically unclear. Here, the authors develop an active learning multiscale framework revealing CH* binding strength as the key descriptor, predicting Cu/Pd and Cu/Ag as optimal catalysts."

 Self-adaptive compliance and gas permeability are crucial properties for on-skin electronics, enabling the reliable extraction of high-fidelity electrophysiological signals for applications in personal healthcare and robotic control. However, integrating these two properties into a single device, particularly under dynamic skin deformations, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an ultrathin liquid crystal elastomer-based sheath-core ionic nanomesh that synergizes soft elasticity with ionic conductivity to create self-compliant and breathable bioelectronic interfaces. The nanomesh features a hydrophilic sheath and a porous architecture, which ensure high moisture and air permeability for superior wearable comfort. Moreover, the unique liquid-like deformation of liquid crystal directors facilitates nearly stress-free skin-device junctions, promoting fatigue-resistant adhesion against various interfacial failures. Our fabricated electrodes successfully acquire muscle-specific electromyography signals with minimized motion artifacts - a feat challenging for conventional epidermal electrodes. This design resolves the trade-off between self-compliance and permeability, establishing a new paradigm for long-term, reliable wearable electronics.

 Tuberculosis (TB) is the biggest cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), possesses a complex cell envelope comprised of multiple classes of unique lipids. The macrophage phagosome is a key reservoir of infection in pulmonary TB and multiple studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) is limiting in this environment. Here, we show that during Pi restriction the Mtb lipidome markedly remodels such that phospholipids are replaced with multiple classes of phosphorus-free lipids. This envelope lipidome remodelling suggests that standard Mtb culture conditions that use media with high concentrations of Pi do not reflect the physiologic environment during infection, thereby undermining vaccine and drug development for tuberculosis. Further, we discover that Mtb can metabolise phospholipid polar heads abundant in host pulmonary surfactant as an alternative phosphate source. Therefore, we present two mechanisms where Mtb manipulates lipid metabolism to overcome host restriction. Here, the authors show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis manipulates lipid metabolism to overcome host restriction, by remodelling its lipidome and utilising host lipids as an alternative phosphate source."

 Extreme rainfall and flooding, driven by a powerful atmospheric river (AR) and a persistent Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), hit Southern California in February 2024 during the 2023–2024 El Niño, affecting over 10 million people. ARs are key contributors to extreme rainfall and flooding along the U.S. West Coast. Although the AR-MJO link has been documented, its spatio-temporal variability remains a major forecasting and risk-management challenge. Combining precipitation, stream gauge and demographic data, we quantify the physical drivers and population exposure to this extreme event. Leveraging a Lagrangian MJO precipitation tracking algorithm, we unravel the multiscale interactions responsible for the AR’s development. El Niño favored a large, long-lived MJO that interacted with the North Pacific Jet (NPJ) over more than three weeks. The MJO convective outflow modulated the NPJ by inducing negative potential vorticity advection along the tropopause. The ensuing NPJ extension and acceleration induced explosive cyclogenesis, whose AR-driven moisture transport resulted in extreme rainfall."

 The relation of regional precipitation and streamflow sensitivities to warming is complicated by runoff often being the small residual in the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration. In addition, the inhomogeneous nature of land-hydrological properties and hydrological interventions by humans, like irrigation and dams, have made streamflow sensitivities challenging to constrain with both climate models and observations. Here, we elucidate the hydrological processes driving the regionally varying mean and extreme streamflow sensitivities to warming across the contiguous United States in a counter-factual warming scenario using GFDL’s moderately high-resolution global climate model. We show that over the West Coast and eastern US, atmospheric rivers are the dominant driver of high-flows in the present climate and of more frequent high-flows in a warmer climate.

 Accurate weather forecasting is essential for a broad range of socioeconomic activities. While data-driven approaches match numerical weather prediction accuracy with reduced computational cost, their deterministic nature overlooks uncertainties in initial state estimate, model systematic biases, and stochasticity arising from unresolved subgrid physical processes. This obliviousness results in over-confident deterministic predictions that limit operational utility and allow prediction errors to compound over time, rendering uncertainty quantification and error correction intractable. To address these challenges, we present the Generative Ensemble Prediction System (GenEPS), a framework that systematically explores uncertainties in initial states, model formulations, and model stochasticity. GenEPS provides a plug-and-play solution for ensemble forecasting with arbitrary data-driven deterministic weather prediction models. Initial conditions and stochastic uncertainty sampling mitigate random errors, while cross-model integration accounts for inherent model formulation differences to reduce systematic biases. By explicitly representing all three sources of uncertainty, GenEPS outperforms state-of-the-art numerical ensemble predictions and data-driven predictions when evaluated against ERA5 reanalysis data using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics. GenEPS also enhances extreme event predictions, offering physically consistent forecast fields. These advances establish a new paradigm in ensemble forecasting through multi-model generative integration, combining a surging number of data-driven weather forecasting models and potentially numerical models, to achieve more reliable predictions."

 Recent decades have witnessed unprecedented extreme precipitation and catastrophic flooding in some of the most populated regions in Southeast Asia during boreal winter. These extreme events are often influenced by the cross-equatorial northerly surge (CENS), characterized by a strengthening of northerly moist monsoon winds south of the equator in the western Maritime Continent. However, the potential future changes in CENS and its hydrological impacts remain underexplored. Here, using an ensemble of high-resolution climate model simulations (CMIP6 HighResMIP), we show that the regional impacts of CENS on the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events are projected to significantly increase in the near future (2030–2050), particularly over the adjacent coastal regions of southern Indonesia and northwestern Australia. More specifically, the risk of CENS-related extreme precipitation is projected to increase by up to 39 ± 1.2% relative to the seasonal probability, despite no apparent changes in the CENS characteristics in the near future. Such stronger impact is attributed to the enhanced moistening efficiency and moist static instability due to a more humid and warmer environment, which leads to more intense CENS convection. Our results suggest the need for effective monitoring and disaster managements to respond to the increasing severity of such events in the near future."

 Basaltic melts may variably disaggregate macrocrysts (large crystals) from crystal mushes during the assembly of magma bodies beneath ocean-island volcanoes. The entrained macrocrysts modulate the crystallinity, density, and rheology of magmas, parameters that control magma system architecture and eruptive dynamics. However, the timescales, drivers, and consequences of inconstant crystal mush incorporation into carrier melts require quantification. Here, we use a suite of plagioclase-rich basalts to show that the entrainment efficiency (the ability for melts to disaggregate and entrain macrocrysts from crystal mushes) is temporally variable on inter-eruption timescales at ocean-island volcanoes. Macrocryst cargoes are predominantly out of equilibrium with their carrier melts in both chemistries and mass proportions (ratios of different macrocryst phases). Geochemical and petrological evidence reveals that macrocryst mass proportions are established in a density-stratified melt-rich reservoir shortly before eruption, whereas the absolute crystallinity is a function of crustal physics, likely driven by fluctuations of annual-to-millennial melt supply. Variations in entrainment efficiency explain several universal, but enigmatic, features in oceanic volcanic systems, such as decoupled crystallinity–temperature–time relationships and the dearth of plagioclase-rich basalts at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges. Systematically studying temporally constrained eruptive products offers a unique window into the evolution of crystal-rich magma storage zones.

 Large predators are returning to landscapes where they have been absent for centuries, but human preferences complicate their recovery. Communities often resist predator recovery because of perceived risks, limiting what managers call social carrying capacity, or the level of human tolerance for coexisting with wildlife. Yet practical methods for measuring and integrating social carrying capacity into management decisions remain limited. To address this, we combine geospatial and survey data to model individual tolerance for the frequency and severity of grizzly bear encounters. The resulting estimates predict and map zip code-level tolerance across the region. Findings show that people tend to overestimate management’s tolerance of encounters than current federal guidelines. This approach provides a pragmatic tool to incorporate social carrying capacity into decisions about predator recovery and reintroduction, helping balance ecological goals with public acceptance.

 In the past decades, the California Current Ecosystem has experienced intense marine heatwaves, which have induced significant disruptions to local phytoplankton communities. Here, using 30-year cruise observations, we identify a previously undocumented vertical structure in chlorophyll-a concentration response to marine heatwaves, characterized by reductions in the surface layer coupled with increases in the subsurface. By integrating observations and coupled physical-biogeochemical model products, we demonstrate that declines of surface chlorophyll-a are primarily attributed to suppressed nutrient upwelled to the upper ocean. Although surface irradiance increased modestly (+3.5%), light availability in the subsurface layer improved substantially (+21.7%) due to reduced phytoplankton shading at the surface. Concurrent with enhanced lateral nutrient transport, phytoplankton growth at depth was promoted during heatwave events. This study highlights the pivotal role of subsurface phytoplankton dynamics in shaping the vertical chlorophyll-a concentration structure and its variability under extreme events.

This reconstruction reveals an unprecedented decline in river flow in recent decades. Moisture from the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode provides a key water source, but temperature rise has increased atmospheric moisture demand and reduced availability.

 Soil spectroscopy is a powerful technique for soil monitoring. Hundreds of soil spectral datasets, both open-access and private, are used for various applications, despite potential errors. This study presents a filtering protocol to enhance the quality of soil spectral datasets from laboratory and satellite sources, here termed the Spectral Quality Protocol (SQuaP). At the beginning, we utilized a database of 9261 Brazilian soil samples, with paired laboratory hyperspectral (350–2500 nm), and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Afterwards, we tested SQuaP on world-wide open datasets and on bare soil satellite observations identified by the Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3). A filtering approach is presented where we applied rule-based checks (crop residues, reflectance trend) flagged outliers via PCA-Mahalanobis, enforced contextual consistency with soil line regression, detecd cluster-aware anomalies using Isolation Forest within clusters, and validated property spectrum coherence via Random-Forest residuals. Results demonstrated at SQuaP enhances spectral data reliability, and consequently modeling performance of clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) using a Random Forest algorithm. For the hyperspectral data SQuaP increased R2 of 17.55 % for clay and 1.58 % for SOC, and reduced RMSE by 10.41 g kg−1 and 2.06 g kg−1, respectively. For satellite data, the improvements were even more pronounced, with an increase of 15.76 % for clay and 13.38 % for SOC on R2, and a reduction in RMSE. At the world scale, predictive performance improved after the implementation of SQuaP in nearly all continents, with gains in R2 ranging from −2.15 % to 13.40 % across evaluated scenarios. These findings highlight SQuAP's effectiveness in noise filtering and improving predictive accuracy, particularly for multispectral data. Furthermore, these improvements were achieved without compromising data variability, as confirmed by Kernel Desnsity Estimation (KDE) analysis, indicating that the protocol successfully removed outliers while preserving the statistical integrity of the dataset.

 Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as potential tools for automated landform mapping. However, current approaches frequently overlook critical topographic features and prior topographic knowledge, which are essential for accurate landform differentiation. Consequently, these approaches struggle to resolve indistinct class boundaries and misclassification in transitional landform zones. The application of transformer-based approaches to landform mapping remains rare, although these methods are well-suited for capturing global geomorphic patterns. In this study, we develop TKGFormer, a topographic knowledge-guided and transformer-based DL model specifically designed for landform classification. This model explicitly integrates terrain residuals and multi-scale terrain feature-guided attention mechanisms to emphasise key topographic features and improve classification accuracy. We introduce a topographic feature prior loss function, which constrains the learning process by enforcing consistency between predicted landform classes and fundamental terrain characteristics. Moreover, we design an efficient decoder to enhance multiscale feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that TKGFormer outperforms five CNN-based models and two transformer-based model in landform mapping by using bare Earth 30 m resolution Copernicus digital elevation data. In terms of mIoU, TKGFormer exhibits an improvement that ranges from 4.4 % to 20.7 % over the other models. The integration of topographic knowledge into DL provides a promising direction for improving the interpretability and reliability of automated landform classification."

 Existing police resource allocation relies on the prediction of historical crime hotspots, which is difficult to balance the overall effectiveness and regional fairness, resulting in an imbalance in the allocation of resources and difficulty in adapting to dynamic security needs. Taking Los Angeles as the study area, this study first constructs an XGBoost regression prediction model to quantify the future crime risk of each area based on the crime location and time information in the historical crime data, and then introduces the minimum regional disparity (MRD) constraint on the basis of which the fairness indicator is integrated into the optimization framework of patrol region allocation. Meanwhile, this study innovatively introduces a deep reinforcement learning method to improve the model’s solution efficiency and adaptability under complex constraints by interacting with the environment through a policy network. The experimental results show that the MRD fairness model significantly improves resource allocation fairness. Compared with the maximum coverage model, the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation decrease by 42.56 % and 57.59 %, respectively, and the Jain’s fairness index simultaneously increases by 94.33 %. Regarding patrol region configuration, the proposed method decreases resource redundancy by 66.62 % and increases the spatial balance of facility distribution by 7.5 %, thereby effectively improving resource utilization and spatial layout rationality. Additionally, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy substantially reduces computational time compared to the classical mixed-integer programming solver, efficiently meeting dual constraints of fairness and coverage effectiveness. In summary, this study integrates MRD constraints and DRL to achieve equitable, efficient policing resource allocation, providing a practical and effective technical pathway for addressing fairness and efficiency demands."

 Despite significant progress in reducing primary pollutants in China, surface ozone pollution remains a pressing challenge. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) curves—constructed using Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), Observation-Based Model (OBM), and Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach for Machine Learning (MLEKMA)—in guiding ozone control strategies in Luoyang. The levels of O3 and precursors between two sampling campaigns present two main paradoxes, that reduction in source inventory do not guarantee the decrease of atmospheric NOx and VOC levels, and reduction of precursors do not always result in O3 decline. As indicated by all three models, O3 sensitivity in Luoyang was in a transition regime in both 2019 and 2021. However, only the WRF-Chem model yielded ozone concentration predictions (169.0–171.0 μg/m3) that closely matched the observed values (168.8 μg/m3), while OBM and MLEKMA significantly underestimated ozone levels—the observed concentrations were 2–3 times and 3–5 times higher than the respective model predictions. Each method presents its limitations: the WRF-Chem model lacks real-time responsiveness, while OBM and MLEKMA exhibit deficiencies in accurately predicting ozone concentrations. Therefore, integrating multiple EKMA-derived methods is recommended for practical ozone management. By leveraging the timeliness of OBM and MLEKMA alongside the predictive accuracy of WRF-Chem, a rapid and robust multi-model approach for urban ozone sensitivity assessment can be achieved, enabling governments to formulate more effective ozone control policies."

 The integration of Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) and radiosonde datasets plays a critical role in atmospheric profiling, offering complementary strengths in meteorological observation. While radiosonde data provide high-resolution vertical profiles, they often face spatial and temporal limitations across various regions, particularly over oceans and remote areas. These gaps can be effectively mitigated by the global coverage offered by GNSS-RO data. In this study, we investigate the impacts of assimilating these two distinct datasets (GNSS-RO and radiosonde) individually and combined on the initial condition for the model, as well as the model forecast through observing system experiments (OSEs). This study also analyses how the assimilation of these observations impacts the assimilation of the other observations by assessing the background and analysis innovations. For these OSEs, we employed the NCMRWF Unified Model (NCUM) with a Four-Dimensional Variational (4D-Var) data assimilation approach to incorporate various observational data received from multiple sources. Four experiments were conducted over 1–10 July 2024: control (CNTL) excluding radiosonde and GNSS-RO data, RO experiment assimilating GNSS-RO, RS experiment assimilating radiosonde data, and RSRO experiment assimilating both. The analysis focuses on a heavy rainfall event on 7–8 July 2024, assessing forecasts of temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall at day-1, day-3, and day-5 lead times, and validating against ERA5 and IMERG datasets. Results show that assimilating GNSS-RO and radiosonde data primarily enhances temperature forecasts at upper levels and humidity forecasts at low and mid-levels. Notably, the assimilation of these observations leads to significant improvements in rainfall prediction. Rainfall forecasts, particularly at day-3, show the greatest improvement: 1.9 % in RO, 7.8 % in RS, and 12.6 % in the RSRO experiment."

 To investigate the impact of microphysics schemes on uncertainties in cloud seeding modeling, parameterizations of silver-iodide-related ice nucleation processes were implemented as a standalone physics module within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The new module is compatible with most bulk microphysics schemes available in the WRF model. Using this module, an 18-member cloud seeding ensemble forecast was developed using three sets of initial and lateral boundary conditions (IC/LBCs) and six microphysics schemes. Twin ensemble forecast experiments, one control (without cloud seeding) and one seeded, were performed to estimate precipitation enhancement potential in post-frontal stratiform clouds during a snowfall event over Danjiangkou Reservoir catchment area in central China. The control ensemble reproduced the overall pattern of precipitation well, while the seeded ensemble predicted primarily positive precipitation potential over the target area. The IC/LBCs and microphysics schemes exert comparable influences on variations in supercooled liquid water and precipitation. The IC/LBCs had more pronounced effects on the spatial distribution of verified variables, while microphysics scheme had greater influence on the intensity. However, microphysics schemes exerted greater influence on the variations of cloud seeding induced changes in microphysical variables and precipitation. The results of this study highlight the importance of incorporating multiple microphysics schemes in cloud seeding modeling for improved representation of uncertainties."

A new generation geostationary satellite, Himawari-8/9, and onboard sensor, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), enables hyper-temporal vegetation monitoring in this cloud-prone region. However, AHI’s fixed viewing geometry varies spatially, making consistent vegetation monitoring challenging across a wide area at a seasonal scale. This study evaluated four different sun-target-sensor geometry conditions using two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) to achieve near-uniform geometry and enhance the ability to monitor vegetation activities: (i) nadir condition, which used nadir viewing and solar geometry at local solar noon; (ii) local solar noon (LSN) condition, which used pixel-by-pixel fixed viewing and solar geometry at local solar noon; (iii) temporally-constant scattering angle (T-CSA) condition, which used pixel-by-pixel fixed viewing and solar geometry corresponding to the scattering angle which meets the criterion (Gao et al 2024 Remote Sens. Environ.315 114407); and (iv) spatially-constant scattering angle (S-CSA) condition, which used pixel-by-pixel fixed viewing and solar geometry corresponding to a uniform scattering angle of 140°. Among these, the S-CSA condition most effectively mitigated angular artifacts. The derived EVI2 showed higher correlations with tower-based gross primary productivity (GPP), indicating it better captured seasonal variations in vegetation activity. It also demonstrated spatially consistent temporal variations, least affected by AHI’s unique observation geometry. Applying a near-uniform sun-target-sensor geometry based on the S-CSA condition improves monitoring capability in Southeast Asia and enhances our understanding of vegetation dynamics."

Despite discussions of decarbonization potential at the regional level, plant-specific co-benefits and technologically driven pathways remain unclear. Here, we integrate detailed data from 329 individual Chinese coking plants—characterizing their location, capacity, technology, and age—with national carbon neutrality scenarios to develop optimized, multi-criteria retirement pathways. Plants mainly located in Shanxi are first phased out before 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario, while retirements are proportional across provinces in the low coke production scenario. Considerable co-benefits are observed, 53.4%–57.1% of water saving and emission mitigation toward 2060. Trade-offs exist due to ascending coal use if there is higher technical penetration of dry quenching. Our analysis quantifies the distinct contributions of demand reduction (driven by steel industry transformation) and structural efficiency improvements within the coking sector itself. These results provide the first granular, data-driven roadmap for managing China’s critical coking transition, offering crucial insights for maximizing environmental gains during industrial decarbonization globally."

The eastern Himalayan Brahmaputra basin is a critical hotspot of this integrated risk. However, a basin-wide quantification of the individual contributions of these drivers to flood exposure has been lacking. Here, we employ a calibrated coupled hydrological–hydraulic model to provide the first comprehensive assessment. We show that meltwater (snow and glacier melt) contributions to annual maximum floods increase with altitude. At the basin scale, meltwater amplifies population and gross domestic product (GDP) exposure to flooding by 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. This amplification rises dramatically to 27.9% for population and 33.3% for GDP in high-altitude regions (⩾2000 m). Rainfall-derived discharge constitutes the dominant source of flood exposure, followed by meltwater; GLOFs present the least contribution. Nonetheless, GLOFs increase basin-wide population and GDP exposure by 1.2% and 1.3%, and notably intensify to 31.1% and 33.5% above 2000 m.

However, many less-developed countries and regions face economic constraints and often suffer from severe ecosystem degradation, which jointly hinder their ability to meet these commitments. Here, we use the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), a less-developed region that has experienced ecosystem degradation, as a case study. We use a novel multi-scenario modeling framework to assess the impact of different combinations of natural climate solutions (NCS) and carbon emission reduction policies (CERPs) on carbon neutrality and associated costs. Our findings show that carbon neutrality was achieved on the QTP by 2020, with a surplus of 18.16 MtCO2 yr−1. However, without CERPs, carbon emissions on the QTP are projected to increase fivefold by 2060 compared with 2020 levels. Even with stringent NCS, a shortfall of nearly 375.34 ± 99.05 MtCO2 yr−1 in maintaining carbon neutrality remains in 2060. If CERPs are implemented without NCS, the cost of maintaining carbon neutrality in 2060 is estimated at USD 199.07 ± 25.96 billion during 2020–2060. Notably, integrating NCS with CERPs reduces costs by nearly half (USD 111.51 ± 21.48 billion). Furthermore, the integration of aggressive CERPs and NCS on the QTP could contribute a further additional surplus by 2060 toward national carbon neutrality goals at a pretty low carbon price. Our research highlights that combining NCS with CERPs yields greater climate benefits at significantly lower costs, providing potential pathways for financially constrained regions to enhance climate mitigation, especially when supported by international climate finance and cooperative mechanisms."

Here, we refine the nitrogen cycle representation in a TEM by incorporating free-living and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) processes along with atmospheric nitrogen deposition effects. Our updated model provides a new assessment of present-day and future global natural ecosystem BNF rates and their spatial distribution. We estimate that present-day (1981–2020) free-living nitrogen fixation (FLNF) contributes to 36 Tg N yr−1, ranging from 33 to 38.5 Tg N yr−1 and SNF is 88 Tg N yr−1 with a range of 80–95 Tg N yr−1, resulting in a total BNF 124 Tg N yr–1, ranging from 112 to 134 Tg N yr−1. Under the SSP5-8.5 warming scenario, our projections indicate that total BNF could increase to 178 Tg N yr−1 by the end of the 21st century. Our model results highlight that the FLNF plays a dominant role in low-temperature environments, and plant functional type emerges as the primary factor for both symbiotic and FLNF pathways, thus precise global vegetation classification is highly necessary for N2 fixation simulation.

The concept of ‘just transitions,’ which integrates both environmental and social interventions, is essential for advancing climate and poverty reduction objectives. Both climate change impacts and climate action may exacerbate existing inequalities, underscoring the urgency of addressing both environmental and social justice concerns. Equally, developmental aspirations may threaten to aggravate environmentally detrimental patterns. To this end, the paper examines how domestic efforts balance climate and poverty priorities in the governance of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. It develops a conceptual framework that links the governance of climate and poverty to justice outcomes within the global political economic context, using the illustrative case of Kenya. Kenya presents a compelling case due to its relevance to the conceptual framework amidst high dependence on climate-sensitive economic sectors; aspirations both to act as a climate leader and reach middle-income status; and its high financial dependence on development partners and transnational capital. By connecting political economy dynamics to justice outcomes, the framework contributes to a deeper understanding of governance efforts that aim to link climate and poverty objectives but do not necessarily deliver a just transition. Through the case of Kenya, the paper illustrates the challenges and opportunities faced by Sub-Saharan African countries in managing the interdependence between climate and poverty reduction objectives, contributing to ongoing debates on just transitions in the global South."

To address this gap, a dual-pathway analytical framework was proposed to diagnose afforestation-induced changes in land surface temperature (LST). Within this framework, a ‘zero-impact line’ was defined to represent the LST response solely from forest cover conversion, and the indirect effect amplification index (τ) was introduced to quantify the magnitude and direction of indirectly driven LST variation. Results indicated that each 1% increase in forest cover reduced LST by 0.029 °C–0.036 °C through direct effects (DE). In the early stages of forestation, τ reached 187%, 227%, and 242% in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, respectively, revealing that indirect feedbacks can equal or exceed DE, thereby amplifying the overall cooling outcome in the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests of Southwest China."

Specifically, we utilized topographic maps (1:50000) created by the U.S. Army Map Service during the Vietnam War (1963–1973) to create detailed historical LUC maps of Laos and Vietnam. We compared multiple model architectures on the manually labeled training data, with the UNet++ achieving the best performance.

In an interconnected global food system, countries rely on both local food production and imports to meet domestic demand. When assessing the impact of drought risk on national food security, however, imported crops are often overlooked. This study incorporates international crop trade information to understand the role of crop imports in the drought risk profile of countries. We focus on conflict-affected countries due to their reliance on food imports, and particular vulnerability to the impacts of drought events and their corresponding cascading effects. We develop a framework to quantify drought risk associated with domestic production and imports of crops (i.e. composite drought risk) by combining gridded drought risk data with crop production and trade for 23 countries. Our findings show that most conflict-affected countries face drought risk primarily through domestic production, as most consumed calories are produced locally. Nevertheless, including crop imports alters the composite drought risk profiles considerably (>10%) in 13 countries, with changes reaching 40%–50% in some cases. Crop imports also carry their own external drought risk, contributing more than 10% of high drought risk in 21 countries and amounting to 80% in some cases. Furthermore, we identify critical trade connections that expose countries to concentrated drought risks from specific trading partners. We demonstrate the need to incorporate both domestic and import-related drought risks in food security assessments, and we suggest potential strategies based on countries’ composite drought risk profiles for drought resilient food security."

 Precipitation from mixed-phase clouds at high-latitudes is difficult to represent correctly in numerical weather prediction models. Paired water vapour and precipitation isotope measurements provide a constraint on the integrated effect of evaporation and condensation processes, but have rarely been collected in a way that allows to use these for model validation and improvement. Here we present a collection of spatially distributed measurements of water isotopes in the different phases at high time resolution during the ISLAS2021 field campaign over the period 15 to 30 March 2021. The main observational site of this campaign was Andenes, Norway (69.3144°N, 16.1194°E). Isotopic measurements were conducted simultaneously at sea level and a mountain observatory, as well as additional coastal sites at distances of 100 km (Tromsø, Norway) and 1000 km (Bergen, Norway), enabling the assessment of spatial representativeness of vapour isotope measurements. Precipitation samples for water isotope analysis were collected on site at sub-event time resolution, and along a transect across the Lofoten archipelago. These measurements were complemented by a suite of aerosol measurements, including ice-nucleating particles, and additional in-situ and remote sensing observations of meteorological variables. During the two weeks of the ISLAS2021 field campaign, frequent alternations between mid-latitude and arctic weather systems were encountered, providing a range of different cases for more detailed process studies. Our dataset can serve as a test bed for assessing the spatial representativeness and sampling strategies for water isotope measurements on meteorological time scales.

We thus assess various regional model physics configurations in this regard. Finding one optimal configuration is challenging: reliable rainfall rarely coincides with correct radiative heating. Simulations of rainfall however yield more dissensus, suggesting that this variable should be prioritized, for which the best results are obtained with the cumulus convection scheme of Tiedtke. 
 This study evaluates the performance of RegCM5 in simulating air–sea fluxes over Southeast Asia through a set of 36 sensitivity experiments testing different physical scheme combinations. Scheme choices vary across five model aspects: radiative transfer, planetary boundary layer, cumulus convection, parameterized microphysics and cloud fraction. A multi-criteria decision-making framework is applied to rank model configurations based on their ability to reproduce spatiotemporal patterns of sea surface wind, latent and sensible heat fluxes, precipitation, and radiative heat fluxes, using mostly satellite-based reference products. No configuration performs consistently best across all criteria: scores assessing latent and shortwave radiative heat fluxes are generally conflicting, with each other and with the scores for precipitation and sea surface wind which instead tend to agree. The choice of cumulus convection scheme drives the performance in simulating the latter two variables, with Tiedtke outperforming and Kain–Fritsch underperforming. In contrast, the best shortwave radiative heat flux simulations are obtained with MIT cumulus convection, in combination with CCM3 radiative transfer.  Overall, RRTM/UW-PBL/Tiedtke/SUBEX/Xu–Randall – using the same order of model aspects as listed in the beginning – stands out by maintaining relatively high scores across all assessed variables. Nonetheless, a stronger dissensus in precipitation outputs suggests that reliable rainfall patterns may be a higher priority for decision makers, highlighting CCM3/UW-PBL/Tiedtke/NoTo/Xu–Randall and RRTM/Holtslag/Tiedtke/NoTo/Xu–Randall as the best configurations for this variable. Beyond statistics, further analysis reveals key monsoon-related biases: Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall is generally underestimated, Western North Pacific Summer Monsoon features are overestimated and shifted northward, near-equatorial regions exhibit excessive boreal summer rainfall in most Tiedtke experiments, and austral summer monsoonal sea surface wind and precipitation only impact areas directly north of Australia without inducing the rainfall annual maximum observed in that season over equatorial seas. These findings provide a basis for selecting optimal physics in RegCM5 over Southeast Asia and offer guidance for future applications, including air–sea coupled regional climate modeling."

These potentially tsunamigenic seafloor offsets result from coseismic fault slip and deformation beneath or within the accretionary wedge. The mechanics of these shallow rupture phenomena and their dependence on subduction zone properties remain unresolved, partly due to the sparsity of offshore observations of shallow megathrust earthquake deformation. Here, we analyze how offshore structure influences shallow rupture mechanics and slip partitioning using 3D dynamic earthquake simulations of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) megathrust with and without variably dipping seaward‐ or landward‐vergent splay faults in the wedge that sole into the megathrust. Resulting tradeoffs between splay and megathrust slip reveal structural controls on rupture partitioning, with greater splay slip leading to less shallow megathrust slip updip. Gently dipping and seaward‐vergent splays host more slip than those with steeper, landward‐vergent splays. To isolate the underlying mechanisms, we compare models with Andersonian and plunging principal stresses. Results suggest distinct static and dynamic processes control the dip‐ and vergence‐dependence of splay rupture: static (mis)alignment relative to far‐field tectonic loading favors slip on more optimally oriented, shallowly dipping splay faults. In contrast, dynamic stress interactions of an updip‐propagating megathrust rupture front with the free surface and potential branch faults favor forward branching onto seaward‐vergent splays and inhibit backward branching onto landward‐vergent splays. Resulting seafloor displacements suggest splay fault structure may influence coseismic tsunami source processes, highlighting the importance of dynamically viable rupture scenarios in subduction hazard assessments."

This study evaluates global Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) extremeness and climate linkages using GRACE and GRACE‐FO data from 2002 to 2024. By examining upper and lower deciles of TWS anomalies representing wet and dry extremes and assessing spatial dependencies, we identify key patterns, trends, and driving factors through dimensional reduction and probabilistic modeling. Results show global TWS extremes are governed by a 2–3‐year oscillatory cycle linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which synchronizes drought and pluvial conditions across continents. Drought extremes show broader spatial coherence than pluvial events, indicating moisture deficits propagate more uniformly through the land–atmosphere system. A weaker quasi‐decadal cycle (6–10 years) modulates these responses and underlies a shift around 2011–2012. Before 2011, wet extremes intensified, while after 2012, dry extremes became dominant, particularly in interior Asia, western United States, and southern Africa. Neither pluvial nor drought extremes show significant global trends in intensity; however, they remain phase‐locked, with wet events twice as intense as dry ones, reflecting asymmetric hydrologic response to moisture surpluses versus deficits. We probabilistically reconstruct TWS extremeness during satellite data gaps using leading spatio‐temporal patterns. The current record, spanning less than one multidecadal cycle, remains insufficient for robust attribution. Extending satellite gravimetry is essential to refine uncertainty in attributing global pluvial and drought extremes under climate change."

Understanding of past extremes and their meaningfulness for contextualizing future possibilities, especially in the near‐term, is limited by the absence of a global analysis focused on the most extreme humid‐heat‐anomaly events. Here we identify record‐setting humid‐heat days for 216 global regions and assess the likelihood of these records being broken even under present‐day climate forcing. We use several reanalyses as a historical catalogue, and large climate‐model ensembles to represent other statistically plausible events. Unlike the spatial pattern of large temperature anomalies, we find that humid‐heat anomalies are most intense, and most seasonally and interannually concentrated, in the deep tropics and arid subtropics. Many top events have attracted little if any prior attention. The eastern United States is especially susceptible to record‐breaking humid heat due to modest current records (>1% inferred annual exceedance probability) contrasting with numerous simulated large‐anomaly days. Australia and eastern China are also prone to locally exceptional episodes, with >40% of ensemble members simulating events exceeding the ERA5‐based distribution maximum. Model biases for key characteristics, together with the observed record‐setting day affecting its estimated return period by >2.5x in half of regions, underline several valuable aspects of a joint observation/model perspective on humid heat. This approach aids in evaluating the plausibility of as‐yet‐unseen extremes; identifying regions of concern that might otherwise be overlooked and underprepared; and gauging regionally specific correlations between event magnitudes and societal impacts."

The steepness of such slopes is thought to reflect a balance between fault slip and erosion rate. We show that facet dip angles along the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ), USA, positively correlate with fault slip rates, such that relative variations in slip rate can be estimated from facet angle, and that by constraining millennial‐scale facet erosion rates, absolute slip rates can be estimated. We calculate ∼ ${\sim} $100‐ka average vertical slip rates of 0.37−0.1+0.36 $0.3{7}_{-0.1}^{+0.36}$ mm/yr (mean and 90% confidence interval) along the central WFZ, consistent with estimates from features offset over similar timescales, but lower than Holocene rates.

 Ecosystems are not only affected by current climate but are also shaped by antecedent climate through their influences on vegetation growth and environmental conditions. These lagged responses, known as memory effects, can either exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate extremes on ecosystem functions. However, the direction, strength and influential duration of memory effects on ecosystem productivity remain poorly understood. Here we implement an interpretable machine-learning framework based on eddy covariance data to model ecosystem gross primary productivity over the period 1995–2020 and further investigate the characteristics of memory effects on positive and negative extremes of ecosystem productivity. Our results show a large contribution from antecedent climate conditions (38.2%) to ecosystem productivity during extremes, with precipitation accounting for 42.2% of the memory effects, followed by temperature (22.1%) and vapour pressure deficit (20.8%). Extreme events conditioned by long-term climatic variations often cause higher productivity losses than short-term extremes, with semi-arid ecosystems exhibiting the largest productivity anomalies and prolonged memory effects. Our results highlight the role of memory effects in regulating carbon flux variations and provide an observation-constrained benchmark for these effects.

 Elastic ceramic aerogels have drawn broad attention for use in aerospace, energy storage, and thermal protection systems, where lightweight structures with thermal stability and mechanical robustness are required. Yet their practical application is often limited by insufficient strength. Achieving both high strength and high elasticity in ceramic nanowire aerogels remains challenging because these properties are typically mutually constrained. Here we design silicon carbide nanowire aerogels reinforced by dual-phase nodes composed of pyrolytic carbon (PyC) and amorphous silica (SiO2) to resolve this conflict. Experimental measurements together with large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) and finite element simulations show that amorphous SiO2 improves load-bearing efficiency by distributing stress uniformly, while PyC relieves local stress concentrations and prevents premature SiO2 fracture, producing a clear synergistic effect. The resulting aerogels exhibit a compressive strength of 10.9 MPa at 80% strain and a resilience of about 90%. This dual-phase strategy provides an effective route to tailor the mechanical response of ceramic aerogels and expand their use in extreme environments such as high temperature, low oxygen, and vacuum conditions, where strength, elasticity, and long-term reliability are required.

 Plant domestication has had profound impacts on the morphology and genetic diversity of crops. Beyond sequence diversity, changes in chromatin structure can play an important role in plant adaptation. However, the interplay between the chromatin landscape and plant domestication remains unclear. Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly and chromatin landscape map of the ancient pseudo-cereal, amaranth. ATAC-sequencing of multiple accessions of three grain amaranth species and two wild relatives, shows that the overall amount of accessible chromatin is highly conserved, but about 2.5% of all chromatin switched states, with a higher fraction of the genome repeatedly opening during domestication processes. These differentially accessible chromatin regions, between the crops and their wild ancestor, are species-specific and significantly associated with selective sweeps - reflecting the repeated independent domestication of amaranth. Our findings reveal the dynamic interplay between domestication and the chromatin landscape, highlighting an additional layer of diversity in crops.

 Plasmon-induced charge generation and separation in metal/semiconductor heterostructures offer a promising platform for hot carrier-based energy conversion applications. A key challenge is understanding ultrafast hot carrier transfer at heterogeneous interfaces, as the details of plasmonic enhanced charge transfer dynamics and accompanying energy relaxation remain unclear. Here, by tracking charge transfer processes across spatial, temporal, and energy domains, we reveal ultrafast, nonthermal electron transfer directly from gold nanoparticles to gallium nitride (GaN) without energy losses from electron-electron scattering. This process facilitates efficient charge separation and produces a nonthermal distribution of transferred electron in GaN—contrasting with substantial energy dissipation typically observed during conventional interfacial charge transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pivotal role of light polarization in modulating charge generation and energy distribution, which enables dynamic control of electron relaxation and enhances the possibility of nonthermal electrons surmounting the Schottky barrier for successful injection. These insights pave the way for advancing hot-carrier management and achieving coherent control of non-equilibrium charge behavior across multiple dimensions for solar energy conversion and optoelectronic applications.

 Lithium disilicate glass-ceramics are increasingly utilized in dental applications due to their exceptional optical and aesthetic properties. However, lithium disilicate glass-ceramics possess a mixed crystalline and amorphous structure with variable resistance to external corrosion. Exposure of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics to acidic conditions in the oral cavity leads to pore formation, and the risk of cracking increases with long-term wear.

The TiO2 species play crucial roles in improving acid resistance, and the Al2O3 species, atomically bonded to the TiO2 species in the hybrid layer, promote interfacial interactions. Moreover, the TiO2/Al2O3 hybrid nanolayer shows no cytotoxicity while maintaining the aesthetics of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations, thus offering broad prospects for oral restoration applications.

 Developing next-generation hypersonic vehicles necessitates structural materials capable of withstanding extreme thermal gradients. However, conventional alloys usually sacrifice room-temperature plasticity for breakthroughs in high-temperature strength. Here, we report a (WTaV)90B10 refractory medium-entropy alloy (RMEA) that overcomes this trade-off, showing decent plasticity of ~6% at ambient temperature, high yield strength of 650 MPa at 1873 K and 242 MPa at 2073 K, and excellent thermal stability up to ~0.7 Tm. The RMEA comprises a BCC metallic solid solution and a boride phase. Interfacial segregation of boron atoms generates gradient-ordering phase boundaries (GOPBs), enhancing stress transfer and plastic compatibility. Strong interfacial bonding of GOPBs and the inherent stability of the dual-phase structure further enable remarkable resistance to ultrahigh-temperature softening. At 2073 K, GOPBs evolve into fully coherent interfaces, ensuring exceptional thermal stability at ~0.7 Tm. This work demonstrates a gradient-ordering strategy for achieving strength-plasticity synergy from ambient to ultrahigh temperatures.

 Understanding the health impact of human radiation exposure from tritiated water release is crucial for the management and sustainability of nuclear energy.

Here by evaluating the uptake and chemical transfer of tritium in biota, we show the critical role of algae in rapidly incorporating and transferring tritiated water into OBT, which serves as nutrients for trophic transfer to fish. Notably, the specific retention of OBT in the fish brain, by integrating into biomolecules, potentially disrupts key metabolic reactions. The derived concentration factors and biomagnification factors are instrumental in estimating the internal exposure dose to human individuals, thereby enabling more accurate risk assessments for both planned tritium releases and accidental leakages.

 Riming is one of the key factors influencing the control of phase partitioning and precipitation formation in mixed-phase clouds. The riming growth rate of ice particles is strongly affected by the spatial distributions of liquid and ice particles. However, models often assume particles are homogeneously distributed in a given grid box when modelling riming, and few observational studies have quantified the effect of sub-grid heterogeneous particle distributions on riming. In this study, based on airborne in situ measurements made in isolated mixed-phase cumulus clouds, the impact of heterogeneous particle distribution on riming growth rate (Rrim) is quantified by defining an impact factor Frim, which is calculated using the observed mean Rrim divided by Rrim assuming a homogeneous particle distribution. The results show that Frim varies from ~0 to 2.8, demonstrating that the heterogeneous particle distribution has a strong nonlinear impact on riming. Additionally, it is found that Frim can be parameterized using the homogeneity of liquid-ice mixing and the range of normalized riming rate, which are related to the predictable condensed water content and ice particle concentration, respectively. Moreover, based on simulations driven by observed particle size distributions and assuming a static condition, it is suggested that riming has a significant feedback on Frim. These findings will be beneficial to improve the capability of models in simulating mixed-phased clouds and deepen our understanding of sub-grid scale cloud microphysics."

 Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies profoundly shape regional precipitation variability, yet their pathways are often obscured by seasonal/monthly mean-state analyses overlooking daily atmospheric dynamics. Focusing on monsoon-affected South China, we show that the rainy-season rainfall interannual variability is primarily driven by shifts in daily circulation regimes rather than rainfall intensity. Objective classification identifies four dominant regimes: two low-pressure system–related types, a pre-onset monsoon regime, and a South China Sea monsoon–dominated regime. Moisture tracking and precipitation decomposition confirm that regime frequency dominates year-to-year rainfall variations. SST anomalies in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans modulate these frequencies by triggering large-scale atmospheric responses, particularly anomalous cyclones/anticyclones over the western North Pacific. These atmospheric changes alter convection and instability, driving low-pressure activity and monsoon onset. Our findings reveal a regime-mediated mechanism linking remote ocean variability to regional hydroclimate extremes, offering new insights for improving climate prediction and projection under global warming."

 The Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation (SO MOC) plays a critical role in redistributing heat, carbon and other tracers globally. Despite its importance, substantial inter-model diversity persists in climate model simulations. This study examines mechanisms underlying such diversity using pre-industrial control simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5/6). We find that discrepancies in the upper overturning cell of SO MOC are primarily governed by model-dependent sensitivity to wind stress, rather than differences in wind stress magnitude. Latitudinal position of maximum zonal wind stress, closely linked to the Southern Annular Mode-like mean state, determines sensitivity through both Eulerian and parameterized eddy-induced circulation. For the lower overturning cell, inter-model differences are largely driven by variations in surface buoyancy fluxes—primarily meltwater—and mean ocean stratification, particularly within key Antarctic Bottom Water formation regions.

 To accurately invert the canopy parameters (Total photosynthetic area index, TPAI) of oilseed rape, a microwave characteristic layered measurement experiment was designed, and a multilayer microwave scattering semiempirical model (MLMSSM) was constructed based on the radar response changes induced by the differences in the vertical structure and canopy components at different phenological stages. This model was then applied to the main oilseed rape production areas to conduct regional TPAI inversion. Microwave characteristic layered measurement experiments were performed at six-leaf, flowering, beginning ripening and fully ripening stages of oilseed rape in the laboratory of target microwave properties (LAMP). The MLMSSM was constructed based on the LAMP-measured data, corresponding to different plant structures containing two- and three-layer submodels, and the TPAI inversion model was derived based on the correlation between the MLMSSM parameters and the crop biophysical variables. Finally, regional TPAI inversion and validation were carried out in the main oilseed rape production area (Hengyang), using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Visualization results, MLMSSM parameters and TPAI inversion results based on LAMP data all revealed the occurrence of multiple scattering interactions among distinct oilseed rape structural layers and verified the effectiveness of the measurement scheme and the model.

 We evaluated the risk of Sick House Syndrome in newly constructed wooden houses by measuring the indoor concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including α-pinene, D-limonene, and the total VOCs (TVOCs), in accordance with Japanese indoor concentration guidelines. To ensure quantitative accuracy, a field survey of 55 houses was conducted using a passive air sampling method with experimentally determined sampling rates.

The results revealed that apart from styrene in one house, the concentration of no compounds exceeded that of the Japanese indoor guidelines. The houses (∼80 %) exhibited α-pinene concentrations below the German bicyclic terpenes guideline (RW II). Although elevated concentrations immediately after construction pose potential short-term health risks, the rapid decline within a few months suggests minimal long-term concerns. Similarly, D-limonene concentrations in all houses were below those of the German guideline (RW II), indicating a low risk.With the increasing prevalence of high-insulation and airtight construction, newly built wooden houses will likely experience elevated concentrations of wood-derived VOCs such as α-pinene.

 Climate warming and moistening are enhancing the frequency and intensity of Tibetan Plateau Vortices (TPVs), altering precipitation patterns across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and adjacent regions. Although TPVs are the primary weather systems driving heavy precipitation over northern China, how their impacts vary across different geographic environments remains poorly understood. Reanalysis data and potential vorticity (PV) diagnostics are used to examine dynamical and thermodynamic processes associated with the TPV-induced cross-regional precipitation event (8–13 July 2021) across the Eastern Slope of the TP (ESTP) and the North China Plain (NCP). In the ESTP, heavy precipitation results from a dynamical-thermodynamic coupled mechanism, where low-level jets transporting moisture from the Indian Ocean and South China Sea interact with orographic lifting to trigger warm and moist advection, further enhanced by PV advection and diabatic heating. In the NCP, a dual-channel moisture transport pathway emerges as the TPV interacts with warm-moist flow along the western flank of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), with precipitation peaks preceding PV maxima, indicating that dynamical forcing associated with PV advection dominates the heavy precipitation. These findings show that TPV-driven heavy precipitation results from spatiotemporal coupling between dynamical triggering and thermodynamic feedback of moisture. Latent heating rapidly amplifies nascent convection, while thermal processes enhance low-level instability, compensating for weakening dynamical forcing and sustaining precipitation. These findings highlight that regional disparities in TPV-induced heavy precipitation stem from asymmetrical dynamical-thermodynamic coupling, underscoring the need to elucidate the physical mechanisms by which TPVs trigger cross-regional precipitation, in order to improve forecasts of TPV-related weather and associated hazards."

Parker;Zhuxia Xu,Spatiotemporal patterns and propagation characteristics of convective activity on the northeast slope of Tibetan Plateau: A high-resolution radar perspective,"•Terrain-anchored convective hotspots: Yellow River Valley, eastern Qilian Mountains, sharp river bend. •Moderate convection dominates (64.7 %), peaks in July with diurnal cycle driven by solar heating. •Convection days feature a synergistic pattern: upper-level trough, low-level convergence, strong moisture flux. •Convective events favor higher CAPE, stronger shear/ascent, and moister BL within 0–2 h prior. •80–85 % Storms are with small-scale(area < 200 km2)and slow-moving(travel <20 km); motion shifts monthly. 
 The northeastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau, situated in a complex terrain and the monsoon-westerly transition zone, experiences frequent convective storms and high disaster risk. Based on CINRAD radar and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2015 to 2019, a high-resolution convective climatology was established, and its environmental fields were diagnosed. Results indicate a significant topographic anchoring effect on convection, with persistent hotspots located in the Yellow River valley-Xinglong Mountain, the eastern Qilian Mountains, and the sharp-bend reach of the Yellow River. Moderate convection dominates (64.7 %), while deep convection has a low frequency but high local intensity. The most active month seasonally is July, with June and August exhibiting similar levels of activity. The convective activity in July is most active during the season, with levels in June and August being similar. The configuration of synoptic patterns indicates a synergistic mode of “upper-level trough, lower-level convergence, and strong moisture transport” for convective days. Diurnal variation is characterized by a peak in the afternoon (13:00–18:00 BJT) and is weakest in the early morning to morning, consistent with the synergistic trigger between solar radiation and terrain convergence. Atmospheric environment diagnostics reveal that, compared to non-convective events, convective events have higher CAPE, stronger updrafts, greater vertical wind shear, and more abundant water vapor in the two hours prior to triggering. The statistical distribution of storm scales exhibits an exponential decay with a “long-tail” pattern, with approximately 80 %–85 % of convective events having a propagation distance of less than 20 km and a max area of less than 200 km2. The propagation direction of convective activity exhibits inter-monthly shifts, trending eastward/southward in June, shifting northward to east-southeastward in July, and westward/northward in August. These findings reveal the mechanisms by which large-scale circulation and local topography jointly influence convection, providing critical scientific support for monitoring and early warning systems for severe convection in the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas, as well as for disaster risk prevention and control."

This study presents an integrated framework combining process-based modeling (PBM), machine learning, and life cycle assessment (LCA) into a user-friendly decision support system (DSS) for AFS analysis and optimization. Multi-scenario simulations using Hi-sAFe (16 configurations varying in latitude and orientation) for maize–poplar systems produced detailed outputs, including land equivalent ratios (LER up to 1.29), crop yield (ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 t ha−1), and N2O emissions (1.6–9.4 kg N ha−1). We trained Random Forest models on PBM diagnostics, microclimate, and design covariates; post-hoc SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified maximum air temperature (Tmax), distance to tree rows, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as the dominant predictors of yield and LER. To address data gaps, long short-term memory (LSTM) and TrAdaBoost-LSTM models were used for microclimate forecasting, achieving high fidelity (R2 = 0.88) in capturing hourly temperature and humidity trends. Outputs have been integrated into an LCA workflow, producing CO2-equivalent and nitrogen footprint metrics that feed into a functional web-based DSS. This platform enables robust, transparent, and scalable AFS evaluation, supporting stakeholders with real-time scenario exploration and scientifically grounded decision-making tools. Furthermore, the framework enables greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting in AFSs by integrating modeled soil organic carbon dynamics and N2O emissions.

However, large uncertainties remain in estimating its flux (Rs) and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) globally, and interactive effects from soil properties are often overlooked in models. To better predict global Rs and Q10, we applied four nonlinear models (Random forest (RF), AdaBoosted, Bagged Tree, and XGBoost models) to 3325 observations of Rs and Q10 from 1971 to 2023 with 18 predictors and used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to explore the interactive effects. The RF model provided the best performance, with the highest R2 values and minimal root mean squared errors. The results indicated that the global average annual Rs was 98.4 ± 19.4 Pg C. Excluding the effects of soil variables (soil texture (Stex), microbial composition, and solution chemistry) led to a decline in R2 (from 0.79 to 0.7 for Rs models and from 0.40 to 0.34 for Q10 models) and an underestimation on Rs. The results of rotated principal component analysis showed that these soil variables collectively explained 50% of the cumulative variance in Rs variability. Soil variables significantly constrained Q10 values, especially in nutrient-poor soils. SHAP analysis showed that the interactive effects of high soil sand proportion and high soil fertility may suppress Rs. High soil evapotranspiration may also decrease Rs at the extreme conditions of Stex. These findings highlight the underappreciated mechanistic influence of soil properties in Earth system models and underscore the need to incorporate multivariate interactions when modeling future soil respiration and its feedbacks to global change."

Andersen,The Greenland Ice-Marginal Lake Inventory Series from 2016 to 2023,"We mapped 2918 ice-marginal lakes across Greenland (2016–2023), revealing changes in size, abundance and temperature. This open dataset improves understanding of terrestrial water storage, glacier dynamics, and Arctic ecology, supporting research on sea level rise, glacier-lake interactions, and sustainable resource planning including hydropower development under Greenland’s climate commitments. 
 Ice-marginal lakes form at the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its surrounding peripheral glaciers and ice caps (PGIC), where outflowing glacial meltwater is trapped by a moraine, or by the ice itself, and create a reservoir that is in contact with the adjacent ice. While glacial meltwater is typically assumed to flow directly into the ocean, ice-marginal lakes temporarily store a portion of this runoff, influencing glacier dynamics and ablation, ecosystems, and downstream hydrology. Their presence, and change in abundance and size, remain under-represented in projections of sea level change and glacier mass loss. Here, we present an eight-year (2016–2023) inventory of 2918 automatically classified ice-marginal lakes (≧0.05 km2) across Greenland, tracking changes in lake abundance, surface extent, and summer surface temperature over time. Fluctuations in lake abundance were most pronounced at the north (22 %) and northeast (14 %) PGIC margins and the southwest Ice Sheet margin (8 %). Over the study period, an increase in surface lake area was evident at 283 lakes, a decreasing trend was evident at 240 lakes, and 1373 remained stable (±0.05 km2). The northeast region contained the largest lakes, with a median size of 0.40 km2 at the ice sheet margin and 0.24 km2 at PGIC margins. Average summer surface temperatures fluctuated between 3.8 °C (2018) and 5.3 °C (2023), with spatial and temporal trends identified with possible links to lake setting and size. Validation against manually identified lakes showed 64 % agreement, yielding an error estimate of −809 lakes (36 %), while lake area uncertainty was ±5 %. Surface temperature estimates showed strong agreement with in situ measurements (r2=0.87, RMSE =1.68 °C, error ±1.2 °C). This dataset provides a crucial foundation for quantifying meltwater storage at ice margins and refining sea level contribution projections while supporting research on glacier-lake interactions, Arctic ecology, and environmental management.

The observed increase in the VSCS frequency is closely associated with the enhanced lower‐middle tropospheric relative humidity due to the vertical moisture advection processes. The strengthened upward motion is primarily caused by anomalous positive vorticity advection by mean westerly flows. Through analysis of Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) experiments, it is demonstrated that the mid‐level cyclonic circulation trend is predominantly forced by greenhouse gas emissions, while anthropogenic aerosols exert a dampening effect.

This study utilizes local S‐wave splitting analysis to investigate crustal and upper mantle deformation associated with seamount subduction beneath northern Luzon. Our observations reveal predominantly trench‐normal fast‐axis orientations and frequency‐dependent delay times. These patterns suggest that anisotropy arises primarily from fluid‐filled cracks and possible serpentinization, with effects extending from the overriding crust into the subducting slab, spanning multiple structural depths. In contrast, trench‐parallel directions in southern non‐seamount subduction regions indicate either ductile overriding lithosphere deformation or toroidal mantle flow around the slab edge. Event depth and raypath geometry further indicate that seamount subduction promotes stress heterogeneity and vertical anisotropic layering. These findings demonstrate that subducting features such as seamounts produce distinct anisotropy signatures, offering new insights into subduction dynamics and lithospheric deformation."

In contrast, gravitational collapse in the western Pamir toward the Tajik Basin, is inferred from the anisotropy pattern, which reflects basal shear. Moreover, along‐strike anisotropy near the intermediate‐depth seismic zone delineates a C‐shaped front of the cratonic Indian slab.

Cloud and radiative properties were examined at daily and monthly resolutions in four seasons. Low clouds were found to be most prevalent throughout the year, followed by deep clouds. The ice phase is the dominant phase except for summer (June–August). Liquid and mixed phases show more significant monthly and annual mean radiative effects in SW and LW than the ice phase. The clouds show net warming effects due to LW heating in most months, while the SW cooling effects of clouds become more dominant for July and August.

However, current understanding of the AA pattern as well as the role of sea ice in modulating local feedback requires further refinement. This study investigated the spatial patterns of AA in the past and future and explored the role of sea ice in modulating AA and its local driving mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the intensity and spatial extent of AA peaked around the 2000s, followed by a gradual decline in subsequent decades. AA exhibits distinct geographical specificity, with marginal sea ice zones functioning as perennial amplification cores. These regions maintain active intensification during autumn and winter. There are strong correlations between the rapid decline of sea ice and AA. Fragmented ice acts as a catalyst, amplifying the trans‐seasonal release of the ocean energy mechanism. As sea ice continues to decline and ice‐free periods emerge in summer in the mid‐21st century, we found that the absence of sea ice as a mediator will gradually diminish the warming asymmetry between the Arctic and the globe, according to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 future scenario projections.

We in this study suggest the NAO–NAT relationship is combinedly modulated by the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV)–Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the latent heat flux (LHF) plays a key role during the process. The cyclonic anomaly over the subtropical North Atlantic as the consequence of positive AMV and negative PDO enhances the LHF on the decadal time scale, which promotes consistent covariation in the atmospheric baroclinicity and the eddy‐mean flow interaction. It leads to positive feedback manifesting the NAO–NAT relationship. Conversely, the negative AMV and positive PDO can symmetrically weaken the NAO–NAT relationship. The above mechanism is verified by model experiment.

Kumar,Snow Cover Plays a Non‐Dominant Role in WRF/Noah‐MP Simulated Surface Air Temperature Cold Biases Over the Western U.S.,"Atmospheric models generally exhibit cold biases in 2‐m air temperature (T2) across mountainous regions during snow seasons. This study evaluates whether snow cover errors are the primary driver for the persistent T2 cold bias in coupled WRF/Noah‐MP simulations across the western U.S (WUS) through analyses of T2, ground snow cover fraction (SCF), snow water equivalent (SWE), and surface albedo. Baseline simulations revealed widespread cold biases in maximum daily T2 (T2max), mainly during November–April when snowpack influences the terrestrial energy budget (mean bias = −1.05°C to −1.32°C), with higher elevation areas showing biases up to −5.31°C. Cold biases across the WUS are reduced, on average, by 17%–24% in the simulations using recently enhanced snow compaction and ground SCF parameterizations (hereinafter ARnew) that tend to reduce snow cover and surface albedo. However, notable cold biases still persist in the ARnew simulations, especially in high‐elevation areas, despite underestimates of ground SCF and SWE. Statistical and information theory analyses show very weak connections between T2max biases and biases in ground SCF and SWE. Further, an experiment that imposes unrealistically low ground SCF (mean bias = −75%) still exhibits cold biases, particularly in high‐elevation areas (mean bias for Z > 2,000 m = −1.46°C). These results indicate that snow cover errors can modestly contribute to cold biases but are not their primary cause. Therefore, resolving the cold bias issue will require addressing factors beyond snow cover, potentially including uncertainties in canopy radiative transfer, surface turbulence, and other atmospheric processes in complex terrain."

Here, the authors identify two parallel prefrontal pathways: one that suppresses food seeking during potential threats, and another that drives pleasure-based eating even when animals are satiated. 
 Flexibly adjusting food-seeking behaviour in response to food-associated cues and internal states is crucial for animals’ survival. However, the neural mechanisms that modulate cued food-seeking behaviour during varying metabolic (i.e., hungry vs. satiated) and emotional (i.e., safe vs. threatened) states remain elusive. Here, we show that the encoding of metabolic or threat states in projection-defined neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL) mediates cued food-seeking responses in rats. Using microendoscopic imaging, we demonstrate that neural population dynamics in PL consistently represent food cues, task-relevant behaviours, and internal state changes by recruiting distinct subsets of cue-responsive neurons at each state. Single-unit recording and loss-of-function experiments reveal that activity in divergent PL projections to the anterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promotes either hedonic feeding during satiation or food-seeking suppression during threat, respectively. Together, our findings uncover a mechanism by which divergent PL circuits regulate cued food-seeking under distinct metabolic or emotional states.

 Oral vaccines provide a non-invasive approach for cancer immunotherapy but face challenges in gastrointestinal stability, antigen presentation, and mucosal delivery. Here, we present an engineered probiotic-based oral vaccine system, BacOR-Fn-T+phiX174, featuring genetically encoded dual-antigen ferritin arrays and inducible bacterial lysis.

The authors show that stem growth advances slower than photosynthesis per degree Celsius, creating a phenological mismatch for carbon. 
 The dynamics of carbon allocation in trees affect carbon storage of forest ecosystems and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on Earth. Here, using carbon fluxes and xylem phenology from 84 conifer forests across the Northern Hemisphere, we quantify the phenology of carbon sources (photosynthesis) and sinks (stem growth) along a thermal gradient from −4.4 to 18.2 °C in mean annual temperature. The onset of stem growth advances by 2.3 days per degree Celsius with rising temperatures, 2 times slower than photosynthesis. Warmer sites accumulate less chilling than colder sites, thus trees require more heat to reactivate. The ending of photosynthesis and wood formation is delayed by 2.0 days per degree Celsius. Overall, the photosynthetic season lengthens by one month more than the growing season towards the warmest sites. Climate warming tends to intensify the mismatch between the phenology of carbon sources and sinks, potentially affecting the carbon sequestration in conifer forests.

The authors consider studies reporting species range shifts and demonstrate a geometric bias in sampling along latitudinal, rather than longitudinal, gradients. This bias may favour the corroboration of shift expectations with warming and mask other patterns and drivers of species movements."

Here the authors show that extreme day-to-day temperature changes have distinct impacts on human health and become more frequent and intense in mid- to low latitudes with climate change. 
 Global warming is increasing the number and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events. Here we argue that extreme day-to-day temperature changes, exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of historical records, are an independent, but largely ignored, aspect of extreme weather events. Such extreme temperature changes have a stronger impact on human health in many locations than do diurnal temperature variations. Global observations show that such events have become more frequent since the 1960s in low and mid-latitudes but decreased at high latitudes, primarily due to GHG forcing. Climate models project a further amplification of extreme day-to-day temperature changes under warming, with frequency, amplitude and total intensity rising by ~17%, ~3% and ~20%, respectively, by 2100 in regions covering 80% of global population. Increased extreme day-to-day temperature changes are associated with drier soil and increased variability in pressure and soil moisture, posing substantial risks to societal and ecosystem resilience and adaptation. Climate change is expected to lead to higher day-to-day temperature variability in mid- to low latitudes. Here the authors show that extreme day-to-day temperature changes have distinct impacts on human health and become more frequent and intense in mid- to low latitudes with climate change."

 Multiple climate extremes can coincide in time or happen sequentially and become a compound hazard. Recently, frequent occurrences of successive hot-pluvial extremes (SHPEs) have been presented, yet the risk of SHPEs on crop yield has not been investigated. Here we reveal peril of recurrent occurrences of SHPEs during intra-growing season and their connection with subsequent yield loss over breadbasket regions. Our results show an increasing trend in evolution of recurrent SHPEs during intra-growing seasons from 1979 to 2024. A significant risk of synchronized low crop yields is found in breadbasket regions, as shown by negative yield percentage changes and linear regression analysis. XGBoost classifier model predicts a negative likelihood of 49%, 50%, 49%, and 50% for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat yield responses to the emergence of frequent SHPE events, respectively. Alternatively, XGBoost regression surpasses and explains 36% of yield variability caused by recurrent occurrences of SHPEs globally for the studied crops, although it exhibits heterogeneities across different regions. The insights provide a foundation for considering the actual risk, which ultimately contributes to improving crop yield.

 Most volcanic eruptions occur in high-relief terrains, however the impact of mountainous topography on lava emplacement is poorly constrained. Here we use analogue materials (syrup, glycerol) to investigate lava effusion where changes in channel width form constrictions, leading to fluid/lava backup. Backup magnitude positively correlates with high volumetric fluid/lava fluxes, high fluid/lava viscosities, and narrow constrictions. Viscosity modulates the impacts of slope: steep slopes produce the largest backups when viscosity is high ( ~ 50 Pa s), while shallow slopes produce the largest backups at low viscosities ( ~ 1.5 Pa s). Scaling experimental results to natural systems, we propose lava backup occurs due to three primary reasons: (i) obstacle-flow interaction, (ii) constriction-induced flux imbalance and (iii) choked flow caused by critical flow transition. Lavas inundating constrictive topographies are highly susceptible to backup, causing excess upstream lava inundation and prolonged downstream effusion, increasing the inundation area and extending the time that communities are at risk.

 The world’s energy supply depends critically on hydraulic fracturing (HF) to access otherwise uneconomical resources. Unfortunately, HF also has the potential to induce larger earthquakes – with some projects being prematurely terminated because of perceived earthquake risks. To de-risk HF, we use a suite of statistical tests to discern if some physical process has restricted the growth of earthquake magnitudes. We show that all stage stimulations at both UK PNR-1z and Helsinki St1 indicate bound fracture growth, implying a more controllable operation. Contrastingly, stimulations at Utah FORGE and UK PNR-2 sequentially transitioned into unbound fault reactivation. The problematic stages (that ultimately led to the termination of PNR-2) are clearly distinguishable. We postulate that our research can discriminate fracture stimulation from fault reactivation, contributing to the de-risking of HF operations worldwide. Our statistical tests provide a framework for model falsification, which can guide physical insights into the bounding processes.

 Understanding when and how evolved rocks formed on terrestrial planets remains a fundamental question in planetary geology. Mars preserves ancient surface rocks, providing unique opportunities to study early crustal formation. Here we report extensive detections of feldspathic, possibly anorthositic, rocks uplifted by the Argyre basin-forming impact using orbital remote sensing. The radial distribution of these feldspathic outcrops indicates they originated from the lower martian crust, positioned stratigraphically between olivine-bearing materials and low-calcium pyroxene-bearing upper crustal rocks. This stratigraphy resembles observations at the Hellas basin, suggesting feldspar-rich rocks are widespread in the lower crust. The spatial association of plagioclase-rich outcrops with pyroxene and olivine-bearing units resembles layered mafic intrusions on Earth, suggesting large-scale melting early in Mars’s history produced differentiated igneous complexes. These observations offer direct evidence to support and refine existing models of early crust formation, addressing key questions regarding crustal properties and formation that have lacked widespread observational constraints.

 Cosmic-ray muons are naturally abundant, high-energy particles that can probe geological structures. Muography exploits muon attenuation or scattering to infer density variations, offering a non-invasive and cost-effective method for subsurface studies. We present laboratory and Monte Carlo simulation evidence for density estimation of porous media with varying fluid saturation, measured by coincident muon flux using plastic scintillator detectors. Muon flux was recorded after transmission through acrylic and sand samples of known density and thickness, and the results were validated against simulations that tracked attenuation as a function of density. Muon flux attenuation systematically reflected changes in material density and fluid saturation. Using a Gaussian-filtered dataset and an exponential model, the estimated bulk density of acrylic closely matched the known value (1.19 g cm⁻³), with relative errors decreasing from 11.1% at 20 cm to 0.34% at 80 cm. For variably saturated sands, densities ranged from 1.01 ± 0.12 g cm⁻³ (0% saturation) to 1.54 ± 0.13 g cm⁻³ (100% saturation), with relative errors improving from 21.1% to 10.8%. Numerical simulations reproduced the same attenuation trends, with errors of less than 1%. These findings demonstrate muography’s sensitivity to subtle density variations, highlighting its potential for reservoir monitoring and imaging density-linked fluid dynamics.

 Traditional wildfire fuel management faces critical barriers due to high cost, carbon emissions, and operational risks. While biochar technology offers a solution, the poor awareness of forest fuel biochar hinders its global implementation. Here we produced biochar from boreal and temperature forest surface fuels. Large-scale characterization revealed its composition, performance, and the chemical and molecular changes of the carbon components. The pyrolysis mechanism was clarified, and advanced analysis was integrated to predict functions and quantify the relationships between raw material, pyrolysis conditions, biochar properties, and functions. It was demonstrated that fuel biochar has important functions in mitigating greenhouse benefits, improving soil, and pollution control. The proposed conversion strategy enables permanent carbon dioxide sequestration of at least 383.61-712.18 kg per ton of fuel. We conclude that biochar represents an innovative alternative to conventional fuel management for more effective mitigation of both wildfires and climate warming.

 Potato cultivation in China grew only modestly after the 2015 Potato as Staple Food policy, amid grain crop prioritization. Here, we identified grain crop low-yield regions and compared grain crop versus potato performance in productivity, economics, and carbon emissions using the crop model and life cycle impact assessment model. We found that planting potato in these regions would increase crop productivity by 2%‒119%, lower greenhouse gas emissions and intensities by 6%‒85% and 26%‒92%, respectively, while the economic returns increased from generally lower than $600 for the original crops to over $1600 per hectare. However, switching to potato in low-yield wheat and maize regions would reduce calorie supply by over 70%, though these reductions would not affect overall caloric provision at the national level. Our results show that substituting traditional crops with potato offers multiple benefits, enhancing productivity and economic returns while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions, with minimal trade-offs in China.

 The accurate three-dimensional (3D) distribution of plant area density (PAD) within forests is crucial for understanding canopy structure and provides essential scene inputs for 3D Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) to facilitate remote sensing interpretation. However, current lidar-based voxelization methods that estimate detailed PAD distributions often cover limited areas, constraining their applications in conducting broad forest studies and interpreting Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data of various scales and resolutions. To address this, we developed the Large-Scale Path Volume Leaf Area Density (LS-PVlad), a novel forest 3D reconstruction workflow capable of producing extensive high-resolution 3D voxelized forest scenes (up to 100 km2 with ≤2 m voxel size) from worldwide open-access airborne lidar scanning (ALS) data. By applying LS-PVlad to the ALS data acquired during the extensive NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) campaigns, we developed the first release of FoScenes—a high-fidelity PAD product comprising 40 seamless scenes from 28 diverse forest sites, with individual area ranging from ∼50 to ∼11,000 ha. The leaf area estimates of LS-PVlad have been validated by two-year field-measured leaf area index (LAI) from litter collection (best RMSE = 0.35 m2/m2) and digital hemispherical photography (DHP) images (RMSE = 0.46 m2/m2) across multiple plots at a deciduous forest site. Additionally, a broad comparison between FoScenes and MODIS plant/leaf area index product demonstrates high consistency (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.86 m2/m2).

 The vegetation greening trend resulting from afforestation in the Southwest China’s karst (SCK) area has attracted significant research attention. Identifying the interannual variation in net primary productivity (NPP), its sustained reaction to climate change, and differences between new and old forests before and after afforestation is vital in assessing the effect of the climate on the carbon sink potential of ecosystems. Using monthly NPP and climate data for 1981–2019, ensemble empirical mode decomposition was employed for the extraction of the interannual signal, and new and old forests were compared based on changepoint detection and forest-age data. According to the results, (1) NPP change significantly increased in 1981–2019; after 2001, the NPP growth rate in new forests was 1.47 times that in the old forests, indicating greater carbon sink potential. (2) NPP was sensitive to climate change on an interannual scale, and the sensitivity increased further after 2001. (3) Additionally, the main determinant of NPP in old and new forests shifted from precipitation to soil surface water content after 2001,which closely aligns with the implementation of large-scale ecological restoration projects. The findings reveal that afforestation reinforces water constraints and shifts the dominant climatic control, providing a basis for evaluation of ecological restoration effectiveness in the SCK area and supporting incorporation of water and carbon trade-offs into afforestation planning and routine forest management.

 Crop yield prediction at a fine spatial scale is crucial for improving agricultural management and resource allocations. Many countries and regions lack fine-scale yield data for fine-scale modeling and thus have to use a “cross-scale pathway”, where coarse-scale (e.g., state-level) data are used to train a model for fine-scale (e.g., county-level or field-level) yield predictions. However, the cross-scale pathway has limited effectiveness in predicting yield due to issues with data availability and model scalability. In this study, we quantify the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway. We applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a previously trained and validated AI-based machine learning model, originally developed for field-level soybean yield predictions in the United States, using Brazilian state-level data to predict Brazilian municipal-level soybean yield. Despite differences in environmental conditions, crop phenology, and yield responses between the U.S. and Brazil, we show that transfer learning improves the municipal-level predictions from the cross-scale pathway by increasing the R2 from 0.29 (without transfer learning) to 0.44. Notably, this is achieved without using any municipal-level data and relying only on scarce state-level observations. When the municipal-level data were used, the transfer learning achieved an R2 of 0.57, the most stable high performance compared with previous studies. The effectiveness of the cross-scale pathway, thus, increases from 50% to 78% with transfer learning. These findings demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway under data-limited conditions, and underscore the potential for global crop yield predictions across scales."

 Slums are densely populated urban areas characterized by substandard housing and squalor. These areas often lack basic infrastructure and services, making them challenging to manage and improve. Mapping slums on a large scale is particularly difficult due to their complex, dynamic, and non-uniform nature and the scarcity of available data. This study employs deep learning and uncertainty estimation to map slum areas in 55 diverse cities. We tackle the issues of scarce labels, noisy labels, and class imbalance to produce reliable slum probability maps. Applied to a large dataset from the Global South, our method approximates probability values to each image, yielding a more granular view of slum morphology within each city. We achieve this by combining Monte Carlo sampling through test-time augmentation, test-time dropout on overlapping image tiles, and an ensemble of four CNNs. The resulting probability maps not only quantify prediction uncertainty but also reveal morphological patterns of slum settlements. Our findings underscore the diversity and complexity of slums, contributing to a more complete understanding of these environments. A key result is our large-scale workflow, which, despite limited data, groups predictions by probability into multiple slum categories defined by their morphological traits. This approach offers a substantial improvement over traditional binary slum classification methods that focus solely on typical slum morphologies."

 The European Union has implemented policies to promote renewable energy, with an emphasis on biomass for heat generation.

This study characterised the organic and inorganic composition, oxidative potential (OP), and ecotoxicity of PM10 indoors and outdoors during the operation of two heating appliances fuelled with different types of biomasses: a modern hydronic stove and a traditional wood stove. PM10 concentrations were higher in the room equipped with the traditional system during the combustion of briquettes (95.9 ± 74.9 μg m−3) and firewood (50.1 ± 25.6 μg m−3), compared to the modern stove using pellets (27.1 ± 11.8 μg m−3) and olive stone (23.0 ± 4.5 μg m−3). While element oxides accounted for similar PM10 mass fractions (7 %), the wood stove produced higher levels of organic constituents, including carbonaceous fractions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), quinones and saccharides. Significant correlations between OP assays and concentrations of PAHs, quinones and phenolic compounds were found in the room equipped with wood stove, with indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratios higher than 1. In contrast, I/O ratios below 1 were observed for OP in PM10 samples collected during hydronic stove operation.

 Unique observations from the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX Phase-IV) revealed the complex multi-layer structure of monsoon clouds, offering key insights into their microphysical and thermodynamic processes. This study investigates the influence of vertically layered aerosol distributions on cloud microphysical properties over the rain-shadow region of India, focusing on three distinct cloud layers: a highly polluted boundary layer cloud, a cleaner mid-layer cloud, and a polluted upper-level cloud. Results show that aerosol layering significantly influences warm cloud microphysics of the layer clouds, including cloud drop radius, liquid water content, spectral width, and cloud droplet number concentration. The drop size distribution (DSD) and particle size distribution (PSD) across the three cloud layers indicated that the middle cloud layer developing under extremely clean conditions exhibited a significantly broader DSD and PSD compared to the other two layers, which formed in environments with slightly higher aerosol loading. Such extremely clean conditions, characterized by cloud droplet number concentrations below 20 cm−3, are rare over continental regions. The upper portion of the top stratiform cloud was characterized by a high concentration of dendritic ice particles, with sizes ranging from 300 to 3000 μm. Just below this dendritic layer, numerous supercooled drizzle drops were observed, with significant aircraft icing. The microphysical characteristics of both the dendritic ice zone and the underlying icing layer containing supercooled drizzle drops were investigated. This study presents observational evidence of the complex vertical structure of monsoon clouds and highlights the role of layered aerosol distributions in modulating cloud microphysical properties, providing constraints for the improvement of cloud process representations in weather and climate models."

Our results show these severe weather events can be attributed to two pathways of El Niño's influence. The strong ISO cold events were characterized by an amplified Siberian High, developed from a North Atlantic (NA)‐originating Rossby wave train. The El Niño modulated the NA jet stream by strengthening, extending it eastward, and increasing its southwest–northeast tilt, which reinforced cold‐air circulation regime via interactions between the seasonal background flow and ISO perturbations. Meanwhile, El Niño strengthened the western North Pacific anticyclone, enhancing moisture transport for freezing rain formation. The two pathways of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts can be found in most ENSO years, implying that ENSO is an important source of subseasonal forecast of extreme cold‐wet events in China."

However, intense subsurface scattering has long hindered high‐resolution seismic imaging of its magma plumbing system. To overcome this challenge, we apply an improved matrix‐imaging method to generate a high‐resolution crustal reflectivity model beneath MSH. The resulting model reveals a multilayered architecture dominated by a laterally extensive reflector that coincides with the top of the Siletz terrane. This horizon likely acts as both a primary accumulation platform and a mechanically sensitive gate. Southeast‐directed reflectors spatially coincide with a mid‐lower‐crust low‐velocity column and delineate potential fluid/melt pathways. Episodic inputs along this corridor may recharge the shallow system. These processes could modulate eruptive style.

Furthermore, a coupled pore network‐discrete element solver is used to validate the proposed parameters by capturing permeability evolution trends observed in the laboratory. Our analyses reveal a competition between pore clogging due to reaction product formation and pore dilation due to volume expansion and fracturing, showing the emergence of steady state in systems characterized by different initial porosity. Notably, two distinct regimes are found, one dominated by clogging and permeability loss, and the other controlled by fracturing, pore expansion, and permeability increase.

The framework begins by pretraining an unconditional diffusion model to approximate the joint distribution of subsurface parameters and state variables, effectively capturing prior information of dynamical systems. By leveraging Bayesian conditional sampling, the model flexibly incorporates specific constraints and adapts to multiple modeling tasks without retraining or fine‐tuning. Furthermore, we devise a training‐free knowledge alignment strategy that embeds domain‐specific knowledge into the sampling process to generate spatiotemporal fields more compatible with physical principles. Extensive evaluations on diverse subsurface flow problems demonstrate that a single pretrained diffusion model, equipped with optimized generative paths, delivers superior performance in unconditional generation, forward prediction, uncertainty quantification, and inverse modeling with sparse and noisy data. These findings underscore the potential of knowledge‐aligned generative learning to advance subsurface flow modeling research."

An in‐depth knowledge of dynamical processes underpinning the ocean heat uptake (OHU) is crucial for accurately projecting anthropogenic climate changes. Mesoscale eddies contribute importantly to heat transport in the ocean, but their effects on the OHU remain poorly understood. Based on a high‐resolution climate simulation from a community earth system model, we find that mesoscale eddy vertical heat transport (EVHT), upward at the climatological mean state, is projected to weaken under global warming. This corresponds to an anomalous downward heat transport, facilitating the ocean absorption of heat surplus from the atmosphere and its storage in the deep ocean. Numerical sensitivity experiments suggest that the anthropogenic EVHT change could contribute to about 20% of the OHU by the end of the 21st century under a high carbon emission scenario."

However, direct evidence for clay dissolution on Earth surface remains limited, and the controlling factors are poorly understood. Here, we suggest that δ7Li of fine sediments can serve as a proxy for clay dissolution. We analyzed δ7Li of the sediments from the Ocean Drilling Program site 1148, and developed a stoichiometric model to disentangle the respective contributions of source rock fragments and marine authigenic aluminosilicate clays to the sediment Li budget.

It boosts oxide film release rate to 600 mm2 /min via electric field-enhanced adsorption energy and electron transfer. 
 Developing an efficient and non-destructive stripping method suitable for most fragile freestanding films is essential for developing industrial semiconductor integration and flexible devices. Here, we propose a rapid stripping process of directional electrodynamic decomposition based on the conductive LaNiO3 sacrificial layer, which can effectively overcome the surface tension during solution penetration. Notably, the release rate of oxide films can be increased to 600 mm2/min, which is two orders of magnitude more than that of traditional soaking method, ascribed to the improvement of the adsorption energy and electron transfer by the electric field. The electrodynamic stripping efficiency is not limited by thickness and area size of sacrificial layers and enables non-destructive and scalable fabrication of freestanding films. The crack-free 3-inch freestanding PbZrO3 epitaxial membrane represents the largest ferroelectric-based membrane achieved to date, which enables its direct integration into flexible piezoelectric sensor array. Intriguingly, a record-breaking 12-inch polycrystalline membrane has been developed to address the requirements of industrial-scale semiconductor manufacturing. The strain-relaxed PbZrO3 membranes exhibit the hysteresis loop of the antiferroelectric transition to ferroelectric. This electrodynamic approach with conductive sacrificial layer will greatly improve the stripping efficiency of high-quality functional freestanding membranes, thereby promoting their application in wafer-level electronic devices.

 Blood biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are promising for dementia prediction, but their association with progression across intermediate stages of cognitive decline in the general population remains unclear. We followed 2148 dementia-free individuals from a Swedish population-based cohort for up to 16 years. Associations between baseline AD blood biomarkers and transitions between normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia were examined. Lower amyloid-β42/40 ratio and higher phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181), p-tau217, total-tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were associated with faster progression from MCI to all-cause and AD dementia, with the strongest associations for NfL and p-tau217. Elevated NfL and GFAP were linked to reduced MCI reversion to normal cognition, whereas no biomarker was associated with MCI development from normal cognition.

 Tailed bacteriophages comprise the largest structural family of viruses with close relatives in archaea and the eukaryotic herpesviruses. The common assembly pathway produces an icosahedrally symmetric protein shell, called capsid, into which the double-stranded DNA genome is packaged. While capsid sizes and amino acid sequences vary considerably, the major capsid protein (MCP) folds are remarkably similar throughout the family. To investigate the mechanisms governing capsid size, we characterize the procapsid and mature capsid of phage D3, which expresses an icosahedral lattice with Triangulation number T = 9. We find that the MCP scaffold domain binds to the interior capsid surface, acting as a clamp to constrain subunit interactions. Following scaffold digestion, the MCP capsid domains form strong interactions that maintain capsid structure throughout maturation. The scaffold constraints appear critical for capsid size determination and provide important understanding of the factors governing capsid assembly in general and expands our understanding of these ecologically and biomedically important viruses.

 The Brazilian Amazon is severely impacted by extreme climate events, with 1.8 million people (6.4% of the Brazilian Amazon’s population) affected by climate-related disasters each year between 2018 and 2022. Yet, how climate disasters specifically affect human populations in different municipalities in the Amazon is underexplored. We target this gap, presenting a region-wide spatiotemporal assessment of climate-related disasters and social vulnerability across the Brazilian Amazon over the period 2000–2022, considering floods, droughts, heatwaves, fires, and landslides, and using a compound risk lens. Analysis of secondary data shows disaster frequency surged, with wet events rising fivefold, fires tenfold, and droughts and heatwaves tripling. Economic losses rose 370% reaching USD 634.2 million annually, with wet events most damaging. Farming sustained over 60% of total losses, followed by infrastructure, housing, and health services. Smaller municipalities, which host 61% of the region’s Indigenous population, experienced the highest relative impacts, including a 9.58% loss in economic growth and lower Social Progress Index scores. Data on non-economic losses and damages were lacking, but further exacerbated the impacts in these vulnerable areas.

 Predicted climate change over land indicates decreasing precipitation in many regions and increased flooding in others. Globally, over 60% of land precipitation is consumed by evapotranspiration (ET); the remainder, available as runoff, recharge, and for consumption, is termed water yield (WY). Using a global dataset, we show that ET from ecosystems reaches a ‘saturation’ limit of about 480 ± 210 mm yr⁻¹ across climates and biomes, well below the energy-based limit predicted by the Budyko equation. This inflexibility in ET increases the sensitivity of WY to precipitation variability, implying enhanced vulnerability to flooding in wet regions and an accelerated approach to the limits of ecosystem and societal sustainability in dry regions. Both effects are also supported by model-based projections. WY thus provides a more sensitive and integrative indicator of climate impacts on terrestrial water resources and associated risks for ecosystems and society.

 Reconstructing past relative sea level provides critical insight into mechanisms driving sea-level change and informs future projections. Foraminifera are widely used sea-level proxies, but their application is often limited by poor preservation. Here, we demonstrate that foraminiferal environmental DNA and sedimentary ancient DNA provide a complementary approach to traditional morphological methods for relative sea-level reconstruction.

 Accurate high-resolution precipitation data are essential for hydrometeorological research, but existing products often exhibit significant accuracy variations due to sensor characteristics, climatic factors, and complex terrain. Current bias-correction methods have substantial limitations, neglecting spatiotemporal variability and relying on sparse gauge networks. To address these challenges, a novel daily precipitation bias-correction approach called BCFS (based on precipitation feature space construction and gauge–satellite fusion) is proposed. BCFS constructs a unified precipitation feature space by integrating spatial patterns with temporal attributes. BCFS was tested in China's Han River basin (1998–2020) using gauge observations and CHIRPS data, and its performance was compared against uncorrected CHIRPS estimates and the WHU-SGCC method. BCFS reduced relative bias by 74.46 %, 85.49 %, 99.98 %, 98.69 %, 35.78 %, and 27.78 % across precipitation intensities relative to uncorrected CHIRPS. It also outperformed WHU-SGCC, improving accuracy for below-average precipitation and reducing biases at higher intensities. Validation in the Jinsha River basin confirmed regional applicability, demonstrating improved extreme precipitation indices and revealing increasing trends in spring extreme events in the basin's upper reaches. Overall, BCFS effectively captures precipitation spatiotemporal characteristics and overcomes limitations of existing fusion methods, substantially improving daily precipitation estimates in gauge-sparse regions. These improvements provide robust support for hydrometeorological monitoring and extreme-event forecasting."

However, understanding the intricate dynamics of drought propagation remains challenging because of spatiotemporal variability and interactions among multiple drought types, including meteorological drought (MD), agricultural drought (AD), and hydrological drought (HD). Traditional analytical methods struggle to capture these complexities, particularly when using high-dimensional time series data characterized by nonlinear causality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cause–effect-based framework that integrates the process-based Community Land Model (CLM5), a causal inference method (Peter–Clark momentary conditional independence (PCMCI)-CMIsymb), and causal effect (CE) analysis to investigate drought propagation across multiple time scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. CLM5 provides high-resolution spatiotemporal drought estimations, PCMCI-CMIsymb detects nonlinear causal relationships, and CE analysis quantifies propagation probabilities across varying time lags. The results demonstrate that (a) drought propagation patterns vary by time scale, with short-term (1 month) propagation occurring primarily from MD to AD, whereas long-term (12 month) propagation extends from MD to both AD and HD; (b) subregional HDs tend to influence each other across regions, with stronger interconnections observed at long-term time scales; and (c) the likelihood of drought propagation differs spatially, with higher probabilities of MD propagation into AD and HD in the middle and lower YRB at the 6 month time scale, mostly peaking at 40%–60% with a 1 month lag. This study presents an advanced analytical framework for drought assessment, providing insights for improving drought mitigation and water resource management, particularly in regions affected by spatial hydroclimatic variability."

Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) are tasked with a UN dual-mandate to ensure the (1) long-term conservation of fish stocks and their associated ecosystems while managing the (2) sustainable use of high seas fisheries. Building on a previous analysis, we developed 10 questions each for our 10 categories (e.g. catch targets, transparency, bycatch). These 100 questions were both descriptive (e.g. are there quantitative results of bycatch improvement?) while others indicated intent (e.g. are there plans to rebuild all declining stocks?) and used publicly available information to evaluate 16 RFMOs (with a score of 0, 0.5, or 1). The average score for all RFMOs out of 100 was 46 (max 61.5, min 29.5). There were six questions for which all RFMOs received a 0, 90 questions for which at least one RFMO scored a one, and a ‘best case’ score of 76.5 that aggregated the highest RFMO score across the 10 categories. This indicates a competence gap; no RFMO is achieving what is empirically documented as possible in one RFMO or another. We also analyzed satellite-derived fishing activity and target stock status. Five RFMO convention areas had the highest overall and density of fishing effort. On average, 56% of stocks targeted in RFMO convention areas were considered overexploited or collapsed. We did not find that RFMO scores were correlated with better management outcomes (i.e. target stock status and fishing effort). However, we found correlations between better target stock status and questions assessing protected area adoption, banning transshipment at-sea, and reducing allowable catches in response to overfishing—policies that few RFMOs have fully adopted. These findings indicate ways for RFMOs to improve high seas fisheries management that are immediately available and effective."

Recent analyses of field experiments suggest that increasing crop rotational complexity (RC) builds resilience to climate change, especially when rotations include overwintering cover crops that assimilate and retain nutrients and increase organic matter inputs to soil. However, evidence from working farms is lacking. We used field-scale remote sensing to assess relationships between crop diversification and agroecosystem climate resilience from 2008 to 2019 in Michigan, the most agriculturally diverse state in the US Midwest. Using panel fixed effects models and linear regressions, we assessed how corn and soybean yield and temporal yield stability (measured as the coefficient of variation) respond to: (1) an index of crop RC that encompasses species turnover and functional diversity, and (2) replacing bare fallows with winter cover crops. We also tested how cover crops influence corn and soybean planting dates as an indicator of resilience to heavy spring rainfall. We found that crop diversification was linked to higher corn and soybean yields, but cover crops showed more promise for improving yield stability than overall RC. Cover crops reduced planting delays associated with heavy spring rainfall, and did not interfere with primary crop planting under average weather conditions. However, cover crop benefits for resilience took multiple years to appear on farms, highlighting the importance of technical and financial support during the early phases of transition. Together these findings may promote cover crop adoption by reducing concerns that cover crops interfere with primary crop planting, and instead showing that they are a crucial tool for minimizing risk from increasingly variable and extreme climatic conditions."

Notably, nearly one-third of the heatwave-induced decline in the intracity trip rate can be attributed to the added effect of sustained periods of extreme heat beyond the temperature–mobility relationship. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on these estimates suggest that the 2023 Chinese summer heatwave led to nationwide mobility reductions on a scale equivalent to suspending all intracity and inbound trips in Shanghai, one of China’s largest and busiest cities, for an entire week. Moreover, the adverse impacts of heatwaves on human mobility are particularly pronounced in cities of small size and with limited economic resources and green spaces, highlighting the urgent need to enhance the heatwave resilience of these cities."

Our empirical strategy employs a difference-in-differences estimator within an event-study framework to identify the causal impact of democratization on the adoption of agri-environmental policy measures. The results show that democratic transitions lead to a significant increase in the adoption of such policies. In the short to medium run (within six years), democratization causes a +25% increase in the number of agri-environmental policies compared to a counterfactual scenario under autocracy. In the long run, this effect persists and is likely to grow further. These newly implemented policies predominantly address biodiversity protection, fertilizer use, forest conservation, and soil erosion. We find no systematic evidence of heterogeneous effects among democracies based on characteristics such as government type, electoral system, levels of political corruption, or international integration. The relevance of these findings is heightened by current global political developments, as many democracies are experiencing institutional backsliding.

In this study, we present the first global-scale assessment of sustainable groundwater head declines, defined as the maximum permissible drop in groundwater head that avoids environmental harm. With a global-scale hydrological-groundwater model coupling (VIC-WUR-MODFLOW) at 5 arcmin resolution, we simulated groundwater discharge and head under natural conditions. Using these values, we isolated mean groundwater levels during low-flow, intermediate-flow, and high-flow periods to estimate historic sustainable groundwater head declines. We compared our estimates with observations and simulations to assess the historic sustainability of groundwater use practices. Globally, the median sustainable groundwater head decline was 4.5 m between 1984–2018. Tropical regions (e.g. Amazon Basin, southeast Asia) exhibited greater sustainably available groundwater due to high recharge, while arid regions (e.g. western United States, South Africa) exhibited limited capacities. Comparisons with historic groundwater head revealed that several key agricultural regions (e.g. Indo-Gangetic Plain, North China Plain, Central Valley) exceeded sustainable limits by more than 20 m, corresponding to overexploitations of sustainable resources by more than 150%. In contrast, much of Europe and North America remained within sustainable boundaries when assessed at the aquifer-scale, although localized overexploitation was still evident. We also identified emerging hotspots (e.g. Iran, northern Africa) where groundwater head declines approached sustainable thresholds over the study period. As freshwater demands continue to rise, these regions may become future hotspots of unsustainable groundwater use without intervention.

We completed a literature review and summarized data from two papers to better understand how technology type influences conclusions regarding bird mortality at USSE facilities. We found 16 papers addressing bird mortality at USSE primarily from the United States where authors pooled data across fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker panel photovoltaic (PV) facilities, despite fixed-tilt facilities trending substantially downward in installed capacity in the U.S. in the last 10 years. Our summary revealed that data to support the lake effect hypothesis is sparse when data from fixed-tilt panel facilities developed prior to the commercial transition to anti-reflective coating (ARC) are separated from tracker panel facilities. A dataset from a single fixed-tilt PV facility built prior to the ARC transition was used in eight papers and cited by 14 of the 16 papers that discussed aquatic bird mortality. This single dataset underpins the entire lake effect hypothesis discussion in the scientific literature. Despite this facility being unrepresentative of current USSE facilities, conclusions drawn from these data have been broadly applied to all PV USSE facilities. Overall, our findings show that it is important for researchers to separate data by technology type, and for regulators to understand that avian mortality trends associated with older solar facilities might not be applicable to modern USSE installations."

The measurement occurred between November 2022 and December 2023, and samples were collected at 1 min interval, resulting in 5155 014 (3580 site-days) and 1190 620 (827 site-days) site-minutes of valid data from the fixed and rotating sites, respectively. The 130 monitoring sites covered a variety of geographic and land-use factors across diverse neighborhoods and sources. We computed several noise metrics, including 1 h (LAeq1 h), daily (LAeq24 h), day-time (Lday), and night-time (Lnight). Daily noise (LAeq24 h) levels across the city ranged between 38 dBA and 85 dBA. Commercial, business, and industrial (CBI) and high-density residential (HD) communities experienced the highest noise levels, with some sites constantly above 70 dBA at day and 65 dBA at night. About 63% of our observed day-time values (up to ∼72% in some areas) exceeded the Rwandan day-time standard (55 dBA) for residential areas, whereas 69% of the observed night-time values (up to 80% in some areas) exceeded the corresponding night-time standard (45 dBA). In Nyarugenge, the most urbanized district, as much as 75% of our site-days data exceeded day-time standard. However diurnal patterns throughout the city were similar, rising from ∼5 am, peaking at about 8 am and plateauing until 6 pm before falling to their lowest at midnight. Overall, noise levels in the city did not vary much by day of the week, weekdays vs weekend, or dry vs wet seasons. Environmental noise in Kigali often exceeded both Rwandan standards and international guidelines, with residents in the city center district, CBI and HD areas at risk of higher exposure, and hence higher risk of adverse effects. Detailed assessment of the sources, at-risk population, and associated health effects may inform Rwandan’s environmental policy efforts and city initiatives in the face of the ongoing urban growth and densification."

We used NASA’s Earth system model to perform the experiments and utilized the moisture-based impact metrics and hydrological variables to investigate the effect of volcanically induced conditions that govern plant productivity. This study highlights Mt. Pinatubo's impact on the drivers of plant productivity and regional and seasonal dependence of these drivers. 
 Large volcanic eruptions can significantly influence the climate system by altering the stratospheric sulfate concentrations, atmospheric radiative balance, stratospheric and surface temperature, and regional hydroclimate. A comprehensive understanding of the volcanically-driven regional hydroclimate response is essential for assessing the socio-economic implications of such short-term episodic climate perturbations, which can lead to droughts, with potential significant impacts to vulnerable civilizations that depend on flooding as a natural crops irrigation mechanism. However, the regional rainfall response to volcanic forcings is substantially dominated by the natural variability in the rainfall response, and which creates a gap in our understanding of how eruptions affect ecohydrological conditions and plant productivity. Here, we explore the understudied store (soil moisture) and flux (evapotranspiration) of water as the short-term ecohydrological control over plant productivity in response to the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. We used the NASA's Earth system model for modeling of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption and detect the ensuing hydroclimate responses. The model simulates a mean surface cooling of ∼ 0.5 °C following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The rainfall response is spatially heterogeneous with large temporal variability, yet still shows suppressed rainfall in the northern hemisphere after the eruption. We find that up to 10 %–15 % of land regions show a statistically significant hydroclimate response (wet and dry) as calculated by the Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) and Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (ETDI). Results confirm that these impact metrics successfully present a more robust understanding of plant productivity. Our results also explain the geographical dependence of various contributing factors to the compound response and their implications for exploring the climate impacts of such episodic forcings."

We evaluate the Australian climate model using aerosol observations and find it underestimates aerosol number often by over 50%. Model changes were tested to improve aerosol concentrations, but some of our changes had severe negative effects on the larger climate system, highlighting issues in aerosol-cloud interaction modelling. 
 The interaction of natural marine aerosol with clouds and radiation is a significant source of climate model uncertainty. The Southern Ocean represents a key area to understand these interactions, and a region where significant model biases exist. Here we provide an evaluation of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator atmosphere model which includes a double-moment aerosol scheme. We evaluate against measurements of condensation nuclei (N10) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number from seven ship campaigns and three terrestrial locations, spanning the years 2015–2019. We find that N10 is heavily underestimated in the model across all regions and seasons by more than 50 % and in some cases by over 80 % at higher latitudes. CCN is also strongly underestimated over marine and Antarctic regions, often by more than 50 %. We then perform seven sensitivity tests to explore different aerosol configurations. We find that updating the dimethyl sulfide climatology and turning on the primary marine organic aerosol flux marginally improves marine CCN by between 4 %–9 %. N10 was reduced by between 3 %–9 %. The Southern Ocean radiative bias is also reduced by this combination of changes, with limited adverse effects. We also test altering the sea spray flux to use wind gust instead of mean wind speed. This significantly improved CCN in the marine regions, but resulted in detrimental impacts on the region's radiation budget, indicating that drastically improving the Southern Ocean's CCN budget may lead to poorer simulations of the global climate."

We found that ice particle changes depend strongly on temperature, humidity conditions, and turbulence. We also found that turbulence and the presence of supercooled liquid water often occur together, and when they do, ice particle growth is especially strong. These findings help scientists to improve weather models. 
 Ice microphysical processes are inherently complex because of their sensitivity to temperature and humidity, the diversity of ice crystal habits, and their interaction with supercooled liquid water (SCL) and turbulence. Long-term surface-based radar observations have been systematically used to unravel the different processes that affect ice particle growth. In this study, we present a statistical analysis of 6.5 years of Ka-band radar observations in Arctic cloud systems, combined with thermodynamic profiles derived from radiosonde measurements. For the first time, ice particle growth and sublimation – diagnosed from vertical gradients of radar reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity – are systematically mapped across a broad range of temperature and moisture conditions. These vertical gradients correspond closely to saturation levels relative to ice and exhibit a strong temperature dependence in supersaturated regions. Notably, distinct signatures near −15 °C are indicative of dendritic growth. Turbulence, quantified via the eddy dissipation rate (EDR), is most frequently observed in regions containing SCL. The co-occurrence of SCL and elevated turbulence results in significantly enhanced ice particle growth compared to conditions in which either is present alone.This work provides new observational constraints that are critical for improving the representation of ice microphysics in atmospheric models."

We simulated lower atmospheric scattering during two mid-latitude auroral events and confirmed that scattering can lead to line-of-sight speed biases, thereby increasing the horizontal differences between opposite cardinal directions. This scattering impact needs to be carefully considered in thermospheric dynamics analysis. 
 Scattered airglow emissions in the lower atmosphere can bias ground-based interferometer observations of thermospheric winds, particularly when airglow brightness becomes spatially uneven due to auroras. During two geomagnetic storms with visible auroras on 10 May and 10 October 2024, the Doppler Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne (DASH) and Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometers concurrently detected atypical winds at Siziwang (SIZW, 41.83° N, 111.93° E), suspected to be caused by scattering. These atypical winds, characterized by horizontal differences exceeding 400 m s−1 between opposite cardinal directions (N-S or E-W) and downwelling exceeding 100 m s−1, showed a strong temporal association with airglow brightness. By modelling the transmission of scattered airglow emissions, we calculate post-scattering wind speeds as the initial wind speeds weighted by both scattered and direct intensities. With fixed initial winds (100 m s−1 westward, 400 m s−1 southward, zero vertical wind), the simulation reproduces horizontal differences of approximately 400 m s−1 on 10 May and 100 m s−1 on 10 October, both capturing the temporal characteristics of the atypical winds. The simulation shows that scattering-induced biases on line-of-sight speed take their sign from the brighter region, while their magnitude varies directionally with the angle to that region: at 45° elevation, biases 135–180° azimuth away exceed those in the brighter region by more than 10 times. Limited by uncertainties in airglow images and optical depth of model inputs, the simulation incurs numerical errors of roughly 75 % during some periods. Effective correction of the scattering impact will require improved accuracy of model inputs in the future."

The results reveal a significant expansion in cropland, particularly for soybean, leading to a substantial reduction in natural vegetation such as forests and grasslands. The datasets can be used to assess the impacts of cropland expansion on water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles in South America. 
 South America is a global hotspot for land use and land cover (LULC) change, marked by dramatic agricultural land expansion and deforestation. While previous studies have documented land use and land cover changes in South America over recent decades, there is still a lack of spatially explicit and time-series maps of crop types that capture shifts in crop distribution. Therefore, developing high-resolution, long-term, and crop-specific datasets is crucial for advancing our understanding of human–environment interactions and for assessing the impacts of agricultural activities on carbon and biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, and climate. In this study, we integrated multi-source data, including high-resolution remote sensing data, model-based data, and historical agricultural census data, to reconstruct the historical dynamics of four major commodity crops (i.e., soybean, maize, wheat, and rice) in South America at an annual timescale and 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution from 1950 to 2020. The results showed that soybean and maize cultivation expanded rapidly in South America by encroaching on other vegetation (i.e., forest, pasture/rangeland, and unmanaged grass/shrubland) over the past 70 years, whereas wheat and rice areas remained relatively stable. Specifically, soybean is one of the most dramatically expanded crops, increasing from essentially zero in 1950 to 48.8 Mha in 2020, resulting in a total loss of 23.92 Mha of other vegetation. In addition, the area of maize increased by a factor of 2.1 from 12.7 Mha in 1950 to 26.9 Mha in 2020. The newly developed crop type dataset provides important insights for assessing the impacts of cropland expansion on crop production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon and nitrogen cycles in South America. Moreover, these data are instrumental for developing national policies, sustainable trade, investment, and development strategies aimed at securing food supply and other human and environmental objectives in South America.

This is often lacking in current disaster databases. Our dataset fills this gap by integrating impact records with information on disaster locations, high-resolution meteorological data, and population estimates. Covering 382 disasters in 71 countries (1979–2018), this dataset enables deeper analyses of heat-related risk and vulnerabilities. 
 International databases of disaster impacts are crucial for advancing disaster risk research, particularly as climate change intensifies the frequency and intensity of many natural hazards – including temperature extremes. However, many widely-used disaster impact databases lack information on the physical dimension of the hazards associated with an impact, and on the exposure to such hazards. This hinders analysing drivers of severe disaster outcomes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present SHEDIS-Temperature, a dataset that provides Subnational Hazard and Exposure information for temperature-related DISaster impact records (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WNOTTC; Lindersson and Messori, 2025). This open-access dataset links temperature-related impact records from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) with subnational data on their locations, associated meteorological time series, and population maps. SHEDIS-Temperature provides hazard and exposure data for 2835 subnational locations associated with 382 disaster records from 1979–2018 in 71 countries. Detailed hazard metrics, derived from 0.1° 3 hourly data, encompass absolute indicators, such as the heat stress measure apparent temperature accounting for humidity and wind speed, as well as percentile-based indicators of when and where temperatures exceeded local thresholds. Population exposure data include annual population figures for impacted subnational administrative units and person-days of exposure to threshold-exceeding temperatures. Outputs are available at grid-point level as well as zonally aggregated to administrative subdivision units, and disaster-record levels. Technical validation against a station-based dataset indicated minor systematic biases – slightly overestimated minimum and underestimated maximum temperatures – but confirmed high consistency between datasets, with correlation coefficients ≥0.9 and mean absolute errors ≤2 °C. By providing comprehensive attributes across the hazard-exposure spectrum, SHEDIS-Temperature supports interdisciplinary research on past temperature-related disasters, offering valuable insights for future risk mitigation and resilience strategies."

The data has a spatial resolution of one kilometer, which means it provides highly localized precipitation information. To estimate precipitation for a specific day in the past, we searched for days in the recent radar data period with similar weather patterns, known as the analog method. The median of the produced dataset is available for public use and can be found on Zenodo. 
 High-resolution gridded precipitation data is scarce, especially at time intervals shorter than daily. However hydrological applications for example benefit from a finer temporal resolution of rainfall information. In this context, we introduce an hourly precipitation dataset for Belgium, featuring a resolution of 1 km. An hourly high-resolution gridded precipitation product over Belgium can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of both short-term and long-term rainfall events, which can be used for wide-ranging applications such as flash flood forecasting and warning systems, studying precipitation extremes and trends, validating weather and climate models or detecting changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change. Similar products such as EURADCLIM (Europe) (Overeem et al., 2023) and RADKLIM (Germany) (Winterrath et al., 2018), both radar-based gauge-adjusted datasets, have already been created and published. Both datasets are high spatial resolution dataset (2 and 1 km, respectively).A high resolution precipitation grid of hourly precipitation data for Belgium covering the period from 1940 to 2016 using the analog technique, is created. The analogs are sampled from the period 2017–2022 for which high resolution radar data precipitation fields are available. The initial step involves identifying the criteria, i.e. atmospheric parameters such as atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity, that can be used to determine analogous days. These atmospheric parameters are obtained from the ERA5 observational data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).  In a second step, hourly precipitation data for suitable analog days are extracted from our radar database, and then used to create the high resolution grid of hourly precipitation for Belgium from 1940 to 2016. Data from rain gauges on the Belgian terrain were used for validation of the candidate precipitation analogs.The dataset for this project lists the top 25 analog days for 1940–2016 based on similarities in weather patterns. The analogs are ranked based on how closely they match to their target day.The database is relying on the Zarr archiving format and is composed of two archives. A first archive contains all target days together with the 25 best analogs. The second one provides a precipitation field for each hour of every day in the past. The Zarr format of the database allows slicing through the database. For example, it allows one to easily delimit a specific area of interest and a specific time frame for which the high resolution gridded median hourly precipitation fields are needed. The median field dataset is available on Zenodo   (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14965710) (Debrie et al., 2025)."

We discovered that the long-term rules of disturbance known as ""regime"" leave a unique footprint in a forest's spatial biomass patterns. We trained a model on millions of computer simulations to learn this link. By applying this model to detailed satellite biomass, we could read these patterns to infer the disturbance regime globally, helping make climate projections more accurate. 
 Forests play a central role in the global carbon cycle by serving as critical carbon sinks for atmospheric CO2. Yet, the stability and continued capacity of these sinks are increasingly threatened by a growing number of disturbances. Accurately representing the stochastic nature of disturbance remains a major challenge and a key source of uncertainty in our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics. This study presents a novel framework for deriving disturbance regimes characterized by extent (μ), frequency (α), intensity (β), as well as background mortality (Kb) directly from landscape features of high-resolution satellite biomass data. These regimes reflect the characteristics of long term disturbances at the landscape scale rather than the properties of any single event. Our analysis inverts the forward model framework developed by Wang et al. (2024), which used a machine learning model trained on a massive synthetic dataset of over 8 million forward model simulations to link known disturbance regimes to spatial biomass patterns. Instead of predicting patterns from regimes, we use observed satellite biomass patterns to infer the underlying disturbance regimes. To ensure robustness, we first identified the optimal spatial resolution for aggregating both simulation and satellite data, minimizing discrepancies in feature value ranges and reducing extrapolation risk. Using this framework, we produced the first globally consistent, observationally constrained dataset of forest disturbance regime parameters and their associated uncertainties, provided at both a 25 × 25 km2 tile level and as a gridded 0.25° global product. Additionally, we used a Dissimilarity Index (DIK) to quantify prediction uncertainty and identify potential extrapolation by measuring observations' divergence from the training set. An empirical evaluation of borderline disturbance regimes supports the assumptions and methodological approach used to build the dataset. Our global maps of disturbance regimes provide a novel, process-based tool for investigating the coupled dynamics of disturbance, vegetation, and the carbon cycle, with potential applications for improving the representation of stochastic disturbances in large-scale ecosystem models."

 Nitrogen and Phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for sustaining life on Earth and have been increasingly applied in global agriculture to meet the growing demand for food production. Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrient inputs to the terrestrial biosphere is crucial for analyzing nutrient flows in crop-livestock systems, managing nutrient resources sustainably, and mitigating nutrient-related environmental impacts. Here, built upon our previous work mapping global nitrogen inputs (History of anthropogenic Nitrogen inputs, HaNi), this study presents the History of anthropogenic P inputs (HaPi) dataset, a comprehensive quantification of human-driven P fluxes to terrestrial ecosystems. HaPi covers the period from 1860 to 2020 and has a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minutes (about 10 km at the equator) with an annual time-step. This harmonized dataset integrates seven components, including P fertilizer application on croplands and pastures, manure P application on croplands and pastures, manure P deposition on pastures and rangelands, and atmospheric P deposition. The results reveal that the global total P input increased from 3.8 Tg yr–1 in the 1860s to 40.9 Tg yr–1 in the 2010s, with mineral fertilizer and livestock manure contributing equally to the increase. Regional patterns have shifted significantly over the study period, with China, South Asia, and Brazil surpassing Europe and the USA as the regions with the highest P inputs in recent decades. Furthermore, mineral fertilizers dominate P inputs in most industrialized countries in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas manure P remains the primary source in many countries of the Southern Hemisphere. The HaPi dataset improves P mass budget calculations and provides essential forcing data for empirical or mechanistic models, supporting critical research in agricultural nutrient management, water quality control, and assessments of the coupled human-Earth system.

 The DANish regional atmospheric ReAnalysis (DANRA) is a novel high-resolution (2.5 km) reanalysis dataset covering Denmark and its surrounding regions over a 34-year period (1990–2023). Denmark’s complex coastline, with over 400 islands and an extensive 7,400 km coastline, means that most municipalities experience mixed land-sea variability. This complexity requires a regional climate reanalysis that can resolve fine-scale coastal and inland features, as well as their impact on climate variability. DANRA is based on the HARMONIE-AROME Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and assimilates a comprehensive set of observations, with a particular focus on Denmark. Compared to global reanalyses such as the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), DANRA demonstrates superior performance in representing essential climate variables, including near-surface weather parameters during both extreme and ordinary conditions. We illustrate these improvements in the representation of several extreme weather cases over Denmark, such as the December 1999 hurricane-force storm, the July 2022 national temperature record, and the August 2007 cloudburst in South Jutland. DANRA is made to support climate adaptation, impact modelling, and the training of next-generation data-driven atmospheric forecasting models. DANRA is distributed as Zarr dataset freely accessible from an object store (doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17294179), maximizing its usability for climate adaptation, impact modelling, and data-driven research."

The data, stored in the PANGAEA database, include instrument-separated subsets with frequent in situ profiling of thermodynamic, turbulence conditions, and thermal-infrared irradiances across the Arctic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), supplemented by radiosondes. These measurements help examine transition events between Arctic ABL states. 
 We present a comprehensive balloon-borne measurement dataset collected during a dedicated Arctic observation campaign conducted from 19 March to 18 April 2024 in the transition from polar night to polar day at the Villum Research Station (Station Nord, STN, Greenland). The objective of the observations was to characterise the temporal evolution of the Arctic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), focusing on key transition periods, including cloud development, low-level jet evolution, and day to night shifts. Data were collected by the Balloon-bornE moduLar Utility for profilinG the lower Atmosphere (BELUGA) tethered-balloon system performing in-situ measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed, turbulence, and thermal infrared irradiance from the surface to several hundred meters altitude, with frequent profiling in high vertical resolution. Twenty-eight research flights delivered more than 300 profiles, with up to 8 profiles per hour, complemented by daily radiosonde launches. This paper specifies the BELUGA instrumentation at STN, data processing procedures, and the publicly available Level-2 data (BELUGA and radiosonde), provided in instrument-separated data subsets listed in a data collection (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.986431). One major application of the data is to evaluate different model types (such as numerical weather prediction, single-column, large-eddy simulations) in representing processes controlling the Arctic ABL. To prepare such evaluations, we give an overview of the observations, environmental conditions during the campaign, and highlight specific events that are valuable for model comparison. We introduce an event in which temperature rates influence the ABL inversion, radiative heating-rate profiles associated with transitions between cloudy and cloud-free conditions, and an observed Arctic low-level jet compared with reanalysis, offering insights into the Arctic ABL evolution."

WaterSip evaluates of the water budget of the air masses, providing information on the conditions during evaporation, transport, and arrival at the target area. WaterSip can be easily configured and writes gridded output files. Guidance is given on where uncertainties arise using a case study, and best practices are recommended. This manuscript supports the comparison of different methods to find precipitation sources. 
 WaterSip is a diagnostic software tool that identifies the evaporation sources and transport pathways of precipitation or water vapour over a target area based on Lagrangian model output. In addition to the geographic location, WaterSip identifies select thermodynamic properties of the moisture sources, during atmospheric transport, and arrival over the target area based on Lagrangian particle dispersion or trajectory model output. WaterSip software thereby employs the Lagrangian diagnostic algorithm for quantitative moisture source accounting of Sodemann et al. (2008b). Moisture sources are identified from changes in specific humidity along  trajectories at each output time step. The ratio between changes in specific humidity and the specific humidity of the air parcel allow to estimate the quantitative contribution of a moisture source to an air parcel at a specific time and location. This contribution and its temporal sequence provides the basis for identifying moisture source contributions to the final precipitation. WaterSip is designed to operate on large datasets of trajectories filling regional to global domains. The results are provided as gridded information in a variety of output files in netCDF format. This paper revisits the relevant methodological foundations, describes the configuration and technical set-up, and provides a consistent example case study to illustrate the use and interpretation of the software tool and its results. A short sensitivity study supports the choice of the main parameters of the diagnostic. Key uncertainties and caveats are described and discussed throughout the text. Users of WaterSip should be aware of these uncertainties to obtain a valid and reliable interpretation of the diagnostic results."

The model was calibrated with field data and literature, and it was extensively validated with global reference yields. The model effectively captured interannual yield variability in global and county-level yield data, demonstrating its potential for assessing the climate impacts on maize production. 
 Process-based crop models combined with land surface models are useful tools for accurately quantifying the impacts of climate change on crops while considering the interactions between agricultural land and climate. MATCRO model is a process-based crop model initially developed for paddy rice, combined with a land surface model. We developed MATCRO-Maize as a new model for maize by incorporating leaf-level photosynthesis of C4 plants and adjusting crop-specific parameters into the original MATCRO model. MATCRO-Maize was evaluated at both a point scale and a global scale through comparisons with observational values. For global-scale simulations, the simulated yield showed statistically significant differences compared with Food and Agriculture Organization's FAOSTAT data at the country and global levels. Although the absolute value of the simulated yield tended to be overestimated, MATCRO-Maize reproduced spatial patterns with a correlation coefficient (COR) of 0.58 (p value < 0.01) for the 30-year average yield comparison of the top 20 maize-producing countries. In addition, the comparisons of the interannual variability derived from detrended deviation were statistically significant for the total global yield (COR of 0.55 with p value < 0.01) and for half of the top 20 countries (COR of 0.64–0.90 with p value < 0.001 for 6 countries; COR of 0.50–0.51 with p value < 0.01 for 2 countries; COR of 0.48–0.55 with p value < 0.05 for 2 countries), which are comparable with those of other global crop models. One of the reasons for this overestimation could be related to the strong model response to nitrogen fertilizer observed in MATCRO-Maize. With experimental field data under more comprehensive conditions, improvements in the functions of nitrogen fertilizer in the model would be needed to simulate the maize yield more accurately."

Although less known, a weak but persistent equatorward eddy heat flux (EEHF) also exists in the subtropical upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS). In this study, we solve a Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) form of the Kuo–Eliassen equation and find that in the subtropical UTLS, the EEHF alone weaken the boreal winter TEM circulation. This EEHF fluctuates on daily time scales. When the EEHF strength exceeds 1 standard deviation, the UTLS TEM circulation substantially weakens. This EEHF cannot be explained by background temperature gradients. Instead, the evolution of the Eliassen–Palm flux and precipitation rate indicates that it is likely driven by horizontal propagation of planetary‐scale waves which, at least in part, is triggered by tropical convection over the western tropical Pacific."

 Electron- or photoionization mass spectrometry coupled with product time-of-flight measurement is a universal detection scheme, which has been playing pivotal role in advancing our fundamental understanding of chemical reactions. This powerful detection scheme, however, usually does not provide the product state-specific information. Here, we propose a variant of universal detection with state-resolving capability by leveraging a three-dimensional velocity-map imaging detector with vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization probe. As demonstrated by a crossed-beam reaction of F + CH4 → CH3(vi) + HF(v), both product vibrational branching and state-resolved angular distributions are simultaneously unveiled in a (vi, v) pair-correlated manner from a single product-image measurement, which enables us to gain previously inaccessible insights. Comparisons with a six-dimensionality quantum dynamics calculation show excellent agreements, validating the approach. The proposed method is general and should open a new opportunity to gain deeper insights into many important complex chemical processes that are otherwise difficult to study. A universal detection scheme capable of providing all reaction products and states information at once from a single measurement is demonstrated in F + CH4 → HF + CH3.

 Efficient cargo delivery is essential for plant trait engineering, yet existing methods are often species-specific and ineffective across diverse habitats. Here, we develop core-shell microneedles for targeted delivery of biomolecular cargoes and active microorganisms into both terrestrial and aquatic plants. The microneedle architecture is rationally engineered to resist water exposure and release cargo upon contact with plant interstitial fluid, enabling controlled delivery into tissues and cells. We demonstrate that these core-shell microneedles can efficiently transport diverse cargoes, from nanoscale biomolecules such as functional nucleic acids, proteins, and plant hormones to microscale bioactive Agrobacterium, leading to strong protein expression and enhanced plant growth. Underwater delivery of salt-tolerance genes into submerged freshwater plants further demonstrates the platform’s utility for engineering stress resilience in challenging environments. By facilitating the cellular uptake of diverse cargoes into intact plants across different habitats, this amphibious microneedle strategy offers a versatile cargo delivery tool to advance plant biotechnology and environmental applications.

 X-ray imaging requires effective light transmission through scintillation screens. However, solid or solution-based scintillators suffer from photon scattering and attenuation. While prior efforts have focused on improving light extraction in solid-state scintillators through nanostructuring or optical engineering, challenges remain in mitigating internal scattering losses. Here, we report a liquid scintillator-based strategy that eliminates light scattering by exploiting in-situ coordination between lanthanide ions and ionic liquid ligands. This coordination chemistry ensures high structural homogeneity and optical transparency. Combined with self-absorption-free lanthanides, this approach achieves over 93% scintillation light transmittance, boosting X-ray imaging spatial resolution to 26 lp mm-1 within a 1 mm scintillation screen. Our scintillators exhibit long-term stability and environmental compatibility, leveraging the inherent properties of ionic liquids for sustained and biocompatible X-ray imaging. Their fluidic and shape-adaptive nature enables the development of convex and zoom scintillation lenses, facilitating uniform omni-angle X-ray detection and in-situ zoom X-ray imaging.

However, achieving the synthesis of chiral cyclopropyl primary amides and cyclopropyl carboxylic acids via asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation and hydrocarboxylation of cyclopropenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an efficient catalytic system that enables the utilization of cost-effective NH4OAc as a practical alternative to gaseous ammonia and simple organic amines in nickel-catalyzed asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of cyclopropenes under 1 atm of CO, which provides rapid access to structurally diverse primary amides, secondary amides, and tertiary amides. Notably, the Ni-catalyzed asymmetric hydrocarboxylation reaction is also established with H2O as a nucleophile to give the corresponding cyclopropyl carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. These reactions feature mild reaction conditions, exceptional levels of enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities while also exhibiting remarkable tolerance towards diverse functional groups. Moreover, our methodology proves to be highly efficient for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds such as Levomilnacipran and Bicifadine.

Here, the authors measure interaction affinities in living cell membranes and uncover roles of Gγ prenylation and a Gβγ docking site in GIRK1 in efficient channel activation. 
 Gi/o protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) inhibit cardiac and neuronal excitability via G protein-activated K+ channels (GIRK), assembled by combinations of GIRK1 - GIRK4 subunits. GIRKs are activated by direct binding of the Gβγ dimer of inhibitory Gi/o proteins. However, key aspects of this textbook signaling pathway remain debated. Recent studies suggested no Gi/o-GIRK pre-coupling and low (>250 µM) Gβγ-GIRK interaction affinity, contradicting earlier sub-µM estimates and implying low signaling efficiency. We show that Gγ prenylation, which mediates Gβγ membrane attachment required for GIRK activation, also contributes to the Gβγ-GIRK interaction, explaining the poor affinity obtained with non-prenylated Gβγ. Using quantitative protein titration and electrophysiology in live Xenopus oocytes, Gβγ affinity for homotetrameric GIRK2 ranges from 4-30 µM. Heterotetrameric GIRK1/2 shows a higher Gβγ apparent affinity due to the Gβγ-docking site (anchor) in GIRK1, which enriches Gβγ at the channel. Biochemical approaches and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the Gβγ anchor is formed by interacting N-terminal and distal C-terminal domains of the GIRK1 subunits, distinct from the Gβγ-binding “activation” site(s) underlying channel opening. Thus, the affinity of Gβγ-GIRK interaction is within the expected physiological range, while dynamic pre-coupling of Gβγ to GIRK1-containing channels through high-affinity interactions further enhances the GPCR-Gi/o-GIRK signaling efficiency. GIRK channels are activated by Gβγ; quantitative aspects are debatable. Here, the authors measure interaction affinities in living cell membranes and uncover roles of Gγ prenylation and a Gβγ docking site in GIRK1 in efficient channel activation."

This cognitive strategy facilitates memory-guided navigation, a finding confirmed by a neural network model that accurately reflects behavioral and monkey neural data. 
 The brain evolved to navigate a dynamic and uncertain world, but the mechanisms underlying ethologically-relevant behavioral strategies remain unclear. In the real-world, such strategies are shaped both by task demands and by the cognitive resources available to the animal. We hypothesized that eye movements constitute a vital cognitive resource to support neural computations for memory-guided navigation. We tested this using a naturalistic task in which humans use a joystick to steer and catch flashing targets in a virtual environment lacking explicit position cues. While navigating to the goal, participants physically track the latent target position with their gaze even in the absence of optic flow, demonstrating that these task-relevant eye movements reflect an embodiment of the subjects’ dynamic internal beliefs about the goal location. We developed a neural network model with tuned recurrent connectivity between oculomotor and evidence-integrating frontoparietal circuits to account for this behavioral strategy. We show that this model better explained neural data from male monkeys’ posterior parietal cortex compared to models optimized solely for task performance and unconstrained by such an oculomotor-based strategy. These results highlight the importance of eye movements in working memory computations and establish a functional significance of oculomotor signals for evidence-integration and navigation computations via embodied cognition.

 Nonhomologous end-joining repairs chromosomal double strand breaks, but it is unknown whether both strands are repaired by this pathway, and if one strand break’s repair path impacts the other. Here, we show that nonhomologous end-joining employs both of two a priori possible strategies. Strand breaks that can be directly ligated are joined near-simultaneously, with no effect of one strand break’s repair path on the other. More complex end structures require obligatorily ordered repair. The first strand to be repaired is used as template for repair of the opposite/second strand break, with the latter repair reaction occurring fastest when also coupled to nonhomologous end-joining. Enforced asymmetry in repair of each strand break can extend to the gap-filling polymerase employed, and whether the polymerases incorporate RNA or DNA. Our results resolve questions about pathway mechanism and identify a requirement for flexibility of the nonhomologous end-joining machinery for efficient repair of both strand breaks within diverse cellular double strand breaks.

 Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (ca) increase plant photosynthesis (An) and reduce stomatal conductance (gs). This increases the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE = An / gs), a major proxy of tree adaptation to climate change. However, whether an increase in iWUE leads to a concomitant increase in tree growth remains in dispute, prompting interest in theoretical links between iWUE and tree productivity. Here using an optimality theory for kinetics of stomatal aperture, we establish an envelope delineating maximal relative increases in tree productivity that can be inferred/expected from relative increases in iWUE. The resulting expressions are used to interpret relations between iWUE (an observable proxy) and tree growth (the target variable), using available experimental data from manipulation experiments and tree-ring isotopes. While rising ca increases iWUE, proportional increases in tree growth are unlikely given ameliorating environmental (for example, rising atmospheric dryness) and anatomical/physiological (for example, tree height) influences.

 The removal of dyes from coloured textile waste represents a sustainable approach to textile recycling, enabling the recovery of valuable chemical, and material resources that would otherwise be discarded. Up to 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions from textiles originate from dye production, making efficient recycling of dyes a major opportunity for curbing emissions and minimizing waste in both textile manufacturing and recycling. Here we demonstrate a process for the extraction, purification, and reuse of mixed dyes from polyester textiles using bio-based, non-hazardous solvents selected on the basis of computational predictions for polyester and dye solubilities. Extracted dyes are purified to individual compounds using counter-current chromatography and analysed via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Post-extraction characterization of the extracted dyes and polymer substrate confirms dye colour retention and polyester fabric property preservation. Dye recycling is demonstrated by redyeing colour-free fabrics with the recovered dyes. We further show a potential process configuration for dye removal using a flow-through reactor packed with a textile substrate. The proposed dye removal process produces reusable, recyclable dyes, and dye-free fabrics, thus facilitating textile recycling.

We conducted high-pressure (50-500 atm) laboratory experiments using calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, and wollastonite, and performed numerical geochemical simulations. Our key finding is that calcium oxide in seawater achieves the highest carbonate yield, with geochemical models indicating that the complex ionic composition of seawater significantly enhances precipitation compared to simple brines. Additionally, an analytical Monte Carlo economic analysis projects that such efficiency could reduce sequestration costs by 15%.

 The extent of the differences between atmospheric and lake heatwaves remains unclear. Here we analysed daily surface water and air temperature data from 265 lakes worldwide (2000–2022) to compare heatwave trends, spatial distributions, and key differences. We find that lake heatwaves are more severe than atmospheric heatwaves, with longer accumulated heatwave days (29.7 days vs. 18.0 days), a shorter reoccurrence period (86.9 days vs. 121.4 days), and greater accumulated heat. Additionally, the frequency and total heatwave days have increased faster for lake heatwaves than for atmospheric heatwaves. When both types co-occur, heatwave severity intensifies. From a long-term perspective, reduced wind speed is the key driver of the differences between lake heatwaves and atmospheric heatwaves. Spatially, lake location is the primary determinant, followed by lake area and depth. Under a fixed-baseline high-emission scenario, by 2100, the difference is expected to diminish as air temperatures rise faster than water temperatures.

We compare the reconstruction to the tropical North Atlantic seasonal temperature gradient, which can help inform how northeastern Caribbean rainy seasons are influenced by the Atlantic Warm Pool. A positive water balance in the northern Bahamas aligned with a ~0.9 °C seasonal temperature gradient from 0 to 950 CE, with both covarying on multi-decadal timescales. Aridity began at ~950 CE when a ~2.2 °C seasonal temperature gradient increase likely shortened the wet season. From 1450 to 1850 CE, frequent hurricanes offset aridity in the northeastern Caribbean by elevating rainfall.

 Border areas represent crucial, yet underexplored, potential sources of cultivated land, a region largely overlooked in global cropland analyses. Using high-frequency time-series (2001-2020) satellite data and interpretable machine learning model, here we conduct the global-coverage analysis of the patterns, drivers, and consequences of cropland changes in the borderlands. Our findings revealed that approximately 17% of global cropland was located in border areas, with a notable acceleration in land reduction during the 21st century. Most of the lost croplands were converted into grasslands (~67%) and forests (~32%). Climate and socio-economic factors collectively influenced changes in border cropland. A decrease in border cropland intensified species richness by increasing net primary productivity (NPP). These contrasting trends—declining cropland alongside rising biodiversity—underscore the need for future assessments to consider their implications for food security and sustainable development in border areas.

However, existing datasets do not specifically cater to this application, limiting the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, a novel public dataset called the NITC person rescue dataset is introduced. It consists of UAV-captured images of individuals stranded within buildings and on rooftops with two types of labels: bounding boxes and image captions. This dataset presents challenging environmental conditions that significantly impact the performance of pre-trained models. In particular, these models struggle with detecting individuals behind windows, highlighting the limitations of applying general-purpose object detection models to domain-specific tasks. This performance deterioration emphasizes the need for fine-tuning to adapt these models to specialized rescue scenarios. This work systematically evaluates various fine-tuning strategies and their effectiveness in improving model performance. The advantages of model-structure-based fine-tuning are illustrated using YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 as case studies. The best-performing model achieves an AP@50 of 87% for detecting person instances on unseen data. State-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), BLIP2 and Qwen2-VL are fine-tuned using ground-truth image captions to obtain meaningful descriptions of the seen."

 This study assesses the chemical composition, oxidative potential (OP), and source contributions of traffic-related particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) collected from two major freeways in Southern California, I-110 and I-710, and from a background site in the University of Southern California (USC) campus. On-road samples were collected in fall 2023 and spring 2024 and analyzed for organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), trace metals, and inorganic ions. The OP of PM10 was evaluated using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Freeway PM10 concentrations exceeded background levels by factors of 4–6 and were consistently higher on I-710, which has a larger proportion of heavy-duty vehicle traffic, compared to I-110. Carbonaceous components were also enriched 5 to 9 times above background, and brake and tire wear metals (e.g., Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba) exceeded the background level by more than an order of magnitude. Both PM10 concentrations and DTT activity in fall were substantially larger than the spring values, possibly due to dilution and lower carbonaceous loadings in the spring. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the primary sources contributing to PM10 composition, revealing five major factors, namely tailpipe emissions, brake and tire wear, resuspended road dust, secondary inorganic aerosol, and sea salt. Multiple linear regression (MLR) linked these sources to OP, with brake and tire wear explaining 33 % of the observed DTT response while contributing only 20 % to the PM10 mass, resulting in a dimensionless OP-to-mass ratio of 1.66. These findings underscore the growing importance of non-tailpipe sources as potentially toxic yet unregulated contributors to on-road health risks, reinforcing the need for targeted research and future regulatory attention."

 Driven by the plateau-basin thermal contrasts, the Mountain-Plain Solenoid (MPS) frequently occurs over the Sichuan Basin (SCB), a deep basin immediately east of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, the mechanical influences of TP topography on the MPS-type circulation with modulation of synoptic circulations remains poorly understood. Here, we identify two types of MPS with distinct synoptic background of westerly and easterly winds between the TP and SCB by using K-means clustering. Specifically, the Westerly-type MPS (W-MPS), is dominated with weak high-pressure systems over the southeastern SCB. Under the lower-tropospheric westerlies away from the TP's eastern slope, lee-side downdrafts suppress the W-MPS circulation by offsetting the plateau-basin thermal forcing. The Easterly-type MPS (E-MPS), linked to weak high-pressure and post-trough systems over the basin, features prevailing easterlies flowing onto the TP's eastern slope in the lower troposphere. By blocking the easterly winds, the TP terrain effects trigger two vertical circulations respectively in the free troposphere and the lower boundary layer, which jointly intensify the MPS circulation over the SCB, building “ultrahigh” MPS with the vertical structure up to the mid-troposphere around 500 hPa. These findings reveal distinct patterns of MPS modified by the TP's topographic forcing on synoptic circulations, deepening the understanding of how the synergistic thermal and dynamic forcing of the TP terrain regulates regional atmospheric circulations."

 Over the past few decades, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has witnessed changes in summer precipitation that follow a “south drying-north wetting” diploe pattern. Although the role of adjacent oceanic moisture export (OME) in modulating the TP precipitation has been highlighted, there is no consensus on the relationship between OME and summer TP rainfall by far. Here, we quantify the contributions of the OME from three seas, namely, the Arabian Sea (AS), the Bay of Bengal (BOB), and the South China Sea (SCS), to the TP summer precipitation and particularly examine the relationship between them from the standpoint of long-term trend based on the 35-year Lagrangian modeling and OME-based precipitation diagnostic. Climatologically, the observed and the diagnosed OME-based precipitation are compatible, both in terms of spatial pattern and magnitude. However, the preferred regions contributed by the three sea sources vary from one another. The AS with fraction contribution 62.6 % rank first with influenced regions almost covering the whole TP, followed by the BOB (21 %) and the SCS (16.4 %) with impacted regions mainly distributed over the southeastern and eastern TP, respectively. Although this order of contribution to the trends of whole TP precipitation remains unchanged, the AS comparatively acts as a main contributor to the “south drying” over the TP, while the BOB makes more contribution to the “north wetting”, implying the distinct mechanisms on the precipitation changes among the TP subsectors."

Using field-based imaging techniques, we directly measured the mass, size, density, and fall speed of snowflakes in surface-layer turbulence. We found that turbulence and microstructure jointly modulate fall speed, often deviating from the terminal velocity in still air. These results inform new parameterizations for numerical weather and climate models. 
 The modeled settling speed of frozen hydrometeors has important implications for the prediction of weather and climate. However, it is usually assumed, erroneously, that they fall in still air. Here, we present novel field measurements of individual snowflake microphysical properties and their settling velocities in atmospheric surface-layer turbulence. Individual snowflake motions are tracked in a laser light sheet using particle streak velocimetry (PSV). A hotplate device, the Differential Emissivity Imaging Disdrometer (DEID), is used to obtain precise estimates of snowflake mass, density, and size. Relative to calculated terminal velocities in still air, we present enhancements and reductions of snowflake settling speeds in turbulent air for a broad range of Reynolds and Stokes numbers. Functional forms describing actual snowflake fall speeds are presented and explored. In particular, a promising non-dimensional functional form for the ratio of actual particle fall speed to terminal velocity is presented in terms of turbulence intensity and a new variable called the shape density index or SDI, which is related to an individual hydrometeor's microphysical structure."

During clean periods with a 53 % drop in Traffic Performance Index, HONO, CO, and NO2 levels decreased by 2–3 times compared to polluted periods. Emission reduction simulations showed that a 50 % NOx reduction could lower HONO by up to 46.3 %, indicating that reducing anthropogenic activities significantly suppresses HONO formation and provides direct evidence for pollution control. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key precursor of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH) and significantly influences the formation of secondary pollutants, making it essential for understanding and controlling air pollution. While many studies have focused on its formation mechanisms, few have explored the impact of variations in anthropogenic activities on HONO formation. Therefore, we investigated the impact of variations in anthropogenic activities on HONO formation based on comprehensive observations conducted in urban Beijing during autumn and winter of 2022. During clean periods with a 53 % drop in Traffic Performance Index, HONO, CO, and NO2 levels decreased by 2–3 times compared to polluted periods and significantly lower than previously reported wintertime levels in Beijing. Source apportionment revealed that NO2 heterogeneous reaction on ground was the dominant HONO source across all periods. Vehicle emissions contributed more to HONO during clean periods, suggesting that reducing anthropogenic activities has a stronger influence on secondary HONO formation. Particulate nitrate (pNO3) photolysis contributed more to HONO during polluted periods, due to higher pNO3 fractions in PM2.5 under more polluted conditions. Despite including all known formation pathways in the model, unidentified HONO sources still remained. This was strongly associated with intense solar radiation and high OH concentrations at daytime, as well as elevated NH3 concentrations at nighttime. Emission reduction simulations further revealed that a 50 % NOx reduction during polluted periods could lower HONO by up to 46.3 %, directly demonstrating that reducing anthropogenic activities significantly suppresses HONO formation and provides a scientific basis for the development of air pollution control strategies."

The comparisons between the measurements of chemically treated and untreated backup filter samples indicate that the WSOMMs detected on the backup filters may originate from heterogeneous reactions on the filter surfaces, but are not caused by the adsorption of gaseous molecules. 
 To better understand the measurement uncertainties and sampling artifacts of particulate water-soluble organic molecular markers (WSOMMs), three quartz filters were stacked and installed in two collocated samplers (Sampler I and II) to simultaneously collect ambient WSOMMs. The paired top filters (Qf) loaded with PM2.5 were analyzed to determine the duplicate-derived uncertainty of particulate WSOMM concentrations. For several WSOMMs (e.g., levoglucosan) specifically associated with aerosol sources, the uncertainty was well below 20 %, which was commonly assumed in previous studies for the analysis of particulate WSOMMs. If the WSOMMs detected in the other two filters (Qb and Qbb) below Qf were caused by gaseous adsorption, the breakthrough value ([Qbb]/([Qb]+[Qbb])) can be used to estimate the sampling artifact of particulate WSOMMs due to gaseous adsorption on Qf. To understand the influence of acidic and alkaline conditions on the adsorption of gaseous WSOMMs or their precursors on quartz filters, the bottom filter (Qbb) of Sampler I was treated with (NH4)2SO4 or KOH on different sampling days. From the comparison of the measurement results between chemically treated and untreated Qbb samples, it was inferred that (NH4)2SO4 can increase the formation of isoprene secondary organic aerosol by reactive uptake of the oxidative intermediates; KOH can promote the adsorption of organic acids through neutralization reactions. Future studies are warranted to develop a suitable method for sampling gaseous WSOMMs using chemically treated adsorbents."

We compared two techniques that use radio signals from the ground to estimate vertical motion – one based on direct Doppler shifts, the other on changes in reflection height. We found that under certain conditions, especially at night and with proper timing, the results from both methods are comparable and consistent. 
 Reliable estimation of vertical plasma drift in the ionosphere is crucial for interpreting ionospheric dynamics and enhancing the accuracy of space weather models. This study provides a comparative assessment of direct Digisonde Drift Measurements (DDM) and indirect ionogram-based methods using parameters such as hmF2, h′F2, h′(3.5 MHz), and h′(0.8foF2). Two high cadence measurement campaigns were conducted at the mid-latitude observatory in Pruhonice, Czech Republic, during different phases of the solar cycle. The analysis focuses on evaluating measurement consistency, temporal coherence, and the influence of sampling step and averaging strategy on drift estimation. While DDM yields stable and robust results even at 1 min resolution, ionogram-derived methods are strongly affected by measurement uncertainty and ambiguity in virtual height interpretation – particularly at short time scales. However, at night, all methods converge when a 15 min time interval is consistently applied both as the computation step and for subsequent smoothing. Under these conditions, coherent wave-like features in the vertical drift are reliably captured. The study outlines the strengths and limitations of each technique and provides recommendations for optimizing temporal resolution in ionospheric drift measurements, supporting improved methodology for future observational campaigns and model validation."

Spanning 1980 to 2020 with spatial resolution of 0.5° and 1°, BMA-ET uses Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to combine thirty evapotranspiration (ET) datasets. A key innovation is dynamic weighting scheme, which adjusts for vegetation types and non-common coverage years among ET datasets. BMA-ET provides a comprehensive resource for understanding global ET patterns and trends, addressing the limitation of prior ET fusion efforts. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the terrestrial water cycle, carbon cycle, and energy balance. Currently, there are four main types of ET datasets: remote sensing–based, machine learning–based, reanalysis–based, and land–surface–model–based. However, most existing ET fusion datasets rely on a single type of ET dataset, limiting their ability to effectively capture regional ET variations. This limitation hinders accurate quantification of the terrestrial water balance and understanding of climate change impacts. In this study, the accuracy and uncertainty of thirty ET datasets (across all four types) are evaluated at multiple spatial scales, and a fusion dataset BMA (Bayesian model averaging)-ET, is obtained using BMA method and dynamic weighting scheme. ET from FLUXNET2015 as reference, the study recommends remote sensing- and machine learning-based ET datasets, especially Model Tree Ensemble Evapotranspiration (MTE), Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) and Process-based Land Surface Evapotranspiration/Heat Fluxes (PLSH), but the optimal selection depends on season and vegetation type. At the basin scale, most of ET datasets demonstrate superior performance. Relative uncertainty based on remote sensing and machine learning is low at the grid point scale. The fusion dataset BMA-ET accurately captures trends in ET, showing a global terrestrial increasing trend of 0.65 (0.51–0.78) mm yr−1 during the period 1980–2020. BMA-ET has higher correlation coefficients and lower root-mean-square errors than most individual ET datasets. Validation using ET from FLUXNET2015 as reference shows that correlation coefficients of more than 70 % of the flux sites exceed 0.6. Validation results based on independent data sources show that the correlation coefficients of BMA-ET with AmeriFlux, ChinaFlux, and ICOS reach 0.61, 0.72, and 0.74, respectively. Overall, BMA-ET provides a comprehensive, long-term resource for understanding global ET patterns and trends, addressing the limitation of prior ET fusion efforts.

 Sedimentary recycling of phosphorus is a key aspect of eutrophication. Here, we present data on benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from the Baltic Sea, an area with a long eutrophication history. The presented dataset contains 498 individual fluxes measured in situ with three types of benthic chamber landers at 59 stations over 20 years, and data cover most of the Baltic Sea subbasins (Hylén et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14812160). The dataset further contains information about bottom-water dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations, sedimentary organic carbon (OC) content and sediment type. The DIP fluxes differ considerably between basins depending on OC loading and the level of O2 depletion and generally increase from the coast to the central basins. Several stations have been visited on multiple occasions, also at times with different O2 concentrations, which enables investigation of the immediate effects of shifting bottom-water O2 concentrations on the benthic DIP release. The Baltic Sea-wide benthic DIP release is estimated to be 389–484 kton yr−1 based on a data integration based on sediment type and O2 conditions during three years with varying extents of hypoxia and anoxia (2004, 2013 and 2018). The dataset reveals a lack of flux measurements in winter months, coastal areas, and sandy and coarse sediments; these should be targeted in future studies. Overall, intercomparisons between samplings and landers as well as rigorous data evaluation show that the data are of high quality. As such, this data set will, alone and together with other environmental data, be important for marine management and studies on mechanisms in benthic phosphorus cycling."

Alongside national inventories, independent databases provide yearly globally consistent emission inventories. Comparing independent inventories with countries submissions provides clear and consistent track of the real progress. Improvement of emissions inventories, reporting timelines, and statistical systems are essential to ensure reliable and comparable data. 
 Tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential for understanding the drivers of climate change and guiding global mitigation strategies. The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and submissions by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are two key sources of GHG emissions data. While EDGAR provides comprehensive and globally consistent estimates, UNFCCC submissions are based on nationally reported inventories, which adhere to specific guidelines and reflect country-specific circumstances and practices. This study presents a detailed comparison between EDGAR and UNFCCC GHG emissions inventories, focusing on G20 countries, which account for nearly 80 % of global emissions, as well as Annex I countries, including the EU27. By examining sectoral discrepancies, methodological variations, and the impact of reporting timelines, the paper identifies key areas of alignment and divergence in emissions estimates. While CO2 emissions show strong agreement between the datasets, CH4 and N2O estimates exhibit substantial discrepancies due to differences in methodologies, emission factors, uncertainties, and reporting practices. Our findings emphasise the need for enhanced methodological harmonization and more frequent reporting, particularly in non-Annex I countries, where limited capacity and irregular updates reduce comparability. Addressing these inconsistencies is crucial for improving transparency, aligning national and independent datasets, and strengthening climate policy decisions under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC Secretariat, 2021b)."

This resource can benefit weather and climate models by providing a clearer picture of how turbulence below clouds influences their formation and organization. 
 The MAESTRO airborne field campaign took place between August 10 and September 10 2024 over the North Atlantic tropical ocean near the Cabo Verde Islands. Its goal was to investigate the processes that control the mesoscale organization of clouds with a payload of probes and sensors, as well as vertically and horizontally-pointing radars and lidars. A particular attention was paid to the role of coherent structures in the boundary layer and mesoscale cloud organization. This focus motivated the acquisition of high-resolution measurements of temperature and water vapor to capture turbulence dynamics in the subcloud layer. To achieve this, six hygrometers and four temperature sensors were deployed, including a new fast-rate hygrometer called FAST-WAVE. This article describes the turbulence dataset, prepared on the basis of these measurements.

A climatology is derived separately for each station and each month of the year. Along with the dataset, SEEPS4ALL also resembles a set of verification tools. In a nutshell, SEEPS4ALL helps promote the benchmark of daily precipitation forecasts against in-situ observations over Europe. 
 Forecast verification is an essential task when developing a forecasting model. How well does a model perform? How does the forecast performance compare with previous versions or other models? Which aspects of the forecast could be improved? In weather forecasting, these questions apply in particular to precipitation, a key weather parameter with vital societal applications. Scores specifically designed to assess the performance of precipitation forecasts have been developed over the years. One example is the Stable and Equitable Error in Probability Space (SEEPS, Rodwell et al., 2010). The computation of this score is however not straightforward because it requires information about the precipitation climatology at the verification locations. More generally, climate statistics are key to assessing forecasts for extreme precipitation and high-impact events. Here, we introduce SEEPS4ALL, a set of data and tools that democratize the use of climate statistics for verification purposes. In particular, verification results for daily precipitation are showcased with both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts."

M. Demattê,"Proximal surface pedogeophysical characterization in Maritime Antarctica: assessing pedogeomorphological, periglacial, and landform influences","The study explores Maritime Antarctica's geology, shaped by periglacial forces, using pioneering gamma-spectrometric and magnetic surveys on igneous rocks due to limited Antarctic surveys. Machine learning predicts radionuclide and magnetic content based on terrain features, linking their distribution to landscape processes, morphometrics, lithology, and pedogeomorphology. Inaccuracies arise due to complex periglacial processes and landscape complexities. 
 Maritime Antarctica (M.A.) contains the most extensive and diverse lithological exposure compared to the entire continent. This lithological substrate reveals a rich history encompassing lithological, pedogeomorphological, and glaciological aspects of M.A., all of with are influenced by periglacial processes. Although pedogeophysical surveys can detect and provide valuable information to understand Antarctic lithologies and their history, such surveys are scarce on this continent and, in practice, almost non-existent. In this sense, we conducted a pioneering and comprehensive γ-spectrometric (natural radioactivity) and magnetic susceptibility (κ) survey on various igneous rocks. This study aimed to improve the geoscientific understanding of periglacial and pedogeomorphological processes in Keller Peninsula by integrating radiometric and magnetic data with advanced spatial analysis. It investigates the spatial variability of natural radiouclides and magnetic susceptibility across different substrates, evaluates a machine learning approach for data modelling, and interprets γ-ray and κ maps to reveal soil and landscape-forming processes. For that, we used proximal γ-spectrometric and κ data in different lithological substrates associated to terrain attributes. The pedogeophysical variables were collected in the field from various lithological substrates, by use field portable equipment. The pedogeophysical variables were collected in the field from various lithological substrates using portable equipment. These variables, combined with relief data and lithology, served as input data for modeling to predict and spatially map the content of radionuclides and κ by random forest algorithm (RF). In addition, we use nested-LOOCV as a form of external validation in a geophysical data with a small number of samples, and the error maps as evaluation of results. The RF algorithm successfully generated detailed maps of γ-spectrometric and κ variables. The distribution of radionuclides and ferrimagnetic minerals was influenced by morphometric variables. Nested-LOOCV method evaluated algorithm performance accurately with limited samples, generating robust mean maps. The highest thorium levels were observed in elevated, flat, and west beach areas, where detrital materials from periglacial erosion came through fluvioglacial channels. Lithology and pedogeomorphological processes-controlled thorium contents. Steeper areas formed a ring with the highest uranium contents, influenced by lithology and geomorphological-periglacial processes (rock cryoclasty, periglacial erosion, and heterogeneous deposition). Felsic rocks and areas less affected by periglacial erosion had the highest potassium levels, while regions with sulfurization-affected pyritized-andesites near fluvioglacial channels showed the lowest potassium contents. Lithology and pedogeochemical processes governed potassium levels. The κ values showed no distinct distribution pattern. Hydrothermal alteration affected the pyritized andesites, with heat and magmatic fluids driving iron enrichment and the formation of hydrothermal magnetite, which in turn led to elevated κ values. Conversely, Cryosol areas, experiencing freezing and thawing activity, had the lowest κ values due to limited ferrimagnetic mineral formation. In regions characterized by diverse terrain attributes and abundant active and intense periglacial processes, the spatial distribution of geophysical variables does not reliably reflect the actual lithological composition of the substrate. The complex interplay of various periglacial processes in the area, along with the morphometric features of the landscape, leads to the redistribution, mixing, and homogenization of surface materials, contributing to the inaccuracies in the predicted-spatialized geophysical variables."

Observational constraints (OCs) decrease this uncertainty using real-world observations. The article proposes a new rigorous statistical OC model that provides updated estimates of confidence intervals as used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. It allows the use of multiple observations simultaneously and proposes an innovative and proper illustration of this OC approach. 
 Projections of future climate are key to society's adaptation and mitigation plans in response to climate change. Numerical climate models provide projections, but the large dispersion between them makes future climate very uncertain. To refine them, approaches called observational constraints (OCs) have been developed. They constrain an ensemble of climate projections using some real-world observations. However, there are many difficulties in dealing with the large literature on OC: the methods are diverse, the mathematical formulation and underlying assumptions are not always clear, and the methods are often limited to the use of the observations of only one variable. To address these challenges, this article proposes a new statistical model called ClimLoco1.0, which stands for “CLimate variable confidence Interval of Multivariate Linear Observational COnstraint”. It describes, in a rigorous way, the confidence interval of a projected variable (its best guess associated with an uncertainty at a confidence level) obtained using a multivariate linear OC. The article is built up in increasing complexity by expressing three different cases – the last one being ClimLoco1.0, the confidence interval of a projected variable: unconstrained, constrained by multiple real-world observations assumed to be noiseless, and constrained by multiple real-world observations assumed to be noisy. ClimLoco1.0 thus accounts for observational noise (instrumental error and climate-internal variability), which is sometimes neglected in the literature but is important as it reduces the impact of the OC. Furthermore, ClimLoco1.0 accounts for uncertainty rigorously by taking into account the quality of the estimators, which depends, for example, on the number of climate models considered. In addition to providing an interpretation of the mathematical results, this article proposes graphical interpretations based on synthetic data. ClimLoco1.0 is compared to some methods from the literature at the end of the article and is used in a real case study in the appendix."

 Cancer is generally thought to be caused by expansion of a single mutant cell1. However, analyses of early colorectal cancer lesions suggest that tumors may instead originate from multiple, genetically distinct cell populations2,3. Detecting polyclonal tumor initiation is challenging in patients, as it requires profiling early-stage lesions before clonal sweeps obscure diversity. To investigate this, we analyzed normal colorectal mucosa, benign and dysplastic premalignant polyps, and malignant adenocarcinomas (123 samples) from six individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Individuals with FAP have a germline heterozygous APC mutation, predisposing them to colorectal cancer and numerous premalignant polyps by early adulthood4. Whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing revealed that many premalignant polyps—40% with benign histology and 28% with dysplasia—were composed of multiple genetic lineages that diverged early, consistent with polyclonal origins. This conclusion was reinforced by whole-genome sequencing of single crypts from multiple polyps in additional patients which showed limited sharing of mutations among crypts within the same lesion. In some cases, multiple distinct APC mutations co-existed in different lineages of a single polyp, consistent with polyclonality. These findings reshape our understanding of early neoplastic events, demonstrating that tumor initiation can arise from the convergence of diverse mutant clones. They also suggest that cell-intrinsic growth advantages alone may not fully explain tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of microenvironmental and tissue-level factors in early cancer evolution."

 The colorectal epithelium is rapidly renewing, with remarkable capacity to regenerate following injury. In colorectal cancer (CRC), this regenerative capacity can be co-opted to drive epithelial plasticity. While oncogenic MAPK signalling in CRC is common, with frequent mutations of both KRAS (40-50%) and BRAF (10%)1, inhibition of this pathway typically drives resistance clinically. Given the development of KRAS inhibitors, and licensing of BRAF inhibitor combinations2-4, we have interrogated key mechanisms of resistance to these agents in advanced preclinical CRC models. We show that oncogenic MAPK signalling induces epithelial state changes in vivo, driving adoption of a regenerative/revival stem like population, while inhibition leads to rapid transcriptional remodeling of both Kras- and Braf-mutant tumours, favoring a Wnt-associated, canonical stem phenotype. This drives acute therapeutic resistance in Kras- and delayed resistance in Braf-driven models. Importantly, where plasticity is restrained, such as in early metastatic disease, or through targeting ligand-dependent Wnt-pathway Rnf43 mutations, marked therapeutic responses are observed. This explains the super response to BRAF+EGFR targeted therapies previously observed in a BRAF/RNF43 co-mutant patient population, highlighting the criticality of cellular plasticity in therapeutic response. Together, our data provides clear insight into the mechanisms underpinning resistance to MAPK targeted therapies in CRC. Moreover, strategies that aim to corral stem cell fate, restrict epithelial plasticity or intervene when tumours lack heterogeneity may improve therapeutic efficacy of these agents."

 Calcium carbonate precipitation in ageing ocean crust sequesters carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater through seafloor weathering reactions, influencing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on million-year timescales. However, this crustal carbon sink, and the extent it balances CO2 degassing during crustal formation at mid-ocean ridges, remain poorly quantified due to limited sampling of the vast ridge flanks where CO2 uptake continues for millions of years. Here we quantify the carbon sink hosted within talus breccias that accumulated through mass wasting 61 million years ago during rift faulting at the slow spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, cored during International Ocean Discovery Program South Atlantic Transect Expedition 390. After 40 million years of carbonate cementation, these breccias contain ~7.5 wt% seawater-derived CO2, 2 to 40 times more than previously cored upper crust. Our estimates of talus breccia abundance based on fault geometries indicate that talus formed at slow-spreading ridges can accommodate a CO2 sink equivalent to a large proportion of the CO2 released during accretion of the underlying crust. The proportion of plate divergence accommodated by faulting, and hence talus abundance, increases nonlinearly with decreasing spreading rate. Consequently, past variations in spreading rate may have impacted the balance between ocean crust CO2 release and uptake in Earth’s carbon cycle. Mass-wasting deposits that accumulated against mid-ocean ridge faults have high porosity in which calcium carbonate precipitated, storing seawater carbon dioxide, as revealed by cores of a 61-million-year-old seafloor talus deposit."

 The integration of high-κ dielectrics with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors has long been limited by the low reactivity of their dangling-bond-free surfaces and the scalability issues of conventional deposition techniques. Here, we report a universal van der Waals (vdW) integration strategy using HfSe2 as a high-κ precursor that is dry-transferred onto MoS2 and WSe2 and fully converted into amorphous HfO2 via plasma oxidation, while preserving atomically flat vdW interfaces. The resulting HfO2/MoS2 and HfO2/WSe2 gate stacks exhibit suppressed interface trap densities (Dit ≈ 7–8 × 1010 cm-2 eV-1) and high dielectric constants (κ ≈ 23). MoS2 n-type field-effect transistors (nFETs) and WSe2 p-type field-effect transistors (pFETs) fabricated with this approach achieve nearly ideal subthreshold swing ( ≈ 60 mV/dec) and negligible hysteresis ( ≈ 3 mV). This scalable methodology enables the vertical integration of complementary logic, demonstrated by complementary FET inverters and ring oscillators, establishing a promising route toward three-dimensional, energy-efficient logic technologies.

Here the authors report the emergence of partially reprogrammed hepatocytes persisting in plastic states during liver tissue injury, which are resistant to proliferation thereby limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis. 
 The liver has remarkable regenerative capacity owing to the boundless proliferative potential of hepatocytes. During liver injury, sustained regeneration must be balanced by mechanisms limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis. Epithelial plasticity is frequently observed during liver damage and is thought to mediate production of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) or hepatocytes, depending on tissue needs. Here we show that hepatocytes persisting in plastic states are present in virtually all liver injury contexts, representing the predominant outcome of hepatocyte reprogramming rather than their full BEC conversion. By developing tools to trap mouse hepatocytes in plastic states in vivo and using models of regeneration and transplantation, we show that plastic hepatocytes are refractory to proliferation cues from the microenvironment. Unlike terminally differentiated hepatocytes, plastic hepatocytes resist proliferation driven by endogenous oncogenic stimuli. Thus, acquisition of plastic states represents a protective mechanism that constrains hepatocyte proliferation, limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis during liver disease. The balance between cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest is essential for liver regeneration. Here the authors report the emergence of partially reprogrammed hepatocytes persisting in plastic states during liver tissue injury, which are resistant to proliferation thereby limiting overgrowth and tumorigenesis."

 The rapid and economical synthesis of novel bioactive compounds remains a hurdle in drug discovery efforts. This study demonstrates an integrated medicinal chemistry workflow that effectively diversifies hit and lead structures, enabling an acceleration of the critical hit-to-lead optimization phase. Employing high-throughput experimentation (HTE), we generated a comprehensive data set encompassing 13,490 novel Minisci-type C-H alkylation reactions. These data served as the foundation for training deep graph neural networks to accurately predict reaction outcomes. Scaffold-based enumeration of potential Minisci reaction products, starting from moderate inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), yielded a virtual library containing 26,375 molecules. This virtual chemical library was evaluated using reaction prediction, physicochemical property assessment, and structure-based scoring, identifying 212 MAGL inhibitor candidates. Of these, 14 compounds were synthesized and exhibited subnanomolar activity, representing a potency improvement of up to 4500 times over the original hit compound. These ligands also showed favorable pharmacological profiles. Co-crystallization of three computationally designed ligands with the MAGL protein provided structural insights into their binding modes.

 Genome three-dimensional organization is essential for eukaryotic gene expression. The chromosomes of the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei contain hundreds of silent variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes in subtelomeric regions. T. brucei transcribes a single VSG gene and periodically changes the VSG expressed, altering its surface coat to escape host antibodies by antigenic variation. We show that T. brucei core and subtelomeric chromosome compartments are separated by distinct boundaries and display topologically associating domains and loops. Chromosomes co-interact through compartment boundaries, which insulate silent subtelomeric from transcribed core compartments. We uncover chromatin-associating factors at the boundaries, including repressor-activator protein 1 (RAP1), which spreads over silent compartments. Inactivation of the RAP1 regulator, phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-phosphatase, removes RAP1 from boundaries and subtelomeric compartments, disrupting chromatin compartment contacts and activating all VSG genes. The data show spatial segregation of repressed from transcribed chromatin and phosphoinositide regulation of compartment assembly and genome organization.

 Despite recent advances, current brain organoid technologies face ongoing challenges in managing heterogeneity and representing the diverse structure and cell types of the human brain. Here, we develop a module-based cellular reconstitution technology to sequentially build uniform cortical assembloids with mature cortical structures and functional connectivity. The uniformity and maturity of the cortical assembloids are achieved by creating single-rosette-based organoids at the early stage, whose sizes were big and consistent with the treatment of Wnt and Hedgehog agonists, followed by spatial reconstitution with the Reelin-expressing neuronal layer and non-neuronal glial cells. The resulting single-rosette-based cortical assembloids are highly uniform and reproducible without significant batch effects, solving major heterogeneity issues caused by difficulties in controlling the number and size of rosettes in conventional multi-rosette organoids. Furthermore, these cortical assembloids structurally and functionally recapitulate the physiology of the human brain, including the six-layered cortical structure, functional connectivity, and dynamic cellular interplay between neurons and glial cells. Our study thus provides an innovative preclinical model to study a range of neurological disorders, understanding the pathogenesis of which requires an organoid system capable of representing the dynamic cellular interactions and the maturity of the human brain.

The authors introduce an asymmetric bulk flux equation, suggesting that the global ocean may absorb ~15% more CO2 than previously estimated. 
 Sea-air carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is typically estimated from the product of the gas transfer velocity (K) and the CO2 fugacity difference between the ocean surface and atmosphere. Total gas exchange comprises interfacial transfer across the unbroken surface and bubble-mediated transfer from wave breaking. While interfacial transfer is symmetric for invasion and evasion, bubble-mediated transfer theoretically favours invasion due to hydrostatic pressure, though field evidence has been lacking. Here we provide direct field evidence of this asymmetry and develop an asymmetric flux equation. Applying the asymmetric equation reduces bias in K, and increases global oceanic CO2 uptake by 0.3-0.4 Pg C yr-1 (~15% on average from 1991 to 2020) relative to conventional estimates. Further evasion data are needed to better quantify the asymmetry factor. Our study suggests that the ocean may have absorbed more CO2 than previously thought, and the asymmetric equation should be used for future CO2 flux assessments.

 Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions that go beyond pairwise networks. Triadic interactions, where one node regulates the interaction between two others, are a fundamental form of higher-order dynamics found in many biological systems, from neuron-glia communication to gene regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose the Triadic Perceptron Model (TPM) which shows that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical states of two connected nodes. Leveraging this result, we formulate the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to extract triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our findings highlight crucial aspects of triadic interactions that are often ignored, offering a framework that can deepen our understanding of complex systems across biology, ecology, and climate science.

This uncertainty-aware techno-economic analysis suggests that pyridinic-graphene membranes, which perform better as CO2 concentration decreases, offer a viable solution. 
 Membrane-based carbon capture offers an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional absorption-based processes, yet adoption remains limited by its performance with dilute CO2 sources such as natural gas power plants. Here we present a techno-economic assessment of pyridinic-graphene membranes—porous graphene membranes hosting pyridinic nitrogen—that yield increasingly high CO2 permeance and selectivity as CO2 concentration in the feed decreases. This unique behaviour substantially reduces energy consumption, process footprint and capture costs, even when considering the non-ideal effects such as concentration polarization and pressure drops. Using uncertainty-aware cost modelling, including membrane cost, electricity prices, contingency factors and learning curves, we show that capture costs can reach US$50–100 per ton CO2 for natural gas power plants and as low as US$25–50 per ton CO2 for coal and cement plants, positioning this technology favourably against state-of-the-art capture processes. Our work bridges material innovation with process optimization, highlighting the role of advanced membrane materials and process design in cost-effective carbon capture for diverse industrial sectors.

 Extreme flooding and prolonged, intensifying droughts have played a critical role in the rise and collapse of preindustrial states and empires worldwide, triggering cascading impacts such as crop failure, famine, and migration that undermined socio-political stability and economic resilience. We present a multicomponent hydroclimatic vulnerability model for crop supply networks to estimate the contribution of climatic stressors as one of several factors contributing to the decline of the late Tang Dynasty in northern China between 800 and 907 CE. We demonstrate that recurrent flooding and prolonged droughts, combined with an unsustainable shift in crop production from drought-tolerant millet to less resilient wheat and rice, led to harvest failures and food shortages during the cooler and drier climatic conditions of the late 9th and early 10th centuries CE. Intensifying raiding from competing polities and climatic extremes further affected grain supplies for the late Tang’s northern military frontier and partly contributed to the sudden decline of the dynasty. Our results emphasize the importance of multicomponent environmental response models to understand historical transformations and provide new aspects of China’s socio-political development during medieval times.

 Energy crops will be critical for scaling up production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in the United States and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here we examine the economic incentives for the extent and type of land conversion needed to scale up fuel production from a mix of cellulosic feedstocks and quantify its greenhouse gas intensity. We show that even with the availability of marginal non-cropland, there will be incentives for converting cropland to produce energy crops as the price of sustainable aviation fuel increases. But contrary to expectations, we find that scaling up fuel production by converting more cropland and more non-cropland from existing uses to energy crops lowers its net greenhouse gas intensity, due to high soil carbon sequestration rate of energy crops, even after considering land use change emissions.The potential savings in emissions are larger than the foregone soil carbon accumulation benefits from keeping that land in current uses.

 The increasing discharge of land-derived phytotoxic herbicides threatens oceanic primary production by inhibiting phytoplankton photosynthesis. Macroalgae also contribute significantly to ocean productivity, yet their responses to herbicides remain poorly understood. Here, using the annual Ulva prolifera green tide in the Yellow Sea as a natural model, we show that large-scale macroalgal blooms act as an effective multi-pathway bioremediation system for herbicides. U. prolifera reduced triazine herbicide concentrations by 32–89% across coastal waters, with some compounds becoming undetectable. The macroalgae displayed strong tolerance to atrazine and achieved high removal efficiency through direct bioaccumulation (bioconcentration factor >5,000 L/kg) coupled with synergistic interactions with associated bacteria. Moreover, U. prolifera enriched key degrader taxa (Rhodobacteraceae, Methylophagaceae, Methylophylus, Alteromonas), enhancing atrazine degradation 2.5-fold via complementary metabolic pathways including dichlorination and dealkylation. These findings reveal a previously overlooked role of macroalgal ecosystems in sustaining coastal resilience and underscore their potential as scalable, nature-based solutions to mitigate herbicide pollution in global oceans.

 Alpine lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are rapidly expanding under climate change, yet their role in the regional carbon budget remains unclear. Here we analyze carbon flux data from 156 alpine lakes of varying sizes and find that these lakes acted as a net carbon sink of 6.7 Tg C yr−1 during 2011–2022, approximately one-fifth of the terrestrial carbon sink over the QTP. This sink is dominated by alpine large alkaline lakes that sequester substantial carbon dioxide far outweighs carbon emissions from smaller lakes. Projected lake expansion under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios indicates an increase in the lake carbon sink by 2100, with the magnitude of this increase varying inversely with scenario level due to the effect of rising water temperatures. When combined with reduced terrestrial carbon sequestration by inundated grasslands, the overall impact of lake expansion on regional carbon budgets depends on future warming rates.

 Methane emissions contribute to about 30% of global warming, with coal mining in China as a major source. Here we comprehensively assess coal mine methane emissions in China from 2000 to 2023 by combining provincial production data with coal mine-specific emission factors. We employ a methodological framework to identify key factors affecting emission factors of individual coal mines, estimate provincial production-weighted average emission factors, and assess their associated uncertainties using bootstrap simulations. The findings reveal distinct geographic patterns in emission factors, with higher values observed in the Southwest (e.g., Guizhou and Sichuan), while the North and Northwest regions (e.g., Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang) exhibit comparatively lower emission factors. Mine production shifts from high-emitting provinces to low-emitting regions resulted in total coal mine methane emission reduction after 2016.

 The Asian monsoon (AM) region has experienced frequent extreme precipitation (EP) over the past decades. Effects of different drivers of water vapor transport process on EP remain unexplored. We thus investigate linear and nonlinear relationships between EP and concurrent precipitable water vapor (PWV) or vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT), using ERA5 reanalysis and 15 CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs), and quantify relative contributions of dynamic and thermodynamic water vapor transport processes to EP. PWV is purely thermodynamic, whereas IVT combines thermodynamic and dynamic drivers. Results show that consistently stronger correlations exist for PWV-EP than IVT-EP over the AM region for both ERA5 and GCMs. However, water vapor budget analysis reveals transient dynamic term dominates EP. Two apparently opposite conclusions result from greater variability in horizontal wind than specific humidity, mathematically causing dynamic term being larger than thermodynamic term, and destabilizing IVT-EP correlations. In a word, the thermodynamic water vapor transport process provides the robust basis for EP, while the dynamic water vapor transport process serves as a direct trigger, jointly controlling EP."

We demonstrate its persistence from a resolution of 160 km up to 5 km. Its root cause lies in biased moisture transport from the subtropics to the inner tropics reducing convection and weakening tropical circulation. Increasing the surface wind speed addresses the bias, but deteriorates the global circulation. This highlights the importance of resolution hierarchies and parametrization development. 
 The double Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (double-ITCZ) bias has been a persistent tropical precipitation bias over many climate model generations. This motivates investigations of whether increasing resolution and discarding parameterizations improves the representation of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and ITCZ. In this work, we study the double-ITCZ bias in an ICON XPP resolution hierarchy spanning from parameterized to explicitly described deep convection within a consistent framework. We demonstrate that the double ITCZ persists across horizontal resolutions from 160 to 5 km in specified sea-surface temperature simulations, independent of deep-convective and non-orographic gravity wave parameterizations. Changes in the treatment of near-surface wind speed within the turbulence parameterization can reduce the bias. However, we highlight that a key driver of the double-ITCZ bias seems to lie in the insufficient moisture transport from the subtropics to the inner tropics. The resulting dry bias in tropical near-surface moisture reduces deep convection over the Warm Pool, leading to a weakened Walker circulation. These biases ultimately culminate in the double-ITCZ feature. Increasing the near-surface wind speed limiter improves tropical near-surface moisture but exacerbates the bias in the moisture source, increasing the inner-tropical contribution at the expense of the subtropics. This degrades the representation of the global circulation, energy balance, and teleconnections. Additionally, we show that parameter adjustments at low resolution are informative of the response to the same parameter adjustments at high resolution. Our findings showcase the benefits of models supporting a range of resolutions and underline the importance of continuing the development of non-discardable parameterizations."

This V3.0 release includes new data records (a camera-derived normalized difference vegetation index and simplified data sets) and provides >4800 site years of phenological time series and transition dates, a 170 % increase relative to the previous release (V2.0). Over 450 of the time series are 5 years or longer in length. 
 Vegetation phenology plays a significant role in driving seasonal patterns in land-atmosphere interactions and ecosystem productivity, and is a key factor to consider when modeling or investigating ecological and land-surface dynamics. To integrate phenology in ecological research ultimately requires the application of carefully curated and quality controlled phenological datasets that span multiple years and include a wide range of different ecosystems and plant functional types. By using digital cameras to record images of plant canopies every 30 min, pixel-level information from the visible red-green-blue color channels can be quantified to evaluate canopy greenness (defined as the green chromatic coordinate, GCC), and how it varies in space and time. These phenological cameras (i.e., “PhenoCams”) offer a pragmatic and effective way to measure and provide phenology data for both research and education. Here, in this dataset descriptor, we present the PhenoCam dataset version 3 (V3.0), providing significant updates relative to prior releases. PhenoCam V3.0 includes 738 unique sites and a total of 4805.5 site years, a 170 % increase relative to PhenoCam V2.0 (1783 site years), with notable expansion of network coverage for evergreen broadleaf forests, understory vegetation, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural systems. Furthermore, in this updated release, we now include a PhenoCam-based estimate of the normalized difference vegetation index (cameraNDVI), calculated from back-to-back visible and visible+near-infrared images acquired from approximately 75 % of cameras in the network, which utilize a sliding infrared cut filter. Both GCC and cameraNDVI showed similar, but somewhat unique, patterns in canopy greenness and VIS vs. NIR reflectance, across various ecosystems, indicating their consistent ability to record phenological variability. However, we did find that at most sites, GCC time series had less variability and fewer outliers, representing a smoother signal of canopy greenness and phenology. Overall, PhenoCam greenness as measured by both GCC and cameraNDVI provides expanded opportunities for studying phenology and tracking ecological changes, with potential applications to the evaluation of satellite data products, earth system and ecosystem modeling, and understanding phenologically mediated ecosystem processes.

 Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged anomalies of warm sea surface temperature (SST) that can disrupt marine ecosystems, physical climate processes, and human coastal activities. MHW definitions vary due to different stakeholders requirements, such as ecological scientists and climate scientists having differing yet specific thresholds and metrics. Here we introduce a new global dataset of daily MHW metrics: climatological baselines, threshold exceedances, SST anomalies, and categorical event classifications of severity, derived from the European Space Agency SST Climate Change Initiative (ESA SST CCI) climate data record (CDR; 1982–2021) version 3.0 and an extension from 2022–2024 provided as an interim climate data record (iCDR). Building on the widely used definition of MHWs, periods in which SST exceeds the local 90th percentile for 5 or more days, our dataset extends this framework by incorporating multiple baseline climatologies (including fixed 30-year periods and rolling 30-year windows, as well as the period for reanalysis 1993–2016), varied percentile thresholds (90th, 95th, 99th), and both raw and linearly detrended SST anomalies. We also implement alternative event duration criteria (minimum 10-day and 30-day persistence) to classify longer-lasting warm events. All data products are provided at daily resolution on a 0.05° (~5 km) grid, with outputs including daily climatological percentiles, SST anomalies and binary MHW flags with severity category indices. This comprehensive dataset provides a consistent foundation for detecting and analysing MHWs across time and space, enabling researchers to assess how methodological choices affect MHW characterisation. By offering multiple definitions in parallel, the dataset facilitates intercomparison studies and supports applications from climate monitoring and model evaluation to marine ecological impact assessment, thereby providing users with pre-made indices for extremes."

 NAND flash memory is essential in modern storage technology, amid growing demands for low-power operation fuelled by data-centric computing and artificial intelligence1,2. Its unique ‘string’ architecture3, where multiple cells are connected in series, requires high-voltage pass operation that causes a large amount of undesired power consumption4. Lowering the pass voltage, however, poses a challenge: it leads to an associated reduction in the memory window, restricting the multi-level operation capability. Here, with a gate stack composed of zirconium-doped hafnia and an oxide semiconductor channel, we report ultralow-power ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) that resolve this dilemma. Our FeFETs secure up to 5-bit per cell multi-level capability, which is on par with or even exceeds current NAND technology, while showing nearly zero pass voltage, saving up to 96% power in string-level operations over conventional counterparts. Three-dimensional integration of FeFET stacks into vertical structures with a 25-nm short channel preserves robust electrical properties and highlights low-pass-voltage string operation in scaled dimensions. Our work paves the way for next-generation storage memory with enhanced capacity, power efficiency and reliability.

 Cognition is highly flexible—we perform many different tasks1 and continually adapt our behaviour to changing demands2,3. Artificial neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks will reuse representations4 and computational components5 across tasks. By composing tasks from these subcomponents, an agent can flexibly switch between tasks and rapidly learn new tasks6,7. Yet, whether such compositionality is found in the brain is unclear. Here we show the same subspaces of neural activity represent task-relevant information across multiple tasks, with each task flexibly engaging these subspaces in a task-specific manner. We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. In neural recordings, we found that task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Monkeys adapted to changes in the task by iteratively updating their internal belief about the current task and then, based on this belief, flexibly engaging the shared sensory and motor subspaces relevant to the task. In summary, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly perform multiple tasks by compositionally combining task-relevant neural representations.

 Mechanical transmission is essential in force-related activities ranging from the daily tying of shoe laces1 to sophisticated surgical2 and robotic operations3,4. Modern machines and robots typically use complex electronic devices designed to sense and limit force5, some of which still face challenges when operating space is limited (for example, in minimally invasive surgeries)6 or when resources are scarce (for example, operations in remote areas without electricity). Here we describe an alternative slipknot-based mechanical transmission mechanism to control the intelligent operation of both human and robotic systems. Through topological design, slipknot tying and release can encode and deliver force with a consistency of 95.4% in repeating operations, which circumvents the need for additional sensors and controllers. When applied to surgical repair, this mechanism helped inexperienced surgeons to improve their knotting-force precision by 121%, enabling them to perform surgical knots as good as those of experienced surgeons. Moreover, blood supply and tissue healing after surgery were improved. The mechano-intelligence exhibited in slipknots may inspire investigations of knotted structures across multiple length scales. This slipknot-gauged mechanical transmission strategy can be widely deployed, opening up opportunities for resource-limited healthcare, science education and field exploration.

 Our sensory systems work together to generate a cohesive experience of the world around us. Watching others being touched activates brain areas representing our own sense of touch: the visual system recruits touch-related computations to simulate bodily consequences of visual inputs1. One long-standing question is how the brain implements this interface between visual and somatosensory representations2. Here, to address this question, we developed a model to simultaneously map somatosensory body part tuning and visual field tuning throughout the brain. Applying our model to ongoing co-activations during rest resulted in detailed maps of body-part tuning in the brain’s endogenous somatotopic network. During video watching, somatotopic tuning explains responses throughout the entire dorsolateral visual system, revealing an array of somatotopic body maps that tile the cortical surface. The body-position tuning of these maps aligns with visual tuning, predicting both preferences for visual field locations and visual-category preferences for body parts. These results reveal a mode of brain organization in which aligned visual–somatosensory topographic maps connect visual and bodily reference frames. This cross-modal interface is ideally situated to translate raw sensory impressions into more abstract formats that are useful for action, social cognition and semantic processing3. A mode of brain organization that connects visual and bodily reference frames may translate raw sensory impressions into more abstract formats that are useful for action, social cognition and semantic processing."

 Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using single-qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution1. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators2 or using entangled states to enhance measurement sensitivity3. Here we describe protocols for using optically unresolved NV centre pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise at nanometre length scales. For noninteracting NV centres, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations, leveraging the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable phase cycling even for co-aligned NV centres that are spectrally unresolved. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole–dipole coupling between two NV centres and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centres. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV centre spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate methods for detecting high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centres. Controlling pairs of nitrogen vacancy centres enables the measurement of magnetic correlations below the optical diffraction limit, and the use of entangled pairs shows a linear scaling of the measurement sensitivity with readout noise, as opposed to the quadratic scaling that would be obtained with unentangled spins."

 Soil stresses affect crop yields and present global agricultural challenges1. Soil compaction triggers reduction in root length and radial expansion driven by the plant hormone ethylene2. Here we report how ethylene controls cell wall biosynthesis to promote root radial expansion. We demonstrate how soil compaction stress, via ethylene, upregulates Auxin Response Factor1 in the root cortex, which represses cellulose synthase (CESA) genes. CESA repression drives radial expansion of root cortical cells by modifying the thickness of their cell walls, which results in a thicker epidermis and thinner cortex. Our research links ethylene signalling with root cell wall remodelling, and reveals how dynamic regulation of cellulose synthesis controls root growth in compacted soil.

 Upon viral infection, the current paradigm of humoral immunity posits that germinal centre reactions occurring within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) yield effector plasma cells that subsequently traffic to infected organs or the bone marrow1–3. However, it is not well understood how viral tissue tropism may govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of such responses. Here we demonstrate that infection with a prototypical systemic virus indeed induces liver-trafficking plasma cells generated in SLOs, whereas strictly hepatotropic hepaciviral infection elicits locally primed, virus-specific plasma cells in the liver independently of SLO contribution. Such locally derived progenies emerged from inducible hepatic-associated lymphoid tissue (iHALT) structures containing generative foci of T follicular helper cells, myeloid cells and germinal centre-like B cells, often arising from single founder clones unique to individual periportal structures and locally supporting somatic hypermutation. Critically, the cellular composition, cell–cell contact partners and microarchitecture of such iHALT structures in mice were closely mirrored upon hepaciviral infection in humans. Functionally dependent upon CD40L signalling and cognate B cell receptor specificity, emerging CXCR4+VLA-4+LFA-1+CD44+CD138+ plasma cells were immediately retained along CXCL12+fibronectin+ICAM2+osteopontin+type I collagen+ periportal fibroblast tracts, acting as cognate anchoring pairs that were critical to their maintenance therein. In summary, we characterize humoral immunity exclusively generated and maintained within its extralymphoid site of viral infection in the liver amidst SLO dormancy, in which functional iHALT successfully compensates for strictly hepatotropic virus-induced SLO-evasion strategies to prevent persistent infection.

 Stem-like progenitors are self-renewing cytotoxic T cells that expand as effector cells during successful checkpoint immunotherapy1,2. Emerging evidence suggests that tumour-draining lymph nodes support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish tumour sites and are a key source of expanded effector populations3–6, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Here, using advanced three-dimensional multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, we identify antigen-presentation niches in tumour-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance and affinity evolution of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6high stem-like CD8+ T cells. Contrary to the prevailing view that persistent T cell receptor (TCR) signalling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement days beyond initial priming sustains the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway has a central role in this process through fine-tuning the TCR signal input that enables the selective expansion of high-affinity TCR stem-like clones as a renewable source of effector cells. PD-1 blockade disrupts this tuning, leading to terminal differentiation or death of the most avid anti-tumour stem-like cells. Our results therefore reveal a relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative-feedback regulatory loop and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumour effect at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high-affinity precursors. PD-1 blockade interferes with the selective expansion and maintenance of high-affinity TCR stem-like clones that have a critical role in effective checkpoint blockade therapy."

 Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological strategy that relies on small molecules such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glues, which induce proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to prompt target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation1. Sporadic reports indicated that ligands designed to inhibit a target can also induce its destabilization2–4. Among others, this has repeatedly been observed for kinase inhibitors5–7. However, we lack an understanding of the frequency, generalizability and mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena. Here, to address this knowledge gap, we generated dynamic abundance profiles of 98 kinases after cellular perturbations with 1,570 kinase inhibitors, revealing 160 selective instances of inhibitor-induced kinase destabilization. Kinases prone to degradation are frequently annotated as HSP90 clients, therefore affirming chaperone deprivation as an important route of destabilization. However, detailed investigation of inhibitor-induced degradation of LYN, BLK and RIPK2 revealed a differentiated, common mechanistic logic whereby inhibitors function by inducing a kinase state that is more efficiently cleared by endogenous degradation mechanisms. Mechanistically, effects can manifest by ligand-induced changes in cellular activity, localization or higher-order assemblies, which may be triggered by direct target engagement or network effects. Collectively, our data suggest that inhibitor-induced kinase degradation is a common event and positions supercharging of endogenous degradation circuits as an alternative to classical proximity-inducing degraders.

 The discovery of Shimao city (around 2300–1800 bce1), a premier state-level Neolithic fortified settlement in Shaanxi, China2, played an important role in helping us understand the emergence of socially stratified urban societies.

We also characterize the population history, revealing that Shimao culture-related populations originated mostly from a Yangshao culture-related population present at least 1,000 years earlier, and the lasting inflow of Yumin-related populations from Inner Mongolia did not interrupt regional genetic continuity. Broader genetic influence from southern mainland ancestry over Shimao culture-related populations supports evidence of rice farming expanding further north than previously expected. Together, these results uncover fine details of the regional peopling and social structure of early state establishment.

 The naming of Australopithecus deyiremeda1 from Woranso-Mille (less than 3.59 to more than 3.33 million years) indicated the presence of a species contemporaneous with Australopithecus afarensis in the Ethiopian Afar Rift. A partial foot (BRT-VP-2/73)2 and several isolated teeth from two Burtele (BRT) localities, however, were not identified to the species level. Recently recovered dentognathic specimens clarify not only the taxonomic affinity of the BRT hominin specimens but also shed light on the diet and locomotion of A. deyiremeda. Here we present a comparative description of these specimens and show that they are attributable to A. deyiremeda. We also find it parsimonious to attribute the BRT foot to this species based on the absence of other hominin species at BRT. The new material demonstrates that overall, A. deyiremeda was dentally and postcranially more primitive than A. afarensis, particularly in aspects of canine and premolar morphology, and in its retention of pedal grasping traits. Furthermore, the low and less variable distributions of its dental enamel δ13C values are similar to those from Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus anamensis, indicating a reliance on C3 foods. This suggests that A. deyiremeda had a dietary strategy similar to the earlier A. ramidus and A. anamensis. The BRT foot and its assignment to A. deyiremeda provides conclusive evidence that arboreality was a significant component of the positional behaviour of this australopith, further corroborating that some degree of arboreality persisted among Pliocene hominins1,3–7. 3.4-million-year-old hominin fossils discovered in Ethiopia provide insight into the diet and locomotion of Australopithecus deyiremeda."

 Food choice is an important driver of speciation and invasion of novel ecological niches. However, we know little about the mechanisms leading to changes in dietary preference. Here we use three closely related species, Drosophila sechellia (Dsec), Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster, to study taste circuit1 and food choice evolution. Dsec, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia; noni), whereas the other two are generalists living on diverse diets2. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in Dsec and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity by means of calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni activates bitter-sensing neurons more strongly in Dsec than in the other two species owing to a small deletion in a single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain3, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sucrose signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data indicate that altered food choice may not be explained by peripheral receptor changes alone but rather by modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands. Calcium imaging of taste neurons and the ventral brain provides insight into evolutionary divergence of food choice in Drosophila species, supporting a role of sensorimotor processing in addition to peripheral receptor changes."

 Exposure to economic inequality is widely thought to erode subjective well-being and mental health1–5, which carries important societal implications6–10. However, existing studies face reproducibility issues11–13, and theory suggests that inequality only affects individuals in disadvantaged contexts14–16. Here we present a meta-analysis of 168 studies using multilevel data (11,389,871 participants from 38,335 geographical units) identified across 10 bibliographical databases (2000–2022). Contrary to popular narratives, random-effects models showed that individuals in more unequal areas do not report lower subjective well-being (standardized odds ratio (OR+0.05) = 0.979, 95% confidence interval = 0.951–1.008). Moreover, although inequality initially seemed to undermine mental health, the publication-bias-corrected association was null (OR+0.05 = 1.019; 0.990–1.049)17. Meta-analytical effects were smaller than the smallest effect of interest, and specification curve analyses confirmed these results across ≈95% of 768 alternative models18. When assessing study quality and certainty of evidence using ROBINS-E and GRADE criteria, ROBINS-E rated 80% of studies at high risk of bias, and GRADE assigned greater certainty to the null effects than to the negative effects. Meta-regressions revealed that the adverse association between inequality and mental health was confined to low-income samples. Moreover, machine-learning analyses19 indicated that the association with well-being was negative in high-inflation contexts but positive in low-inflation contexts. These moderation effects were replicated using Gallup World Poll data (up to 2 million participants). These findings challenge the view that economic inequality universally harms psychological health and can inform public health policy. A meta-analysis of 168 studies reveals that economic inequality is not significantly associated with subjective well-being or mental health."

 Land-use change causes widespread shifts in the composition and functional diversity of species assemblages. However, its impact on ecosystem resilience remains uncertain. The stability of ecosystem functioning may increase after land-use change because the most sensitive species are removed, which leaves more resilient survivors1–3. Alternatively, ecosystems may be destabilized if land-use change reduces functional redundancy, which accentuates the ecological impacts of further species loss4,5. Current evidence is inconclusive, partly because trait data have not been available to quantify functional stability at sufficient scale. Here we use morphological measurements of 3,696 bird species to estimate shifts in functional redundancy after recent anthropogenic land-use change at 1,281 sites worldwide. We then use extinction simulations to assess the sensitivity of these altered assemblages to future species loss. Although the proportion of disturbance-tolerant species increases after land-use change, we show that this does not increase stability because functional redundancy is reduced. This decline in redundancy destabilizes ecosystem function because relatively few additional extinctions lead to accelerated losses of functional diversity, particularly in trophic groups that deliver important ecological services such as seed dispersal and insect predation. Our analyses indicate that land-use change may have major undetected impacts on the resilience of key ecological functions, hindering the capacity of natural ecosystems to absorb further reductions in functionality caused by ongoing perturbations. Large-scale analyses of bird species traits reveal that land-use change reduces resilience of key ecological functions more than previously thought."

 Glasses-free three-dimensional (3D) displays provide users with an immersive visual experience without the need of any wearable devices1,2. To achieve high-quality 3D imaging, a display should have both large linear dimensions and a wide viewing angle. However, the trade-off between spatial extent and bandwidth of optical systems, the space–bandwidth product, conventionally constrains the simultaneous maximization of the two. The two most common approaches to 3D displays are holographic3,4 and automultiscopic1,5,6, which, respectively, sacrifice either scale or viewing angle. Recently, some implementations enhanced by artificial intelligence have shown directions to mitigate these constraints, but they still operate within a set space–bandwidth product7,8. As a result, it remains challenging to fabricate large-scale wide-angle 3D displays9. Here we report the realization of a large-scale full-parallax 3D display with seamless viewing beyond 100°, maintained at over 50 Hz and 1,920 × 1,080 resolution on a low-cost light-field delivery setup.

 Lightning is among the most energetic manifestation of electrical activity in planetary atmospheres, with documented observations not only on Earth but also on Saturn and Jupiter1. On Mars, the existence of electrical activity has long been suspected2,3 but never directly demonstrated. The dusty atmosphere of Mars undergoes aeolian processes, ranging from wind-blown dust and sand, metre-to-hundred-metre-sized dust devils to thousand-kilometre-scale dust storms4, which, in Earth’s deserts, can become electrified through triboelectric charging5–7. For this reason, electric fields have been predicted to build up on Mars8–10, but with no measurement of Martian atmospheric electrical activity so far. Here we report in situ detections of triboelectric discharges, identified by their electrical and acoustic signatures captured by the SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover11,12. Fifty-five events have been detected over two Martian years, usually associated with dust devils and dust storm convective fronts. These serendipitous observations demonstrate that Martian electric fields can reach the breakdown threshold of the near-surface atmosphere of Mars, predicted to be on the order of several tens of kV m−1. Such electrical activity could affect dust dynamics13,14 and potentially fuel a reactive electrochemical environment enhancing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, with consequences for the preservation of organic molecules15,16. This in situ evidence may have implications for surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration.

 During mitosis, stable but dynamic interactions between centromere DNA and the kinetochore complex enable accurate and efficient chromosome segregation. Even though many proteins of the kinetochore are highly conserved1,2, centromeres are among the fastest evolving regions in a genome3,4, showing extensive variation even on short evolutionary timescales.

We show that new centromeres spread progressively via drift and subsequent selection and that the kinetochore, which is evolving slowly in relative terms, appears to act as a filter to determine which new centromere variants are tolerated.

 Detecting individual spins—including stable and metastable states—represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing, with broad applications across condensed matter physics1,2, quantum chemistry3 and single-molecule magnetic resonance imaging4,5. Although nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume6,7. Here we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution relative to single NV centres under ambient conditions. The protocol uses carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway towards atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interfaces.

 Amazonia is the largest1 and the most species-rich tropical forest region on Earth2, where hundreds of Indigenous cultures and thousands of animal species have interacted over millennia3,4. Although Amazonia offers a unique context to appraise the value of wildlife as a source of food to millions of rural inhabitants, the diversity, geographic extent, volumes and nutritional value of harvested wild meat are unknown. Here, leveraging a dataset comprising 447,438 animals hunted across 625 rural localities, we estimate an annual extraction of 0.57 Mt of undressed animal biomass across Amazonia, equivalent to 0.34 Mt of edible wild meat. Just 20 out of 174 taxa account for 72% of all animals hunted and 84% of the overall biomass extracted. We show that this amount of wild meat can meet nearly half of protein and iron dietary requirements for rural peoples, along with a substantial portion of their needs for B vitamins (18–126%) and zinc (23%). However, wild meat productivity is likely to have decreased by 67% in nearly 500,000 km² of highly deforested areas of Amazonia. Furthermore, the availability of wild meat per capita decreases significantly in areas with higher human population, greater proximity to cities, and more extensive deforestation. These findings highlight the urgent need to preserve the forest to safeguard biodiversity and traditional wild meat food systems, which will be essential for ensuring Amazonian peoples’ well-being and achieving several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals5.

 Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays1. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking (RB) techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot-based encodings. Moreover, we show the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate for exchange-only qubits and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade (PSB) readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB)2, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.

 Gut bacteriophages profoundly impact microbial ecology and health1–3; yet, they are understudied. Using deep long-read bulk metagenomic sequencing, we tracked prophage integration dynamics in stool samples from six healthy individuals, spanning a 2-year timescale. Although most prophages remained stably integrated into their hosts, approximately 5% of phages were dynamically gained or lost from persistent bacterial hosts. Within a sample, we found that bacterial hosts with and without a given prophage coexisted simultaneously. Furthermore, phage induction, when detected, occurred predominantly at low levels (1–3× coverage compared to the host region), in line with theoretical expectations4. We identified multiple instances of integration of the same phage into bacteria of different taxonomic families, challenging the dogma that phages are specific to a host of a given species or strain5. Finally, we describe a new class of ‘IScream phages’, which co-opt bacterial IS30 transposases to mediate their mobilization, representing a previously unrecognized form of phage domestication of selfish bacterial elements. Taken together, these findings illuminate fundamental aspects of phage–bacterial dynamics in the human gut microbiome and expand our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that drive horizontal gene transfer and microbial genome plasticity.

Here the authors show that reverse-migrating neutrophils anchored in the lung extracellular matrix exacerbate fibrosis via ICAM1 and macrophage derived cathepsin C. 
 Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive lung disease characterized by chronic immune dysregulation and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Neutrophils, traditionally linked to acute inflammation, are increasingly recognized for their role in fibrosis. In this study, we identified a unique subset of neutrophils undergoing reverse transendothelial migration (rTEM) in the lungs of a silicosis mouse model induced by intratracheal SiO₂ instillation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and ECM proteomics, we found that rTEM neutrophils were retained in fibrotic regions via ICAM1-mediated interactions with the ECM. Mechanistically, macrophage-derived cathepsin C (CTSC), accumulating in the ECM, cleaved ICAM1 into its soluble form (sICAM1), which promoted fibroblast activation and exacerbated fibrosis. In vivo depletion of neutrophils or macrophages reduced ICAM1 and CTSC levels, alleviating fibrosis and underscoring their pathogenic roles. These findings establish a direct link between ECM, rTEM neutrophils, and fibrosis, highlighting CTSC and ICAM1 as promising therapeutic targets. All animal experiments were performed using male mice. Pulmonary fibrosis involves chronic inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling but the contribution of neutrophils is unclear.

 The integration of organic synthesis with enzymatic catalysis offers a promising route toward efficient and sustainable construction of complex molecules. While organic synthesis enables diverse transformations, enzymatic catalysis enhances stereoselectivity under mild conditions, improving cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. However, current enzymatic synthesis planning algorithms face challenges in formulating robust hybrid organic–enzymatic strategies. Key issues include the difficulty in devising hybrid planning approaches and the reliance on template-based enzyme recommendations, which limits their adaptability across diverse scenarios. Here we show ChemEnzyRetroPlanner, an open-source hybrid synthesis planning platform that combines organic and enzymatic strategies with AI-driven decision-making. The platform features advanced computational modules, including hybrid retrosynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, plausibility evaluation, enzymatic reaction identification, enzyme recommendation, and in silico validation of enzyme active sites. A central innovation is the RetroRollout* search algorithm, which outperforms existing tools in planning synthesis routes for organic compounds and natural products across multiple datasets. ChemEnzyRetroPlanner provides an intuitive graphical interface and programmatic APIs for scalability, while leveraging the chain-of-thought strategy and the Llama3.1 model to autonomously activate hybrid synthesis strategies for diverse scenarios. The results indicate that this fully automated, open-source system holds potential value for improving the efficiency and sustainability of molecular synthesis.

 The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, adapting and responding to changes in diet, environment, and lifestyle. However, current microbiome research is heavily biased toward high-income countries, leaving regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) severely underrepresented. This imbalance limits our global understanding of microbial diversity and hinders the development of region-specific health interventions.

 Near-infrared room-temperature phosphorescent (NIR-RTP) materials feature the advantages of large Stokes shift, long emission lifetime, and high penetration ability, and have been broadly applied in bio-medical imaging, fiber optic telecommunication, and night vision-readable display. Developing organic NIR-RTP materials heavily relies on the long-conjugated chemical structures. The large conjugation could result in aggregation caused quenching, complex synthesis, poor processability, and high biological toxicity. Herein, by solution blending poly(iminofuran-spiro-pyrrolone) (PISP) with polystyrene (PS), we construct a nonconventional NIR-RTP polymer alloy without significantly extensive conjugation. The PISP was synthesized via a catalyst-free multicomponent polymerization in air with high molecular weights (up to 41000 g/mol) and decent yields (up to 84%). Although lacking classical luminescent segments and largely extended conjugation, PISPs exhibit the clusterization-triggered cryogenic phosphorescence. More importantly, upon solution blending PISP with PS, the resultant polymer alloy shows a NIR-RTP emission up to 715 nm with a Stokes shift of 375 nm. This work will be of interest for developing luminescent materials for the optoelectronic devices, in vivo imaging, and flexible electronics.

 The clinical application of checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer has been impeded by the emergence of immune-related adverse effects, such as pneumonitis. To date, the precise immune pathogenesis of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) remains elusive. Here, we perform comprehensive single-cell analysis, specifically the combination of scRNA-seq and scTCR/BCR-seq, to profile molecular and cellular changes in CIP tissues and matched noncancerous adjacent tissues from lung cancer patients.

The synthase proteins possess catalytic activity, while the polymerization factors are essential for complex formation. 
 Chondroitin sulfates are complex polysaccharide chains that regulate various biological processes at the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix. Here, we identify four heterodimeric complexes responsible for chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization in humans: CHSY1-CHPF, CHSY1-CHPF2, CHSY3-CHPF, and CHSY3-CHPF2. Using a custom-tailored in vitro glycosylation assay based on chemo-enzymatically synthesized fluorescent substrates, we demonstrate that all four complexes exhibit chain polymerization activity. The cryo-EM structure of the CHSY3-CHPF complex provides molecular insights into the chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization reaction. The architecture of the catalytic sites suggests that CHSY1 and CHSY3 are enzymatically active, while CHPF and CHPF2 primarily play a stabilizing role. Mutational analysis of purified enzyme complexes, combined with an in cellulo complementation assay, confirms that only CHSY1 and CHSY3 have bifunctional glycosyltransferase activities. Based on the spatial arrangement of the catalytic sites, we propose that chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization follows a non-processive, distributive mechanism.

Now a study finds that relying on a carbon tax alone falls short, whereas combining industrial regulations, subsidies and a modest tax is the most promising approach to achieve sustainable growth with green jobs. 
 A large number of countries have by now pledged to undertake policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. However, evidence for a suitable policy package to induce an effective and orderly transition is scarce. Recent studies suggest that abrupt and aggressive climate policies may trigger significant transition risks, potentially leading to macroeconomic imbalances. Here we extend a macro-financial agent-based integrated assessment model grounded in evolutionary economics and complex systems science to test a variety of policy packages aimed at rapidly decarbonizing the global economy and study how they affect job creation and economic stability. We show that carbon taxation alone is self-defeating: its role at internalizing environmental costs while triggering rapid decarbonization finds little support. However, an ensemble of industrial regulations and public subsidies coupled with a mild carbon tax is the most promising policy toolkit to support a rapid and orderly transition. Such a policy mix can be designed to have a neutral impact on public finances and to boost job creation during the transition process. Carbon taxation serves primarily as a tool for raising public revenues to support government spending, rather than as a direct driver of rapid decarbonization.

Recent groundwater salinization has further triggered a shift from nutrient to water limitation, causing severe stomatal closure and decoupling of tree carbon–water balance, which induces a negative intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE)–growth relationship. Higher tree iWUE predicted sharper tree growth declines, and both nutrient enrichment and high stand density amplified this feedback, increasing the risk of hydraulic failure and mortality. These results suggest that a transient nutrient-stimulatory effect could drive further coastal forest degradation due to heightened belowground saltwater stress under sea-level rise. Coastal tree growth under enhanced sedimentary nutrient inputs will turn to high mortality risks as atmospheric drought and sea level rise progress, revealed by a two-decade field experiment of coastal pine forests with different fertilization and density levels."

 The origin of intraplate basalts remains controversial, despite numerous isotope and seismic studies. Here we employ thermodynamic modeling with MAGEMin to integrate the Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes of basaltic volcanics with the seismic velocities of their mantle source. The results indicate that residual garnets generate high P-wave velocity anomalies in the mantle, and impart distinctive time-integrated εNd-εHf isotope signatures to the partial melts (i.e., the erupted basaltic magmas). Since the garnet-spinel transition (~42-60 km) is always shallower than the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (~70-100 km), garnet effects may serve as an indicator of thermal magmatic events. These findings suggest that the widely distributed Cenozoic intraplate basalts in Eastern China originated from the lithospheric mantle (<~60 km) that didn’t retain garnet. Two notable exceptions are the Wudalianchi and Nuominhe basalts, which originate from the asthenosphere (~100-140 km) and the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, respectively. The integrated radiogenic isotope-seismic velocity framework can be applied to intraplate basalts globally.

 Warming can alter the temporal stability of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in grasslands. However, it remains unclear how ANPP stability responds to long-term warming. Through a 10-year in-situ manipulative warming experiment conducted in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found warming initially enhanced ANPP stability and the positive effects of warming on ANPP stability tended to decline as the duration of the experiment was extended. Increased community height primarily enhanced ANPP and its stability under warming. However, declining sedge cover and reduced ecosystem carbon and water use efficiency under prolonged warming increased annual ANPP fluctuations, thereby negating the positive effects of warming on ANPP stability. Our findings provide the evidence that carbon and water use efficiency crucially maintain ANPP stability under long-term warming.

 Green space cooling is a nature-based solution to alleviate urban heat risk. However, the relationship between its cooling and urban development, particularly in the context of global economic differences, is poorly understood. Here, we examined the effect of the built-up environment on improving the cooling efficiency of green spaces in 1113 built-up areas. The average cooling efficiency of green spaces in the high-income countries globally is 1.64 times that in the low-income countries. In high-income countries, reducing built-up density and increasing building height can enhance the cooling efficiency of green spaces. Notably, maintaining built-up density below 20% enables relatively high cooling efficiency, regardless of variations in building height. In contrast, in most zones of low-income countries, controlling the low building height tends to achieve better cooling efficiency of green spaces. Our findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing green space layouts tailored to urban climate adaptation across different socio-economic regions.

 Pervasive high-conductivity anomalies in shallow cold subduction zones (40–70 km depths, corresponding to 1–2 GPa) remain unexplained by conventional mechanisms (e.g., dehydration fluids). Here we report a dramatic enhancement in brucite’s electrical conductivity at 1.2–2.0 GPa and 300–400 °C: conductivity rises sharply by 2–3 orders of magnitude over just 100 °C, ultimately reaching peak values of ~10−2 S/m, through integrated multi-anvil press experiments and in situ impedance spectroscopy analysis. Comprehensive post-experiment characterization of quenched samples confirms brucite preservation with no detectable dehydration byproducts (e.g., periclase). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy identifies high temperature-triggered distinct amorphous regions along grain boundaries above 300 °C, indicating conductivity enhancement arises from amorphization-facilitated proton transport in brucite. This result implies that high-conductivity anomalies in most shallow cold subduction zones likely originate from the amorphization of hydrous minerals (e.g., brucite), shedding light on the global water cycle and Earth’s deep electrical structure.

 The ocean absorbs about 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, with this uptake regulated by acid-neutralizing anions collectively termed alkalinity. Most seawater alkalinity originates from the weathering of aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals on land, whose dissolved products are transported to the ocean by rivers, a slow process that causes carbon dioxide removal to lag behind emissions. Here we present geochemical evidence showing that fine-grained glacial sediments mobilized by coastal erosion undergo rapid seafloor weathering. While aluminosilicate weathering is largely balanced by secondary clay formation (reverse weathering), carbonate dissolution yields a significant net release of alkalinity to coastal waters. Because more than two-thirds of the global coastline was formerly glaciated, ongoing deglaciation and erosion may enhance alkalinity fluxes, providing a previously unrecognized shortcut in the global carbon cycle. As this enhanced flux is ultimately driven by climate warming, it may act as a negative feedback that helps moderate future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

 Rare-metal granites and pegmatites are enriched in critical metals, such as lithium (>5000 ppm), relative to conventional granites in the crust (<100 ppm). The petrogenesis of lithium-bearing pegmatites has been historically associated with the high-degree fractional crystallisation of parental granites. However, the extent of lithium enrichment during this process remains debated due to uncertainties concerning the partitioning behaviour of lithium between minerals and felsic melts. Alternatively, lithium enrichment in granitic pegmatites may reflect the composition of their crustal source. To test the anatectic origin of rare-metal granites and pegmatites, partial melting experiments were performed on variably enriched metasedimentary rocks (100–800 ppm lithium). The experiments produced felsic melts with a lithium content of 180–2200 ppm and constrained mineral-melt partition coefficients for granitic systems. Trace element modelling demonstrates that high-grade granite-related deposits (>5000 ppm lithium) are sourced from the anatexis of enriched crustal rocks (>300 ppm lithium), followed by the moderate fractional crystallisation of the partial melts.

 Multimodal remote sensing imagery has been widely used in many fields. However, in specific scenarios, it is challenging to acquire the key modality, making it difficult to extract the land cover mapping information in conditions of missing modalities. Existing missing modality learning methods transfer historical complete modal feature knowledge to single-modal features disrupting their feature distribution, and leading to poor performance in downstream tasks. To address the aforementioned issue, a multimodal remote sensing land cover dataset called EarthMiss is designed to simulate real-world missing modality scenarios. EarthMiss comprises 3355 pairs of 0.6-meter high-resolution Optical and SAR images collected from 13 cities spanning five continents, including 8 common types of land cover objects, making it the multimodal remote sensing dataset with the highest number of classes at this high resolution. Besides, a remote sensing meta modal representation framework named MetaRS is proposed for missing modality land cover mapping task. MetaRS presents a meta-modal aware module to extract modality-invariant features for missing modality feature recovery, and a meta-modal representation regularization training strategy to guide meta-modal focus on task-related feature representation. Specifically, we disentangle features by supervising the covariance matrix of multi-modal features, and knowledge transfer takes place solely, thereby ensuring the consistency of the transferred knowledge. Then, a meta-modal representation branch fuses the meta-features of all modalities and calculates the prediction loss for them. Comprehensive experiments conducted across EarthMiss dataset, four additional benchmarks, and a 2023 Libyan-flood case study demonstrate that MetaRS significantly surpasses existing methods, and provides a promising alternative for multimodal remote sensing applications.

 Near-real-time (NRT) daily crop monitoring at the field scale is crucial for precision agriculture, yet remains challenging due to limitations in the spatial or temporal resolution of existing remote sensing methods. While Sentinel-2 provides adequate spatial resolution for field-level applications, its temporal resolution is insufficient for capturing rapid crop dynamics, especially in cloudy regions. Existing spatiotemporal fusion techniques require multiple clear-sky images and lack true NRT capability, while ground-based sensors offer continuous monitoring but with limited spatial coverage. To address these limitations, this study develops the Near-Real-Time Ground-Satellite Fusion (NRT-GSF) algorithm, a novel approach based on a Bayesian dynamic linear model and Kalman filtering. The algorithm uniquely integrates Sentinel-2 imagery with continuous measurements from Internet of Things for Agriculture (IoTA) systems to generate daily 10-m Green Area Index (GAI) products. Its recursive framework supports both forward prediction in NRT mode following satellite overpasses and backward updating to refine historical profiles. Implemented over French wheat fields using 34 IoTA systems and Sentinel-2 time series from 2019, the algorithm effectively enhanced spatiotemporal completeness and accuracy (R = 0.75–0.98, RMSE = 0.1–0.49). A comprehensive leave-one-out Sentinel-2 evaluation demonstrated its superiority over the current Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) algorithm. Ground validation using handheld RGB cameras further confirmed the accuracy of the GAI products from the new algorithm (RMSE = 0.5). The NRT-GSF framework offers a robust and operationally solution for daily, high-resolution crop GAI mapping in NRT mode, and it can be extended to other traits or applications in the near-real-time context."

 Flowers provide significant ecological and economic benefits. Despite rapid technological progress and broad availability of remote sensing data, flower detection and monitoring are still challenging because many phenological studies rely on vegetation indices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) which are not well-suited for flowers. Although some studies have focused on detection of flowering, the development and application of a comprehensive and robust remote sensing method for flowering remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce the flower color index (FCI) for detecting four major warm flower colors—red, pink, purple, and yellow—by leveraging remote sensing bands including blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (NIR); these bands are widely available across a variety of remote sensing platforms. Here, we demonstrate the application of FCI across species representing a range of vegetation forms (herbaceous, shrubs, and trees) and study locations, corresponding to global biodiversity hotspots. We also tested FCI performance utilizing imagery with different spatial resolution—SkySat (0.5 m), PlanetScope (3 m), and Landsat (30 m). We show that FCI effectively detects and quantifies flowering events, which can be widely applied in ecology (e.g., flowering phenology, species identification, biodiversity conservation), agriculture (e.g., pollination management, yield estimation), and ecotourism (e.g., cherry blossom festival). Our proposed FCI has a simple formulation, is fast to calculate, and robust to different environments (urban or natural), spatial scales (spatial resolution and spatial extent), and background effects.

This study quantifies the spatiotemporal evolution, frequency, duration, and severity of CHDEs from 1980 to 2023 and identifies both persistent hotspots and emerging risk regions. A compound-event detection framework combining percentile-based HW thresholds (85th, 90th, 95th) with Effective Drought Index (EDI) metrics was applied to E-OBS daily data at 0.1° resolution for the warm season (May–September). Three indicators, frequency, total occurrence, and severity, were used to assess long-term trends and spatial variability. Vector analysis decomposed CHDE drivers, estimating the relative contributions of HWs and DEs. Results show a 35–45% increase in annual CHDEs after 2000, with severe 7-day events (95th percentile) rising by 2.7% per year. The Mediterranean basin (Iberia, southern France, Italy, Greece, western Turkey) remains the principal hotspot, while central and northern Europe (Germany, Poland, the Baltic region, southern Scandinavia) have experienced a three- to five-fold rise in frequency. Vector angles (mean ≈12°) and magnitudes indicate HWs as the dominant driver, with DEs amplifying risks regionally.

 Ocean remote sensing is essential for a wide range of marine applications, yet persistent cloud cover often introduces large spatiotemporal gaps that undermine data continuity and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose the Bayesian Field Convolutional Neural Network (BF-CNet), a probabilistic fusion network designed for cloud-affected reconstruction and forecasting. BF-CNet consists of two cooperating modules: the Uncertainty Feature Extraction Module (UFEM), built upon Bayesian Neural Fields, which performs pixel-wise posterior inference from cloud-free observations to reconstruct missing regions with quantified uncertainty; and the Spatiotemporal Inference Module (SIM), a ConvLSTM-based network that propagates these probabilistic representations through time for short-term forecasting. The two modules are trained sequentially within a cascaded framework. A hybrid loss function that combines per-quantile mean absolute error (MAE) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is adopted to balance deterministic accuracy and probabilistic calibration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating deterministic (MAE, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM) and probabilistic (PICP, ECE) metrics is employed to jointly assess reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty reliability. Trained on datasets with physically realistic cloud masks, BF-CNet achieves substantial improvements over advanced baselines (e.g., cloud-region reconstruction MAE = 0.367, RMSE = 0.643, SSIM = 0.943, PSNR = 34.32 dB; ECE = 0.011), while maintaining computational efficiency and robust generalization across different oceanic variables.

 Exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases (RD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The abundant epidemiological evidence on the health effects of air pollution often focuses on individual pollutants, rather than complex mixtures of simultaneous exposure to multiple air pollutants. Traditional statistical approaches to investigate the effects of air pollution often predict the health outcome of a specific pollutant, and control for confounding by other pollutants. This is a limitation which could result in an underestimation of the health risks. Recently, the application of Machine Learning (ML) has been used to predict the health effects of complex air pollution mixtures. The aim of this study was to use unsupervised ML clustering methods to determine the joint effects of SO2, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 on hospital admissions for RD and CVD in the Vaal Triangle Airshed Priority Area (VTAPA), South Africa.Due to the missing air pollution from January 2011 to February 2020, data were imputed using the multiple imputation by chain equations (mice) method. K-means and spectral clustering methods were then applied to the air pollution data.A three-cluster spectral clustering model using the normalised Laplacian matrix, showed that the risk of RD hospital admission increased when exposed to SO2, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 in higher concentration levels, and lower levels of O3 by 1.04 (95 % CI 1.01–1.08). No cluster models showed an increased risk of CVD hospitalisation.Although the clustering methods used in this study were quick to run and analyse, it is evident that more studies need to be done before considering unsupervised ML a reliable and definite tool to study joint effects of air pollution on different health outcomes."

In this study, focusing on China, we deploy a provincial-scale energy system planning and operation model to examine the technical and cost-optimal potential of green hydrogen to fully remove carbon-based fuels in the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors by 2050. Our results show that green hydrogen infrastructure can enable more cost-effective decarbonization of both the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors. First, in the zero-carbon electricity sector alone, utilizing green hydrogen as long-duration storage enables a 17% reduction in the electricity-only cost (ZE scenario) relative to one without hydrogen. However, cost savings hinge on the availability of underground hydrogen storage. Second, coupling the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors by sharing green hydrogen infrastructure reduces the combined energy system cost by 6% compared to a decoupled energy system. Third, the coupled energy system also makes green hydrogen comparable to fossil fuel-based gray and blue hydrogen costs in China. Allocating the entire savings realized in the coupled energy system to just the hydrogen used as fuel/feedstock in hard-to-electrify sectors yields a 24% reduction in the hydrogen-only cost relative to the cost under the decoupled system. Last, coupling hydrogen infrastructure between electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors yields a substantially different spatial pattern of hydrogen production. In the decoupled energy system, 80% of hydrogen demand in electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors is produced locally within the same provinces, but the coupled energy system cuts local production to 30%, shifting production to high renewable energy generating provinces. Understanding the spatial patterns of optimal hydrogen infrastructure siting will help plan an integrated electricity and hydrogen system that can cost-effectively decarbonize multiple sectors and China’s broader economy."

Using 250 year simulations for Canada’s Taiga Plains, a priority of the 2 billion trees program, we tested afforestation and reforestation (A/R) strategies that combine species mix, planting density and surface albedo. Medium-density (600–1400 trees ha−1) mixed stands with ∼25%–40% deciduous trees stored 15%–30% more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures by coupling rapid early growth with long-term retention and greater disturbance resilience. Replanting under-stocked stands with these mixtures raised long-term storage by 18%–30% over business-as-usual. Accounting for albedo showed pure evergreen or deciduous stands lost 6%–20% of their climate benefit, whereas mixed stands yielded net cooling and the highest sequestration (≈ 4.6–4.7 tCO₂e ha−1 yr−1). Partial harvesting plus replanting preserved, and sometimes increased, ecosystem carbon (≈ 300–340 tC ha−1) and productivity (≈ 1.6–2.0 tC ha−1 yr−1) without raising risk.

Subsurface conditions such as soil depth and groundwater availability can influence plant drought vulnerability. Yet, how subsurface factors interact with climate stress and shape forest vulnerability and die-off at landscape scales remains poorly understood. The record-breaking hot and dry 2023–2024 summer in southwestern Australia induced widespread stress in the Jarrah Forest ecosystem. Analysis of vegetation greenness anomalies using airborne geophysics data, groundwater depth records, climate data, and remote sensing revealed that vegetation die-off emerged from the interactions of heat, water stress, and subsurface conditions. Shallow soils, rocky substrates, and limited access to subsurface water predisposed vegetation to experience heat and drought stress. Identifying the role and location of subsurface features enables identification of vulnerable, and resilient, areas and will guide adaptive forest management for resilience against future climate extremes."

We lack clear evidence on the changes in streamflow volume and timing of these rivers, which significantly compromises our capacity for protection. Here, we analyse alterations in streamflow and centre of timing at 1017 stream gauges across 812 climate-sensitive rivers and tributaries worldwide from 1950 to 2022. We observed increasing trends in streamflow volume (Q) at just over half of our sites (512), biased towards earlier changes in centre of timing (CT) (⩾−2 d yr−1), with more than 65% of records reflecting this trend. At over 80% of gauges, we found that rising Q and earlier CT are sensitive to increasing precipitation (P) and earlier centre of timing of precipitation (PCT). More than 60% of significant gauges show moderate to severe changes in Q and CT. We identified 104 global climate-sensitive rivers, located in subtropical, temperate and arctic regions, that have experienced large and severe changes based on long-term changes in Q seasonality (CT > ±15 d). Long-term changes in Q and CT may persist in rivers experiencing large and severe changes and intensify in those with minor and moderate changes. These changes will increase flooding, alter storage, cause water shortages, and degrade river health. We recommend proactive strategies including better streamflow monitoring, adaptive infrastructure (e.g. reservoirs, flood control), flexible flood management protocols, water-sharing agreements during droughts, and prioritised protection of ecosystems to buffer against variations in Q and CT."

We found that meteorological variations, induced by a transition from El Niño to La Niña, were the main cause of persistent pollution, as stronger northerly winds enhanced pollutant transport into the region. In contrast, the effect of rapid emission reductions was limited. Recommendations for air quality improvement were also proposed. 
 Effective air quality management requires a comprehensive understanding of how meteorological variability and emission changes shape multiannual changes in regional PM2.5 pollution. During the cold seasons of 2015–2017, persistent PM2.5 pollution occurred in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China, despite rapid emission reductions. This study systematically investigated the interconnections between climate variability, meteorology, PM2.5 levels, source contributions and budgets during these periods, aiming to uncover the detailed impacts of meteorological and emission changes on PM2.5 pollution. We found that drastic meteorological changes, closely linked to a transition from strong El Niño (2015) to weak/moderate La Niña (2017), were the main drivers of the three-year PM2.5 changes. Strengthened northerly winds and reduced humidity enhanced cross-regional PM2.5 transport into the PRD while concurrently suppressing local PM2.5 production and accumulation. WRF/CMAQ simulations indicate that transport (non-local) contributions to PM2.5 in the PRD increased from 70 % in 2015 to 74 % in 2016 and 78 % in 2017. While the transport of secondary inorganic PM2.5 components overall intensified, their responses to meteorological and emission changes varied: Variations in sulfate were more sensitive to emission reductions outside the PRD, whereas those for nitrate were primarily driven by meteorological shifts. Simulated PM2.5 mass budgets further support the increasing dominance of transport, especially via advections. Our findings underscore the potentially crucial role of meteorological variability in driving multiannual PM2.5 pollution changes in the PRD and other regions strongly impacted by cross-regional transport, emphasizing the necessity for regionally coordinated emission control strategies to effectively mitigate PM2.5 pollution."

The dataset combines traditional microscopy-based phytoplankton counts with zooplankton data (abundances) obtained from digitized images using the ZooScan imaging system, along with surface and bottom temperature and salinity measurements. Sampling was conducted seasonally along two main transects and three coastal stations, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics of plankton communities. Phytoplankton was identified at the species level by the same taxonomist during all the time series (573 taxa in total). From their individual images, zooplankton were automatically sorted into 103 taxonomic and morphological groups, validated by an expert, and compiled into a data table, allowing both community and individual approaches using abundances and biovolumes at both individual and community levels. Individual zooplankton images have also been made available for further morphometric analyses. This 14-year-long, spatially and temporally resolved zooplankton imaging dataset (available at https://doi.org/10.17882/105465) is part of an ongoing effort to enhance the availability of zooplankton imaging data, locally and globally.

Using satellite images from the MODIS Terra and Aqua sensors, we monitored daily ice cover and seasonal freeze-up and breakup timing. On average, over 65 % of river segments show later freeze-up (~ 9 days), earlier breakup (~ 8 days), and shorter ice seasons (~ 14 days), revealing a clear signal of rapid warming across Arctic river systems. 
 River ice plays a critical role in Arctic freshwater routing, navigation safety, and biogeochemical exchange. However, consistent, daily-resolved observations across the pan-Arctic remain scarce. Here we present a harmonized, multi-decadal dataset of daily river ice concentration (RIC) and annual phenology (freeze-up, breakup, and ice duration) for the six largest Arctic rivers—Yukon, Mackenzie, Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma—covering hydrological years 2001–2024. Built from >590,000 MODIS Terra/Aqua scenes, our workflow integrates a scalable threshold-based classifier on Google Earth Engine with dual-satellite daily synthesis, temporal-window cloud reclassification, and a high-latitude dark-period correction. Technical validation against higher-resolution optical imagery shows a mean RIC accuracy of 0.83 across basins. Phenological metrics derived from MODIS agree with in situ records with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 10.8 days for freeze-up and 11.4 days for breakup (improving to 8.4 days relative to the onset of ice drift), and with Landsat-based river-section phenology with MAE of 10.5 days (freeze-up) and 16.0 days (breakup). RIC correlates strongly with surface air temperature (mean Pearson r = −0.91) and increases systematically with latitude. Trend analysis from 2001 through 2024 shows delayed freeze-up in over 66 % of river segments, earlier breakup in more than 65 %, and shorter ice seasons in over 65 %. On average, freeze-up is delayed by 9.0 days, breakup occurs 7.8 days earlier, and ice duration shortens by 14.1 days over the study period. These basin-consistent, temporally resolved records provide an open benchmark for diagnosing cryospheric change in Arctic river corridors and for constraining model–data intercomparisons. The river-ice dataset is available via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17054619, Qiu et al., 2025)."

Collected over six monitoring periods between 2016 and 2025, it offers a critical basis for analysing thermal exposure of giant clams, identifying potential refugia, and supporting modelling of atoll responses to climate change. 
 In French Polynesia, semi-closed atolls of the eastern Tuamotu Archipelago are home to fisheries and mariculture activities based on giant clam resources. These activities are increasingly vulnerable to global warming, as evidenced by the mass bleaching event observed in Reao atoll in March 2024, triggered by the most intense and prolonged Marine Heatwave (MHW) ever recorded in this lagoon. The GAIA project (manaGement strAtegy evaluatIon for small-scale fisheries in Atoll lagoons) was launched to address this issue and aimed to explore the sustainability of giant clam fisheries under climate change, with a particular focus on processes driving thermal exposure during MHWs. To achieve this, spatial and temporal temperature fluctuations, lagoon circulation, and water exchange dynamics between ocean and lagoon across the atoll rim were monitored using moored autonomous oceanographic sensors. A total of 6 monitoring periods took place between December 2016 and May 2025, with the most extensive instrumentation covering the entire February–March 2024 MHW event. The strength of these observations lies not only in their coverage of a unique and poorly sampled ecosystem, but also in their comprehensive documentation of an exceptional MHW event, from its onset and peak to its dissipation, providing an unprecedented record of the full life cycle of a major thermal anomaly in a tropical semi-closed atoll lagoon. This dataset also supports future modelling efforts to simulate temperature dynamics and identify thermal refugia in atoll lagoons under changing climate scenarios. All data were post-processed, quality-controlled, and formatted into interoperable NetCDF files.

Using this methodology, we reveal systematic differences between high- and low-resolution DGVM simulations caused by under-representation of climate variability in the low-resolution data and poor representation of shore lines and inland water bodies. In a study area covering European Union, the differences in aggregated output variables were found to be 2.8%–7.3%. 
 Simulations of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are typically conducted at a spatial resolution of 0.5°, while higher-resolution simulations remain uncommon. This coarse resolution eliminates detailed orographic features and hence, associated climate variability, which are especially pronounced in mountainous regions. The impact of disregarding such variability on vegetation dynamics has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we explore the differences in vegetation outcomes between the DGVM LPJ-GUESS simulations conducted at high and low spatial resolutions. Using the CHELSA algorithm, we create an elevation-informed high-resolution climate dataset for a domain encompassing the European Union. Distinctive features of this algorithm include orographic nature of formation of precipitation, a negative derivative of temperatures with respect to elevation, and also, detailed consideration of shadowing and exposure of the terrain to the Sun in computations of solar radiation. We design a custom experiment protocol and use it to perform LPJ-GUESS simulations on both resolutions. Comparative analysis reveals significant systematic discrepancies between the two resolutions. In mountainous areas, all of the considered output variables show statistically significant differences. In particular, carbon pools are smaller on the high resolution, with the total carbon pool being 37 %–39 % smaller. Furthermore, we quantify the extent to which the under-representation of orographic climate variation affects regional predictions across the European Union. This is expressed as a difference in the total value, which ranges from −3.8 % for the net ecosystem productivity to 2.9 % for the litter and soil C pools. These values are found to be comparable to differences caused by miss-representation of water bodies and shorelines on the low resolution."

Standard coupling algorithms introduce a numerical error, which one can compute with iterative coupling methods. We use such a method for a coupled model of a single vertical column of the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice. We find that coupling errors in the atmosphere and at the ice surface can be substantial and that discontinuous physics parameterizations lead to convergence issues of the iteration. 
 The atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice components in Earth system models are coupled via boundary conditions at the sea surface. Standard coupling algorithms correspond to the first step of an iteration, so-called Schwarz waveform relaxation. Not iterating is computationally cheap but introduces a numerical coupling error, which we aim to quantify for the case of a coupled single column model: the EC-Earth AOSCM, which uses the same coupling setup and model physics as its host model, EC-Earth. To this end, we iterate until a reference solution is obtained and compare this with standard, non-iterative algorithms. Understanding the convergence behavior of the iteration, as well as the size of the coupling error, can inform model and algorithm development. Our implementation is based on the OASIS3-MCT coupler and allows to estimate the coupling error of multi-day simulations.In the absence of sea ice, SWR convergence is robust. Coupling errors for atmospheric variables can be substantial. When sea ice is present, results strongly depend on the model version. In the latest model version, coupling errors in sea ice surface and atmospheric boundary layer temperature are often large. Generally, we find that abrupt transitions between distinct physical regimes in certain parameterizations can lead to substantial coupling errors and even non-convergence of the iteration. We attribute discontinuities in the computation of atmospheric vertical turbulence and sea ice albedo as sources for these problems."

To support future satellite missions, we created a new land surface model based on the Crocus scheme that simulates snow microstructure. Key improvements include better snow albedo representation, enhanced Arctic snow modeling, and improved forest module to capture Canada's diverse snow conditions. Results demonstrate improved simulations of snow density and melt across large regions of Canada. 
 Snow microstructure – characterized by density, grain size, grain shape and arrangement – fundamentally determines snowpack macroscopic properties. Despite this critical role, many land surface models (LSMs) lack explicit representation of snow microstructure. This limitation has become increasingly critical as future spaceborne missions for snow water equivalent measurement demand advanced modelling systems capable of accurately estimating snowpack properties, including microstructure, across diverse climatic and vegetation regions. The Soil Vegetation and Snow (SVS) LSM, used by Environment and Climate Change Canada for operational land surface and hydrological predictions, has been substantially upgraded to address these challenges. SVS version 2.0 (SVS2) incorporates the detailed multilayer Crocus snowpack model, enabling distinct simulations of snowpack evolution in both open terrain and forested areas within each grid cell. Crocus within SVS2 has been upgraded from its original alpine design with three major enhancements to handle Canada's varied snowpack conditions: an advanced albedo parameterization that accounts for spatial variability in light-absorbing particle deposition, new physical parameterizations tailored to Arctic snow characteristics, and a refined canopy model for forest environments. Significant improvements in simulations of near-surface density predictions are evident along a latitudinal transect from southern Quebec to the Canadian Arctic, while challenges remain in simulation of density and specific surface area in basal snow layers. SVS2 achieved substantial gains in snow melt-out timing accuracy, reducing prediction errors by over 50 % compared to the alpine Crocus version and surpassing two established snow reference products (ERA5-Land and ERA5-Crocus). These enhancements position SVS2 as a substantial advancement for future operational snow modeling applications across Canada."

WUI fires emit a cocktail of chemicals from the combustion of anthropogenic materials, including compounds that may differ from the burning of biogenic‐only materials. There is currently limited knowledge on the mixture composition of combustible materials in WUI homes, representing a data gap and need to further characterize exposure chemistries and toxicological impacts of WUI‐relevant smoke exposures. To address this issue, this study integrated combustible materials in an average American WUI home to derive what we are referring to as the “Burning ExposHome.” Items such as structural materials, plumbing, furnishings, and appliances were included in the Burning ExposHome. Calculations were based on an average American household, a 2,016 sq. ft. single family home of four bedrooms, using materials typical to California due to the high incidence of WUI fires in that geographic region. All materials were sorted and summed by type of base material such as wood materials, plastics, textiles, and metals. This list is notably modular and detailed per item, allowing for the addition/subtraction of components to address future study designs. In summary, the total combustible mass of an average American home was around 46,500 kg, including 81% wood materials, 6% plastics, and 2% metals.

Although soil moisture (SM) and soil temperature (ST) are known to shape the fungal lifecycle, their effects on coccidioidomycosis remain understudied. Most prior studies have relied on their proxies—precipitation and air temperature—that might not accurately capture soil hydrothermal dynamics. We conducted multivariable negative binomial regressions to estimate seasonal associations between incidence and climate drivers—including SM, ST, and wind speed from the North American Land Data Assimilation Phase 2 (NLDAS‐2), and PM10‐based dusty‐day counts—in Arizona's hyperendemic counties (Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal) from 2000 to 2022. We found higher incidence in areas with hotter, drier soils and more seasonal dusty days. Multi‐year soil hydrothermal cycles—alternating wet–dry and cool–hot periods along with concurrent dry, dusty conditions—significantly influenced incidence. Notably, no antecedent dry–cool seasons were linked to increased incidence, indicating moisture and/or heat are prerequisites for fungal growth and dispersal. SM showed more consistent and widespread effects than ST across seasons and lags, with winter and spring soils most influential. Higher incidence followed wetter winters and monsoons, and dry, hot springs and falls. Our models using NLDAS‐2 SM and ST data showed robust performance and generalizability across exposure seasons. Our results support adding multi‐year soil indicators—with up to 3‐year lead times—into early‐warning systems to enhance VF forecasting and better prepare endemic regions for the challenges of a warming, drying, and increasingly variable climate."

To gain insights into this issue, we have constructed epidemic, drought, and flood indices for the Ming and Qing dynasties of China in a period of more than 400 years. Using adaptive fractal analysis, we find that the time series of epidemic, drought, and flood indices possess long‐range correlations of different degrees in different regions of China. More importantly, the scaling behavior for the cross correlations between the epidemic and the drought indices in Northern China is characterized by a non‐stationary emergent behavior rather than by a long‐range correlation, while this scaling behavior is close to the boundary of stationarity and non‐stationarity in the Central China. This scaling is up to about 16 years, highlighting that on average, outbreak of large‐scale epidemics may occur not shorter than once every 32 years. Interestingly, the emergent behavior can be characterized as a Zipf's law for the ranked size of the epidemics, mostly in the Northern China, and sometimes also involving some regions in the Central China."

 The molecular mechanisms that enable memories to persist over long timescales from days to weeks and months are still poorly understood1. Here, to develop insights into this process, we created a behavioural task in which mice formed multiple memories but only consolidated some, while forgetting others, over the span of weeks. We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverged between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, that is, cellular macrostates, in the thalamocortical circuit that defined memory persistence. Of note, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that although these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization. In particular, the calmodulin-dependent transcription factor CAMTA1 was required for initial memory maintenance over days, whereas the transcription factor TCF4 and the histone methyltransferase ASH1L were required later to maintain memory over weeks. These results identify a critical CAMTA1–TCF4–ASH1L thalamocortical transcriptional cascade that is required for memory stabilization and put forth a model in which the sequential recruitment of circuit-specific transcriptional programs enables memory maintenance over progressively longer timescales.

 Lineage plasticity is a cancer hallmark that drives disease progression and treatment resistance1,2. Plasticity is often mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that may be reversible; however, there are few examples of such reversibility. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), plasticity mediates resistance to androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors and progression from adenocarcinoma to aggressive subtypes, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE)3–5. Here we show that plasticity-associated treatment resistance in CRPC can be reversed through the inhibition of NSD2, a histone methyltransferase6. NSD2 upregulation in CRPC-NE correlates with poor survival outcomes, and NSD2-mediated H3K36 dimethylation regulates enhancers of genes associated with neuroendocrine differentiation. In prostate tumour organoids established from genetically engineered mice7 that recapitulate the transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states, and in human CRPC-NE organoids, CRISPR-mediated targeting of NSD2 reverts CRPC-NE to adenocarcinoma phenotypes. Moreover, a canonical AR program is upregulated and responses to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide are restored. Pharmacological inhibition of NSD2 with a first-in-class small molecule reverses plasticity and synergizes with enzalutamide to suppress growth and promote cell death in human patient-derived organoids of multiple CRPC subtypes in culture and in xenografts. Co-targeting of NSD2 and AR may represent a new therapeutic strategy for lethal forms of CRPC that are currently recalcitrant to treatment. Inhibition of the histone methyltransferase NSD2 and the androgen receptor in preclinical models can reverse lineage plasticity to suppress tumour growth and promote cell death in multiple subtypes of castration-resistant prostate cancer."

 Plant metabolic activities are regulated to adapt to the fluctuating environment for optimized growth, while interplay between metabolic and chromatin pathways plays an essential role in environmental adaptation. However, how metabolic and chromatin regulators cooperate to control metabolite accumulation and gene expression required for stress tolerance remains unclear. Here, we show that the pyruvate kinase 1 (PK1) has a function to integrate stress signals for metabolic and epigenetic controls of heat tolerance in rice. Over-expression of PK1 enhances plant tolerance to heat, while its loss-of-function decreases the recovery rate from heat stress. Heat stress induces PK1 production, nuclear enrichment, lysine acetylation and activity for pyruvate accumulation, H3T11 phosphorylation (H3T11p) and H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac), and gene expression. In addition, PK1 phosphorylates General control non-repressed protein 5 (GCN5) and stimulates its activity for H3K9ac. Conversely, under heat stress GCN5 enhances PK1 lysine acetylation and enhances its activity for H3T11p and pyruvate production. The PK1 and GCN5-controlled H3T11p and H3K9ac are required for heat stress-responsive gene expression. These results establish PK1 as key player linking metabolic and chromatin pathways and uncover a mutually stimulating mechanism between metabolic and chromatin regulators for stress tolerance in rice.

 Squeezed states of light are essential for emerging quantum technology in metrology and information processing. Chip-integrated photonics offers a route to scalable and efficient squeezed light generation, however, parasitic nonlinear processes and optical losses remain significant challenges. Here, we demonstrate single-mode quadrature squeezing in a photonic crystal microresonator via degenerate dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing. Implemented in a scalable, low-loss silicon-nitride photonic-chip platform, the microresonator features a tailored nano-corrugation that modifies its resonances to suppress parasitic nonlinear processes. In this way, we achieve an estimated 7.8 dB of on-chip squeezing in the bus waveguide, with potential for further improvement. These results open a promising pathway toward integrated squeezed light sources for quantum-enhanced interferometry, Gaussian boson sampling, coherent Ising machines, and universal quantum computing.

 Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on homochiral microporous materials have emerged as a promising approach for enantioselective separation. However, constructing MMMs for achieving efficient enantioselective separation at a high feed concentration still remains a great challenge due to the suboptimal interfacial compatibility. Here, we employ soluble porous organic cages (POCs) of intrinsic chiral sites as fillers to fabricate MMMs devoid of interfacial defects, exhibiting fast and selective enantioseparation for racemic 2-phenylpropionic acid with a flux of 2.93×10-3 mol m-2 h-1 and an enantiomeric excess (ee) value up to 100% at a high concentration of 0.1 mol L-1. The POC-based MMMs demonstrate a long-term operation stability with a low ee decline rate of 0.56% h-1. This work reveals the imperative role of the microporous chiral environment in POCs for the enantioselective recognition and furnishes guidelines for the construction of POC-based membranes for efficient chiral separation.

Here, the authors show that combined PARP and ATR inhibition triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in cancer and normal cells, revealing a mechanism to balance efficacy and toxicity in DDR inhibitor therapies. 
 The combination of DNA damage response inhibitors (DDR inhibitors) has emerged as a promising strategy for anticancer therapy. Herein, we demonstrate that the combined administration of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitors elicits PANoptosis across diverse cellular lineages, including non-cancerous cell populations. The induction of PANoptosis is dependent on mitotic entry and ZBP1-dependent PANoptosome (ZBP1-RIPK1-Caspase8-Caspase6). We identify the Aurora kinase B (AURKB) as the upstream regulator, essential for phosphorylation of ZBP1 which impacts ZBP1-dependent PANoptosome assembly and activation. The Trp53-/- Brca1-/- model of ID8 and two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models further confirm the occurrence of PANoptosis following combination administration in vivo. The toxicity is mitigated in ZBP1-knockout mice. This study unveils a mechanism that dictates cell fate during DDR inhibitors-induced aberrant mitosis, emphasizing the critical balance between efficacy and safety in optimizing DDR inhibitors combination therapies.

 The multiplexity of current antibody-based imaging is limited by the number of reporters that can be detected simultaneously. Compressed sensing can be used to reconstruct high-dimensional information from low-dimensional measurements. Previously, compressed sensing using composite in situ imaging (CISI) of transcriptomic data leveraged gene co-regulation structure to recover spatial expression of 37 RNA species from images of 11 composite channels. Here, we extend the CISI framework to protein expression data measured by imaging mass cytometry (IMC). CISI-IMC accurately recovers spatial expression of 16 immune and stromal marker proteins from images of 8 composite channels with an average Pearson’s correlation of 0.8 across protein. Training the CISI-IMC framework using data collected on multiple human tissues enables universal decompression of composite data from a wide range of tumor and healthy tissue types. The expression dictionary and barcoding matrix described here are immediately implementable for general immune and stromal cell type classification, but CISI-IMC can in principle be applied to other markers or other antibody-based imaging methods.

They show that short-distance shifts towards dense vegetation or vertically downwards in canopies reduce velocities, highlighting that structurally complex ecosystems may provide short-term climate refuges. 
 Climate velocity—the speed and direction species must move to track climate change—is often estimated without accounting for vegetation-driven microclimatic variation. Using mechanistic microclimate models parameterized with three-dimensional maps of topography and vegetation structure, here we show that microclimate heterogeneity reduces the magnitude and alters the direction of climate velocity for maximum and minimum temperatures. For understory-dwelling organisms, the magnitude of maximum temperature velocity was halved and generally oriented towards areas with dense vegetation. For canopy-dwelling organisms, the magnitude of maximum temperature velocity was nearly zero, with vectors oriented vertically downward. These results demonstrate that vegetation complexity produces localized microrefugia, enabling short-term persistence of species under warming conditions.

 Catastrophic earthquakes have struck along the East Anatolian Fault (EAF), including the 2020 Elaziğ earthquake and the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake doublet. We integrated ground velocity from 2015-2020, together with co- and post-seismic deformation from the 2020 and 2023 earthquakes to investigate the fault slip evolution of the EAF, aiming to reveal the potential future seismic hazards. The spatiotemporally continuous deformation field allows us to derive complete slip distribution models throughout the earthquake cycle, including an interseismic period, two distinct postseismic periods, and three coseismic events. The results demonstrate that the slip patterns exhibit complementary characteristics across the interseismic, coseismic, and postseismic phases. Additionally, by integrating historical earthquake records with the strain accumulated and released during the observation period and quantifying the corresponding slip deficits, we evaluated the seismic potential of the EAF. Among these, the Palu segment emerged as having particularly high seismic risk, emphasizing the need for close monitoring. Geodetic observations suggest segments of the East Anatolian Fault which display interseismic slip deficits correlate with the rupture zones of the 2020 Elaziğ earthquake and the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake doublet and may be useful to identify high risk regions."

 Improving Urban Land Use Efficiency (LUE) can curb urban sprawl, protect farmland and ecological spaces, and promote low-carbon, intensive development models. Although numerous studies have been conducted, uncertainty and bias in LUE assessments—stemming from data sources, LUE calculations, and trend analysis methodology—has rarely been investigated. After a series of tests, here we propose a reliable, comprehensive, and equitable framework, which uses Built-Up Area per capita (BUP) metrics and provincial population data, along with time-series analysis tools, to assess LUE trends. Our global evaluation reveals that 79.6% of provinces saw significant BUP growth from 1985 to 2020, with an average increase of 15 m² per capita per five years - a trend that challenges progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 11.3. Considerable—and widening—disparities in BUP are observed across provinces and countries. In 2020, the BUP in some high-income countries was thirty times greater than in low-income countries, while the latter exhibited higher BUP growth rates—likely due to their smaller initial base. However, they could still be considered inefficient in land use if assessed solely based on growth rate metrics. The study highlights the importance of reliability, completeness, and equity in global assessments and in building global criteria.

 Eruptions at continental basaltic volcanoes can take and combine various forms, including lava lakes, lava flows and fountaining, explosions or structural collapses. Aside from a few well-instrumented cases worldwide, accurately reconstructing eruptive scenarios is hampered by the lack of detailed visual observations. However, volcanoes also have their own acoustic signatures composed of low-pitched inaudible sounds, called infrasounds. Here we analyze infrasound records close to Nyiragongo volcano (D.R. Congo) ( <20 km) up to Kenya ( ~800 km), which are converted using acoustic numerical modeling into time-lapse observations of the catastrophic drainage of the world’s largest lava lake on 22 May 2021. The emitted infrasounds also enable tracking of fissure openings and lava eruptions along the flank, occurring simultaneously with the lava lake drainage. This striking example supports the growing role of infrasound as a key component of volcano monitoring and early-warning systems, as it provides unique information inaccessible to other ground-based instruments.

 Buried lakes are widely distributed on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) after summer. Some of these lakes may drain over winter, thereby delivering meltwater into the ice sheet and potentially influencing ice flow dynamics. However, to date, only a limited number of buried lake drainages (BLDs) have been identified and their spatiotemporal dynamics across the GrIS remain unclear. Here we detect pan-GrIS wintertime BLDs by integrating Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite imagery and ArcticDEM data. We begin by locating potential buried lakes with topographic depressions. Then we identify the depressions with significant wintertime backscatter increases as potential BLDs using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Next, we map the maximum summertime meltwater area using Sentinel-2 imagery and select the potential BLDs with sufficient summertime meltwater as final BLDs. Finally, we categorize these final BLDs into three types (complete BLDs, partial BLDs, and low-confidence BLDs), and we also investigate potential ice velocity anomalies (IVAs) triggered by BLDs using ice velocity data. The results show that: (1) 167 complete and partial BLDs are identified over seven winters from 2017 to 2023 on the GrIS, including 25 cascade drainages; their spatiotemporal distributions vary significantly, with most BLDs detected at the NW, CW, and SW basins in November. (2) Wintertime BLDs potentially trigger 10 significant IVAs (up to 50 %), and may lead to a net increase in annual ice motion. (3) Wintertime IVAs triggered by BLDs are significantly higher than summertime IVAs triggered by supraglacial lake drainages; they propagate downstream along subglacial hydrologic pathways rather than ice flowlines. (4) BLDs can even trigger rerouting of subglacial hydrologic pathways over a short time period. In conclusion, we present a new method of detecting sparse wintertime BLDs over large areas and reveal that BLDs have a more profound effect on ice flow dynamics than previously assumed."

 Odor and volatile organic compound (VOC) pollution were characterized through a 15-month mobile monitoring campaign (January 2024–March 2025) in the Tuoketuo Industrial Park, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, an area experiencing frequent odor complaints. A portable multi-sensor odor analyzer was deployed across ambient routes, Priority Monitoring Zones (PMZs), and 52 Priority Regulated Enterprises (PREs), covering a total distance of 4072 km. The monitoring results indicated that mean odor unit (OU, dimensionless) values were higher in PMZs at night (10.2) than during the day (8.3) and on ambient routes (7.08). Seasonal peaks occurred in summer (July–August) and winter (December), corresponding to periods of low wind speeds and temperature inversions. Spatial analysis identified recurrent odor hotspots along J Avenue (night-time anomaly probability 65 %) and at the H Street–F Road intersection (48 %). Ammonia (NH3; peak 10 mg m−3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S; peak 7.85 mg m−3), and trimethylamine (TMA) were the dominant odorants, associated mainly with biopharmaceutical, coal-chemical, corn-processing and wastewater treatment activities. Although total VOC (TVOC) concentrations were low (0.11–0.15 mg m−3), odor activity values (OAVs) highlighted TMA and methanethiol (MM) as key contributors to perceived odor impact. These findings support targeted night-time enforcement in high-risk corridors and optimization of waste-gas treatment, and motivate the adoption of OAV-based odor management beyond mass-based TVOC metrics."

Lee,Extreme precipitation scaling under synoptic air mass regimes,"•GWTC-2 air masses (AMs) modulate extreme precipitation scaling by region and season. •The bin-shifting effect in Tropical stations is stronger in humid AMs than dry AMs. •Negative scaling rates dominate Mediterranean stations across most AMs. •Semi-arid stations are highly sensitive to warming, with super-CC driven by dynamics. •Dynamic amplification of extremes is most common during Warm Front passages. 
 Observed sensitivity of extreme precipitation to surface temperature (apparent scaling) often deviates markedly from the Clausius Clapeyron (CC) relation, and so cannot be used to reliably infer future changes in extreme precipitation under climate change (climate scaling). These deviations from the CC relation results from the superimposition of thermodynamic influences with those of diverse synoptic weather regimes when using the binning method. To disentangle these influences, this study stratifies by synoptic regime prior to scaling analysis. This novel approach employs the Gridded Weather Typing Classification version 2 (GWTC-2), a multivariate scheme that categorizes daily weather conditions into 11 distinct air masses. It is found that scaling precipitation against temperature produces rates that are skewed by the bin-shifting effect and moisture limitations at higher temperatures, especially in tropical regions. While scaling with dew point temperature corrects those limitations, it might overestimate the true response of precipitation to warming, as it more directly reflects moisture availability. Importantly, scaling rates behave differently under different synoptic air masses, which together potentially offers a more realistic range of scaling behaviors against which future extreme precipitation changes may be compared. Within GWTC-2-stratified scaling, we show that most sub-CC and super-CC scaling involve dynamical suppression or amplification of precipitation extremes, respectively. Also, warm front passages are the main synoptic conduit through which the dynamic contribution modulate extreme precipitation. Future work should evaluate climate scaling across diverse climate models and scenarios to determine whether GWTC-2–stratified scaling offers a reliable reference range for projecting extreme precipitation."
