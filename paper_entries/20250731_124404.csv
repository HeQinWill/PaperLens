10.1088/1748-9326/adeba2,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注北极阿拉斯加地区海狸池塘的分布及其受气候变化影响的预测。它探讨了影响海狸池塘分布的关键因素（如温度、与水源的距离和地形），并预测了在未来气候情景下海狸池塘分布的潜在扩张。虽然该研究提到了气候变化的影响，但其重点在于生态系统工程和生物地理学，而非大气环境遥感技术。因此，它与空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等领域没有直接关联。,[],Ken D Tape;James D M Speed,"Predicted expansion of beaver pond distribution in Arctic Alaska, 1910–2090","Ecosystem engineering by beavers is a nascent disturbance in the Arctic tundra, appearing in the 1970s in western Alaska and since expanding deeper into tundra regions. Evidence from modeling and observations indicates that beaver ponds act as biophysical oases, and we anticipate myriad changes as these disturbances are constructed along tundra streams, sloughs, and lake outlets. We used over 11 000 mapped beaver pond locations in Arctic Alaska and their climatic, geographic, and environmental attributes to understand (1) which of those attributes control the distribution of beaver ponds, and, if temperature is a factor, (2) how beaver pond distribution will change under future climate scenarios. Of the variables used in the ensemble modeling approach, mean annual temperature was the most important variable in determining beaver pond locations, with pond occurrences more likely in warmer locales (>−2 °C). The distance to water was also important in determining beaver pond locations, as expected, with higher likelihood of ponds closer to water features. Lowland topographic variables were also relevant in determining the distribution of beaver ponds. Under the current climate, beaver ponds are widespread in most of western Alaska, matching the predicted extent of potential occupancy, with the exception of areas furthest from treeline, implying possible dispersal lags or other factors. By 2050, under future climate scenarios (RCP8.5; 2090 for RCP6.0), the entire North Slope of Alaska, which currently has no beaver ponds, is predicted to be suitable for beaver ponds, comparable to western Alaska in 2016. The vast extent of future beaver engineering in tundra regions will require reenvisioning the typical tundra stream ecosystems of northern Alaska, northern Canada, northern Europe, and northern Asia to include more extensive wetlands, routine disturbances, permafrost thaw, and other features of these nascent oases that are not fully understood."
10.1088/1748-9326/adf128,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化对低收入和中等收入国家妇女膳食多样性的影响。虽然气候变化与大气环境之间存在联系，但该研究并未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。该研究主要使用贝叶斯分层统计模型分析了气候变化对妇女膳食多样性的影响，并探讨了其他因素（如家庭财富、妇女受教育程度等）与膳食多样性的关系。,[],B Carducci;R Benedict;J Corrigan;B Mayala;S Namaste;F Bilotto;P Cao;M Herrero;Z Guo;J Fanzo,Exploring women’s dietary diversity amidst climate variability: a comparative analysis across eight low- and middle- income countries,"It is anticipated that climate change and climate variability will threaten food and nutrition security through multiple pathways, yet evidence on its impact on minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W), especially in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) is limited. Using Bayesian hierarchical statistical modeling, we analyzed the impacts of climate variability on MDD-W, of 142 484 non-pregnant women, aged 15–49 years, in eight LMICs (Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal and Tanzania). All analyses were adjusted for survey weights and sampling design and analyzed separately. The proportion of women achieving MDD-W the previous day of the survey ranged between 20.8% and 57.3%. In the full model, enabling variables including climate change and variability generally showed significant negative associations with MDD-W (precipitation and land surface temperature anomalies, daytime and nighttime long-term land surface temperature variability), whereby the adjusted odds of women’s dietary diversity was reduced by 9%–37% due to climatic variables. Underlying variables such as growing season, nutrient yield and enhanced vegetation index had limited associations across countries. In fact, for nutrient yields, the direction of association differed by country and nutrients. Immediate variables were significantly positively associated with MDD-W in almost all countries with an adjusted odds of women’s dietary diversity increasing by 6%–92%, including household wealth (n = 8), women’s media access (n = 8), women’s education (n = 7), improved sanitation and women’s employment (n = 5) and women’s landownership (n = 3). The month of the survey was associated with MDD-W in four countries, but the direction of association varied by country. These findings suggest that safeguarding women’s diet diversity from climate change requires adaptation efforts that target vulnerable populations to ensure nutrition."

A broad portfolio of options is necessary to enable sufficient potential and mitigate sustainability concerns. So far, integrated assessment models have almost exclusively considered options on land. In this study, we show that ocean liming can make a substantial contribution to achieving ambitious climate mitigation targets. Due to the expected time needed for scale-up, the deployment potential in the first half of the century is limited, such that ocean liming can hardly reduce peak temperature. However, in the second half of the century, substantial deployment may be economically competitive. In addition, the availability of ocean liming reduces the dependence on other carbon removal options, and specifically on bioenergy. This could reduce the pressure on land and improve the sustainability of ambitious climate mitigation scenarios. However, impacts on the ocean ecosystems are still poorly understood and need to be clarified before deployment. In light of the remaining uncertainties and global and regional limitations, we suggest to limit the maximum global deployment of ocean liming in integrated assessment models to 5 GtCO2/yr carbon uptake."

Yet, whether the sudden profusion of precipitation or the presence of flooding has a net positive or negative impact on agricultural production, particularly agricultural pests, is understudied. Using a difference-in-difference approach applied to field-level pesticides from ∼13 000 field/y observations in Kern County, CA, we evaluate how precipitation whiplash impacted agricultural pest control. We show the wet year had an anticipated bump in pesticides targeting molds and weeds and an unanticipated decrease in insecticides. Yet, there was little effect of on-field standing water on pesticide use. County-wide crop statistics, available for a subset of crops, were also similar across years, with similar area harvested, yields and total value in the historically wet versus the prior dry year. Despite the historic nature of the drought and proceeding rainfall events, farmers, on average, appeared to adapt to precipitation whiplash successfully. Given the increasing prevalence of precipitation whiplash as well as policy efforts to increase groundwater recharge through on-field flooding in wet years, such null effects suggest the benefits to harnessing extreme precipitation do not imply major costs for pest control."

However, how these interactions affect trees in urban parks is poorly understood. Using multi-source satellite fusion, we observe that New York City parks are experiencing delays in the start of the growing season, especially in medium-sized parks. Notably, warming effects are more pronounced in park trees near the edges, where urban heat is stronger. This delay is explained by a physiological mechanism: warmer winters reduce chilling accumulation and increase the heat requirements for leaf development, disrupting the balance between chilling and heat needed for spring leaf-out. Medium-sized parks are especially vulnerable to urban heat due to their structural characteristics such as higher edge-to-area ratios and limited interior buffer zones, both of which amplify edge effects. These findings demonstrate that climate change, compounded by the UHI effect, is altering tree phenology in urban parks, with implications for urban ecosystem adaptation and management."

However, emerging observational evidences reveal a notable alteration in the O3-temperature relationship under extremely heat conditions (referred to as O3 suppression) in 20%–30% cities of China, yet the underlying mechanisms and driving forces remain unclear. This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the meteorological mechanisms driving high-temperature O3 suppression in Eastern China, with particular emphasis on regional disparities between suppression and non-suppression areas. Our analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns of O3 suppression across major Chinese regions. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions exhibit significant O3 suppression, with the O3-temperature relationship decreasing by 3–5 μg m−3 °C−1 at high temperatures. In contrast, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region rarely illustrates this phenomenon. Through integrated statistical analysis and machine learning approaches, we identified radiation, relative humidity (RH), and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) as the key meteorological drivers. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that RH was the dominant factor accounting for regional differences in O3 suppression, primarily owing to the contrasting effects of dry heat (BTH) and wet heat (YRD and PRD). PBLH emerged as a secondary influential factor that modulates O3 concentration through the competitive effects of diffusion and transport processes. Cluster analysis further revealed that the occurrence frequency of inhibitory meteorological conditions (high RH and low PBLH) during high-temperature days in the YRD and PRD regions (25%–35%) significantly exceeded that in the BTH region (2%). This study provides crucial insights into the regional disparities in meteorological mechanisms underlying high-temperature O3 suppression and offers valuable scientific support for region-specific O3 pollution control strategies in the context of climate warming and increasingly frequent heatwaves."

We investigated how different aerosols, such as sulfates, nitrates, and pollutants, influence the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and its surroundings. The results show that these particles can alter temperature patterns, especially during the Asian summer monsoon. This research improves our understanding of how human activities may affect regional climate. 
 This study aims to investigate the direct shortwave (SW) radiative forcing (RF) and heating rates of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) using in situ observations from the Balloon measurement campaigns of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (BATAL) conducted between 2014 and 2018. Measurements were obtained over three distinct locations in India: Gadanki (13.48° N, 79.18° E), Hyderabad (17.47° N, 78.58° E), and Varanasi (25.27° N, 82.99° E). Given the ambiguity in the chemical composition of ATAL from several reported studies, seven different aerosol mixtures – comprising sulfate (SUL), nitrate (NIT), organic carbon (OC), and ammonium (AM) – were considered to assess their impact on estimates of ATAL radiative forcing and heating rates. A pronounced enhancement in aerosol backscatter was observed at ATAL altitudes (13 to 19 km) across all locations, with the backscatter ratio (BSR; at 455 nm) peaking at 1.07 over Varanasi and Hyderabad, followed by 1.06 over Gadanki. Radiative forcing estimates indicate a net warming effect, with ATAL contributing up to 3 % of the total columnar atmospheric forcing. Heating rates reveal a marked increase in aerosol-induced warming at ATAL altitudes, with maximum heating rates reaching 0.03 K d−1 across the study locations. The radiative impact of ATAL aerosols is highly sensitive to variations in the aerosol composition. Compared to a reference case with a stratospheric sulfate background, the ATAL radiative forcing varies between 0.03 and 0.28 W m−2 (1.5- to 14-fold increase). At the same time, heating rates exhibit a 30-fold increase, reaching 0.03 K d−1, depending on the aerosol mixture. Despite these strong localized effects within the UTLS, the overall contribution to total columnar aerosol forcing remains moderate (up to 5 %), underscoring the importance of aerosol composition in determining ATAL's radiative influence."

The increased amount of ozone enhances ozone radiative forcing. The ozone enhancement and associated radiative forcing are the highest over South and East Asia. The emissions of nitrous oxides show a higher influence on shifting ozone photochemical regimes than volatile organic compounds. 
 Ozone in the troposphere is a prominent pollutant whose production is sensitive to the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we assess the variation of tropospheric ozone levels, trends, ozone photochemical regimes and radiative effects using the ECHAM6–HAMMOZ chemistry–climate model for the period 1998–2019 and satellite measurements. The global mean simulated trend in tropospheric column ozone (TRCO) for the study period (1998–2019) is 0.89 ppb decade−1. During the overlapping period with Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) observations (2005–2019), the simulated global mean TRCO trends (1.58 ppb decade−1) show fair agreement with OMI/MLS estimates (1.4 ppb decade−1). The simulations for doubling emissions of NOx (DoubNOx), VOCs (DoubVOC), and halving emissions of NOx (HalfNOx) and VOCs (HalfVOC) show nonlinear responses to ozone trends and tropospheric ozone photochemical regimes. The DoubNOx simulations show VOC-limited regimes over the Indo-Gangetic Plain, eastern China, western Europe and the eastern US, while HalfNOx simulations show NOx-limited regimes over North America and Asia. Emissions changes in NOx (DoubNOx/HalfNOx) influence the shift in tropospheric ozone photochemical regimes compared to VOCs (DoubVOC/HalfVOC).The estimated global mean TO3RE during 1998–2019 from the control (CTL) simulations is 1.21 W m−2. The global mean TO3RE shows enhancement by 0.36 W m−2 in DoubNOx simulations compared to CTL. While TO3RE shows a reduction in other simulations compared to CTL (DoubVOC: −0.005 W m−2, HalfNOx: −0.12 W m−2 and HalfVOC: −0.03 W m−2). We show that emission changes in anthropogenic NOx cause more significant changes in TO3RE than anthropogenic VOCs."

During warm periods, the model overestimated concentrations of OH and HO2, leading to overestimation of ozone and nitric acid production. Our findings highlight the need to better understand how OH and HO2 are formed and removed, which is important for accurate air quality and climate predictions. 
 HOx radicals (OH and HO2) are crucial oxidants that determine atmospheric oxidation capacity and the production of secondary pollutants; however, their sources and sinks remain incompletely understood in certain rural, forest, and maritime environments. This study measured HO2∗ (HO2 + contribution from RO2, organic peroxyl radicals) and OH concentrations using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer at a subtropical rural site in southern China from 12 November to 19 December 2022. The average peak concentrations were 3.50 ± 2.47 × 106 cm−3 for OH and 1.34 ± 0.93 × 108 cm−3 for HO2∗. Model-estimated contribution from RO2 to HO2 during the measurement period ranged from 44 % to 69 % of  HO2∗. Calculations based on an observation-constrained chemical model revealed an overestimation of HO2 and OH concentrations during warm periods of the field study. Sensitivity tests suggest that adding HOx sinks or an HO2 recycle process to the model could improve the model performance. Over-simulation of HOx in the model resulted in overestimations of midday (10:00–15:00 UTC) production rates by more than 79 % for ozone and a factor of 1.88 for nitric acid. Our study highlights the need for further improving understanding of the sources and sinks of OH and HO2 and representation of them in air quality models."

This research demonstrates that viscous organic aerosol coatings significantly hinder PAH oxidation, with spatial distributions sensitive to the degradation modeling approach. Our findings emphasize the need for accurate modeling of PAH oxidation processes in risk assessments, considering both fresh and oxidized PAHs in evaluating human health risks. 
 We used the CAM5 model to examine how different particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation approaches affect the spatial distribution of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Three approaches were evaluated: NOA (no effect of OA coatings state on BaP), shielded (viscous OA coatings shield BaP from oxidation under cool and dry conditions) and ROI-T (viscous OA coatings slow BaP oxidation in response to temperature and humidity). Results show that BaP concentrations vary seasonally, influenced by emissions, deposition, transport and degradation approach, all of which are influenced by meteorological conditions. All simulations predict higher population-weighted global average (PWGA) fresh BaP concentrations during December–January–February (DJF) compared to June–July–August (JJA), due to increased emissions from household activities and reduced removal processes during colder months. The shielded and ROI-T approaches, which account for OA coatings, result in 2–6 times higher BaP concentrations in DJF compared to NOA. The shielded simulation predicts the highest PWGA fresh BaP concentration (1.3 ng m−3), with 90 % of BaP protected from oxidation. In contrast, the ROI-T approach forecasts lower concentrations in middle to low latitudes, as it assumes less effective OA coatings under warmer, more humid conditions. Evaluations against observed BaP concentrations show the shielded approach performs best, with a normalized mean bias (NMB) within ± 20 %. The combined incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for both fresh and oxidized PAHs is similar across simulations, emphasizing the importance of considering both forms in health risk assessments. This study highlights the critical role of accurate degradation approaches in PAH modeling."

 Atmospheric black carbon can act as a short-lived climate forcer and carrier of toxic compounds. This work aims to utilize aerosol compositions detected by a soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer to advance our understanding of the emission and atmospheric processing of refractory BC (rBC) in Singapore. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of rBC and organic aerosols (OAs) (PMFbase) identified two traffic factors with differences in rBC content, coating thickness, and diurnal pattern, which could potentially help differentiate gasoline and diesel vehicular emissions. Additionally, two secondary OA (SOA) factors influenced by local chemistry and/or regional transport (less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA) and more-oxidized OA (MO-OOA)) were identified. Including metals in the PMF (PMFmetal) improved the quality of source apportionment significantly. An industrial- and shipping-influenced OA separated from traffic emissions was strongly associated with heavy metals (e.g., V+ and Ni+) that might pose higher potential risks to human health. Two biomass burning OA (BBOA) factors with different degrees of oxygenation were also identified. Although the aged BBOA component was highly oxidized, its strong association with K3SO4- distinguished it from other background MO-OOAs, which generally lacked distinctive OA signatures. Integration of both metals and inorganic aerosols (IAs) into the PMF (PMFall) further identified an additional aged BBOA component that was associated with nighttime IAs and organo-nitrate formation. Furthermore, PMFall revealed concurrent LO-OOA and nitrate formation during daytime, whereas photochemical production of MO-OOAs was linked to acidic sulfate formation, indicating the importance of investigating the interaction between SOA and IA formation and their mixing state in complex city environments."

Murray,Iron isotopes suggest significant aerosol dissolution over the Pacific Ocean,"This paper presents the chemical and iron isotopic composition of aerosols (> 1 µm) over the equatorial and tropical Pacific Ocean in previously undocumented areas. Analysis of our data suggests that a significant proportion of aerosol iron (∼ 13 %) is not only dissolved but also removed during atmospheric transport. Such removal had not previously been evidenced to our knowledge. This highlights the unique and strong constraints brought by iron isotopes on atmospheric process studies. 
 This study presents aerosol iron isotopic compositions (δ56Fe) in the western and central equatorial and tropical Pacific Ocean. Aerosols supply iron (Fe), a critical element for marine primary production, to the open ocean. Particulate aerosols, > 1 µm, were sampled during the EUCFe (Equatorial Undercurrent Fe) cruise (RV Kilo Moana, PI: James W. Murray, 2006). One aerosol sample was isotopically lighter than the crust (δ56Fe = −0.16 ± 0.07 ‰, 95 % confidence interval), possibly originating from combustion processes. The nine other aerosol samples were isotopically heavier than the crust, with a rather homogeneous signature of +0.31 ± 0.21 ‰ (2 SD, n= 9). Given (i) this homogeneity compared to the diversity of their modeled geographic origin and (ii) the values of the Fe/Ti ratios used as a lithogenic tracer, we suggest that these heavy δ56Fe signatures reflect isotopic fractionation of crustal aerosols caused by atmospheric processes. Using a fractionation factor of Δsolution-particle= −1.8 ‰, a partial dissolution of ≈ 13 % of the initial aerosol iron content, followed by the removal of this dissolved fraction, would explain the observed slightly heavy Fe isotope signatures. Such fractionation has been observed previously in laboratory experiments but never before in a natural environment.

A reference table is provided for attributing the PTR signal to contributing VOC species. The signals are grouped according to the complexity of their potential identities. We find that a number of signal ions such as C6H7+ for benzene and C5H9+ for isoprene merely give an upper limit of their corresponding concentrations. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important atmospheric components that contribute to air pollution, but their accurate quantification by proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) remains challenging. In this work, we coupled a gas chromatograph (GC) prior to PTR-MS and analyzed complex ambient air in urban Shanghai to speciate the PTR signal to identify the VOC species that were responsible for the generation of the ions detected by PTR. We classified 176 individual PTR signals with associated compounds resolved by the GC based on whether they could be used to quantify a VOC species without pre-separation. In this classification, Category I includes 45 decent signal ions that were produced from a single VOC species and thus can be used for reliable quantification, although some of the Category I ions are not the conventionally used protonated quasi-molecular ions (MH+). Category II includes 39 signal ions that were produced from a group of isomers and can be used to quantify the isomeric sum, but with an increased uncertainty if a single calibration factor for one specific isomer is used to represent all structures. Category III includes 92 signal ions that were generated from more than one non-isomeric species (e.g., through protonation, fragmentation, cluster formation) and thus merely gave an upper limit of VOC concentrations. In addition, we propose taking aromatic compounds, for instance, the quantification of selected VOCs, utilizing either non-MH+ or non-Category I ions. Our results help to achieve more comprehensive species identification and reliable VOC quantification in PTR measurements."

 The air–sea CO2 flux in the coastal ocean is a critical component of the global carbon budget, yet it remains poorly understood due to limited data, the many sources and sinks of carbon, and their complex interactions. In August–November 2021, the Tara schooner collected over 14 000 km of CO2 fugacity (fCO2) measurements along the coast of South America, including in the Amazon River–ocean continuum (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13790064, Olivier et al., 2024a). The Amazon River and its oceanic plume exhibit complex interactions under the combined influence of many processes such as tides and bathymetry. Observations revealed a wide range of fCO2 values, from up to 3000 µatm in the river to a minimum of 42 µatm downstream of the plume, where values were notably lower than atmospheric levels. South of the estuary, the fCO2 of the North Brazil Current waters (0–9° S) exceeds 400 µatm, while along the Brazil Current (10–30° S), fCO2 is around 400 µatm and decreases with temperature and distance from the Equator. Due to its high variability in the coastal environment, in the dataset salinity emerged as the primary driver of fCO2 variability across this dynamic region. Despite strong variability, comparison with discrete samples of other carbonate parameters showed a mean difference of 2 µatm, within the range of uncertainties of the chemical formulas used for comparison. This dataset provides critical insights into the under-sampled region of the Brazilian coast, improving our understanding of coastal fCO2 dynamics and their role in the global carbon budget."

Around 70 TB point clouds have been processed to ready-to-use raster layers at 10 m resolution (~ 59 GB), enabling a wide use and uptake of ecosystem structure information in biodiversity and habitat monitoring and ecosystem and carbon dynamic modelling. 
 Recent years have seen a rapid surge in the use of light detection and ranging (lidar) technology for characterizing the structure of ecosystems. Even though repeated airborne laser scanning (ALS) surveys are becoming increasingly available across several European countries, so far, only a few studies have derived data products of ecosystem structure at a national scale, possibly due to a lack of free and open-source tools and the computational challenges involved in handling the large volumes of data. Nevertheless, high-resolution data products of ecosystem structure generated from multi-temporal country-wide ALS datasets are urgently needed if we are to integrate such information into biodiversity and ecosystem science. By employing a recently developed, open-source, high-throughput workflow (named “Laserfarm”), we processed around 70 TB of raw point clouds collected from four national ALS surveys of the Netherlands (AHN1–AHN4, 1996–2022). This resulted in ∼59 GB raster layers in GeoTIFF format constituting ready-to-use multi-temporal data products of ecosystem structure at a national scale. For each AHN (Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland) dataset, we generated 25 lidar-derived vegetation metrics at 10 m spatial resolution, representing vegetation height, vegetation cover, and vegetation structural variability, together with auxiliary data (∼12 GB) such as raster layers of point density; pulse density; flight line timestamp information; terrain and surface elevation; and masks of water areas, roads, buildings, power lines, and NA values (areas with no points available). The data enable an in-depth understanding of ecosystem structure at a fine resolution across the Netherlands and provide opportunities for exploring ecosystem structural dynamics over time. To illustrate the utility of these data products, we present ecological use cases that monitor forest structural change and analyse vegetation structure differences across various Natura 2000 habitat types, including dunes, marshes, grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands.

 Lead (Pb) and its isotopes are powerful tools for studying the pathways of Pb pollution from land to sea and, simultaneously, investigating biogeochemical processes in the ocean. However, the scarcity and sparsity of in situ measurements of Pb concentrations and isotope compositions do not allow for a comprehensive understanding of Pb pollution pathways and biogeochemical cycling on a global scale. Here, we present three machine learning models developed to map seawater Pb concentrations and isotope compositions, leveraging the global GEOTRACES dataset as well as historical data. The models use climatologies of oceanographic and atmospheric variables as features from which to predict Pb concentrations, 206Pb/207Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we found that seawater temperature, atmospheric dust, atmospheric black carbon, and salinity are the most important features for predicting Pb concentrations. Dissolved oxygen concentration, salinity, temperature, and atmospheric dust are the most important features for predicting 206Pb/207Pb, atmospheric black carbon and dust, seawater temperature, and surface chlorophyll a for 208Pb/207Pb.

The global burned area is predicted at 3.46 × 106–4.58 × 106 km² per year, showing a decline from 1901 to 1978, an increase from 1978 to 2008 and a sharper decrease from 2008 to 2020. This dataset provides a benchmark for studies on fire ecology and the carbon cycle. 
 Fire is a key Earth system process, driving variability in the global carbon cycle through CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and subsequent CO2 uptake through vegetation recovery after fires. Global spatiotemporally consistent datasets on burned area have been available since the beginning of the satellite era in the 1980s, but they are sparse prior to that date. In this study, we reconstructed global monthly burned area at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° from 1901 to 2020 using machine learning models trained on satellite-based observations of  burned area between 2003 and 2020, with the goal of reconstructing long-term burned area information to constrain historical fire simulations. We first conducted a classification model to separate grid cells with extreme (burned area ≥ the 90th percentile in a given region) or regular fires. We then trained separate regression models for grid cells with extreme or regular fires. Both the classification and regression models were trained on a satellite-based burned area product (FireCCI51), using explanatory variables related to climate, vegetation and human activities. The trained models can well reproduce the long-term spatial patterns (slopes = 0.70–1.28 and R2 = 0.69–0.98 spatially), inter-annual variability and seasonality of the satellite-based burned area observations. After applying the trained model to the historical period, the predicted annual global total burned area ranges from 3.46×106 to 4.58×106 km2 yr−1 over 1901–2020 with regular and extreme fires accounting for 1.36×106–1.74×106 and 2.00×106–3.03×106 km2 yr−1, respectively. Our models estimate a global decrease in burned area during 1901–1978 (slope = -0.009×106 km2 yr−2), followed by an increase during 1978–2008 (slope = 0.020×106 km2 yr−2), and then a stronger decline in 2008–2020 (slope = -0.049×106 km2 yr−2). Africa was the continent with the largest burned area globally during 1901–2020, and its trends also dominated the global trends. We validated our predictions against charcoal records, and our product exhibits a high overall accuracy in simulating fire occurrence (>80 %) in boreal North America, southern Europe, South America, Africa and southeast Australia, but the overall accuracy is relatively lower in northern Europe and Asia (<50 %). In addition, we compared our burned area data with multiple independent regional burned area maps in Canada, the USA, Brazil, Chile and Europe, and found general consistency in the spatial patterns (linear regression slopes ranging 0.84–1.38 spatially) and the inter-annual variability.

 We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced-order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on 3 months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in terms of computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts and forecasts chemical patterns for leading chemical indicators, including nitric oxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, hydroxyl radical, isoprene, and carbon monoxide. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics."

Dynamic vegetation models with mechanistic plant hydraulic architecture are needed to model these developments. We evaluate the plant hydraulic architecture version of LPJ-GUESS and show its ability to capture species-specific evapotranspiration responses to drought and to reproduce flux observations of both gross primary production and evapotranspiration. 
 Due to climate change, severe-drought events have become increasingly commonplace across Europe in recent decades, with future projections indicating that this trend will likely continue, posing questions about the continued viability of European forests. Observations from the most recent pan-European droughts suggest that these types of “hotter droughts” may acutely alter the carbon balance of European forest ecosystems. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the possible future impacts of severe drought on the European forest carbon sink. Dynamic vegetation models can help to shed light on such uncertainties; however, the inclusion of dedicated plant hydraulic architecture modules in these has only recently become more widespread. Such developments intended to improve model performance also tend to add substantial complexity, yet the sensitivity of the models to newly introduced processes is often left undetermined. Here, we describe and evaluate the recently developed mechanistic plant hydraulic architecture version of LPJ-GUESS and provide a parameterization for 12 common European forest tree species. We quantify the uncertainty introduced by the new processes using a variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we evaluate the model against water and carbon fluxes from a network of eddy covariance flux sites across Europe. Our results indicate that the new model is able to capture drought-induced patterns of evapotranspiration along an isohydric gradient and manages to reproduce flux observations during drought better than standard LPJ-GUESS does. Further, the sensitivity analysis suggests that hydraulic process related to hydraulic failure and stomatal regulation play the largest roles in shaping the model response to drought."

They include tide- and wind-driven sea surface current components, resolving the slowly varying part of the flow, and a stochastic signal, representing the fast-varying small-scale dynamics. The comparison with high-frequency radar observations shows that the non-Gaussian stochastic model captures key dynamics and mimics the observed fat-tailed probability distribution. 
 In the Gulf of Trieste, the sea surface currents were observed by high-frequency radar for almost 2 years (2021–2022) at a temporal resolution of 30 min. We developed a hierarchy of idealized models to simulate the observed sea surface currents, combining a deterministic and a stochastic approach, in order to reproduce the externally forced motion and the internal variability, which is characterized by fat-tailed statistics. The deterministic signal includes tidal and Ekman forcing and resolves the slowly varying part of the flow, while the stochastic signal represents the fast-varying small-scale dynamics, characterized by Gaussian or fat-tailed statistics, depending on the statistic used. This is done using Langevin equations and modified Langevin equations with a  gamma-distributed variance parameter. The models were adapted to resolve the dynamics under nine tidal and wind forcing protocols in order to best fit the observed forced motion and internal variability probability density function (PDF). The stochastic signal requires 2 stochastic degrees of freedom when the average tidal forcing is adopted, while it needs 1/2 stochastic degree of freedom when the complete tidal forcing is used. Despite its idealization, the deterministic–stochastic model with stochastic fat-tailed statistics captures the essential dynamics and permits mimicking the observed PDF. Moreover, a fluctuation response relation is valid when the stochastic signal is perturbed, showing that the response to an external perturbation can be obtained by considering the fluctuations of the unperturbed system."

Our new version, pyVPRM, supports diverse satellite products like Sentinel-2, MODIS, VIIRS, and new land cover maps, enabling high spatial and temporal resolution. This improves flux estimates, especially in complex landscapes, and ensures continuity as MODIS nears decommissioning. 
 The Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) is a well-established tool for estimating carbon exchange fluxes between the atmosphere and the biosphere. The gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (Reco) of the ecosystem are modeled separately at high spatial and temporal resolution using the satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface water index (LSWI), as well as meteorological variables for solar irradiance and surface temperature. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is calculated as the difference between the gross flux GPP and respiration. VPRM is widely used as a biospheric flux model in atmospheric transport modeling, most often on scales ranging from city to continent, but also in studies of biospheric carbon budgets and their changes with climate extremes. Historically, satellite-based surface reflectances from the 500 m resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been used to determine the EVI and LSWI. However, MODIS is reaching the end of its lifetime and will soon be decommissioned. Therefore, we present an updated version of VPRM, pyVPRM, which provides a software framework with a modular structure that can be used with various satellite products, land cover maps, meteorological data sources, and VPRM model parameterizations. Our tool naturally provides an interface to use satellite data from Sentinel-2, MODIS, and VIIRS, as well as global high-resolution land cover classification maps from the Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover Collection 3 and ESA WorldCover at 100 and 10 m resolution, respectively. Neither product is static; hence, dynamic changes of the land cover from year to year can be represented. Using Sentinel-2, ecosystem fluxes can be calculated at a resolution of up to 20 m, providing more accurate flux estimates in heterogeneous landscapes like croplands and making it possible to resolve small-scale vegetation patches common in urban areas. In contrast, VIIRS data are at the same resolution as MODIS and thus can provide continuity once MODIS is discontinued, requiring only minor adjustments to the VPRM data preprocessing. In addition, pyVPRM improves the data handling, for example, for snow-covered scenes. This paper presents the pyVPRM framework, discusses changes and improvements compared to previous VPRM implementations, and provides VPRM parameters for the European domain based on indices calculated from MODIS, Sentinel-2, and VIIRS using a new selection of eddy-covariance observations from 97 flux tower sites. Using pyVPRM and the new parameters, we observe significant improvements in the estimation of the European carbon budget. The results conform well with those from inversion studies."

However, the accumulation and aging of microplastics (MPs) in soils pose emerging challenges to SAG stability and nutrient dynamics, particularly in salt-affected soils. This study provides a novel investigation into the relationship between MP characteristics and SAG dynamics, with a specific focus on salt-affected soils in northeastern China. Our findings demonstrate that high MP abundance significantly disrupts SAG structure, reducing the proportion of large aggregates (p = 0.032) and increasing microaggregates (<0.25 mm), with microaggregates serving as hotspots for MP accumulation (p < 0.05). MP type and size emerged as dominant factors of SAG structural instability, leading to pronounced imbalances in aggregate-associated nutrients (AANs) across aggregate fractions. The inherent characteristics of salt-affected soils─such as elevated salinity, alkalinity, and low organic matter─further amplified these destabilizing effects. This study elucidates the complex interplay between MPs and soil properties, demonstrating their contribution to the deterioration of soil structure and the reduced availability of SAG and AAN.

However, the unique release dynamics of their loaded chemicals raise concerns about potential adverse effects on nontarget organisms. To address this, we compared the toxicity of bentonite and sepiolite nanocarriers loaded with the anesthetic/antibacterial chemical eugenol to the toxicity of pure eugenol. Daphnia magna was exposed to loaded nanocarriers, pure eugenol, and bare nanocarriers. In acute immobilization tests, a 50% effect concentration (EC50) of 0.14 ± 0.01 mg eugenol L–1 was derived for pure eugenol. Loading eugenol onto bentonite and sepiolite nanocarriers mitigated this acute toxicity, as indicated by respective EC50 values of 0.48 ± 0.02 and 0.57 ± 0.07 mg eugenol L–1. In 12-day toxicity tests, similar concentrations of eugenol were released from both nanocarriers. For the first day of exposure, this temporarily reduced the swimming speed of the daphnids. Moreover, in contrast to sepiolite nanocarriers, bentonite nanocarriers induced marked decreases in population growth. This reveals that nanocarriers exert particle-specific adverse effects on daphnid populations that cannot be predicted based on the toxicity of their individual constituents. We therefore plead to assess nontarget effects of the complete nanocarrier system, including the carrier and its loading, before allowing these products on the market."

However, concrete guidance is currently missing on how to integrate environmental learning curves into prospective life cycle assessments. Here, we propose a method to combine (i) process-specific environmental learning curves for key technology parameters and (ii) projections from integrated assessment models to include relevant changes in background processes, such as expected decarbonization of the electricity grid. Our method enables process contribution analyses, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and flexibility in the assessment of various impact categories. Application of our proposed method is demonstrated in a case study assessing various environmental footprints of producing monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic panels. We showed that environmental footprints reduce 21–80% between 2020 and 2050 through a synergy of (i) and (ii). Footprint reductions were mostly driven by background changes when decarbonization is extensive, whereas process-specific environmental learning curves become the major driver for footprint reductions when developments in background processes follow a similar trajectory as charted by the past. Our method may also be used in the assessment of emerging technologies by applying process-specific environmental learning curves to mature parts of their supply chain."

Many plastic chemicals also hinder technological solutions toward a safe and sustainable circular economy. Hence, there is broad agreement to address so-called plastic chemicals of concern, including under the Global Plastics Treaty. However, debate on how to identify such chemicals of concern is ongoing, particularly around whether their risk (and by extension, exposure) should be considered. In this perspective, we provide a review of the difficulties associated with understanding human and ecosystem exposure to and risks from plastic chemicals. Based on this, we highlight benefits of applying a hazard-based approach for identifying plastic chemicals of concern in a timely manner, and argue that additional consideration of exposure/risk would result in unjustified and costly delays, complications, and uncertainties, and therefore should not be required. A hazard-based approach to identifying plastic chemicals of concern would enable efficient action toward mitigating the impacts of plastics on human health and the environment, and facilitate a transition to a safe and sustainable plastics economy."

This study uncovers a novel mechanism for radical generation in UV222/chlorine mediated by benzoate (BA), a model compound for benzoate pollutants and moieties of natural organic matter. 10 μM BA significantly enhanced HO• formation and free chlorine decay by 77% and 530% in UV222/chlorine, respectively, but showed less effect on UV254/chlorine. This enhancement was attributable to an excited-state transformation pathway of BA in UV222/chlorine, contributing 64% to BA degradation due to the strong absorption of BA at 222 nm and the high photon energy of UV222. The triplet excited state (3BA*) was a key intermediate from BA photoexcitation, followed by the generation of hydrated electrons (eaq–) via 3BA* photoionization. Both 3BA* and eaq– reacted with free chlorine to form HOCl•– at determined rate constants of 1.33 × 109 M–1 s–1 and 1.50 × 1010 M–1 s–1 at pH 7, respectively, and then HOCl•– rapidly decomposed to HO•.

On coral reefs, rates of coral recruitment and post-recruitment survivorship are naturally low, resulting in a bottleneck to population growth and restoration efforts. Therefore, we investigated the potential that two technologies, specialized settlement modules and the Underwater Zooplankton Enhancement Light Array (UZELA), improve early life success. We hypothesized that greater complexity of specialized settlement modules increases larval settlement rates in tanks and the combination of settlement modules with UZELA increases subsequent recruit survivorship and growth on the reef. We found that complex settlement modules enhanced recruit settlement, survivorship, and growth relative to the lowest complexity module. The addition of UZELA to the settlement modules further doubled survivorship and quadrupled growth. Our experiment demonstrates a proof-of-concept that combining these novel technologies offers promise for reducing the time for corals to complete their most vulnerable phase of life, accelerating the timeline for establishing genetically diverse coral populations, and offering a possible step-function change in coral recruitment success that could help overcome the recruit survivorship bottleneck in coral restoration."

Effective risk assessment is made challenging by the complexity of terrestrial exposure, which is highly variable and event-driven. Unlike in aquatic settings, NTAs experience pesticide exposure through multiple routes, such as overspray, ingestion, or contact. To integrate such multiple exposure routes into a unified framework, this study proposes an extension to the toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic (TKTD) and time-resolved BufferGUTS model that can be applied to a broad range of NTAs without species-specific adaptations. Our model extension draws on principles from mixture toxicity and allows for individual effect contributions and effect kinetics per uptake route, providing further insight into the substance effect dynamics. We tested the model using honeybee (Apis mellifera) data for topical and oral exposures to five insecticides. Among the insecticides tested, only one exhibited different kinetics between topical and oral applications, while three exhibited nonsimilar effects from the two routes. We recommend the integration of such TKTD models into environmental risk assessment practices to combine uptake route effects, model field-relevant exposure scenarios, and identify the most relevant routes for each substance.

Redox-copolymer electrosorbents were developed for the selective recovery of PGM chloroanions from ores processed via flotation and leaching, as well as catalytic converters. An electrosorbent integrating a ferrocene redox moiety and a metal-affinity ligand achieved a separation factor >20 between palladium and platinum. Electrochemically assisted regeneration enhanced the release efficiency by >90% compared to a solely pH-driven ligand deprotonation. Thus, the combination of electrochemical stimulus with pH swings can reduce the overall load of chemical input when compared to a solely chemical regeneration. The redox-copolymer retained 90% of uptake capacity after over 300 cycles and demonstrated improved stability over the redox-homopolymer. Unlike processes that may require pH adjustment or alkaline precipitation, our approach achieves PGM uptake directly from highly acidic (pH ∼1) leachates from both ores and catalytic converters in the presence of excess transition metals and competing inorganic ions in solutions. A technoeconomic analysis demonstrated that Pt recovery becomes economically viable after only nine regeneration cycles, highlighting the cost-efficiency of the process.

Here we report the suppression of biogenic methane (CH4) by wildfire chars, a previously unrecognized, potentially beneficial impact of wildfires on global climate. We hypothesized that char derived from wildfires possess an electron storage capacity (ESC) that can support char-respiring microbes, enabling them to outcompete methanogens. A total of 18 chars from fires that occurred between March and October 2023 were collected from across the U.S. All chars possessed sizable ESC, from 0.54 to 2.85 mmol e–/g in the EH range of −0.36 to +0.81 V. Without char, singly 13C-labeled acetate (13CH312COO–) was converted by a wastewater culture into equimolar 13CH4 and 12CO2. In the presence of an air-oxidized char, 13CO2 was produced at the expense of 13CH4, as anaerobic char respirers outcompeted acetoclastic methanogens. Char electron contents measured before and after acetate degradation showed that, electrons that would otherwise end up in CH4 were deposited into char instead. On average, 28.4 ± 2.2% of the wildfire chars’ ESC was utilized to divert electrons away from CH4. Aeration of microbially utilized chars restored the chars’ capacity to suppress CH4, confirming the redox-reversible nature of ESC. These results improve our understanding of, and ability to assess, the full climate impacts of wildfires and deforestation. This study provides the first significant data set of wildfire char ESC, and the first quantitative demonstration of CH4 suppression by wildfire chars."

Although existing risk assessments have examined the accumulation and toxicity of PTEs, their dynamic interplay with multidimensional drivers has remained inadequately characterized. Here, an innovative heuristic graph convolutional network (GCN) model is introduced by integrating adaptive graph topology with quantified directional feedback optimization to improve ecological risk prediction.

A three-phase heuristic algorithm pruned 85.5% of spurious edges in the topological graph, and GCN adaptively quantified the directional feedback between environmental drivers and ecological risk. Topological networks and feature importance analysis jointly identified pH, base saturation, calcium carbonate, exchangeable bases, and soil organic carbon as pivotal regulators acting alongside geological factors.

Epidemiological studies that assess these effects need daily, fire-specific ground-level PM2.5 data, and missing emission information can lead to underestimates. This paper presents a method to estimate daily fire-specific PM2.5 smoke concentrations in the western United States from 2007 to 2019. Our model uses fire characteristics (e.g., fuel type, fire size, and distance) and updated fire emission inputs in an atmospheric dispersion model to simulate where smoke travels and at what concentration. We then apply a Bayesian time-series model to ground-based EPA monitors to isolate the smoke-specific portion of total PM2.5, accounting for meteorology and season. This approach allows us to assess spatial variation in smoke exposure and investigate the role of fire attributes. For example, Lindon, UT experienced 398 fires with modest average concentrations (∼2 μg m3), while Carson City, NV saw fewer fires (177) but more intense exposures (∼6 μg m3, max 159 μg m3).

The spectroscopic method is benchmarked against accurate mass speciation by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Complex natural mixtures relevant to indoor and outdoor air quality were examined: electronic (e-) cigarette aerosols from nicotine and cannabinoid sources, woodsmoke aerosols, and secondary organic aerosols from limonene ozonolysis. The spectroscopy method measured the UV–vis absorption of quinoidal ions, formed from DNPH hydrazones in alkaline solution, at 530 nm (A530). A significant correlation was established between the two methods across a range of aerosol mass and chemical compositions tested, resulting in a recommended calibration factor (CF) of ∼5.16–5.34 × 10–5 (M cm), where Ccarbonyls (M) = A530 × CF (M cm) × path length–1 (cm–1).

The results show that duct‐assisted Z‐to‐O conversion is highly angle‐dependent. We compare its efficiency with that of O‐to‐Z conversion, and discuss implications for the magnetic zenith effect."

Within this altitude range, the 4.8‐hr tide exhibits amplitudes of approximately 25 m/s, surpassing the semidiurnal tide and being twice as large as the diurnal tide. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a strong 4.8‐hr tide. Notably, two consecutive midnight ionospheric collapses occurred on the night of March 17–18. Our analysis reveals that both the 4.8‐hr tide in the meridional wind and the zonal electric field are crucial to the generation the first collapse, while the former playing a more important role in the formation of the second collapse. The generation of the 4.8‐hr tide and the variability of the zonal electric field are likely associated with the effects of a major geomagnetic storm."

We first assess how well the DYAMOND models reproduce precipitation intensity (Ṗ $\dot{P}$) relative to observations of the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement, as well as cloud water paths (CWP) relative to the ERA5 reanalysis. Both Ṗ $\dot{P}$ and CWP differences vary greatly between the models. We then look at the ratio of these fields in a recently defined index of precipitation efficiency (PE) (ϵ ${\epsilon}$), which is straightforward both to calculate from 2D output and to compare to satellite observations. Moderate rainfall events have greater spatial variability in and lower values of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ than intense events for all models. Oceanic ϵ ${\epsilon}$ also tends to be greater than or equal to continental values in the models. We then phase partition ϵ ${\epsilon}$ using the ice water path (ϵi ${{\epsilon}}_{i}$) and the liquid water path (ϵw ${{\epsilon}}_{w}$) to understand which phases drive these behaviors in ϵ ${\epsilon}$. While the mean value and land‐ocean contrast of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ correlate well with ϵw ${{\epsilon}}_{w}$, its spread and intermodel variability during intense events are driven by ϵi ${{\epsilon}}_{i}$. Lastly, we consider the sensitivity of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ to averaging timescales, as well as its variability over timescales in power spectra, and find that the models tend to underestimate the variability of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ at higher frequencies. These analyses indicate that explicit deep convection is insufficient to generate consistent ϵ ${\epsilon}$ and that both cloud microphysics and subdaily precipitation phenomena like mesoscale convective systems contribute to persistent intermodel variations in ϵ ${\epsilon}$."

Kiran Kumar,Radiative Fluxes Over the Himalayan Region: Evaluating the Parameterization Schemes and Exploring the Potential of the XGBoost Machine Learning Tool for Downward Longwave Radiation,"Radiative fluxes over the Himalayas are shaped by complex topography and dynamic meteorology and are increasingly influenced by anthropogenic emissions from adjoining foothill plains and long‐range transported dust, affecting regional energy balance. This study presents a first comprehensive analysis of 2‐years (June 2019–May 2021) of surface radiative fluxes in distinct sky conditions (clear, cloudy, and rainy) at Manora Peak (79.45°E, 29.35°N) in the central Himalayas. We examined shortwave (Sdn: downward and Sup: upward) and longwave (Ldn: downward and Lup: upward) flux components at monthly, daily, and seasonal scales. Ldn was found significantly higher on cloudy days than clear skies, with seasonal increases of 9.94% (summer‐monsoon), 15.29% (autumn), 9.38% (winter), and 10.28% (spring). On rainy days, these values were more pronounced, reaching 12.47%, 24.76%, 19.22%, and 11.58% respectively. Atmospheric transmissivity (τ) peaks (∼0.8) during day hours, and surface albedo (α) rises (∼0.7) at sunset under clear skies. We evaluated various parameterization schemes for Ldn, identifying Herrero‐Polo‐2012 as best for clear (R2 ∼0.89, RMSE ∼11.24 W m−2), while Kimball—1982 and Unsworth—1975 as optimal for cloudy (R2 ∼0.79, RMSE ∼22.93 W m−2) and rainy (R2 ∼0.82, RMSE ∼16.73 W m−2) conditions, respectively. Further, we applied an advanced XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict Ldn, achieving superior performance to traditional schemes under various sky conditions (clear: R2 ∼0.91, RMSE ∼9.7 W m−2; cloudy: R2 ∼0.89, RMSE ∼ 12.00 W m−2; and rainy: R2 ∼0.91, RMSE ∼11.70 W m−2), highlighting the potential of ML‐based emulators over complex terrain."

Okui;K. Sato;S. Watanabe,The Mechanism of Interhemispheric Coupling Revealed by a Gravity Wave‐Permitting General Circulation Model,"Interhemispheric coupling (IHC) is the positive correlation between temperatures in the polar winter stratosphere and the polar summer upper mesosphere and the lower thermosphere. Over the past two decades, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the IHC. However, a consensus on the mechanism is yet to be fully reached, particularly regarding the role of gravity waves (GWs). We conduct hindcast simulations for seven boreal winters using a GW‐permitting general circulation model encompassing the whole neutral atmosphere. The model is initialized through spectral nudging to state‐of‐the‐art reanalysis data of identical vertical coverage. Treating the 7‐year averages of the model outputs as a climatology, the IHC is investigated as a sequential evolution of anomalies relative to it. The results showed that consequential interplay of GWs and quasi‐two‐day waves in the summer mesosphere is the key driver of the IHC, as is consistent with Yasui et al. (2021, doi: 10.1175/jas‐d‐21‐0045.1) except for the final step toward the summer pole facilitated by primary GWs in the Antarctic. These waves are filtered by an anomalously weak westward jet due to a temperature gradient caused by planetary wave forcing, considered to be quasi‐two‐day waves. The mechanism is mostly applicable to both types of IHC events: those associated with sudden stratospheric warming and those with vortex intensification. Meanwhile, comparisons across the seven boreal winters indicate vulnerabilities in specific processes underlying the mechanism. In the reanalysis, it is suggested that GW parameterizations underestimate the GW forcing anomalies, but analysis increments reduce this discrepancy."

Anderson,Statistical Analysis of Trans‐Ionospheric Pulse Pairs and Inferences on Their Characteristics,"Trans‐ionospheric pulse pairs (TIPPs), first observed in 1993, are signatures of in‐cloud lightning discharges observed by satellite‐based broadband very high frequency (VHF) receivers. It has been definitively shown that TIPPs are the space‐based signatures of compact intracloud discharges (CIDs), and that the associated pair of pulses that comprise a TIPP result from the direct VHF pulse from the discharge, followed by a pulse reflected from the Earth's surface. However, the ratio of the peak amplitudes of these two pulses can vary widely, with the second pulse often having considerably higher peak amplitude than the first. This observation has not been satisfactorily explained. Using data collected from geostationary orbit by the Radio Frequency Sensor (RFS) and matched to locations reported by the Global Lightning Dataset (GLD360), we assemble the largest database to date of 76,348 TIPPs with associated location, altitude, and amplitude ratio of the two pulses in the TIPP. We show that the amplitude ratio of TIPPs is strongly correlated to the altitude of the associated discharges and the geometry of the source location with respect to the Earth's surface and the receiver. These observations strongly suggest that the difference in amplitude of the two pulses is driven by a nondipole radiated beam pattern that is dependent on the polarity of the CID, velocity of the current wavefront, and viewing angle."
10.1029/2024JD043138,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文探讨了总羟基反应性（k′OH）和总过氧自由基（RO2*）对臭氧生成的影响。通过在北京冬奥会期间的观测数据，发现现有大气模型低估了k′OH和RO2*的浓度，导致臭氧生成过程不明确。研究通过引入未知挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的氧化化学反应，将k′OH约束到实测值，有效缩小了模型和实测RO2*之间的差距。考虑实测k′OH和RO2*后，臭氧生成潜力增加，臭氧生成机制的敏感性从VOCs限制转变为NOx限制，并显著提高了VOCs对臭氧生成的绝对敏感性。这表明同时测量k′OH和RO2*能更准确地控制臭氧。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面。,"['ozone production', 'OH reactivity', 'peroxyl radicals', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Nana Wei;Weixiong Zhao;Tiantian Zhang;Jianshu Wang;Chong Zhang;Yi Chen;Xuena Yu;Weili Lin;Chunxiang Ye;Christa Fittschen;Weijun Zhang,Bridging the Gap Between Total Peroxyl Radical Observations and Models by Measuring OH Reactivity to Improve Estimates of Ozone Production: A Case Study From the 24th Winter Olympics Games,"Ozone (O3) concentration is a function of the catalytic cycles of ROx radical (hydroxyl (OH), hydroperoxyl (HO2) and organic peroxy (RO2) radical) and NOx (NO and NO2). Total OH reactivity (k′OH) and total peroxyl radicals (RO2* = RO2 + HO2) play an important role in this cycle and have a major impact on O3 mitigation. The currently used atmospheric models generally underestimate the measured values of k′OH and RO2* concentrations, therefore the ozone production processes remains unclear. This paper presents observation of k′OH, RO2*, and ancillary trace species from February and March 2022 in Beijing, covering the 24th Olympic Winter Games period. We aim to accurately predict the ozone production processes by exploring the impact of k′OH on the RO2* chemistry. During the Games period, observed k′OH were significantly higher than calculations, and average RO2* concentrations at noontime of 6.9 pptv were observed, which is about 1.3–10 times higher than previous winter observations. A zero‐dimensional model underestimated the observed RO2*. Constraining k′OH to the measured value by introducing the oxidation chemistry of unknown or unmeasured volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species (X) can effectively close the gap between modeled and measured RO2*. By considering measured k′OH and RO2*, the ozone production potential increased by a factor of 1.3–2.1, the O3 production regime sensitivity showed a significant trend shift from VOCs to NOx limited, and enhanced the absolute ozone production sensitivity on VOCs by an order of magnitude. This means that simultaneously measurement of k′OH and RO2* provides a more accurate approach to O3 control."

Quantification of regional transport to SO42− using chemical transport models (CTMs) is debated due to uncertainties in SO2 emissions and SO42− formation mechanisms incorporated in the CTMs. In this study, sulfur isotope ratios in sulfate (δ34S‐SO42−) were measured at Gucheng, a heavily polluted city in the NCP, to differentiate local emissions from regional transport to sulfate. The δ34S‐SO42− values varied from 2.5 to 6.5‰, with a mean of 4.6 ± 1.1‰. The lower δ34S‐SO42− values were observed in the haze events, attributed to regional transport from high‐SO2 emission regions, where coal materials typically exhibit declined δ34S values. The fractionation factors (α34Sg→p) of δ34S for SO2 to SO42− conversion were estimated to be 3.6 ± 1.1‰. Considering the α34Sg→p, the quantified formation mechanisms indicated that transition metallic ions (TMIs)‐catalyzed O2 oxidation dominated sulfate formation, contributing 34%, followed by NO2 (27%), OH (23%), and H2O2/O3 oxidation pathways (16%). Local coal burning, vehicle emissions, and oil combustion contributed 58%, 16%, and 9% to sulfate, respectively. The remaining 17% of sulfate was contributed by regional transport (mainly coal burning) with enhancements in the specific haze events. Although uncertainties remained in the estimations, our findings did suggest that strict control in SO2 emissions from local and regional coal combustion along with TMIs emissions from the steel industry was crucial for reducing sulfate concentrations in this NCP city."

Sime;Alison J. McLaren;Martin Werner,Moisture Source Controls on Water Isotopes in Antarctic Precipitation—Insights From Water Tracers in ECHAM6‐Wiso,"The interpretation of water isotope records in Antarctic ice cores is crucial for our understanding of past climate changes. Here we use novel water tracers in an ECHAM6‐wiso simulation to investigate moisture source controls on deuterium excess in Antarctic precipitation, particularly the logarithmic variant dln ${d}_{\ln}$. The simulation captures the amplitude of seasonal changes in observed δD $\delta D$ and dln ${d}_{\ln}$ of precipitation. There are, however, some model biases that cannot be resolved through adjustments to kinetic fractionation parameters or the model resolution. These may reflect issues in the hydrological cycle representation or the representation of isotope processes. The simulated dln ${d}_{\ln}$ in Antarctic precipitation reliably reflects moisture source sea surface temperature (SST): dln ${d}_{\ln}$ shows a higher correlation than traditionally defined deuterium excess. Ocean surface relative humidity with respect to SST (RHsst) influences dln ${d}_{\ln}$ during evaporation, however, this influence weakens above the ocean surface. 79% of the variance in dln ${d}_{\ln}$ of annual precipitation at Dome C is due to changes in moisture source SST. dln ${d}_{\ln}$ is more sensitive to source SST in inland Antarctica than in coastal regions, making it a robust proxy for reconstructing past SST at the inland ice core sites. The explained variance of dln ${d}_{\ln}$ by source SST for daily precipitation at Dome C is lower at 28%, which increases to 59% after excluding very low precipitation days (< ${< } $0.02 mm). Finally, we find reversed relationships between source SST and dln ${d}_{\ln}$ in the vapor above the Southern Ocean, potentially driven by cold air outbreaks or precipitation processes."

It is largely influenced by local weather conditions and atmospheric transport, which are in turn controlled by large‐scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Because of the absence of long‐term atmospheric nitrogen deposition data series, the mechanisms of interannual variation of nitrogen deposition are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate relationships between atmospheric nitrogen deposition and atmospheric circulation variability and explore the underlying mechanisms. We find that there is a growing imbalance between regional nitrogen emissions and deposition in global hotspots. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition variations exhibit significant relationships with atmospheric circulation modes, with predominant influences from the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

 Hadal trenches, some of the Earth’s least explored and understood environments, have long been proposed to harbour chemosynthesis-based communities1,2. Despite increasing attention, actual documentation of such communities has been exceptionally rare3,4. Here we report the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth during an expedition to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the western Aleutian Trench using the manned submersible Fendouzhe. The communities dominated by siboglinid Polychaeta and Bivalvia span a distance of 2,500 km at depths from 5,800 m to 9,533 m. These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches, where methane is produced microbially from deposited organic matter, as indicated by isotopic analysis. Given geological similarities with other hadal trenches, such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated.

Ward,Repurposing haemoproteins for asymmetric metal-catalysed H atom transfer,"Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer, a new-to-nature reaction. 
 Transition metal–hydrides have been widely exploited in catalysis for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated moieties, including carbonyls, alkenes and alkynes1. To complement heterolytic metal–hydride bond cleavage, metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has recently gained attention, as a promising strategy for radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes2, thus enabling late-stage diversification of complex molecules3,4. However, owing to the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical and the enantiopure catalyst5, asymmetric MHAT6 remains challenging. Here we show that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of P450BM3 yielded a triple mutant that catalyses MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes, producing diverse cyclic compounds—including pyrrolidines and piperidines—with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole-cell conditions. Apart from electron-deficient alkenes, alternative radical acceptors—including hydrazones, oximes and nitriles—were converted by repurposed P450BM3 to enantioenriched cyclization products. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding by homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)–hydride species2,6. Starting from CYP119, directed evolution afforded a stereocomplementary MHATase, highlighting the potential of repurposed CYPs for MHAT biocatalysis. Our study highlights the prospect of integrating homolytic metal–hydride reactivity into metalloenzymes, thus expanding the scope of asymmetric radical biocatalysis.

Ding,Remodelling of corticostriatal axonal boutons during motor learning,"Individual boutons on mouse corticostriatal axons exhibit differential selectivity for rewarded and unrewarded movements during motor learning, and the proportion of reward-responsive boutons increases. 
 Motor skill learning induces long-lasting synaptic plasticity at dendritic spines1–4 and at the outputs of motor cortical neurons to the striatum5,6. However, little is known about corticostriatal axon activity and structural plasticity during learning in the adult brain. Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution. Individual boutons on mouse corticostriatal axons exhibit differential selectivity for rewarded and unrewarded movements during motor learning, and the proportion of reward-responsive boutons increases."

 Hexagonal diamond (HD), with anticipated physical properties superior than the known cubic diamond, has been pursued relentlessly since its inception 60 years ago1. However, natural and synthetic HD has only been preserved as a highly disordered component in fragile, heterogeneous mixtures of other nanocarbon structures that precludes determination of bulk properties and identification of HD as a bona fide crystalline phase2–4. Here we report the synthesis, recovery and extensive characterization of bulk HD by compressing and heating high-quality graphite single crystals under controlled quasi-hydrostatic conditions.

The interlayer bonds in HD are shortened with respect to intralayer bonds to optimize the HD structure. Notably, the hardness of HD is only slightly higher than cubic diamond. We anticipate that purifying the precursor graphite carbon and fine-tuning the high pressure–temperature (P–T) synthesis conditions may lead to higher-quality HDs.

 Across mammalian species, new mothers undergo behavioural changes to nurture their offspring and meet the caloric demands of milk production1–5. Although many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviours are well characterized6–9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here we performed transcriptomic profiling of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARCAgRP neurons). To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay in which female mice chose between a food source or pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviours in both lactating and virgin females. We found that ARCAgRP neurons inhibit bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA (MPOABRS3 neurons), which become more active postpartum and govern parenting and satiety. Activation of this ARCAgRP-to-MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviours from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviours. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mouse hypothalamus and behavioural experiments show that specific hypothalamic networks regulate conflicting feeding versus parenting behaviours of female mice."

 The surface landscapes of cells differ as a function of cell type and are frequently altered in disease contexts1–3. Exploiting such differences is key to many therapeutic strategies and is the basis for developing diagnostic and basic-science tools. State-of-the-art strategies typically target single surface antigens, but each individual receptor rarely defines the specific cell type4,5. The development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell-surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is therefore highly desirable. Here we describe an autonomous decision-making device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive polypeptide fragments. We show that this protein-actuator platform can perform convergent protein ligation on designated cell surfaces, allowing highly selective generation of active proteins, which can either remain physically associated with the cell surface on which they were manufactured or be released into the surrounding milieu. Because of its intrinsic modularity and tunability, we demonstrate that the technology is compatible with different types of input, targeting modality and functional output, allowing for the localized interrogation or manipulation of cellular systems.

 Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment1 was designed to first detect elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed2. Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7σ from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395 ± 106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347 ± 59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.

 Magnetic field generation on Earth has probably persisted for at least 3.5 Gyr (refs. 1,2), initially sustained by secular cooling of the Earth’s core and, more recently, by the growth of the solid inner core3. Numerical models of the present-day geodynamo have proved to be successful in producing Earth-like magnetic fields4–7 and approaching realistic dynamic regimes8–11. However, thermal evolution12,13 and palaeomagnetic records14,15 suggest that the geodynamo operated for most of geomagnetic history without a solid inner core. Dynamo action in a whole fluid core remains poorly understood. Here we show dynamo actions that are independent of fluid viscosity in the correct geometry of the Earth’s core in the deep past at extremely low viscosity, demonstrating the negligible role of fluid viscosity in our dynamo simulations. Our early-Earth geometry models produce magnetic field intensity and morphologies that are compatible with the palaeomagnetic data in the deep past while showing remarkable similarity to the present-day magnetic field. This raises questions about the role of the solid inner core in producing the spatial-temporal variations of the observed Earth’s magnetic field7,16–18.

 Immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments are common in cancers such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (MASH-HCC)1–3. Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood4. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation5–7. Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways8–12. Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC.

 Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy1. Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation2,3. Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4+ T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.

 Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation1. Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/CCDH1) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/CCDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes2, raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry. APC/C activity is transiently inhibited to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry."

 Mouse lemurs are the smallest and fastest reproducing primates, as well as one of the most abundant, and they are emerging as a model organism for primate biology, behaviour, health and conservation. Although much has been learnt about their ecology and phylogeny in Madagascar and their physiology, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing to create Tabula Microcebus, a transcriptomic atlas of 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs opportunistically obtained from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration and expert cell annotation, we define and biologically organize more than 750 lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. This includes cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and differentiating cells along the developmental trajectories of spermatogenesis, haematopoiesis and other adult tissues. We also describe dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types. We globally compare expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explore primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing lemur transcriptomes to those of human, mouse and macaque. This reveals cell-type-specific patterns of primate specialization and many cell types and genes for which the mouse lemur provides a better human model than mouse1. The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this model primate and establishes a general approach for characterizing other emerging model organisms. Together with a companion paper, the generation of a transcriptomic atlas for the mouse lemur and analyses of example cell types establish this animal as a molecularly tractable primate model organism."

This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans. A single dose of an adeno-associated virus vector encoding an HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody given shortly after birth results in persistent antibody expression and protection from infection in rhesus macaque models of human HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse."

 The European Union (EU) climate policies rely on a functioning forest carbon sink. Forests cover about 40% of the EU area and have absorbed about 436 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year between 1990 and 2022, which is about 10% of the EU’s anthropogenic emissions. However, the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks is rapidly declining owing to increasing natural and anthropogenic pressures, threatening the EU’s climate goals and calling for prompt actions. Here we provide actionable research recommendations to improve the monitoring and modelling of forest resources and their carbon sink, and to better inform forest management decisions. We suggest a timeline for the development of these measures to better support the implementation of strategies and policies outlined in the European Green Deal.

 Terrestrial ecosystems could contribute to climate mitigation through nature-based climate solutions (NbCS), which aim to reduce ecosystem greenhouse gas emissions and/or increase ecosystem carbon storage. Forests have the largest potential for NbCS, aligned with broader sustainability benefits, but—unfortunately—a broad body of literature has revealed widespread problems in forest NbCS projects and protocols that undermine the climate mitigation of forest carbon credits and hamper efforts to reach global net zero. Therefore, there is a need to bring better science and policy to improve NbCS climate mitigation outcomes going forward. Here we synthesize challenges to crediting forest NbCS and offer guidance and key next steps to make improvements in the implementation of these strategies immediately and in the near-term. We structure our Perspective around four key components of rigorous forest NbCS, illuminating key science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour. Finally, we outline a ‘contribution approach’ to support rigorous forest NbCS that is an alternative funding mechanism that disallows compensation or offsetting claims.

 Proteins that bind to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with high affinity and specificity could be useful for therapeutic and diagnostic applications1–4. However, a general methodology for targeting IDPs or IDRs has yet to be developed. Here we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformations, RFdiffusion5 can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We used this approach to generate binders to the IDPs amylin, C-peptide, VP48 and BRCA1_ARATH in diverse conformations with a dissociation constant (Kd) ranging from 3 to 100 nM. For the IDRs G3BP1, common cytokine receptor γ-chain (IL-2RG) and prion protein, we diffused binders to β-strand conformations of the targets, obtaining Kd between 10 and 100 nM. Fluorescence imaging experiments show that the binders bind to their respective targets in cells. The G3BP1 binder disrupts stress granule formation in cells, and the amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibres, enables targeting of both monomeric and fibrillar amylin to lysosomes, and increases the sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based amylin detection. Our approach should be useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs or IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.

 Projections of tropical rainfall under global warming remain highly uncertain1,2, largely because of an unclear climate response to a potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)3. Although an AMOC slowdown can substantially alter tropical rainfall patterns4–8, the physical mechanisms linking high-latitude changes to tropical hydroclimate are poorly understood11. Here we demonstrate that an AMOC slowdown drives widespread shifts in tropical rainfall through the propagation of high-latitude cooling into the tropical North Atlantic. We identify and validate this mechanism using climate model simulations and palaeoclimate records from Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)—a past period marked by pronounced AMOC weakening9,10. In models, prevailing easterly and westerly winds communicate the climate signal to the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean through the transport of cold air generated over the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic. Air–sea interactions transmit the response across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, altering rainfall patterns as far as Indonesia, the tropical Andes and northern Australia. A similar teleconnection emerges under global warming scenarios, producing a consistent multi-model pattern of tropical hydroclimatic change. These palaeo-validated projections show widespread drying across Mesoamerica, the Amazon and West Africa, highlighting an elevated risk of severe drought for vulnerable human and ecological systems.

 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains the world’s deadliest bacterial pathogen1. There is an urgent medical need to develop new drugs that shorten the treatment duration to combat widespread multi-drug-resistant and extensive-drug-resistant Mtb. Here, we present a preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, that contains an aryl fluorosulfate (SuFEx)2 warhead and uniquely targets the acyltransferase domain of Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis. CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection. Inhibition by CMX410 is irreversible through a previously undescribed mechanism: CMX410 reacts with the catalytic serine of the AT domain of Pks13, rapidly and irreversibly disabling the active site by forming a β-lactam. CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg−1 per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens.

 Gene editing has the potential to solve fundamental challenges in agriculture, biotechnology and human health. CRISPR-based gene editors derived from microorganisms, although powerful, often show notable functional tradeoffs when ported into non-native environments, such as human cells1. Artificial-intelligence-enabled design provides a powerful alternative with the potential to bypass evolutionary constraints and generate editors with optimal properties. Here, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins. Several of the generated gene editors show comparable or improved activity and specificity relative to SpCas9, the prototypical gene editing effector, while being 400 mutations away in sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial-intelligence-generated gene editor, denoted as OpenCRISPR-1, exhibits compatibility with base editing.

 Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an emerging primate model organism, but their genetics, cellular and molecular biology remain largely unexplored. In an accompanying paper1, we performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing of 27 organs from mouse lemurs. We identified more than 750 molecular cell types, characterized their transcriptomic profiles and provided insight into primate evolution of cell types. Here we use the generated atlas to characterize mouse lemur genes, physiology, disease and mutations. We uncover thousands of previously unidentified lemur genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions including over 85,000 primate splice junctions missing in mice. We systematically explore the lemur immune system by comparing global expression profiles of key immune genes in health and disease, and by mapping immune cell development, trafficking and activation. We characterize primate-specific and lemur-specific physiology and disease, including molecular features of the immune program, lemur adipocytes and metastatic endometrial cancer that resembles the human malignancy. We present expression patterns of more than 400 primate genes missing in mice, many with similar expression patterns to humans and some implicated in human disease. Finally, we provide an experimental framework for reverse genetic analysis by identifying naturally occurring nonsense mutations in three primate immune genes missing in mice and by analysing their transcriptional phenotypes. This work establishes a foundation for molecular and genetic analyses of mouse lemurs and prioritizes primate genes, isoforms, physiology and disease for future study.

 Allergens that induce allergic airway inflammation are highly diverse, but they commonly activate type 2 immune responses1,2. Airway epithelial cells are crucial in allergen sensing3–5. However, the shared features among diverse allergens that elicit similar innate responses, and their epithelial detection mechanisms, remain poorly defined1,2,6–9. Here we identify pore-forming proteins as one of the common stimuli of allergic airway inflammation and reveal their immune-activation mechanisms. Using the prevalent mould allergen Alternaria alternata as a model, we established an in vitro system to investigate type 2 innate immune sensing. A six-step biochemical fractionation identified Aeg-S and Aeg-L as the core immune-stimulatory components. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that these proteins form 16- to 20-mer transmembrane pore complexes. Their cooperative perforation acts as a bona fide type 2 immune adjuvant to support antigen-specific T helper 2 and immunoglobulin E responses. Genetically engineered A. alternata strains that lack pore-forming activity do not induce allergic responses in mice. Furthermore, pore-forming proteins from various species, despite structural and membrane target differences, are sufficient to trigger respiratory allergies. Perforations in airway epithelial cells initiate allergic responses through two mechanisms: one triggers IL-33 release, and the other involves Ca2+ influx, which activates MAPK signalling and type 2 inflammatory gene expression. These findings provide insight into how type 2 immune responses detect common perturbations caused by structurally diverse stimuli. Targeting downstream signalling of epithelial perforation may open new avenues for treating respiratory allergies.

 As Earth’s climate warms, surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has intensified, increasing rates of sea-level rise. Observations and theory indicate that meltwater generated at the ice sheet surface can drain to its bed, where it flows relatively unhindered to the ocean. This understanding of water movement within and beneath ice sheets underpins the theoretical models that are used to make projections of ice sheet change. Here we present evidence of a destructive mode of meltwater drainage in Greenland. Using multiple satellite sources, we show that a 90-million-cubic-metre subglacial flood forced its way upwards from the bed, fracturing the ice sheet, and bursting through the surface. This phenomenon was triggered by the rapid drainage of a subglacial lake and occurred in a region where the ice bed was predicted to be frozen. The resulting flood caused a rapid deceleration of the downstream marine-terminating glacier. Our observations reveal a complex, bi-directional coupling between the ice sheet’s surface and basal hydrological systems and demonstrate that extreme hydrological forcing may occur in regions of predicted cold-based ice. Such processes can impact the ice sheet’s dynamics and structural integrity but are not currently considered in ice sheet models.

 Characterizing black carbon (BC) on a fine scale globally is essential for understanding its climate and health impacts. However, sparse BC mass measurements in different parts of the world and coarse model resolution have inhibited evaluation of global BC emission inventories. Here, we apply globally distributed BC mass measurements from the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN) and complementary measurement networks to evaluate contemporary BC emission inventories. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) for high-resolution simulations to relate BC emissions to ambient concentrations for comparison with measurements. Here we find that simulations using the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) emission inventory exhibit skill (r2 = 0.73) in representing variability in SPARTAN measurements across primarily developed regions with low BC concentrations but exhibit pronounced discrepancy (r2 = 0.00019) across high-BC regions in the Global South, underestimating BC by 38%. Alternative inventories (EDGAR, HTAP) yield similar results. These findings motivate renewed attention to the challenging task of characterizing BC emissions from low- and middle-income countries. Using globally consistent measurements and high-resolution modelling, this study finds that black carbon emissions are generally underestimated in the Global South."

 The RalGAP (GTPase activating protein) complexes are negative regulators of the Ral GTPases and thus crucial components that counteract oncogenic Ras signaling. However, no structural information on the architecture of this tumor suppressor complex is available hampering a mechanistic understanding of its functionality. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of RalGAP that reveals an extended 58 nm tetrameric architecture comprising two heterodimers of the RalGAPα and RalGAPβ subunits. We show that the catalytic domain of RalGAPα requires stabilization by a unique domain of RalGAPβ, providing the molecular basis for why RalGAP complexes are obligatory heterodimers. Formation of RalGAP tetramers is not required for activity in vitro, but essential for function of the complex in vivo. Structural analysis of RalGAP subunit variants reported in cancer patients suggests effects on complex formation and thus functional relevance, emphasizing the significance of the obtained structural information for medical research.

 Tracking the motion of individual atoms during chemical reactions represents a severe experimental challenge, especially if several competing reaction pathways exist or if the reaction is governed by the correlated motion of more than two molecular constituents. Here we demonstrate how ultrashort X-ray pulses combined with coincident ion imaging can be used to trace molecular iodine elimination from laser-irradiated diiodomethane (CH2I2), a reaction channel of fundamental importance but small relative yield that involves the breaking of two molecular bonds and the formation of a new one. We map bending vibrations of the bound molecule, disentangle different dissociation pathways, image the correlated motion of the iodine atoms and the methylene group leading to molecular iodine ejection, and trace the vibrational motion of the formed product. Our results provide a quantitative mechanistic picture behind previously suggested reaction mechanisms and prove that a variety of geometries are involved in the molecular bond formation.

PI4P controls lipid asymmetry and curvature, while PI(4,5)P2 recruits a dynamin protein; together they coordinate membrane remodeling for division. 
 In plants, the developing cell plate which is characterized by a series of anionic lipids, undergoes dramatic morphological change for successful cytokinesis. However, the mechanisms underlying these alterations, and the roles of anionic lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and phosphatidylserine (PS) during cell division remain poorly understood. Here we present that changes in anionic lipid composition have a profound effect on cell plate development: deprivation of phosphatidylinositides (PIPs) leads to incomplete cytokinesis through distorted cell-plate architecture. Our data demonstrate that PI4P shapes cell plate membrane morphology through flippase-regulated PS flipping inhibition, while PI(4,5)P2 functions in the recruitment of dynamin-related protein 1A (DRP1A) and the constriction region formation; depletion of PIPs causes cell plate tubulation and flattening failure. We propose a model in which PI4P regulates the level and distribution of PS, while PI(4,5)P2 mediates the localization of DRP1A; together, they coordinate cell plate morphology to ensure successful cytokinesis in plant cells.

 Genomes of clonally reproducing fungal pathogens are often compartmentalized into conserved core and lineage-specific accessory regions (ARs), enriched in transposable elements (TEs). ARs and TEs are thought to promote pathogen adaptation, but direct experimental evidence is sparse. Using an evolve and re-sequence approach, we found that serial passaging of the cross-kingdom fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum through tomato plants or axenic media rapidly increased fitness under the selection condition. TE insertions were the predominant type of mutations in the evolved lines, with a single non-autonomous hAT-type TE accounting for 63% of total events detected. TEs are inserted preferentially at sites of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, a hallmark of ARs. Recurrent evolutionary trajectories during plate adaptation led to increased proliferation concomitant with reduced virulence. Unexpectedly, adaptive mutations in accessory genes strongly impacted core functions such as growth, development, quorum sensing, or virulence. Thus, TEs and ARs drive rapid adaptation in this important fungal pathogen.

Myers,Global wood harvest is sufficient for climate-friendly transitions to timber cities,"Timber cities, using new engineered wood products for constructing homes and commercial buildings, could transform urban construction. This article looks at how demand for wood might impact current harvests and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. 
 Decarbonizing the economy requires a large-scale transition from fossil carbon-containing feedstocks to minerals and biomass, notably wood in buildings. Increasing harvesting is under discussion to meet the supply of wood for ‘timber cities’, with potentially negative impacts on forests and biodiversity. Here we investigate pathways to timber cities, including their impacts on land use, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by quantifying global and regional wood cycles using Bayesian material flow analysis. We show that shifting wood fuel to industrial use and maximizing circular use of wood can make timber cities possible with the current harvest volume. Our results reveal that these pathways have better environmental performance than increased harvesting, reducing total CO2 equivalent emissions by 2100 by 40.8 Gt compared to business as usual. To achieve the wood transition, regional and cross-sectoral governance and planning are needed, addressing national-level pathways and inter-regional wood transport. The most critical actions are reducing the use of virgin wood as fuel by promoting cleaner alternatives, and using wood waste more effectively globally, rather than expanding plantation forests. Timber cities, using new engineered wood products for constructing homes and commercial buildings, could transform urban construction.

 Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are typically a mix of warmers/coolers and short-lived/long-lived species. This suite of emissions should be taken into account to drive better climate. We quantify 33 emitted species since 1750 from seven economic sectors and their impact on present-day warming. We then assess how today’s sectoral emissions impact future temperatures. Sectors that predominantly emit short-lived warmers drive half of today’s warming (~0.6 °C). However, their current-year emissions have a lesser impact on 100-year temperature projections due to proportionally lower longer-lived species. Sectoral emissions dominated by longer-lived warmers impact temperature for centuries – an impact which accumulates over time. However, shorter-lived climate coolers from these sectors mask ~50% of their present-day warming (~33% overall). This means actions necessary to reduce long-lived warming may temporarily increase near-term temperatures. Successfully limiting both near- and long-term warming requires considering this interplay and accelerating climate ambitions to offset any decline in coolers."

Here, we assess skill of climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) for predicting monthly high temperature anomalies relative to monthly means over time. Models project that, as the planet warms, these high temperature anomalies will increase in subtropical regions and decrease in high latitudes. Both postive and negative biases remain largely unchanged regionally and seasonally within two historical periods, 1980–2001 and 2002–2023. Globally, models have underestimated the 22-year average monthly high temperature anomalies by 2–3% and 22-year maximum anomalies by 11–12%.

 Investigating the response of the rhizosphere and bulk soil to fertilization, along with the mechanisms governing their dynamic and stability, is essential to understand root and microbial functions in ecosystems. Here we synthesized 7606 pairwise observations based on 3803 paired samples from rhizosphere and bulk soil to assess how chemical and microbiological properties respond to application of mineral and organic fertilizers across croplands, grasslands, and forests. Fertilization positively altered the overall chemical properties of rhizosphere and bulk soil by 21% and 18%, respectively, while microbiological properties remained largely unchanged except for microbial biomass and the activities of certain enzymes. Fertilization decreased the response variability of soil properties, resulting in reduced heterogeneity, particularly in bulk soil. The response slopes of rhizosphere and bulk soil properties to fertilization were below 1.0, indicating that the rhizosphere had greater resistance, especially under organo-mineral fertilizer application. This high resistance stems from i) large input or available compounds by roots maintaining the stability of microbial communities in rhizosphere, ii) stronger microbial control over chemical properties, and iii) a larger gap in response variability between rhizosphere and bulk soil. In conclusion, while rhizosphere and bulk soil properties respond similarly to fertilization, the rhizosphere demonstrates greater stability due to its higher resistance.

 Historical reconstructions of fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions are vital to setting emission mitigation strategies, and tree-ring radiocarbon analysis provides a reliable approach. However, residual radiocarbon from past nuclear tests can distort the signal, and regional variations beyond the well-known latitudinal gradient remain underexplored. Here we analyzed tree-ring radiocarbon records from Nanling (1921–2020, this study) and published datasets to identify spatial patterns of bomb-derived fallout in China from 1965 to 1985. Compared to latitudinal compilations and European backgrounds, radiocarbon enhancements extended up to 3000 km from test sites, highlighting the dominant role of source characteristics. We further demonstrate that re-release of bomb radiocarbon from terrestrial ecosystems prolongs its regional atmospheric residence time to 5–20 years, introducing spatial variability that biases fossil fuel carbon dioxide reconstructions up to 5.4 ppm. These findings underscore the need to integrate source-specific fallout and atmospheric transport into regional radiocarbon interpretation frameworks.

 Built as a world-class city cluster in China, the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) faces pressure to reconcile rapid economic growth with its carbon peaking commitments. Distributed solar energy, particularly rooftop photovoltaics (RPV), emerges as a strategic solution to reduce carbon emissions while overcoming land constraints. This study proposes an integrated methodology that combines Google Earth Satellite (GES), digital elevation model (DEM), land use and land cover (LULC) map, global tilted irradiation (GTI), and a deep-learning model to assess RPV potential of the GBA. It leverages an advanced deep learning model, RSPrompter, and GES to obtain rooftop segmentation, achieving an unprecedented accuracy of 96.2% that surpasses other models like U-Net, SegNet, HRNet, and DeepLabV3+. Moreover, a shape-based rooftop height estimation by integrating segmented rooftops with DEM and LULC is introduced to enhance the precision of RPV potential assessments. This study reports a total rooftop area of 2428.769 km2 and an effective rooftop area of 137.547 km2 in the GBA, capable of generating 11,907.521 GWh of power annually, equivalent to a CO2 emission reduction of 4,393.875 kilotons.

 The infiltration factor (Finf) represents the proportion of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that penetrates indoor spaces from the outdoor environment. It is a crucial parameter for reducing biases in exposure assessments of PM2.5 from indoor and outdoor sources.

 The exchange of air masses between sea and land plays a crucial role in the migration and transformation of atmospheric pollutants in coastal regions. Due to the absence of in-situ technology for continuous monitoring of marine air pollutants, much of the current scientific understanding of that still lacks observational evidence. This study utilized data of ozone (O3) and its precursors obtained from satellite spectrum to investigate the distribution and transport of air pollutants between marine and terrestrial atmosphere in East Asia. The results indicate that the low tropospheric (0–5 km) O3 concentrations over the seas are comparable to those in coastal cities, with Bohai Bay having the highest concentration in East Asia, exceeding 33 DU (1 DU = 2.69 × 1016 molecules·cm−2). Meanwhile, through the observations of two Chinese satellites with different equator-crossing time, afternoon O3 concentrations over sea were significantly higher than in the morning, indicating high-level O3 over sea was mainly caused by local formation. The comparison of marine and terrestrial pixels shows that, under the same precursor concentrations, marine air exhibits a 3.7 % higher O3 production rate on average. The higher O3 production rate, combined with the substantial emissions of O3 precursors, ultimately leads to the Bohai Sea becoming an ‘O3 pool’. This study, for the first time based on satellite observations, captures the exchange process of O3 and its precursors between terrestrial and marine atmospheres: land-based precursors are transported to the sea, where O3 formed under suitable conditions and then transported back to land."

We estimate that a 15% increase in solar generation is associated with an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2emissions, contributing 12.38% toward the yearly target of 69 MMT CO2reductions needed to cut 1380 MMT of CO2in 20 years, as per the Environmental Protection Agency rule on fossil fuel power plants. This study offers insights for policymakers and stakeholders in achieving CO2reduction targets through increased solar generation."

In zebrafish embryos, midline tissues composed of the notochord, floorplate, and hypochord elongate synchronously with their lengths aligned. We show that floorplate and hypochord cells collectively migrate posteriorly along the nascent notochord extracellular matrix as it extends posteriorly, maintaining the tripartite configuration. Fibroblast growth factor-mediated migration in a spatially graded manner causes cell stretching, which triggers Yap-dependent proliferation and controls floorplate and hypochord growth. Supported by mathematical modeling, we further suggest that their growth is fine-tuned by mechanical tethering to the notochord via cadherin 2 at the posterior end. We propose that the notochord instructs and sustains the tripartite formation via leader-follower formation control, a strategy from engineering that spatially organizes multiple agents to coordinate the growth of the midline tissues."

However, changes in neuronal activity, including the saturation of synaptic strength by the positive-feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity, could deteriorate the encoded memory. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to contribute to the stability of the encoded memory by maintaining the relative differences in synaptic strength against persistent destabilizing changes in neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear how and when these two types of plasticity work together in the context of memory. Here, we have demonstrated that LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, drives homeostatic resetting several hours after LTP by down-regulating AMPA-receptor trafficking via the Golgi apparatus. LARGE deficiency impairs long-term memory formation in mice. Our study reveals a potential molecular mechanism underlying the stability of memory mediated by cross-talk between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity."

However, little is known if groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce possible benefits. Here, we investigated wild fish shoals responding collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analyzed the collective response in reaction to bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size. Larger shoals increasingly detected predator attacks (i.e., true positives), while their response facing harmless flybys (i.e., false alarms) remained constant. Furthermore, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to simultaneously overcome two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision-making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our findings set the stage for the next generation of studies investigating the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making."

However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM.

Previous studies have suggested that metformin acts peripherally by reducing hepatic glucose output and altering gut functions. Here, we report a neural mechanism via the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). Mice with forebrain-specificRap1knockout exhibited resistance to the antidiabetic effects of low-dose metformin while remaining sensitive to other antidiabetic agents. Centrally administered metformin inhibited brain Rap1 and reduced hyperglycemia. Conversely, forced activation of brain Rap1 increased glycemia and abolished the glycemic effect of metformin. Metformin activated a specific subset of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) that requires Rap1. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggest that VMH Rap1 is indispensable for the antidiabetic effects of metformin.

Here, we demonstrate how knot particles enable single-layer bianisotropic control using their inherent topology. Leveraging their geometric properties, we examine three-dimensional (3D) wire configurations characterized by the knot winding numbers (p,q), generating balanced electric and magnetic responses. Through multipole analysis, we demonstrate efficient polarization rotation with high transmission for different knot-particle topologies. We explore the knot-particle topologies required to achieve matched polarization rotation and derive simple design rules for the knot parameters without resorting to numerical optimization. The microscopic polarizability tensors and macroscopic susceptibilities reveal that the trefoil knot exhibits strong chiral bianisotropic behavior through its magnetoelectric coupling tensor. We implement knot-particle metasurfaces using advanced 3D printing, which realizes the full 3D geometry of the wires. We present simplified flat designs suitable for printed circuit board fabrication that preserve the essential symmetry enabling the bianisotropic properties."

A microheater, with millisecond response, heats or recools DNA origami constructs, hybridizing or dehybridizing sticky ends. Because anything within 20 micrometers of the heater equilibrates to a programmed temperature change in milliseconds, sticky ends of a compound DNA origami machine can open and close synchronously and operate cooperatively, in phase, additively increasing the drive force compared to single pair of sticky ends DNA machine (the six-helix bundle DNA origami hinge machine). In our demonstrations, we fold and unfold two square origami with 10 pairs of complementary sticky ends to drive a bead on the end of a rod like origami to speeds exceeding 30 micrometers per second.

While temperature-mortality relationships are well-documented, the effects of climate change on morbidity are less understood. Using data on emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006 to 2017, we find distinct differences in the temperature-response functions of these health outcomes, influenced by age distribution and underlying causes of morbidity and mortality. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: We project that while future warming will increase ED visits, mortality will decrease due to fewer cold extremes. These results underscore the need to quantify temperature-morbidity responses to fully understand and anticipate the health impacts of climate change and suggest that local declines in mortality due to warming can mask economically meaningful increases in temperature-driven morbidity and health care utilization."

A multitude of plant physiological regulation processes determine the overall drought resistance of ecosystems. So far, these physiological strategies to resist drought are poorly understood at large scales across different ecosystem types because the detection of these physiological regulation processes is mostly limited to in situ measurements on individual plants. In this study, by using high-resolution remote sensing data, we evaluated drought strategies of different ecosystem types throughout Europe by evaluating three key physiological regulation aspects (evapotranspiration, water content, and carbon regulation) based on their associated vegetation attributes. We found that different ecosystem types show divergent responses in these physiological attributes, suggesting different optimization strategies with respect to water saving versus spending, water content stabilizing versus fluctuating, and leaf conserving versus shedding strategies facing drought. These drought strategies from remote sensing provide timely ecosystem response information, facilitating earth system model predictions and aiding the protection against future droughts at large scales."

We identified the decreased mechanical capacity and impaired proliferation of alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells in the inflammatory environment as the primary contributors to respiratory failure of ARDS. A biomimetic, self-adaptive, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone–loaded hollow mesoporous cerium oxide coated with a platelet membrane (HCeOx-D@PM) was developed for precise ARDS therapy. HCeOx-D@PM comprises a platelet membrane (PM) shell for targeted delivery to injured lungs and an HCeOxcore, which enables high drug loading, efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and penetration of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Initially, HCeOx-D@PM suppresses the inflammation and mitigates the adverse effects of lesions on AT2 cell by scavenging accumulated ROS. It then adaptively releases 7,8-dihydroxyflavone in response to cysteine–aspartic acid protease 3 activation, facilitating AT2 cell proliferation and notably improving survival rates in vivo, offering a promising advancement in the precise treatment of respiratory diseases."

To address this challenge, we tested a social drive hypothesis, which predicts that social plasticity and social selection in human groups cause indirect genetic effects that accelerate the adaptation of fitness, promoting population growth via feedback between the environmental causes and evolutionary consequences of cooperation. Using Bayesian multilevel models to analyze fertility data from a small-scale society, we demonstrate that density- and frequency-dependent indirect genetic effects on fitness promote the evolution of cooperation among neighboring women, increasing the rate of contemporary adaptation by ~5×. Our results show how interactions between the genetic and socioecological processes shaping cooperation in reproduction can drive rapid growth and social evolution in human populations."

These skills rely on mapping the infinite space of possible rhythmic sensory inputs onto a finite set of internal rhythm categories. What is the nature of the brain processes underlying rhythm categorization? We used electroencephalography to measure brain activity as human participants listened to a continuum of rhythmic sequences characterized by repeating patterns of two interonset intervals. Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs but, instead, produces categorical representation of rhythms. These neural rhythm categories arise automatically, independent of any motor- or timing-related tasks, yet exhibit strong similarity with categorization observed in overt behavior. Together, these results and methodological advances constitute a critical step toward understanding the biological roots and diversity of musical behaviors across cultures."

Here, we use nonlocal metasurfaces with monoclinic lattices that break mirror symmetry to efficiently achieve circularly polarized thermal emissions with both high temporal and spatial coherence. We design a chiral metasurface based on waveguide arrays with periodically shifted segments that have a saddle-shaped chiral and high-Qdispersion band. The parabolic shape along one direction ensures minimum involvement of spatial/Fourier components at each frequency, thereby achieving circularly polarized thermal emission with high spatial coherence. Meanwhile, the flatband behavior along the other direction allows the use of a slot-shaped spatial filter and a mid-infrared lens to collect emissions from large-area metasurfaces, thus improving power collection efficiency without affecting temporal coherence. Our experiments demonstrate circularly polarized thermal emissions with high temporal coherence (Q> 200) and very large circular dichroism (~0.8)."

We identify 347 straddling stocks across 67 species, including both highly migratory and less mobile species. Our results suggest that regardless of the climate change scenario, at least 37% and 54% of stocks are projected to shift between EEZs and the high seas, by 2030 and 2050, respectively. More stocks are expected to shift toward the high seas, and highly migratory stocks are projected to shift across Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Coastal states and RFMOs require to revise governance frameworks to support sustainable and equitable adaptation to shifting stocks. Developing such strategies requires cooperation between management bodies within EEZs and the high seas."

In a single run, the reactor was typically operated for 10 minutes. The atom efficiency for hydrogen in our approach for methanol synthesis is ~67%. Hydrogen gas is the by-product, produced at a rate of over 2 millimoles per hour.

This breakthrough enables clean, energy-efficient methane conversion without unwanted oxidation by-products, offering substantial environmental and economic benefits beyond combustion."
