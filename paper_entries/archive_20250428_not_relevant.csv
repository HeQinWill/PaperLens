Electrification and energy efficiency retrofits offer a viable decarbonization pathway, especially since half of US homes were built before modern building codes. These older homes are often occupied by low-to-moderate-income (LMI) families. Equitable electrification provides a unique opportunity to considerably reduce emissions in communities where energy bill savings have the most impact on household finances. This study evaluates how the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) impacts the adoption potential of air-source heat pumps (ASHPs), heat pump water heaters and clothes dryers, and electric cooking ranges across income groups in the United States. Using a database that statistically represents the US housing stock, we estimate the indicative adoption potential of these technologies under scenarios that represent Pre-IRA conditions and a reference case with IRA provisions. After IRA rebates were introduced, adoption potential for LMI households more than doubled for ASHPs, heat pump water heaters, and electric cooking ranges and more than tripled for heat pump clothes dryers relative to Pre-IRA adoption potential. Cooking retrofits had the lowest adoption potential, and homes that electrified space heating without weatherization had greater adoption potential than those that underwent basic or enhanced enclosure upgrades. Our results show that the introduction of IRA rebates and a gradually decarbonizing grid substantially improves adoption potential for LMI households and even surpasses the adoption potential of middle and upper-income households."

Internal climate variability combines with the forced global warming response to determine both the magnitude and spatial distribution of these events, and their consequences can propagate from one country to another via many pathways. We examine how exposure to compound climate hazards in one country is transmitted internationally via agricultural trade networks by analyzing a large ensemble of climate model simulations and comprehensive trade data of four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, rice and soya). Combinations of variability-driven climate patterns and existing global agricultural trade give rise to a wide range of possible outcomes in the current climate. In the most extreme simulated year, 20% or more of the caloric supply in nearly one third of the world’s countries are exposed to compound heat and precipitation hazards. Countries with low levels of diversification, both in the number of suppliers and the regional climates of those suppliers, are more likely to import higher fractions of calories (up to 93%) that are exposed to these compound hazards. Understanding how calories exposed to climate hazards are transmitted through agricultural trade networks in the current climate can contribute to improved anticipatory capacity for national governments, international trade policy, and agricultural-sector resilience. Our results highlight the need for concerted effort toward merging cutting-edge seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction with international trade analysis in support of a new era of anticipatory Anthropocene risk management."

However, the role of mid-latitude atmospheric circulation anomalies in resulting winter BKS warming is unclear. This study investigates the relationship between autumn (October–November) East Asian trough (EAT) and the BKS warming in the subsequent winter (December–February) for the period 1979–2022. The result shows that when the autumn EAT weakens, warming, increased moisture, and sea ice loss are observed in the BKS during winter. The weakened EAT promotes increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the mid-latitude North Pacific through increasing solar radiation and reducing cold air activity and positive SST anomalies persist into winter. These continuous warm SSTs from autumn to winter trigger winter Rossby waves downstream, which favors the occurrence of a combination of a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and high pressure over the Ural region, further leading to BKS warming."

The assessment of the modelling tools for blue-green elements (BGEs) documents that currently there is no process-based model for the simultaneous evaluation and optimisation of multiple ecosystem services of BGEs. To evaluate coupling options, this study conducted a meta-analysis on model interoperability by assessing the model scales, drivers, overlaps, gaps, and interfaces of these models for BGEs. Model meta-analysis points out the conceptual and constructual constraints preventing easy model coupling, and thus, an integrated assessment of ecosystem services. Constraints arise due to very different disciplinary approaches from different scientific communities involved in model development, differences in the simulation of transformation and transport processes at urban interfaces relevant for BGEs, and fundamental divergences in spatial and temporal scales and time steps of existing models for single ecosystem services. In particular, the lack of vegetation models tailored for BGEs hinders current model developments towards developing a process-based tool for multiple ecosystem services, which would be able to handle nonstationary climate conditions, including feedback assessments of drought and heatwave impacts on the functioning of BGEs."

At greater levels of wind deployment, the increased likelihood of extended periods of generation surplus and deficit presents a challenge for managing power supply. It is essential to characterise and predict how this energy source performs within India’s monsoon climate to ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system. This study demonstrates, for the first time, how large-scale atmospheric variables are related to seasonal wind energy generation anomalies in India during boreal summer. Furthermore, an operational seasonal forecasting system is shown to skilfully predict the atmospheric predictor variables at a lead time of 1–4 months, indicating an ability to forecast summer wind energy generation at the country and regional level in India. The explanatory power of the chosen atmospheric predictor variables remains high under the near-term planned expansion of the Indian wind fleet. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of seasonal forecast information for electricity system management in India."

We explore the role of Arctic sea ice loss, a key driver of AA, in changing cold temperature extremes across Canada and their impact on human mortality. We use a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations from the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project and a distributed lag nonlinear mortality model in 27 regions covering Canada to quantify the role of Arctic sea ice loss in changing human mortality in the cold season. We find that despite a robust increase in 5th percentile temperatures across eastern Canada, there is no detectable decrease in mortality associated with the most extreme cold, due to mortality in many regions having low sensitivity to warming of cold extremes. The study attributes the temperature-related mortality impact of a physical process, namely Arctic sea ice loss, and highlights Canada’s robust adaptation to extreme cold."

Transport is the only sector with rising emissions, with an increase of 24% compared to 1990. The EU initially aimed to ban new CO2-emitting cars by 2030 but has since delayed this target to 2035, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the push for rapid decarbonisation. The pace of decarbonisation in this sector will either ease or intensify the pressure on other sectors to stay within the EU’s carbon budget. This paper explores the effects of speeding up or slowing down the transition in road transport. We reveal that a slower decarbonisation path not only drives up system costs by 126 billion €/a (6%) but also demands more than a doubling of the CO2 price from 137 to 290 €/t in 2030 to trigger decarbonisation in other sectors. On the flip side, accelerating the shift to cleaner transport proves to be the most cost-effective strategy, giving room for more gradual changes in the heating and industrial sectors, while reducing the reliance on carbon removal in later years. Earlier mandates than currently envisaged by the EU can avoid stranded assets and save up to 43 billion €/a compared to current policies."

Yet, our understanding of the compound impact of soil and environmental factors on SOC gain potential after transitioning to no-till practices is still developing. Using imbalanced machine learning classification, here we quantify key thresholds to hierarchically classify SOC gain potential by switching from conventional tillage to long-term no-tillage with residue retention. Our findings reveal that antecedent SOC level exerts the primary influence, with a reduced gain potential for antecedent SOC exceeding 50 tonnes per hectare. Wet climate (Dryness Index 1.5) and low productivity (net annual primary productivity 5.5 tonnes per hectare) could further lessen the effectiveness of SOC sequestration. These key thresholds identify vast areas across Africa, Australia, South Asia, Southern Europe, and parts of North and South America as high-potential croplands for carbon sequestration and offer guidelines for assessing the reliability of regenerative agriculture in local and regional contexts."

However, many global ET datasets overlook soil moisture constraints, causing large uncertainties. In this study, we developed an improved model that better captures the influence of soil moisture on vegetation and soil evaporation. Our model significantly improves ET estimation accuracy and provides a new long-term global ET dataset to support water cycle and climate research. 
 Accurately quantifying the impact of soil water availability on evapotranspiration (ET) is curcial for improving ET retrieval accuracy. However, most global satellite-derived ET datasets do not explicitly incorporate soil moisture constraints, leading to significant uncertainties, particularly in water-limited regions. In this study, we propose an enhanced soil moisture constraint scheme that effectively captures soil moisture’s influence on vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation using a quantile-based approach. Unlike previous methods, this scheme relies solely on soil moisture data, reducing uncertainties associated with heterogeneous soil hydraulic properties. We integrated this approach into the process-based land surface ET/heat fluxes algorithm (P-LSH, or P-LSHv1), developing an improved version, P-LSHv2. Using observations from 106 global flux towers, we calibrated biome- and climate-specific parameters and quantified moisture constraints across diverse climates and land cover types. P-LSHv2 achieves notable improvements in ET estimation, with a reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.67 mm d-1; and an increased correlation coefficient (R) of 0.81, outperforming its predecessor, P-LSHv1, particularly in arid regions. Comparative analyses show that P-LSHv2 surpasses the Penman-Monteith-Leuning model and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model in capturing soil moisture anomalies' effects on ET, enhancing global ET accuracy. Leveraging the P-LSHv2 algorithm, we have produced a long-term global daily ET dataset spanning 1982–2023, providing a valuable resource for research on terrestrial water and energy cycles and climate change.

Richardson,Tracking vegetation phenology across diverse biomes using Version 3.0 of the PhenoCam Dataset,"Here, we describe the PhenoCam V3.0 public data release. The PhenoCam Network characterizes vegetation phenology in ecosystems across the US and around the world using repeat digital photography. This V3.0 release includes new additions to the data records (e.g., camera NDVI and simplified data sets) and provides >4800 site years of phenological time series and transition dates, a 170% increase relative to the previous data release (V2.0). Over 450 of the time series are 5 y or longer in length. 
 Vegetation phenology plays a significant role in driving seasonal patterns in land-atmosphere interactions and ecosystem productivity, and is a key factor to consider when modeling or investigating ecological and land-surface dynamics. To integrate phenology in ecological research ultimately requires the application of carefully curated and quality controlled phenological datasets that span multiple years and include a wide range of different ecosystems and plant functional types. By using digital cameras to record images of plant canopies every 30 minutes, pixel-level information from the visible red-green-blue color channels can be quantified to evaluate canopy greenness (defined as the green chromatic coordinate, GCC), and how it varies in space and time. These phenological cameras (i.e., “PhenoCams”) offer a pragmatic and effective way to measure and provide phenology data for both research and education. Here, in this dataset descriptor, we present the PhenoCam dataset version 3 (V3.0), providing significant updates relative to prior releases. PhenoCam V3.0 includes 738 unique sites and a total of 4805.5 site years, a 170 % increase relative to PhenoCam V2.0 (1783 site years), with notable expansion of network coverage for evergreen broadleaf forests, understory vegetation, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural systems. Furthermore, in this updated release, we now include a PhenoCam-based estimate of the normalized difference vegetation index (cameraNDVI), calculated from back-to-back visible and visible+near-infrared images acquired from approximately 75 % of cameras in the network, which utilize a sliding infrared cut filter. Both GCC and cameraNDVI showed similar, but somewhat unique, patterns in canopy greenness and VIS vs. NIR reflectance, across various ecosystems, indicating their consistent ability to record phenological variability. However, we did find that at most sites, GCC time series had less variability and fewer outliers, representing a smoother signal of canopy greenness and phenology. Overall, PhenoCam greenness as measured by both GCC and cameraNDVI provides expanded opportunities for studying phenology and tracking ecological changes, with potential applications to the evaluation of satellite data products, earth system and ecosystem modeling, and understanding phenologically mediated ecosystem processes. The PhenoCam V3.0 data release is publicly available for download from the Oak Ridge National Lab Distributed Active Archive Center: the source imagery used to derive phenology information is available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2364 (Ballou et al., 2025), and the summarized phenology data are available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2389 (Zimmerman et al., 2025)."

Conventional remediation agents are often carried away by groundwater flow in high-permeability layers, making it difficult to access NAPL contaminants in low-permeability layers and are prone to generate secondary contamination. This study explores the use of dihydrolevoclucosenone (Cyrene), a bioderived green solvent, as an alternative to traditional remediating agents for NAPL remediation. Through microfluidic experiments and accompanying numerical modeling, we demonstrate that Cyrene enhances the dissolution and mobilization of NAPL contaminants, particularly in low-permeability zones, achieving residual NAPL reductions of up to 80% compared with water and Tween 80 solutions. These findings underscore Cyrene’s dual environmental benefits as an eco-friendly solvent for both treating solid waste (e.g., stalks) and for NAPL remediation, paving the way for sustainable and green solutions in environmental management."

Despite the well-known climate benefits, practical implementation is often hampered by conflicts between environmental goals and farmers’ economic interests. Identifying optimal rewetting locations that maximize greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction while minimizing agricultural disruption is crucial to advancing this process. However, there is currently limited scientific evidence to guide these decisions. To identify “low-hanging fruits”, 12 sites were selected for 4-month incubations to investigate the effects of four land uses (grass-cut, grass-graze, arable, and unmanaged) on CO2 and methane (CH4) emissions postrewetting. Results showed that unmanaged sites exhibited the highest potential for GHG reduction (2015 mg CO2-eq m–2 day–1, 89.9%), followed by grass-graze, grass-cut, and arable sites, reflecting a gradient of management intensity. These insights suggest that prioritizing rewetting of unmanaged areas while delaying interventions on arable lands could yield greater climate benefits and enhance farmers’ acceptance. Additionally, emission variability across sites was linked to soil properties, indicating that soils with a higher organic carbon content (for greater CO2 reduction) and lower bacterial diversity (for reduced CH4 production) offer the greatest GHG reduction potential. This study provides crucial scientific evidence to guide targeted peatland rewetting efforts, supporting net-zero emission goals."

We investigated the photochemical behavior of aqueous-phase cellular organic matter (COM) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from cultured bacteria isolated from atmospheric PM2.5, focusing on their photochemical production of 3C*, 1O2*, and •OH. The molecular size and aromaticity of chromophores and fluorophores in COM and EPS increased with molecular weight (MW). Apparent quantum yields (ΦRI) of up to 10% and 5% were measured for 1O2* and 3C*, respectively, which are in the upper range of previously reported values. This indicated that COM and EPS contain photosensitizers that are highly efficient at producing 1O2* and 3C*. ΦRI and concentrations ([RI]ss) decreased with MW due to higher-MW molecules engaging in charge-transfer interactions that disrupt photochemical processes and oxidant production. Machine learning models were used to understand and predict oxidant production based on measurable optical and chemical properties of COM and EPS.

Among the contaminants of concern are polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), a toxic group of organic pollutants prevalent at high concentrations in bitumen. Here, we quantify PAC concentrations, loads, and yields in four rivers draining watersheds impacted by mining. These rivers also actively erode and incise the bitumen-bearing McMurray Formation, which has complicated previous attempts to distinguish natural from anthropogenic inputs. We collected 998 water quality samples from locations both upstream and downstream of mining, analyzed them for a broad suite of 48 unsubstituted and alkylated PAC homologues, and compared their compositional fingerprints to potential natural and anthropogenic sources. Erosion of bituminous outcrops, rather than industrial pollution, is the main driver behind PAC input and riverine transport, as supported by (i) discrepancies in loads and yields among watersheds with varying levels of industrial development, (ii) responses to hydrologic changes with respect to the distribution of mapped outcrops, and (iii) shifts in PAC relative abundances. This study presents evidence that PAC concentrations are primarily controlled by the presence of eroding bitumen-rich outcrops in conjunction with hydrographic profiles, rather than industrial impacts."

The bottlenecks of current LiMn2O4 (LMO)-based electrodes are their limited Li+ adsorption rate and capacity, caused by disordered electron/ion transport channels and insufficient ion-accessible sites. Inspired by selective ion uptake processes in mangroves, we propose the strategy, fabricating ultrashort, vertically aligned channels for Li+ transport in the electrode to enhance the Li+ selective performance of HCDI. The self-supporting graphene/LMO/bacterial cellulose electrode featuring vertically aligned channels (VGLB) possesses sturdy framework, excellent electrical conductivity, fast electron/ion transport channels, and abundant available Li+ adsorption sites, enabling an ultrahigh Li+ adsorption rate of 2.6 mg g–1 min–1 and capacity up to 33.9 mg g–1 with a high retention of 91.62% after 100 cycles. VGLB also manifests superior selectivity in various simulated salt lake brines with Li+ purity in recovered solution of over 85%. Most importantly, VGLB enables selective Li+ extraction in low-grade brine from Jingbian oil and gas-produced water. We conduct finite element simulations to study the Li+ distribution in the electrode and disclose how the electrode microstructure influences the Li+ extraction performance. This approach put forward an avenue for electrode structure design for efficient Li+ extraction from both salt lakes and low-grade brines with HCDI application."

To better understand climate impacts of forest bioenergy use, we develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the dynamic lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for bioenergy projects using pine pulpwood feedstocks from managed forests in the U.S. South. We apply it in eight different forest basins to determine the carbon payback period and cumulative carbon storage for hypothetical bioenergy projects with 30-year plant operating lives (2030–2060). Variations in local forest types, age class distributions, and traditional wood product market demands result in large differences in carbon payback times between basins. In general, carbon debt repayment is faster for biofuel or bioelectricity projects that employ CCS than those that do not. We find that facilities employing CCS and consuming 3 million green tons of feedstock annually yield carbon payback periods below 10 years if located within pine-dominated coastal plain or gulf coast regions.

The excimer emission was thoroughly characterized via regulating the concentration of the luminophore and the length of the alkyl chain. It was found that the monomer emission and excimer emission could be optionally designed via regulating alkyl chains. Benefiting from the excellent dual-mode emission characteristics, the hypersensitive and ultraselective analysis of perchlorate (ClO4–) in real water samples was performed due to the strong electrostatic interaction between ClO4– and luminophore triggered excimer emission. The limit of detection was down to 21 ng·g–1, which was a magnitude below the limit in drinking water set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (60 ng·g–1). Practical application showed the concentrations of ClO4– in construction wastewater samples were four-folds higher than the local river water.

However, a lack of efficient means and incomplete monitoring data are the main obstacles impeding soil pollution management and prevention in China. Moreover, it is rare to examine the possibility and reliability of using  field-collected earthworms to assess the pollution degree of soil heavy metals in real-world situations at a large field scale. In this study, we investigate the potential use of field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators to assess the pollution characteristics and risks of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cd, and Cr) across three typical regions (Xiaokeng Reservoir, Dabaoshan Mine, and Smelter/Steel Plants) in Shaoguan, one of six trial zones identified for the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China. Our results unveil the existence of significant differences in the spatial distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals in soils and earthworms across these regions. The average contents of Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cr, and Cd in soils were 329.7 ± 476.5, 180.9 ± 262.4, 82.9 ± 197.8, 66.6 ± 61.6, 53.3 ± 53.6, and 7.2 ± 8.2 mg/kg, while those in earthworms were 113.6 ± 112.1, 99.4 ± 106.8, 90.0 ± 126.9, 24.7 ± 30.8, 8.8 ± 9.4, and 5.1 ± 3.4 mg/kg, respectively. The internal exposure dose of heavy metals in earthworms is found to more accurately reflect their bioavailability under true environmental conditions than the external exposure dose in soils. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) exhibited the highest values for Cd (0.01–24.40), followed by those for Pb (0.06–9.94), Cu (0.12–5.23), Cr (0.02–1.90), As (0.02–1.18), and Zn (0.06–1.17). Further principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) classification ascertain that earthworms are more capable of differentiating heavy metal pollution in different regions than soil alone.

As a substitute for PFOS, sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS) is extensively utilized in various applications and detected in human blood. However, its potential health risk in AS remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the comparative impacts of PFOS and OBS on endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. In the in vivo study, Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE–/–) mice were exposed to 0.4 or 4 mg/L PFOS/OBS for 12 weeks. We found that dyslipidemia developed more rapidly in the OBS-exposed mice than in the PFOS-exposed mice. PFOS exhibited a higher enrichment capacity in both blood and aortic tissues than OBS. Remarkably, OBS induced a more pronounced inflammatory response and caused a more significant disruption of the endothelial barrier in the aorta of ApoE–/– mice compared to PFOS. In vitro experiments showed that OBS, at the same exposure concentrations and durations as PFOS (0.1–20 μmol/L, 48 h), more effectively inhibited cell viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), caused higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and enhanced cell adhesion between HUVECs and monocytes. Both PFOS and OBS were found to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulate the expression of inflammatory factors. Notably, the use of OBS, but not PFOS, was shown to disrupt cell junctions and increase endothelial permeability by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.

In the quantitative real-time PCR experiments, the DON group showed significant difference compared to the control group (* p < 0.05) and the DON-OG group (# p < 0.05) regarding cytokine levels such as IL-10, TNF-α, Il6, Il1b, Ccl2, Il12α, Nos2, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2. In the animal experiment, C57BL/6 mice were utilized to monitor body weight, the presence of bloody stools, and diarrhea. Additionally, the colonic tissues of the mice underwent pathological analysis. The results indicated that cells treated with both DON and OG displayed lower levels of inflammation compared to those treated with DON alone. Furthermore, proteomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that the regulation of the Lancl2 protein and the mTOR signaling pathway contributed to the milder inflammatory response observed in the DON-OG group. These findings were further corroborated by the pathological analysis of the colonic tissues from the mice. In the combined exposure of DON and OG, OG partially mitigated the intestinal inflammation induced by DON."

Despite the low mortality observed, immunosuppressed animals infected with A. thermomutatus and R. mucilaginosa exhibited fluctuations in body mass and induced changes in the neuropsychiatric state of the mice. Fungi were recovered from the lungs, spleen, blood, and brain of infected mice at densities similar to but slightly lower than the inoculum up to 5 days post-inoculation. A. thermomutatus infection induced an inflammatory process in the lungs of infected BALB/c mice. In the target organs of animals infected with R. mucilaginosa, a notable fungal load was detected in the brains of infected animals. These results suggest that viable isolates of fungi such as A. thermomutatus and R. mucilaginosa originating from Antarctic permafrost, which is exposed to increasing melt caused by rising temperatures in the region, may present significant pathogenic potential. This highlights that climate change in Antarctica may facilitate the release and dispersal of fungi and other pathogenic microorganisms capable of infecting humans and animals."

This study examined the 2022–2023 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) season in a contiguous metropolitan area connected by an active international land border, affording an opportunity for comparison of the respiratory virus season spanning two independent public health jurisdictions. Time-lagged cross correlation and qualitative examination of the wastewater signals showed that the peak of the Detroit (MI, USA) RSV season predated the peak in Windsor (ON, Canada) by approximately 5 weeks. A strong positive relationship was observed between RSV N-gene concentrations in wastewater and hospitalization rates in Windsor-Essex (Kendall’s τ = 0.539, p ≤ 0.001, Spearman’s ρ = 0.713, p ≤ 0.001) as well as Detroit (Kendall’s τ = 0.739, p ≤ 0.001, Spearman’s ρ = 0.888, p ≤  0.001). This study demonstrated that wastewater surveillance can reveal regional differences in infection dynamics between communities and can provide an independent measure of the prevalence of RSV, an underreported disease. These findings support the use of wastewater surveillance as a cost-effective tool in monitoring of RSV to enhance existing surveillance systems and to better inform public health disease mitigation strategies."

Because of such facts in conjunction with its low biodegradation rate and high potential of long-distance atmospheric transport, the presence and accumulation of HFPO–DA have been ubiquitously detected in environmental media and biological species, including animals and human beings, posing alarming and urgent needs for the risk assessment of HFPO–DA.

Among them, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium (M8OI) has been detected at high concentrations in soils and exhibits hepatotoxic properties. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this toxicity, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed, coupled with benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, to derive transcriptomic points-of-departure (tPOD) through dose–response analysis. The transcriptomic analysis identified 425, 667, and 567 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low (10 μmol/L), medium (50 μmol/L), and high (200 μmol/L) doses of M8OI exposure, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed significant perturbations in pathways related to cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling. BMD modeling yielded tPOD values of 1.51 μmol/L (median of the 20 most sensitive genes, omicBMD20), 2.98 μmol/L (tenth percentile of all genes, omicBMD10th), 6.83 μmol/L (mode of the first peak of all gene BMDs, omicBMDmode), and 5.9 μmol/L for pathway-level analysis. These transcriptomics-derived tPODs were at least 105-fold lower than M8OI’s hepatotoxic concentration, as indicated by its EC50 of 723.6 μmol/L in HepG2 cells. Functional analysis of the transcriptomic data identified legionellosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer as the most sensitive pathways affected by M8OI. These findings highlight the molecular mechanisms driving M8OI-induced hepatotoxicity and underscore the utility of transcriptomics in deriving sensitive and quantitative toxicity thresholds. The results provide critical insights for guideline-driven toxicological evaluations and regulatory decision-making, supporting a more comprehensive assessment of IL safety."

 Deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining is currently in the exploration phase with some groups proposing a move towards extraction within years1. Management of this industry requires evidence of the long-term effects on deep-sea ecosystems2, but the ability of seafloor ecosystems to recover from impacts over decadal scales is poorly understood3. Here we show that, four decades after a test mining experiment that removed nodules, the biological impacts in many groups of organisms are persistent, although populations of several organisms, including sediment macrofauna, mobile deposit feeders and even large-sized sessile fauna, have begun to re-establish despite persistent physical changes at the seafloor. We also reveal that areas affected by plumes from this small-scale test have limited detectable residual sedimentation impacts with some biological assemblages similar in abundance compared to control areas after 44 years. Although some aspects of the modern collector design may cause reduced physical impact compared to this test mining experiment, our results show that mining impacts in the abyssal ocean will be persistent over at least decadal timeframes and communities will remain altered in directly disturbed areas, despite some recolonisation. The long-term effects seen in our study provide critical data for effective management of mining activities, if they occur, including minimising direct impacts and setting aside an effective network of protected areas4,5."

 Aquatic vegetation contributes to lake methane emissions, but changes in aquatic vegetation in northern (>40° N) lakes remain unknown, hindering evaluations of its importance in estimating lake emissions. Here we use Landsat imagery to monitor aquatic vegetation (mainly emergent and floating vegetation) in 2.7 million northern lakes from 1984 to 2021. Vegetation was observed in 1.2 million lakes, with a total maximum vegetation area of 12.0 × 104 km2, a mean vegetation occurrence of 1.68 ± 3.8% and a greenness of 0.66 ± 0.05. From the 1980s–1990s to 2010s, significant (P < 0.05) increases in maximum vegetation area (+2.3 × 104 km2) and vegetation occurrence (+73.7%) were observed and 72.5% of lakes experienced higher greenness. Vegetation expansion was affected by the temperature in sparsely populated regions, whereas lake area and fertilizer usage played vital roles in densely populated areas. The methane emission estimate that includes contributions from both aquatic vegetation and open water (1.31 [0.73, 1.89] Tg CH4 yr−1) is 13% higher than that calculated for open water (1.16 [0.63, 1.68] Tg CH4 yr−1). The long-term net increase in total methane emissions including aquatic vegetation is 125% higher than that of open water due to vegetation expansion. This highlights the necessity of incorporating aquatic vegetation in estimates of methane emissions from northern lakes.

 Flow laws for ice predict rates of deformation (strain) and are fundamental to modelling glacier and ice-sheet dynamics. Here we apply Bayesian inference to laboratory measurements accumulated over 70 years to constrain flow laws for ice-sheet modelling. At low strains, commonly used flow laws—derived from individual experimental datasets with narrow stress, temperature and grain-size ranges—fail to capture the full complexity of ice behaviour. We show that a multicomponent flow law that sums strain rates from different deformation mechanisms is needed to capture grain-size and temperature sensitivities observed in the full set of experiments. This multicomponent flow law is applicable to natural scenarios where the anisotropy of ice is weak or where the deformation kinematics differ from those that formed the crystallographic preferred orientation, making the ice more viscous. Low-strain flow laws, including this multicomponent flow law, have limited validity at high strain, where viscosity evolves and anisotropy develops, making ice less viscous. A one-component, grain-size insensitive flow law gives a reasonable fit to high-strain experimental data and is better suited to modelling the large-scale flow behaviour of ice sheets. Experimentally constrained flow laws predict ice-sheet strain rates that differ by an order of magnitude from estimates made using previous flow laws, highlighting the need for accurate flow laws in ice-sheet modelling."

 Continental cratons are characterized by thick lithospheric roots that remain intact for billions of years. However, some cratonic roots appear to have been thinned or completely removed in the geological past. The mechanisms for thinning have been difficult to distinguish for these past events. Here we present a full-waveform seismic tomographic model for North America that allows the resolution of fine-scale structures and reveals an extensive craton-thinning event that is ongoing. The seismic images show extensive drip-like features that suggest the transport of lithospheric materials from the base of the craton beneath the central United States to the mantle transition zone, and thus active lithospheric thinning. Geodynamic modelling suggests that the dripping may be mobilized by large-scale mantle flow induced by the sinking of the Farallon slab that is currently in the lower mantle. Dripping lithosphere could be further facilitated by prior lithospheric weakening, for example by volatiles released from the slab. Our seismological observations of active extensive thinning of cratonic lithosphere support lithospheric removal could be a result of external mantle processes, which we hypothesize may include the deep mantle effects of subduction. Drip-like features imaged in a seismic tomography model are consistent with extensive ongoing thinning of cratonic lithosphere beneath North America."

Here the authors find that light snowfall and snow melting processes drive this mismatch and use these relationships to constrain future projections of snow water resources. 
 Although Earth system models (ESMs) tend to overestimate historical land surface warming, they also overestimate snow amounts in the Northern Hemisphere. By combining ground-based datasets and ESMs, we find that this paradoxical phenomenon is predominantly driven by an overestimation of light snowfall frequency. Using spatially distributed emergent constraints, we show that this paradox persists in mid- (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100) projections, affecting more than half of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface. ESMs underestimate the frequency of freezing days by 12–19% and overestimate snow water equivalent by 28–34%. Constrained projections indicate that the raw ESM outputs overestimate future Northern Hemisphere snowmelt water by 12–16% across 53–60% of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface. This snowmelt water overprediction implies that the amount of water available in the future for agriculture, industry, ecosystems and domestic use may be lower than unadjusted ESM projections suggest.

 Active chlorine, including HClO and ClO−, is one of the most extensively used disinfectants. However, it is mainly produced through energy-consuming three-step chlor-alkali electrolysis of saturated brine using Cl2 gases as intermediates. Here we report a photoelectrochemical synthetic pathway from natural seawater using a chloride-mediated NbClOx/BiVO4 photoanode. The photoanode presents an onset potential of 0.6 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and over 500 h of stability in seawater under one sun illumination. The faradaic efficiency and selectivity of hypochlorite are close to 100% at 1.2–1.8 VRHE with a yield of 119.9 ± 9 μmol cm−2 h−1 at 1.72 VRHE. Meanwhile, value-added products of Mg(OH)2 and CaCO3 are obtained on the cathode, accompanied by hydrogen production. Further analyses show that the present process reduces electricity consumption by 77.16% and CO2 emissions by 75.31%.

 Public concern over global climate change and biodiversity loss has accelerated international efforts to restore natural ecosystems through nature-based solutions. Rewilding is a growing conservation approach encompassing the recovery of ecological and trophic complexity through interventions such as habitat restoration and/or species reintroduction. Here we explore the nascent efforts of marine rewilding using a systems thinking methodology to inform a systematic review and iterative thematic analysis. Marine rewilding involves a diverse range of interventions, showing similarities in ecological principles with terrestrial rewilding, yet it diverges from terrestrial rewilding in the scale of initiatives, predictability of outcomes, and the prominence of social inclusion. To make progress in offering unifying concepts, we propose a definition for marine rewilding: a systemic process requiring deliberate human intervention that involves community participation and ocean stewardship to regenerate degraded marine ecosystems.

 Representative non-exhaust emissions from automobiles and tire-wear particles (TWPs) accumulate in road dust, causing their dispersion into the surrounding environment. TWPs undergo fragmentation due to continuous abrasion and weathering, resulting in the release of carbon black (CB), a major component of tire rubber. Although previous studies have conducted mass flow analyses (MFAs) for TWPs based on vehicle and road types, a detailed MFA specifically addressing road dust, including CB-bound TWPs, has not been performed. In this study, annual emissions of TWPs, including CB, from road dust were estimated based on different vehicle and road types. Mass flow diagrams were constructed to illustrate the distribution of these particles across technical and environmental compartments for each road type. The environmental mass of TWPs, including CB, in each compartment was calculated based on sewage system type, runoff ratio, road cleaning efficacy, and UV exposure. The MFA results indicate that highways contribute significantly to TWP exposure in soil and air, despite a substantial portion of TWPs also accumulating as road residue. Additionally, the endpoint mass flow of the environmental media (4241 t/a to air, 3140 t/a to water bodies, 20,602 t/a to soil, 3044 t/a to landfill, and 12,712 t/a to road residue) and the predicted environmental concentration values (1.16 μg/m3 in air, 0.37 mg/L in water, and 1824 mg/kg in soil) were consistent with literature ranges, supporting the reliability of the findings.

 The heavy class imbalance problem and the multi-source observations fusion remain challenges for lightning nowcasting based on deep learning method. To address the problems, this paper proposes a novel lightning augmented recurrent nowcasting (LARN) model which trained with a two-step training approach. The first training stage is designed as a lightning augmented pretraining (LAP) module based on self-supervised learning method, which can focus on the critical lightning events to solve the heavy class imbalance problem. The second training stage is designed as a multi-modal data fusion module (MDF), which can effectively fuse lightning, radar and satellite observations to nowcasting lightning. The results of experimental evaluations demonstrate the performance of LARN model outperforms the existing nowcasting models with lead times for up to 90 min. The ablation study shows that the two training stages cooperate well, with the LAP module improving the hit rate and the MDF module reducing the false alarm rate. For the radar and satellite modalities, the vertically integrated liquid (VIL) exhibits the most informative power for lightning nowcasting, followed by 10.7 μm brightness temperatures (IR107) and then 6.9 μm brightness temperatures (IR069). Case studies show that the LARN model can better predict the lightning evolution under different type of thunderstorms. Since the LARN model can reflect the lightning distribution in the reality scenes without adopting under-sampling strategy and subjective loss function design, therefore it can apply to different lightning datasets."

 Atmospheric deposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is not routinely measured in existing observation networks worldwide. This paucity of measurements prevents the comprehensive assessment of the global DOC budget in the atmosphere and is currently a barrier to understanding the vital role of the airborne DOC input to soil and water. In this study, 172 observations of atmospheric DOC deposition at the global scale published between 1985 and 2024 were compiled. Overall, the global geometric mean DOC concentration and flux were 2.03 ± 2.12 mg C L−1 and 18 kg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively, with a global budget of approximately 460 Tg C yr−1. While these values are comparable to those reported in previous global-scale studies, they differ across regions. Spatially, the DOC deposition fluxes observed in Africa, Central America, and South America were 2–7 times greater than those reported in North America, Europe, and Asia, which conforms with the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation in these regions, especially for an annual precipitation greater than 1400 mm. When the annual precipitation is less than 1400 mm, the spatial distribution of atmospheric DOC deposition is also influenced by emissions. Owing to the substantial decline in emissions, atmospheric DOC deposition has declined in North America, Asia, and especially in China over the past 10 years."

 This study focuses on heat waves (HWs) variability over South Asia (SA) influenced by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during 1950–2023. The influence factor and driving mechanism for HWs variability over SA in the El Niño and La Niña years are discussed. We observe positive composite anomalies of HWs events and frequency over the north-western region of SA in La Niña years but negative composite anomalies in El Niño years. In La Niña years, outgoing long-wave radiation (total cloud cover) over the north-western region of SA has positive (negative) anomalies. Thus, less cloud cover regions allow more solar radiation to increase the surface temperature and HWs. During La Niña years, positive composite anomalies of HWs over the north-western region of SA are mainly due to positive anomalies of outgoing long wave radiation, negative anomalies of total cloud cover, positive anomalies of soil temperature level 1, negative anomalies of relative humidity, positive anomalies of short-wave radiation and negative anomalies of long-wave radiation. However, during El Niño years, negative composite anomalies of HWs over the north-western region of SA are due to negative anomalies of outgoing long wave radiation, positive anomalies of total cloud cover, and negative anomalies of direct solar radiation. During El Niño years, vertical-latitude cross-section and vertical-longitude cross-section analysis show significant positive anomalies of air temperature, positive anomalies of vertical velocity, negative anomalies of relative humidity, and positive anomalies of geopotential height; support increases in the HWs over the southern and central -eastern region of SA.

 The evaluation of precipitation events is crucial for predicting severe droughts and floods, particularly in the context of global warming. This study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the global precipitation concentration index (CI) from 1950 to 2020, comparing CI with nine extreme precipitation indices to assess its applicability. The world map was divided into three distinct regions related to flood-drought events using the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Key findings include: 1) CI exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, with elevated values in seasonally warm coastlines and arid regions. Seasonal changes in CI were not synchronized, particularly lower in Northern Hemisphere winters, while the Southern Hemisphere displayed minor seasonal variation, alongside a long-term growth trend in approximately 36.5 % of the global area. 2) CI's spatiotemporal variations helped delineating regional precipitation patterns, revealing a strong correlation (R2 = 0.87) with the extreme precipitation index R95c, but a negligible relationship with total precipitation (P) (R2 = -0.05). This facilitated the global partitioning into three regions: Humidity Amplification Region (I), Dryness Intensification Region (II), and Climate Fluctuation Region (III). 3) Flood-drought events were potentially linked to variations in CI and P, where In Region I experienced increased flood risk due to rising CI and P, Region II faced heightened drought risk from rising CI and declining P, and Region III showed opposing effects on floods due to reduced CI and increased P, with P variability significantly influencing flood frequency. 4) The main atmospheric circulation factors varied by region, typically including the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO), with AAO being most significant. This study highlights the potential of CI in improving the prediction of drought and flood risks, emphasizing the need for enhanced regional data and dynamic modeling to better assess the impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns and hydrological extremes."

Although multiple genetic and pharmacological manipulations are known to extend longevity in model organisms, aging is a complex trait, and targeting one’s own genes may be insufficient to prevent age-dependent deterioration. An alternative strategy could be to use enzymes from other species to reverse age-associated metabolic changes. In this review, we discuss a set of enzymes from lower organisms that have been shown to affect various metabolic parameters linked to age-related processes. These enzymes include modulators of steady-state levels of amino acids (METase, ASNase, and ADI), NADPH/NADP+and/or reduced form of coenzyme Q (CoQH2)/CoQ redox potentials (NDI1, AOX,LbNOX, TPNOX,EcSTH, RquA, LOXCAT, Grubraw, and ScURA), GSH (StGshF), mitochondrial membrane potential (mtON and mito-dR), or reactive oxygen species (DAAO and KillerRed-SOD1).

However, safe, low-cost, multifunctional micromanipulation for operating bio-objects across scales and modalities remains inaccessible.

The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters.

Recently, single-atom-thick gold sheets, termed goldene, was reported. Here, we ask if goldene can be extended to include multiple layers. The answer is yes, and trilayer goldene is the magic number, for reasons of electronegativity. Experiments are made to synthesize the atomically laminated phase Ti4Au3C3through substitutional intercalation of Si layers in Ti4SiC3for Au. Density functional theory calculations suggest that it is energetically favorable to insert three layers of Au into Ti4SiC3, compared to inserting a monolayer, a bilayer, or more than three layers. Isolated trilayer goldene sheets, ~100 nanometers wide and 6.7 angstroms thick, were obtained by chemically etching the Ti4C3layers from Ti4Au3C3templates.

When salt water overlays permafrost, Rayleigh-Darcy (R-D) instability emerges because of the density mismatch and regulates melting (thawing) dynamics. Contrary to expectations that a higher Rayleigh number (R) would amplify instability, our experiments revealed fingering and stable melting fronts at low and highR, respectively. We attribute the occurrence of the two melting patterns to the interplay between two competing flow structures: local circumfluence modulated by front perturbation and transversal chaotic mixing. We propose theories that rationalize the melting pattern transition and finger-scale evolution. In addition, the classic mass transport theory for R-D convection drastically underestimates the melting rate and misses key variable(s). The presence of fingering patterns and accelerated dynamics may have led to earlier penetration of the permafrost layer than previously anticipated. These findings have implications for understanding similar processes in magma migration, carbon sequestration, and subsurface energy recovery."

The textures span several nanometers and encompass many hundred spins; they are created and interrogated without manipulating the nuclear spins individually. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-engineered Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field: The texture is therefore metastable and robust against spin diffusion.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, subhertz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the SNSPD’s straight segments with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current crowding–free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: After irradiation with 800 ions nm−2, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37%, while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently.

Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)–specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections. These findings identify a phenomenon in contemporary FLUBV that may help explain the recent disappearance of the Yamagata lineage from circulation, highlighting the crucial role of targeting NA in vaccination strategies to enhance cross-lineage FLUBV protection."

Specifically, we report a “nonlocal” pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe2, several microns away from the illumination spot. We identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart.

Here, we uncover a unique form of motion camouflage, showing that broadclub cuttlefish pass dark stripes downward across their head and arms to disguise their hunting maneuvers. This “passing-stripe” display reduces the probability of response to predatory expanding stimuli by prey crabs in a lab-based experiment, is modulated according to approach speed during a hunt, and generates a motion pattern that is different from that of looming predators.

Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9–inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes."

Most patients suffer from a risk of difficult-to-cure as well as severe systemic toxicity when receiving standard chemotherapies. As hyaluronic acid (HA) is a specific ligand of CD44 highly expressed by LSCs, we had HA self-assembled with cisplatin and daunorubicin to form a dual chemodrug nanogel (HA/Cis/Dau) to afford the targeted therapeutic interventions of rrAML. HA/Cis/Dau displayed an extra therapeutic function of inducing the granulocyte-monocyte differentiation in CD44+rrAML cells, an rrAML mouse model, and primary blasts isolated from patients with AML. Unlike free drugs directly diffusing and killing rrAML cells, HA/Cis/Dau transported the drugs into lysosomes, causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, ROS accumulation, and thus a metabolic reprogramming of the rrAML cells. Moreover, HA/Cis/Dau was featured with alleviated side effects, ease of preparation, and cost effectiveness, therefore holding great promises for the targeted treatment of rrAML."

To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS.

Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) with [6,6-2H2]glucose is nonradioactive, achieves tumor metabolic contrast, but can be improved by enriched contrast from deuterated water (HDO) based imaging.

Cells must deform the large nucleus to fit through constricting channels. To understand the role of the nuclear lamina in limiting cell migration through constrictions, we imaged it in cells migrating through periodic constricting channels in a microdevice. The lamina underwent cycles of wrinkling and smoothing as the nucleus changed from an irregular, rounded shape in the wide channel regions between constrictions to a smooth, hourglass shape as the nucleus passed through the center of a constriction. The laminar surface area of nuclei within constrictions was measured to be at or above the computationally predicted threshold area for the nuclear volume. The channels excluded control nuclei that had insufficient excess surface area, but not nuclei lacking lamin A/C. Thus, the excess surface area of the nuclear lamina enables cell migration through constricting channels."

Understanding physical differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin is crucial, yet specific labeling methods in living cells remain limited. Here, we have developed replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling to mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this approach, we investigated local nucleosome motion in the four known chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, of living human and mouse cells. The more euchromatic (earlier-replicated) and more heterochromatic (later-replicated) regions exhibit greater and lesser nucleosome motions, respectively. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, although the replication timing is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier-replicated regions have more accessibility, and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing."

We reviewed peer-reviewed articles reporting original data that were published between 1997 and March 2022 on the following physical treatment technologies: roughing filters, storage reservoirs, bank filtration, conventional and high-rate clarification, dissolved air flotation, lime softening, granular media filtration, slow sand filtration, precoat filtration, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, ceramic membrane filtration, and soil aquifer treatment. The literature search was conducted in several databases including Web of Science and PubMed. Data from 165 articles were included in the analysis and used to calculate Log Reduction Values (LRVs) for each technology by microbial contaminant type (bacteria, virus, or protozoa). The quantity and quality of data ranged widely for each technology. We found granular media, membranes (microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO)), and precoat filtration to remove the most protozoa with average LRVs of 3.0 (95% CI 2.8–3.3), 5.7 (95% CI 5.4–6.0), and 4.4 (95% CI 4.1–4.7), respectively. Bacteria was removed most effectively by membrane filtration (MF, UF, RO) with average LRVs of 4.5 (95% CI 3.9–5.1) and moderately by dissolved air flotation, lime softening, and soil aquifer treatment with average LRVs of 2.7, 2.6, and 2.4 respectively. Viruses were removed most effectively by reverse osmosis membrane filtration with an average LRV of 4.9 (95% CI 4.0–5.7). This data provides valuable information on pathogen reduction and areas of needed research. The variation in results underscores the importance of further consideration when selecting technologies to use and the need for standardized reporting in both lab and field studies. It is important to consider variables in water quality and technology operation that may impact treatment effectiveness when selecting treatment options for use. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts to revise the WHO’s GDWQ, offering updated insights into LRVs for different water treatment technologies."

Although sunlight-induced photoreductive dissolution of ferrihydrite via ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) has been extensively studied, its potential impacts on mineralogical transformation and environmental behaviors of coexisting contaminants remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of environmental parameters (e.g., solution pH, pO2 level, arsenic speciation, and content) on ferrihydrite transformation with the representative DOM-oxalate under simulated solar irradiation. Results showed that the oxalate-mediated LMCT process synchronously initiated Fe(II) production and proton consumption, the latter of which facilitated interfacial electron transfer and atom exchange (IET-AEFh-Fe2+) processes among ferrihydrite and newly formed Fe(II). At pH 5.0–8.0, ferrihydrite was prone to transform into goethite due to sufficient Fe(II) (approximately 80–2700 μM) from LMCToxa and enough affinity of Fe(II) with mineral to trigger IET-AEFh-Fe2+, while it only underwent reductive dissolution at pH 3.0–5.0 or kept a quasi-steady state over pH 8.0. Increasing the pO2 level and arsenic content hampered the recrystallization of ferrihydrite by reducing Fe(II) duration or altering the surface property of ferrihydrite, whereas the presence of As(III/V) also led to the formation of lepidocrocite with As(V) being more prominent. Additionally, chemical extraction and As K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy revealed that As was consecutively incorporated into the structures of goethite and lepidocrocite in the form of As(V) regardless of primary As speciation.

With the objective of devising chemical design strategies, we initially explored the structure–activity relationship (SAR) and structure–toxicity relationship (STR) of isothiazolinones. By comparing the antimicrobial activities of commercial isothiazolinone analogues, chlorine substitutions were identified as key determinants of pathogen growth inhibition potency. The variability of reproductive endocrine-disrupting toxicity was primarily driven by the length of the alkyl carbon chain, based on interactions with molecular initiating events and disturbances in sex hormones. Inspired by the SAR and STR guidelines, two new isothiazolinones (i.e., Target 1 and Target 2) were designed and synthesized. Compared to the commercial analogue dichloro-octylisothiazolinone, Target 1, which has a shorter alkyl chain and the same chlorine count, demonstrated slightly stronger antimicrobial activity, significantly lower endocrine-disrupting toxicity, and longer environmental persistence. Meanwhile, Target 2, containing ether bonds within a shorter alkyl chain and the same chlorine count, exhibited weaker antimicrobial activity, significantly lower endocrine-disrupting toxicity, and slightly longer environmental persistence.

Given its stable presence in aquatic environments, long-term exposure of wild fish may pose a risk to offspring embryonic development. This study demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish to environmental concentrations of difenoconazole throughout their life cycle resulted in abnormal development of offspring embryos/larvae, including decreased heart rate, delayed hatching, increased malformation rate, shortened body length, and increased mortality. These changes were significantly correlated with the affected apoptosis, autophagy, energy metabolism and MAPK signaling pathways in F1 generation. This transgenerational toxic effect results from epigenetic alterations in gametes, impaired nutrient supply from the ovum, and maternal transfer of difenoconazole. After exposure to difenoconazole, the development of female fish offspring was affected more than that of male fish offspring, which was mainly caused by the impaired nutrient supply from the ovum and the maternal transfer of difenoconazole. Because this transgenerational developmental toxicity was observed at environmental levels, difenoconazole may pose a threat to the survival of wild larvae and therefore a risk to wild fish populations."

However, to date, the effects of terrestrial organic matter (OM) input and degradation on CH4 emissions from large reservoirs remain largely unknown. From May 2020 to April 2021, we conducted monthly sampling campaigns at 100 sites in Lake Qiandao (580 km2), a mega-reservoir in China, and made monthly vertical profile observations from March to September 2023. We estimated an annual mean FCH4 flux of 0.26 g C m–2 yr–1 (1.51 × 108 g C yr–1). Elevated FCH4 and enriched δ13C-CH4 coincided with low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, high levels of organic suspended solids, terrestrial organic matter, nutrients, depleted δ18O-H2O, and low carbon isotope fractionation (αC) in the inflowing lake regions. Dissolved CH4 (cCH4) correlated positively to the relative abundance of aliphatic compounds. Anoxic bioincubation experiments revealed rapid degradation of riverine organic matter, accompanied by a 56-fold increase in cCH4, δ13C-CH4 enrichment (to −32.25‰), and a significant decrease in αC to 1.02. These findings indicate that acetoclastic CH4 production makes a substantial contribution to cCH4 and thus FCH4. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we conclude that input of terrestrial organic matter and its subsequent degradation lead to DO depletion, and their OM degradation byproducts serve as carbon substrates that promote CH4 emissions."

During this process, cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA) is regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme. However, the precise electron transfer mechanism between CDs and NrfA remains unclear. Herein, a hybrid photosynthetic system composed of NrfA and redox CDs (NrfA/R-CDs) was constructed, achieving a maximum NH3 production rate of 12.5 ± 1.1 μmol (NH3)·mg–1 (NrfA)·h–1. R-CDs with aromatic ketone groups could store photoinduced electrons, enhancing carrier separation efficiency. These stored photoelectrons were capable of being directly transferred to NrfA without the need of cofactors. Even under dark conditions, direct electron transfer occurred from the stored photoelectrons in R-CDs to NrfA, providing an indirect illumination approach to reduce phototoxicity to NrfA. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated the formation of a stable complex between the heme 2 region of NrfA and R-CDs. The short distance (10 Å) and π-electronic interactions between R-CDs and heme 2 facilitated the direct electronic transfer process.

However, the effectiveness of NBs under various operational conditions, including varying PFAS concentrations, pH levels, and the presence of coexisting ions, has remained insufficiently explored. A deeper understanding of these interfacial interactions is crucial to optimizing and maximizing the efficiency of NBs in PFAS removal. This study aims to bridge these knowledge gaps by systematically exploring the role of NBs in augmenting the adsorption of legacy PFAS on various carbon-based adsorbents, including granular activated carbon (GAC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene. Our experimental results demonstrated a significant improvement in PFAS adsorption on carbon-based adsorbents in the presence of NBs, with the enhancement effect particularly pronounced at a high initial PFAS concentration (50 mg L–1). Acidic conditions notably facilitated PFAS removal in the NB-assisted carbon adsorption system, aligning well with the predictions from the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Furthermore, ionic strength was found to play a critical role, with lower levels stabilizing NBs and promoting interactions with adsorbent surfaces, while higher levels reduced the effectiveness of NBs. Additionally, multivalent cations (particularly Fe3+) showed a substantially greater enhancement in PFAS removal efficiency compared to Na+ and Ca2+.

The present study intends to elucidate the behavior of arsenic in Fe-SOM-As composites formed through adsorption or coprecipitation under redox conditions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that crystalline minerals were generated during Fe-HA-As coprecipitation, while other composites exhibited an amorphous structure. In an anoxic environment, iron-reducing bacteria reduced Fe(III) and As(V) to Fe(II) and As(III), respectively, enhancing the mobility of arsenic. The presence of SOM increased the concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and As(III) through complexation. Notably, elevated As(III) and reduced Fe(II) were observed in the HA-containing coprecipitation group due to the weak adsorption capacity of crystalline minerals, which released As(V) into solution and competed with Fe(III) for electrons. Under oxic conditions, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical (•OH) were formed through the oxidation of Fe(II) and reduced SOM. As(III) was subsequently oxidized by superoxide and •OH, and the process was dominated by •OH. Substantial •OH in the HA-containing coprecipitation group mainly oxidized dissolved As(III), while limited •OH in other groups contributed greater to adsorbed As(III).

In this study, we investigated the effects of NMP size, concentration, and diatom supply on the production and settling of fecal pellets by the marine copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris. By employing an aggregation-induced emission fluorescence imaging technique, we visualized the distribution of NMPs in fecal pellets, measured their size and production rate, and developed a fluid dynamic model to simulate the settling process of fecal pellets in the water column. Our results indicated that NPs and MPs exhibited uniform and nonuniform distributions in the produced fecal materials, respectively. NMPs reduced both the size and integrity of copepod fecal pellets. Copepods ingested MPs in the absence of diatoms, but exposure to 5000 μg/L of NMPs decreased the fecal pellet production by 52% in the presence of diatoms due to feeding selectivity. The sinking rates of fecal pellets of varying sizes, as obtained from modeling simulations, ranged from 10.9 to 103.1 m/day.

We examined the longitudinal microbiota data from mother–infant dyads and demonstrated that maternal trace element exposure played a pivotal role in shaping the composition and similarity of the mother–infant gut microbiota. Specifically, serum levels of cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rubidium (Rb) were identified to cause further fluctuation in the shift of the maternal gut microbiota. Antibiotic usage shortly before or on the delivery day, as well as maternal zinc (Zn) exposure, affected the gut microbiota similarity within mother–infant dyads.

In situ export is best represented by a combination of GA export (proportional to modeled zooplankton) and export derived from ocean color (related to local phytoplankton). Both products also correlate with a long‐term time series of abyssal carbon flux.

Owing to the complexity of the climate system, the variability in US winter (DJF) precipitation response to ENSO is investigated. By regressing autoencoder neural network‐based ENSO types (i.e., encoded tropical Pacific Sea surface temperature anomaly patterns) onto DJF US precipitation, supplemented with support vector regression and extreme gradient‐boosting regression, we show that ENSO modulation of precipitation is regionally sensitive to the ENSO type. Certain regions exhibit significant nonlinear relationships between precipitation and strong ENSO event phase that was most pronounced over the eastern and northwestern quadrants of the US. The coherency of the response varies among individual events. Specifically, among individual events, differences in ENSO SST anomaly patterns were linked to meridional shifts in the positioning of the Pacific jet stream. This leads to variable anomalous upper‐level flow and atmospheric conditions influencing US winter precipitation during the ENSO events. By analyzing associations between DJF precipitation and ENSO types whilst assessing the consistency of precipitation anomalies during strong ENSO events, we identify the regional likelihood of consistent precipitation responses, thereby calibrating confidence in seasonal ENSO‐precipitation responses."

We further demonstrate that the models that more accurately represent the relationship between ETM and ΔT (referred to as “Good ETM models”) are those in which ΔT is less influenced by the preceding winter Niño3.4 sea‐surface temperature anomalies (N34DJF) and largely influenced by phases of ETM. Additionally, these models better capture the 2–7‐year spectral peak observed in N34DJF. On the contrary, Bad ETM models are characterized by a dominant higher‐frequency, 2–3‐year quasi‐biennial peak. Consequently, Good ETM models render ENSO states that align more closely with observations compared with Bad ETM models. This study underscores, through CMIP6 models, the significance of boreal winter ENSO amplitude in influencing how extratropical climate affects the seasonal transitions of ENSO."

The ice core was analyzed to investigate the relationship between sea salt aerosols (SSAs), sea ice dynamics, and atmospheric circulation. The first component of Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis (32SC REOF1), which explains 58% of the variance in the ice core ions, serves as a proxy for SSAs. Time series correlation analysis reveals that sea ice had a minimal impact on 32SC REOF1. Instead, it showed a significant correlation with winter meridional atmospheric transport from the Southern Indian Ocean to PEL. The sea salt records exhibit a significant increase from the period 1616–1850 to 1851–2016 CE, with the mean value increasing by a factor of 2.4. This centennial‐scale trend is likely linked to shifts in the position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds (SHWW). During the earlier period (1616–1850 CE), which was likely characterized by a colder climate, the SHWW in the Southern Indian Ocean sector may have shifted equatorward and weakened in intensity, potentially leading to reduced cyclone frequency and a subsequent decline in SSAs transport to high latitudes. In contrast, the period 1851–2016 CE, which is likely warmer, saw the SHWW shifted poleward, enhancing meridional wind speeds and increasing SSAs transport. Comparisons with other Antarctic ice core records suggest that the centennial‐scale shift in the SHWW is a regional phenomenon, particularly pronounced in the Southern Indian Ocean."

Here, the authors show that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior tail of the striatum encode a prediction error signal important for driving associative fear learning. 
 Learning by experience that certain cues in the environment predict danger is crucial for survival. How dopamine (DA) circuits drive this form of associative learning is not fully understood. Here, in male mice, we demonstrate that DA neurons projecting to a unique subregion of the dorsal striatum, the posterior tail of the striatum (TS), encode a prediction error (PE) signal during associative fear learning. These DA neurons are necessary specifically during acquisition of fear learning, but not once the fear memory is formed, and are not required for forming cue-reward associations. Notably, temporally-precise inhibition or excitation of DA terminals in TS impairs or enhances fear learning, respectively. Furthermore, neuronal activity in TS is crucial for the acquisition of associative fear learning and learning-induced activity patterns in TS critically depend on DA input. Together, our results reveal that DA PE signaling in a non-canonical nigrostriatal circuit is important for driving associative fear learning.

 Winter atmospheric rivers (ARs) are crucial for water supply and extreme weather events over the western (WUS) and eastern US (EUS), yet their long-term trends and interplay remain unclear. Here we fill this gap by analyzing multiple observational AR products over the past four decades. Contrasting yet interrelated trends emerge in AR frequency, intensity, and associated mean precipitation. A decline in AR activity over WUS contributes to a drying trend, while notable increases over EUS foster a wetter climate. These trends are driven by large-scale atmospheric and oceanic variability in the Pacific, which strengthens anticyclonic circulation patterns near both coasts. These anticyclonic patterns, however, have opposing effects–impeding ARs from steering to WUS while facilitating their development over EUS. Our findings present a unified explanation for the observed AR trends and have co-beneficial implications for mitigating concerns related to AR-induced extreme events across both densely populated coastal regions."

 The long-term global cooling of the Late Cretaceous was interrupted by an intense warming period at ~69 Ma known as the mid-Maastrichtian event. The underlying mechanisms of this climatic event and associated change in the global carbon cycle are, however, strongly debated, including a possible major reorganization of deep-ocean circulation patterns. How this reorganization co-varied with climate shifts and global carbon cycling is not known, mainly due to the lack of high-resolution studies. Here, we present new high-resolution stable isotope, Mg/Ca-derived bottom-water temperature, and CaCO3 wt% records from IODP Site U1403 (North Atlantic) to reconstruct the climatic and oceanographic processes associated with the mid-Maastrichtian event. We observe a very dynamic and vigorous deep-ocean circulation that is characterized by precession-paced fluctuations that are proposed to reflect the interplay of different bottom-water source regions. Our results further point towards Large Igneous Province volcanism as a trigger not only for the mid-Maastrichtian event but also for the observed change in deep-water circulation. A clear shift towards the dominance of Northern Component Water bathing the North Atlantic at around 68 Ma signals the end of low-latitude waters in the North Atlantic, a bottom-water source that characterized the Cretaceous oceans for tens of millions of years.

 Fuels are a large source of uncertainty in fire emissions estimates due to variability in the physical and chemical properties of fuels and how they are represented. These uncertainties can be addressed using imaging spectroscopy and lidar data, that provide observations of the chemical and physical traits and spatial distribution of vegetation. Combined with ground fuel measurements, these data provide information on fuel distribution and quantity important for mapping and modeling fire effects. In this study, we present a methodology to develop models and continuous maps of pre-fire fuel characteristics for use in fire emissions modeling. We first addressed any spatial gaps over fire areas for Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) chemical trait data using Random Forests regression and for derived fractional cover. We used the AVIRIS fractional cover and chemical traits or AVIRIS estimates alongside lidar, multispectral, and topographic variables to build fuel characteristic models informed by ground measurements with partial least squares regression. We derived maps of predictive uncertainty alongside a suite of uncertainty statistics for each fuel characteristic that inform the use of fuels data within fire effects models.

 This study provides satellite and proximal hyperspectral analyses of lithium (Li)-bearing volcano-sedimentary environments aimed at determining the target absorption features of alteration assemblages to be used as exploration vectors towards analogous Li-mineralized systems.The study was applied at the McDermitt caldera (USA), which hosts volcano-sedimentary Li mineralization in the form of clay minerals originated from the alteration of glass-rich extrusive igneous rocks in endorheic lacustrine basins. The surface-exposed areas of the caldera were investigated using satellite hyperspectral imagery acquired by the German Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) mission. Satellite data were validated via ground spectroscopy, performed through hyperspectral imaging, complemented by mineralogical and geochemical analyses on specimens deriving from the Jindalee McDermitt Li deposit.The Li mineralization in the Jindalee McDermitt deposit is dominated by a Mg(Li)-smectite (hectorite) + amorphous silica assemblage, showing absorption features at 2306 nm and 2200 nm that can be detected in the spectral range covered by the EnMAP sensor. The analysis of the corresponding hyperspectral feature distribution maps and the comparison with ground control samples, confirmed that the above features together can be effectively used as mineralogical-hyperspectral vectors for Li-prospective areas on a caldera-scale.

Results of this test show that the distinctive 2200 + 2306 nm bands association is lacking at the High Rock caldera complex, which suggests that this spectral footprint can be employed as a mappable criteria to target lacustrine sequences with mineralogical features analogous to those of Li-mineralized volcano-sedimentary deposits."

 Increasing frequency and severity of drought events impact global and domestic agricultural productivity. Monitoring drought in agricultural fields with remote sensing can provide faster, lower-cost decision management support for critical field management activities. We evaluated the application of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emitted at red (SIFRed) and far-red (SIFFarRed) wavelengths in comparison with chlorophyll- and xanthophyll-sensitive reflectance-based remote sensing indices (NDVI, NIRV, NIRVP and PRI) for drought stress monitoring at the canopy scale. To do so, we evaluated impacts of drought stress on two soybean varieties with similar phenology but contrasting affinities for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which can provide host plants with extended access to water and nutrients in exchange for carbohydrates. Drought response physiology of the two genotypes was further explored using leaf level photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, water potential and phenology. We observed distinct responses, with the low-affinity genotype exhibiting lower SIFRed and more negative midday leaf water potential, as well as reduced growth and development rate compared with the high-affinity genotype. SIFFarRed and NIRVP exhibited the strongest correlation with canopy photosynthesis followed by NIRV.

 The distribution of Arctic sea ice is an important direct indicator of climate change, and spaceborne optical remote sensing represents one primary technique for sea ice monitoring due to its high spatiotemporal resolution and wide swath coverage. However, this process is often impeded by heavy cloud cover, which shares similar visual and spectral features with sea ice. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel methodological framework for discriminating between sea ice and different cloud types (cirrus and cumulus) via the ultraviolet–visible-infrared observations from China’s Haiyang-1C/D (HY-1C/D) satellites, and the ultraviolet (UV) data from the onboard Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) are used to study sea ice and clouds over the Chukchi Sea for the first time. The spectral properties are characterized by the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (ρTOA) in both UV and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths. This indicates that the 355 nm UV band has the optimal sensitivity to the presence of sea ice and clouds, with cirrus clouds composed of high-altitude ice crystals exhibiting extremely high UV reflectivity. A hybrid threshold is subsequently determined to separate sea ice and cloud pixels. In comparison to the MODIS MOD29 sea ice product, which masks cloud pixels with brightness temperature (BT) differences, this algorithm can effectively reduce the misclassification resulting from surface temperature inversions in polar regions. The ice/cloud identification results have been further applied to sea ice concentration (SIC) estimation, and extensive trials of this UV-based ice/cloud detection approach in the Arctic Passages demonstrates its potential applicability."

 Driven by urban expansion and economic growth, China has carried out extensive coastal reclamation in the past four decades, leading to negative ecological impacts. Accurate mapping of reclamation dynamics helps analyze its environmental effects and supports the government in regulating reclamation projects. Nevertheless, existing methods for monitoring coastal reclamation dynamics face two major limitations: overestimating reclamation areas and low temporal accuracy. This study proposes a novel method to automatically distinguish artificial reclamation from natural expansion to reduce the overestimation of reclaimed areas and improve temporal dynamic accuracy through time-series analysis of long-term Landsat satellite imagery. In China’s coastal regions, our method achieves an overall classification accuracy of over 94 % for artificial reclamation and natural expansion. The estimation accuracies of the year of reclamation are 91.60 % (one-year tolerance) and 96.44 % (two-year tolerance), which are more accurate than the post-classification comparison method based on the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset. From 1990 to 2022, China’s coastal reclamation totaled 5,121.1 km2, with a slowdown after 2014 and a shift toward green development after 2018. Reclamation patterns varied regionally, with most projects concentrated in economically developed bays, driven primarily by urbanization and industrialization. The results prove that the proposed method can improve the spatiotemporal accuracy of coastal reclamation mapping, hence providing a more reliable data foundation for project siting, ecological impact assessment, and coastal management."

 El Niño event usually intensifies Hadley Circulation (HC), meanwhile reducing its meridional extension. From a global perspective, the width change of HC is associated with the meridional movement of baroclinic instability and eddy activities over the subtropics. However, these hypotheses may not work for regional HC. In this study, we construct the three-dimensional structure of HC and investigate the El Niño-related regional HC variability, focusing on the meridional extension. El Niño is associated with an expansion of HC over the central-eastern Pacific but a contraction over the west. Unlike the global HC, the strengthening (weakening) of regional HC usually coincides with an expansion (contraction). Nevertheless, the “narrow” equatorial intensification over the eastern Pacific and the “widespread” subtropical weakening over the Indo-Western Pacific of regional HC collectively form a strengthening and contraction of global HC. This spatial pattern of regional HC intensity changes is tightly associated with the ENSO-related precipitation and sea surface temperature (SST) gradient anomalies. Our result has broad implications for global climate predictability, highlighting the importance of a better understanding of the interactions between the regional HC and tropical/subtropical climate variabilities."

Advanced control systems based on different device physics are essential for the advancement of sophisticated robotic vehicles and miniature mobile robots. Here, we present a nanoelectronics-enabled analog control system mimicking conventional controllers’ dynamic responses for real-time robotic controls, substantially reducing training cost, power consumption, and footprint. This system uses a reservoir computing network with interconnected memristive channels made from layered semiconductors. The network’s nonlinear switching and short-term memory characteristics effectively map input sensory signals to high-dimensional data spaces, enabling the generation of motor control signals with a simply trained readout layer. This approach minimizes software and analog-to-digital conversions, enhancing energy and resource efficiency. We demonstrate this system with two control tasks: rover target tracking and drone lever balancing, achieving similar performance to traditional controllers with ~10-microwatt power consumption.

Here, we report a remarkable finding of compressed H2-molecular–type hydride CaH14exhibiting an unusual transition temperature (Tc) of 204.0 kelvin. The peculiarity of its electronic structure lies in the pronounced emergence of near-free electrons, which manifest metallic bonding, but molecular hydrogen fragments persist. This finding indicates that the necessary condition for superconducting transition is forming the Fermi sea with Cooper pairs rather than the monatomic hydrogen. Notably, the formation mechanism of free electrons can be effectively explained by the finite-depth potential wells model. Intriguingly, this H2-molecular–type hydride can downgrade the required pressure to 80 gigapascal while maintaining a highTcof 84 kelvin, well above the liquid-nitrogen temperature.

However, the self-purification process of the contaminants by pyrite after their migration from surface water to groundwater has been neglected. This process is accompanied by a decrease in pollutant concentration with a transition from aerobic to anaerobic environments. Here, we selected sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a micropollutant frequently detected in groundwater, as a modeled micropollutant for the investigation. The findings indicate that pyrite could degrade micropollutants SMX (20 μg/L) by self-activation with nearly 100% degradation efficiency under anaerobic conditions. It was also found that •OH was not the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS), but rather the longer-lived and more stable Fe(IV) generated by •OHad-mediated oxidation of structural Fe(III). Additionally, SMX can be degraded by outer-sphere electron transfer with dissolved Fe3+ in the system. Whereas, the reduction product Fe2+ facilitates the supply of electrons to pyrite and promotes the production of Fe (IV). The contributions of Fe(IV) and outer-sphere electron transfer to SMX degradation were 67.5% and 32.5%, respectively. Furthermore, pyrite self-activation exhibited selective oxidation of electron-rich pollutants under anaerobic conditions.

Vapor pressure deficit is the difference between saturation vapor pressure (es) and actual vapor pressure (ea). Because es increases nonlinearly with temperature, calculations of time‐averaged VPD vary depending on the frequency of temperature measurements and how ea is calculated, potentially limiting our understanding of fire‐climate relationships. We calculate eight versions of monthly VPD across the WUS and assess their differences. Monthly VPDs calculated from daily data are 2%–6% higher, and more accurate, than when calculated from monthly data. Using daily maximum and minimum temperature, instead of mean, increases VPD by ∼20%, but can overestimate true values depending on how ea is calculated. These differences do not meaningfully impact correlations with annual wildfire area, however, suggesting our understanding of historical fire‐VPD relations is not very sensitive to how VPD is calculated."

We demonstrate that bulk strain rate is the dominant factor controlling stress amplification. High strain rates of 10−10–10−12 s−1 cause stresses on the 102–103–MPa level within 100–102 years, while lower strain rates are insufficient to generate the stresses required for lower‐crustal earthquakes.

 Sedimentary pyrite iron and sulphur isotope compositions (δ56FePYR, δ34SPYR, Δ33SPYR) are commonly used to reconstruct global ocean properties and the evolving oxidation state of Earth’s surface, motivating exploration of impacts of diagenesis on pyrite-based proxies. Along with auxiliary petrographic and porewater data, we present coupled microscale δ56FePYR-δ34SPYR-Δ33SPYR in accumulating sediments on the oxic margin of the Black Sea. The coevolution of microscale δ56FePYR-δ34SPYR-Δ33SPYR distributions provides insight into porewater S species production, consumption, and buildup on pyritization pathways. “Early” pyrite is characterized by low δ56FePYR and δ34SPYR values consistent with microbially-mediated iron and sulphate reduction and iron (oxyhydr)oxide sulphidization at low sulphide-to-iron ratios. In contrast, “sulphidic zone” pyrite displays distinct late-stage morphologies and higher δ56FePYR and δ34SPYR, which reflect sulphide accumulation at the sulphate-methane transition zone and direct sulphidization of residual iron phases. We propose that coupled δ56FePYR-δ34SPYR-Δ33SPYR distributions constrain pyritization pathways and microbial and physico-chemical aspects of the depositional environment.

 With the intensification of climate change and human activities, water resource shortages, floods, and water quality anomalies are becoming increasingly serious. It is urgent to ensure the effective realization of water resource management, flood monitoring, and water quality assessment through fine-scale monitoring of water body spatial distribution and dynamics. Currently, various technologies have been applied to water information monitoring, with remote sensing-based spectral index methods being widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, and large-scale observation capabilities. However, the wide variety of existing water spectral indices, each suited to different scenarios and objectives, makes it challenging for ordinary users to select the most appropriate index and determine its optimal usage (i.e., threshold settings). This study addresses these challenges by evaluating the performance and applicability of 15 widely used water detection indices, using Sentinel-2 imagery across 14 representative global regions. The results revealed that the performance of water indices varied across different scenarios. Common issues include misidentification in high-reflectance backgrounds (e.g., buildings and snow), low-reflectance backgrounds (e.g., shadows), and omission errors for water bodies with high chlorophyll content. On this basis, this study provides a recommended table for water body index selection in different scenarios and a recommended range table for index thresholds, and point out key directions for future development of water body indices. This study offers valuable guidance for the selection and use of water body indices in practical application, helping to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fine-scale monitoring of water bodies."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are byproducts of combustion processes and can undergo photooxidation in cloud water upon being emitted into the atmosphere. Quinones are among the products formed from the photochemical aging of PAHs and can undergo subsequent reactions to form environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study showed that 9,10-anthraquinone (9,10-ANTQ), 1,4-anthraquinone (1,4-ANTQ), and 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NAPQ) undergo different pathways when forming ROS. Singlet oxygen (1O2), which was monitored during the photoaging of these quinones, formed logarithmically over time in low yields (0.5 ± 0.1 μM M−1 to 1.6 ± 0.1 μM M−1) with 9,10-ANTQ and 1,4-ANTQ. However, with 1,4-NAPQ, it formed rapidly within the first 5 min, reaching high yields of 21 ± 7 μM M−1, before undergoing decay. This work suggests that 9,10-ANTQ can behave as a photocatalyst to continuously generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the atmosphere; however, it will more likely exist in its triplet state (39,10-ANTQ∗) as an EPFR. Contrarily, 1,4-ANTQ and 1,4-NAPQ will photodegrade into other products that generate ROS. Among these products is juglone, which was shown to generate •OH exponentially upon photoaging as well as degrade into other products. The varying photochemical behaviors between these different quinones help explain the overall photochemistry of combustion-derived particles, which catalytically generated 1O2 and •OH in this study. This work provides insight into the environmental fates of combustion-derived material and their oxidized derivatives and shows the potential of these compounds to generate excess atmospheric ROS."

This can lead to welfare-optimal climate policies in integrated assessment models (IAMs) that recommend very slow emissions reductions over the coming decades, in sharp contrast with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. These econometric models assume that weather impacting a single country is all that affects the economy of that country. We examine whether the addition of global weather conditions in the empirical modelling of economic growth affects the projections of the impact of climate change on global gross domestic product (GDP). In effect, we explore whether the interconnectedness of the global economy makes individual countries vulnerable to weather changes that impact other countries. Using three influential econometric models we add global weather to the regressions. We find that this leads to significant worsening of the projections of macroeconomic damage for given future emissions scenarios. Damage to world GDP in 2100 under SSP5-8.5, averaged across both econometric models and climate models increases from ∼11% under models without global weather to ∼40% if global weather is included. Further, we demonstrate that when the damage function used in a recent IAM is estimated from empirical models augmented with global weather conditions, they reduce the welfare-optimal amount of climate change from ∼2.7 C to ∼1.7 C which is consistent with the Paris Agreement targets. Our results highlight the need for econometric modelling and climate science’s understanding of extreme events to be integrated much more consistently to ensure the costs of climate change are not underestimated."

We find that although system costs slightly increase (less than 1%) under deep decarbonization in China, climate and health benefits are substantial. We further investigate the role of three important emission mitigation technologies (nuclear, offshore wind, and carbon capture and storage) in power system deep decarbonization. Our analysis shows that none of these technologies would significantly affect future system costs but they influence both the quantity and location of renewable energy installations and the expansion of China’s transmission network.

They are used worldwide to help assess the trace gas exchange, critical to understanding climate change. However, their physical framework interferes with the flow they measure. We present a new way of correcting measurements from sonic anemometers of several types. The method uses measurements of vertical wind velocity and other turbulent velocities, compares their ratios, and from this yields correction factors for sonic anemometers. 
 Non-orthogonal sonic anemometers are used extensively in flux networks and biomicrometeorological research. Previous studies have hypothesized potential underestimation of the vertical velocity turbulent perturbations, necessitating correction to increase flux measurements by approximately 10 %, while some studies have refuted that any correction is needed. Those studies have used cross-comparisons between sonic anemometers and numerical simulations. Here we propose a method that yields a correction factor for vertical velocity that requires only a single sonic anemometer in situ but requires some assumptions and adequate fetch at a sufficient distance above roughness elements where surface similarity is valid. Correction factors could be important in adjusting flux network and other flux data, as well as assessing the energy budget closure that is used as one of the flux data quality measures. The correction factor is confirmed in one field experiment and comparison between a CSAT3 and RMY 81000VRE, but it does not work well for the more complex form factors shown in a field comparison of an IRGAson and a CSAT3a."

The distinction between these processes can be achieved using lidar or spectral techniques, as demonstrated in the case studies. The capability of the new method to identify rimed particles and aggregates without differentiating them can simplify statistical work. 
 Advancing the understanding of mixed-phase cloud microphysical growth processes requires a thorough detection of the transition processes from pristine hydrometeor states toward aggregates, rimed particles and graupel. In this study,  a versatile combination of techniques is applied to detect and characterize aggregated and strongly rimed hydrometeors even under adverse atmospheric conditions, such as the presence of orographic gravity waves. This approach combines dual-frequency observations from vertical-stare Doppler cloud radars and measurements from a polarimetric scanning cloud radar. The core of the approach is to use profiles of the vertical distribution of particle shape (VDPS) method that serve as a proxy for identifying the presence of oblate, isometric or prolate cloud particles. At height levels within the VDPS-based shape profiles where isometric particles are identified, Doppler spectra and dual-wavelength vertical-stare cloud radar observations are used to discriminate between the occurrence of aggregation and graupel formation.The underlying dataset was acquired in the framework of the 3-year field experiment Dynamics, Aerosol, Cloud and Precipitation Observations in the Pristine Environment of the Southern Ocean (DACAPO-PESO) at the southern hemispheric midlatitude site of Punta Arenas, Chile (53° S, 71° W). The frequent presence of layers of supercooled liquid water and the permanent occurrence of orographic gravity waves motivate a strong interest to understand the formation of precipitation and the role of aggregation and riming at this site. Therefore, two case studies representing both processes, strong riming events and aggregation, from the DACAPO-PESO campaign are presented to demonstrate the potential of combining the new VDPS retrieval with spectral methods, which analyze particle fall velocity and the coexistence of multiple particle types. We found that the identification of layers of supercooled liquid water is essential to pin down regions of riming in the observed cloud systems. In consequence, considering the general notion of the excess of liquid water in clouds over the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, our study serves as a preliminary investigation into the occurrence of riming and aggregation processes above Punta Arenas."

 Sediments provide valuable information for geologists and geophysicists whenever they strive to understand, and reproduce, the geological evolution, lithology, rock properties, seismic response, and geohazards of a region. The analysis of sedimentary sequences is thus useful for the interpretation of depositional environments, sea-level change, climate change, and recognition of the sediments' source areas. By integrating sedimentary data into geophysical modeling, such interpretations are improved in terms of their accuracy and reliability. To further help our understanding of the Iberian Peninsula's geological evolution, geological resources, and geohazards, this work presents to the scientific community the SedDARE-IB data repository. This repository includes available data on the depth to the Base of the Cenozoic and Top of the Paleozoic stratigraphic markers for the Iberian Peninsula, the surrounding West Iberian Atlantic Margin and Western Mediterranean Neogene basins, or the acoustic basement as interpreted for the Valencia Trough and Alboran Mediterranean basins. As an example of the broad applicability of the data included in SedDARE-IB, we investigate how sediment thickness affects the depth to the 150 °C isotherm in specific basins, as commonly used in geothermal exploration. The calculated trend suggests that, given constant measured surface heat flow and thermal conductivity, the 150 °C isotherm becomes shallower as the sediment thickness increases, until a critical threshold value is reached for the latter.

RF-temporal reconstructs temporal trends from 61 fossil pollen records across the Tibetan Plateau, while RF-spatial interpolates site-based cover, producing a dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° and a temporal resolution of 400 years. The dataset provides estimates of vegetation cover, along with standard errors, for three vegetation types (vegetation, woody plant, and herbaceous plant). To illustrate, we present the temporal trends and spatial distribution of vegetation cover for these vegetation types, comparing them with the vegetation cover used in ESMs. We further discuss the dataset’s reliability and applications, along with the discrepancies between our reconstructed results and those used in ESMs, highlighting possible reasons for these differences."

Here, we employed comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) to analyze the molecular compositions of organics in CPM from typical ultralow emission coal-fired power plants and iron and steel sintering plants in China. We established a nontargeted screening approach to obtain molecular fingerprints of these organics, identifying more than 180 and 200 compounds from over 1000 peaks from the two types of plants.

The assessments of extreme events often rely on percentile‐based indices using a 30‐year baseline period. In China, the Blue Book on Climate Change has traditionally been based on the 1981–2010 baseline period, and it began to use the 1991–2020 baseline period since 2024. However, the impact of baseline changes on assessing extremes in China remains unclear. This study examines how baseline period updates influence the detection of long‐term climate change in China, particularly in estimating the Time of Emergence (ToE) for climate change signals. The results show that for temperature extremes, updating the baseline period leads to more (10%∼38%) cold extremes identified by 10th percentile indices and fewer (−32%∼−11%) warm extremes identified by 90th percentile indices across China. It slows the increase in identified warm extremes and accelerates the decrease in cold extremes. It delays the ToE for warm events and advances the ToE for cold events. For precipitation extremes, the update leads to fewer (−12%∼−1%) but more intense (at most 4%) extreme precipitation events identified by 95th and 99th percentile indices across China with slower increases in frequency and faster rises in intensity. The baseline period update advances the ToE for extreme precipitation intensity and delays it for frequency. The update of the baseline significantly affects the assessment of changes in climate extremes in China due to the background warming and wetting in 1991–2020 compared to 1981–2010."

Such movement of different branches of jets are referred as the wavier jets that can be maintained by the negative phase of East Atlantic‐Europe Pacific teleconnection (−EAUP), which might be associated with the positive phase of the Victoria mode over the North Pacific, the tripole sea surface temperature mode over the North Atlantic, and the reduction of sea ice concentration over Arctic. This study has emphasized the role of the heterogeneous variations of PJ and SJ playing on boreal summer quadrupolar rainfall changes in eastern China during the AA period."

E. Roelvink;G. Masselink;C. Stokes;R. T. McCall,Climate Adaptation for a Natural Atoll Island in the Maldives ‐ Predicting the Long‐Term Morphological Response of Coral Islands to Sea Level Rise and the Effect of Hazard Mitigation Strategies,"Coral atoll islands, common in (sub)tropical oceans, consist of low‐lying accumulations of carbonate sediment produced by fringing coral reef systems and are of great socio‐economic and ecological importance. Previous studies have predicted that many atoll islands will become uninhabitable before the end of this century due to sea level rise exacerbating wave‐driven flooding. However, the assumption that such islands are morphologically static has been challenged by observations and modeling that show the potential for overwashing and sediment deposition to maintain island freeboard. Reliable long‐term predictions of island change and future flood risk, essential for adaptation planning, are, however, lacking. Here, we adopt a novel, efficient approach for modeling the long‐term island response and illustrate the morphological response of an atoll island to future sea level rise and the effect of various adaptation measures. We demonstrate that wave‐driven sediment deposition increases island (beach) crest freeboard. We find that the assumption of static island morphology leads to a significant increase in the predicted frequency of future island flooding compared to morphodynamically active islands. Reef adaptation measures were shown to modify the inshore wave energy, influencing the equilibrium island crest height and therefore the long‐term morphological response of the island, while beach restoration mainly delays the island's response. Accounting for long‐term natural island dynamics, including the morphodynamic feedback from adaptation measures, offers more realistic projections of future flood risk compared to current static island model predictions. These local projections of island response can serve as decision support tools for climate adaptation."

The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) uses an ensemble modeling approach to fill this crucial gap. Yet FishMIP does not have a standardised skill assessment framework to quantify the ability of member models to reproduce past observations and to guide model improvement. In this study, we apply a comprehensive model skill assessment framework to a subset of global FishMIP models that produce historical fisheries catches. We consider a suite of metrics and assess their utility in illustrating the models' ability to reproduce observed fisheries catches. Our findings reveal improvement in model performance at both global and regional (Large Marine Ecosystem) scales from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 simulation rounds. Our analysis underscores the importance of employing easily interpretable, relative skill metrics to estimate the capability of models to capture temporal variations, alongside absolute error measures to characterize shifts in the magnitude of these variations between models and across simulation rounds. The skill assessment framework developed and tested here provides a first objective assessment and a baseline of the FishMIP ensemble's skill in reproducing historical catch at the global and regional scale. This assessment can be further improved and systematically applied to test the reliability of FishMIP models across the whole model ensemble from future simulation rounds and include more variables like fish biomass or production."

 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, whether in warm or cold phases, that persist for two or more consecutive years (multi-year), are relatively rare. Compared with single-year events, they create cumulative impacts and are linked to extended periods of extreme weather worldwide. Here we combine central Pacific fossil coral oxygen isotope reconstructions with a multimodel ensemble of transient Holocene global climate simulations to investigate the multi-year ENSO evolution during the Holocene (beginning ~11,700 years ago), when the global climate was relatively stable and driven mainly by seasonal insolation. We find that, over the past ~7,000 years, in proxies the ratio of multi-year to single-year ENSO events increased by a factor of 5, associated with a longer ENSO period (from 3.5 to 4.1 years). This change is verified qualitatively by a subset of model simulations with a more realistic representation of ENSO periodicity. More frequent multi-year ENSO events and prolonged ENSO periods are being caused by a shallower thermocline and stronger upper-ocean stratification in the Tropical Eastern Pacific in the present day. The sensitivity of the ENSO duration to orbital forcing signals the urgency of minimizing other anthropogenic influence that may accelerate this long-term trend towards more persistent ENSO damages.

 Catalytic methods to couple alkynes and alkenes are highly valuable in synthetic chemistry. The cobalt-catalyzed intermolecular reductive coupling of alkenes and alkynes is particularly attractive due to the unique reactivity and cost-effectiveness of cobalt catalysts. However, the enantioselective transformations of this kind are less developed. The limited successful enantioselective examples are restricted to the use of electronically biased activated olefins as the coupling partners. Herein, we report an asymmetric desymmetric reductive coupling of electronically unbiased succinimide-containing cyclobutenes with alkynes to synthesize enantioenriched, synthetically important vinyl cyclobutanes via photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. Excellent enantioselectivities, good diastereoselectivities and regioselectivities are obtained. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that Hantzsch ester is a better reducing reagent when used in combination with Et3N.

 Millennial-scale variations in the strength and position of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current exert considerable influence on the global meridional overturning circulation and the ocean carbon cycle. The mechanistic understanding of these variations is still incomplete, partly due to the scarcity of sediment records covering multiple glacial-interglacial cycles with millennial-scale resolution. Here, we present high-resolution current strength and sea surface temperature records covering the past 790,000 years from the Cape Horn Current as part of the subantarctic Antarctic Circumpolar Current system, flowing along the Chilean margin. Both temperature and current velocity data document persistent millennial-scale climate variability throughout the last eight glacial periods with stronger current flow and warmer sea surface temperatures coinciding with Antarctic warm intervals. These Southern Hemisphere changes are linked to North Atlantic millennial-scale climate fluctuations, plausibly involving changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. The variations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current system are associated with atmospheric CO2 changes, suggesting a mechanistic link through the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.

Here, the authors show that pathogenic Shigella flexneri can use its effector IpaH1.4 to directly target and subvert RNF213 to evade host antibacterial immunity. 
 Ubiquitination plays vital roles in modulating pathogen-host cell interactions. RNF213, a E3 ligase, can catalyze the ubiquitination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is crucial for antibacterial immunity in mammals. Shigella flexneri, an LPS-containing pathogenic bacterium, has developed mechanisms to evade host antibacterial defenses during infection. However, the precise strategies by which S. flexneri circumvents RNF213-mediated antibacterial immunity remain poorly understood. Here, through comprehensive biochemical, structural and cellular analyses, we reveal that the E3 effector IpaH1.4 of S. flexneri can directly target human RNF213 via a specific interaction between the IpaH1.4 LRR domain and the RING domain of RNF213, and mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RNF213 in cells. Furthermore, we determine the cryo-EM structure of human RNF213 and the crystal structure of the IpaH1.4 LRR/RNF213 RING complex, elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the specific recognition of RNF213 by IpaH1.4. Finally, our cell based functional assays demonstrate that the targeting of host RNF213 by IpaH1.4 promotes S. flexneri proliferation within infected cells. In summary, our work uncovers an unprecedented strategy employed by S. flexneri to subvert the key host immune factor RNF213, thereby facilitating bacterial proliferation during invasion.

 The global outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV), combined with the termination of smallpox vaccination and the lack of specific antiviral treatments, raises increasing concerns. The surface proteins M1R and B6R of MPXV are crucial for virus transmission and serve as key targets for vaccine development. In this study, a panel of human antibodies targeting M1R and B6R is isolated from a human antibody library using phage display technology. Among these antibodies, A138 against M1R and B026 against B6R show the most potent broad-spectrum neutralizing activities against MPXV and Vaccinia virus (VACV). When used in combination, A138 and B026 exhibit complementary neutralizing activity against both viruses in vitro. X-ray crystallography reveales that A138 binds to the loop regions of M1R, similar to the vulnerable epitope of 7D11 on VACV L1R. By contrast, A129 targets a more cryptic epitope, primarily comprising the β-strands of M1R. Moreover, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of A138 or B026 alone provides partial protection, while combining these two antibodies results in enhanced protection against VACV in male C57BL/6 mice.

 Allogeneic transplantation of CCR5 null hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the only known cure for HIV-1 infection. However, this treatment is limited because of the rarity of CCR5-null matched donors, the morbidities associated with allogeneic transplantation, and the prevalence of HIV-1 strains resistant to CCR5 knockout (KO) alone. Here, we propose a one-time therapy through autologous transplantation of HSPCs genetically engineered ex vivo to produce both CCR5 KO cells and long-term secretion of potent HIV-1 inhibiting antibodies from B cell progeny.

 Reduced snow cover is becoming increasingly common in the Arctic-Boreal region under amplified warming, complicating efforts to isolate its specific impacts on plant productivity during the subsequent snow-free seasons. Here, we compiled a multi-source remote sensing dataset to disentangle the effects of warming-independent reduced snow cover across the northern permafrost region over the past 30 years. In years with shortened snow cover duration but normal climate conditions, gross primary productivity increased by a rate of 1.48 g C m−2 for every 10-day shortened snow cover duration and normalized difference vegetation index of 0.0024 in regions with increased soil temperature compared to the long-term mean. This productivity boost was primarily driven by shortened snow cover duration and early snowmelt, which enhanced soil heat uptake, accelerated permafrost thaw, and improved plant water and nutrient availability, thereby advancing spring greening. This study offers valuable insights into Arctic-Boreal climate feedback under a warming climate.

 Accurate estimation of terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) is essential for refining global carbon budgets. Current large-scale TER models rely on empirical structures derived from site-scale observations, often driven solely by hydrothermal factors. However, incorporating ecosystem-scale information is critical for more accurate large-scale TER modeling. Such ecosystem-scale variables have not been well parameterized, since the mechanisms by which they affect TER remain unclear. To address this gap, here we developed a Causality constrained Interpretable Machine Learning model for TER estimation (named “CIML-TER”) which consider the ecosystem-scale information. CIML-TER exhibited higher estimation accuracy (reducing relative mean absolute error by approximately 15%) and overcame the “artificial discontinuities” phenomenon of traditional models. Meanwhile, we quantitatively revealed that although environmental factors, such as temperature and water, were still the dominant drivers of TER (contributing ~44.15% of global TER variability), biotic factors (e.g., vegetation structure, ~25.91%) and spatiotemporal variation factors (e.g., land cover and phenology, ~29.94%) were also critical.

 This study investigated the source characteristics of submicron non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) over a highly growing urban industrial city near the western coast of India. Using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), we conducted continuous measurements from June 2020 to May 2021, capturing seasonal variations in aerosol composition. The annual average NR-PM1 concentration was 16.4 ± 15.4 μg m−3, with substantially higher concentrations observed during winter (33.3 ± 22.2 μg m−3). Chemical analysis revealed distinct contributions of organic aerosols (OA), nitrate (NO3−), sulfate (SO42−), ammonium (NH4+), and chloride (Cl−) to NR-PM1. Organic aerosol consistently contained the most significant fraction of NR-PM1 (49–67 % seasonally). Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) resolved four distinct OA sources: traffic-related hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass-burning OA (BBOA), and two oxygenated OA factors (Semi-Volatile Oxygenated OA (SVOOA) and Low-Volatile Oxygenated OA (LV-OOA)). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was a large OA fraction, with LVOOA being most abundant in winter and post-monsoon, while SV-OOA was higher in monsoon and summer, suggesting photochemical and potentially aqueous-phase formation. Seasonal changes were also observed in OA elemental composition (O/C: 0.67–0.74; H/C: 1.53–1.61; OM/OC: 2.07–2.16) and carbon oxidation state (OSc: 0.25 in monsoon/winter to −0.06 in summer), further supporting the influence of photochemical processes. Size distribution analysis indicated that aerosols were predominantly in the accumulation mode (300–800 nm), suggesting aged and internally mixed aerosol particles.

It is not clear, however, whether this decline takes the form of a gradual wind speed decrease or an increase in ‘wind energy droughts’ (WED), long periods with weak wind speeds. Both types of wind speed reductions contribute to a decline in wind power production. Prolonged and more frequent WED, in particular, may reduce revenue and jeopardize wind farm projects. Past and future changes in WED, as well as their underlying drivers, remain poorly understood. Here we show that winter WED will become more probable in Europe and the return period of 10.3 yr events during 1971–2000 have been shortened to about 10 yrs in the whole Europe, and it would be shortened to about 6.6 yrs during 2041–2070, under uncurbed greenhouse gases emission (scenario RCP8.5). In the current period, low wind energy winter has become more probable in most European countries, especially in the northern countries, showing a higher probability ratio of wind droughts. In the future, for some southern countries, the frequency of wind energy winter droughts is projected to decrease compared with the current period, which is helpful for the development of wind power generation in these countries. In addition, the changes in WED are sensitive to the global warming level. With global warming at 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C, 4 °C levels, low wind energy winter in Europe will occur more frequently as the probability is more than 1.13, 1.46, 1.53, 1.60 times as much as that in the current climate, respectively. The regional difference of attribution is meaningful for the optimization of wind energy transmission networks in Europe, which may be considered by large-scale wind energy producers."

Both of these technologies rely on the use of chemical solvents or sorbents in order to capture CO2. Lately, concerns have surfaced about the cost and energy implications of producing solvents and sorbents at scale. Here, we show that the production of chemical sorbents could have significant implications on system cost, energy use and material use depending on how much they are consumed. Among the three chemical sorbents investigated, namely monoethanolamine (MEA) for post-combustion carbon capture, potassium hydroxide (KOH) for liquid DAC and polyethylenimine-silica (PEI) for solid sorbent DAC, we found that solid sorbent production for DAC represents the highest uncertainties for the system. At the high range of solid sorbent consumption, total energy system cost increased by up to 6.5%, while effects for other options were small to negligible. Scale-up of material production capacities was also substantial for MEA and PEI. While PEI has the advantage of requiring a lower sorbent regeneration temperature than KOH, the potential production cost may outweigh these benefits. There is thus a trade-off between the advantages and the additional cost uncertainty regarding sorbents. Implications of sorbent consumption for carbon capture technologies should be considered more thoroughly in scenarios relying on solid sorbent DAC."

Incorporating the relative global attractor radius as the saturation threshold into the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent method to address SCSP’s oscillatory error growth after saturation reveals that its PL peaks in winter (3.72 months) and drops to its lowest during the autumn (3.12 months). ENSO is identified as the primary source of SCSP predictability, with its PLs generally extending longer and exhibiting distinct inter-seasonal variability compared to those of SCSP. As a crucial system linking ENSO and SCSP, WNPAC mirrors with SCSP in both PLs’ values and inter-seasonal variability.

However, current restoration strategies remain predominantly limited to zoning modes of restoration, lacking a systematic integration of restoration priority assessments and configurations of technology at the watershed scale. To enhance the effectiveness of restoration in the LP, we propose a framework for selecting restoration modes by identifying watershed restoration priorities. Our methodology integrates three key components: (1) ecological network analysis to identify critical conservation areas, (2) a multi-criteria assessment to evaluate ecological importance, problem severity, and restoration potential for priority ranking, and (3) a watershed classification that synthesizes ecosystem status conditions and restoration priorities for selecting the corresponding restoration mode. The results reveal significant spatial heterogeneity in the status conditions and ecological problems of watershed ecosystems, with high-priority restoration watersheds concentrated in the western and central regions. In addition, the watershed ecosystems are categorized into eight classes, with corresponding combinations of technologies that match both the ecological problems and restoration priorities.

WWTPs are also significant sources of CO2 due to organic matter oxidation, and integrating alkalinity addition into treatment processes may both reduce in-plant CO2 emissions and increase downstream CO2 uptake. This study presents a modeling framework that combines a modern activated sludge model-based WWTP simulator with an integrated hydrodynamic-biogeochemical-carbonate chemistry model of coastal oceans. We evaluate the effects of adding alkalinity either upstream (UpAdd) of the biological treatment stage or downstream at the discharge location (DnAdd) on WWTP carbon emission reduction and marine CO2 removal. The carbon emission from WWTPs decreases with increasing alkalinity dosage in UpAdd and can be eliminated at a dosage level that is feasible to implement. However, carbon uptake in the surrounding oceanic water is much reduced due to elevated dissolved inorganic carbon in the discharge water. DnAdd does not affect CO2 emissions from WWTPs but enhances carbon uptake in the ocean, with the net oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 increasing with increasing dosage level. Across all tested dosage levels, total CO2 removal, including emission reduction at the WWTPs and enhanced carbon uptake in the ocean, is 30% greater in UpAdd than in DnAdd. WWTP treatment tanks have much higher pCO2 than in the ocean, and aeration of process tanks enhances the gas transfer. The upstream alkalinity addition leads to sharp declines in pCO2 in the treatment tanks and large reductions in carbon emission from the WWTPs. These results have implications for developing strategies to reduce global carbon emission and enhance oceanic carbon burial using WWTPs as a delivery mechanism."

Despite criticisms of unclear carbon outcomes, long-term durability of projects, and impacts on local communities, there are few systematic studies that assess their ecological and social outcomes based on ground-level data and robust counterfactuals. This study synthesizes data from the carbon market registry, on-ground surveys, and satellite data to inform VCM standards and policies for land-use related carbon market projects in India. We analyzed satellite imagery to assess changes in tree cover in more than 20 000 plots participating in all VCM afforestation projects registered in the country as of 2022 and surveyed project developers to assess the implementation process and local households to and evaluate economic impacts for 366 households in two of the ongoing projects. We compare these results with comparable plots and households using statistical and machine learning approaches. We find robust evidence of increases in tree cover in both participating and comparable non-participating plots—however there are significantly higher increases in the former (average increase 48 compared to 26%). We also find increases in incomes and asset ownership in both participating and non-participating households in two projects, with significantly higher increases in income in one project and in assets in the other. However, half of the projects are no longer operational, which calls into question the durability of these projects despite positive outcomes for tree cover. Results suggest that VCM standards and policies that foster economic well-being of local stakeholders are more likely to deliver sustained carbon benefits. Successful, long-lasting projects provide examples that evaluation of project implementation plans for continuous engagement, economic incentives, and security of land tenure for local stakeholders at the outset could lead to more viable, long-term VCM projects. Robust counterfactual data on changes in tree cover and economic outcomes are critical for improving the integrity of the VCM."

We therefore compared the accuracy and sensitivity of Dräger Tubes in laboratory tests with more advanced analyzers. Dräger Tubes had a detection limit 3 to 4 times higher than expected. Since there are areas where the use of advanced analyzers is not feasible, the DTM should be improved, or simple and cost-effective measuring methods should be developed. 
 Regional estimates of ammonia (NH3) emissions are often missing data from heterogeneous or small fields. Areas with no experienced staff or in-field power supply also prevent the use of accurate and fully established micrometeorological measurement techniques. The Dräger Tube method (DTM) is a calibrated open and dynamic chamber method, which requires little training to use and is relatively inexpensive. It uses NH3 detector tubes (Dräger Tubes), an automatic pump, and a chamber system comprised of four stainless-steel chambers connected with PTFE tubing. Even though the DTM is often used in countries such as Germany and China, the detection accuracy, precision and sensitivity have not been tested yet. In order to quantify those for the DTM, we simultaneously measured defined NH3 mixing ratios with the Dräger Tubes, with quantum cascade laser spectroscopy (QCLS) (MGA7, MIRO Analytical AG, Switzerland) and with cavity ring-down spectroscopy (G2103, Picarro, Inc., USA). Second, we tested the effects of exchanging the tubing material and heating the tubing under laboratory conditions, as well as PTFE film attachments or wiping of the DTM chamber system with ethanol during outdoor measurements, on performance improvements. Results showed that the Dräger Tubes had a detection limit between 150 and 200 ppb, which is 3 to 4 times higher than originally assumed. Dräger Tube concentration measurements also underestimated NH3 concentrations by 43 % to 100 % for mixing ratios between 50 and 300 ppb and by 28 % to 46 % for mixing ratios between 500 and 1500 ppb. The PTFE tubing material showed similar performance to the polyester–polyurethane tubing material regarding response time, which was further improved by heating the tubing to 50 °C. The modifications to the chamber surface and cleaning in the outdoor experiment did not lead to any improvements to the NH3 concentration measurements. The results suggest that the DTM should only be used where alternatives are unfeasible and high NH3 emissions are to be expected. Further assessment of calibrated DTM using reference methods is required for a comprehensive evaluation, and alternative developments for a more appropriate method replacing the DTM in small-plot applications is encouraged."

 Dryland salinity remains a major global natural resource management concern, and which is amplified in Australia. However, limited detailed space-time data sets with observations of stream and groundwater salinity has constrained a deep understanding of the range of processes that can lead to dryland salinity problems in landscapes.

Over a 14-year period a series of different sampling campaigns has resulted in a large dataset with hydrogeochemical data which includes both in-situ (field) data and post laboratory analysis of major anions and cations. This data is augmented with observed groundwater levels and publicly available streamflow and climate data. The data set covers 23 groundwater sample sites and 39 surface water sites. Because the data was collected by four distinct groups and over many years, we analyse to see if this has caused a bias in the dataset.

We developed an AI model using latent diffusion models (LDMs) to mimic this process, increasing weather data resolution over Italy from 25 to 2 km. LDM outperforms other methods, accurately capturing local patterns and extreme events. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative, with potential disruptive application in climate sciences. 
 Downscaling based on deep learning (DL) is a key application in Earth system modeling, enabling the generation of high-resolution fields from coarse numerical simulations at reduced computational costs compared to traditional regional models. Additionally, generative DL models can potentially provide uncertainty quantification through ensemble-like scenario generation, a task prohibitive for conventional numerical approaches. In this study, we apply a latent diffusion model (LDM) to demonstrate that recent advancements in generative modeling enable DL to deliver results comparable to those of numerical dynamical models, given the same input data, preserving the realism of fine-scale features and flow characteristics at reduced computational costs. We apply our LDM to downscale ERA5 data over Italy up to a resolution of 2 km. The high-resolution target data consist of 2 m temperature and 10 m horizontal wind components from a dynamical downscaling performed with COSMO-CLM. A selection of predictors from ERA5 is used as input, and a residual approach against a reference U-Net is leveraged in applying the LDM. The performance of the generative LDM is compared with reference baselines of increasing complexity: a quadratic interpolation of ERA5, a U-Net, and a generative adversarial network (GAN) built on the same reference U-Net. Results highlight the improvements introduced by the LDM architecture combined with the residual approach, outperforming all the baselines in terms of spatial error, frequency distributions, and power spectra. These findings point out the potential of LDMs as cost-effective, robust alternatives for downscaling applications (e.g., downscaling of climate projections), where computational resources are limited but high-resolution data are critical."

Despite this, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of CdS-NPs remain unclear. A key question is whether their toxicity arises from the nanoparticulate form of cadmium (Cd) or from the release of Cd2+. To explore this, we exposed freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01–1 mg/L) of CdS-NPs or Cd2+ for 10 days. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining revealed significant damage to the digestive gland in both cases. Although CdS-NPs released some Cd2+ (≤10.4%), transcriptomic and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated different toxicity mechanisms. CdS-NPs primarily induce ferroptosis, triggered by lysosomal dysfunction that releases Fe2+ into the cytoplasm, disrupting the cellular iron metabolism. In contrast, Cd2+ primarily induces an autophagic response, as evidenced by the upregulation of autophagy-related markers and activation of apoptosis pathways linked to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization.

The existence, spatial distribution, and general properties of HSEFs in the Earth magnetotail are still unknown. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey of HSEFs in the Earth magnetotail, utilizing NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission observations from 2017 to 2021. A total of 642 events characterized by electron bulk speeds exceeding 5,000 km/s are identified. The main statistical properties are: (a) The duration of almost all HSEFs are less than 4 s, and the average duration is 0.74 s. (b) HSEFs exhibit a strong dawn‐dusk (30%–70%) asymmetry. (c) 39.6%, 29.0%, and 31.4% of the events are located in the plasma sheet, plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL), and lobe region, respectively. (d) In the plasma sheet, HSEFs have arbitrary moving directions regarding the ambient magnetic field, and the events near the neutral line predominantly move along the same direction as the ion outflows, indicating outflow electrons generated by magnetic reconnection. (e) HSEFs in the PSBL and lobe mainly move along the ambient magnetic field, and 70% of HSEFs in the PSBL exhibit features of reconnection inflow. The HSEFs in lobe regions may locate near the reconnection electron edges. Our study reveals that the HSEFs in magnetotail are closely associated with magnetic reconnection, and the statistical results deepen the understanding of HSEF fundamental properties in collisionless plasma."

However, knowledge gaps remain regarding circulation pathways in the western Arctic Ocean, where Arctic Atlantic Water (AAW) and Pacific Water interact. Here, we report iodine‐129 (129I) concentrations in seawater collected from the western Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea in 2021. The wide range of 129I concentrations (1–355 × 107 atoms/L) highlights its value as a tracer for identifying water masses and deciphering circulation patterns. Depth profiles of 129I reveal that AAW enters the western Arctic via multiple pathways, with the top layer potentially diverging from the boundary flow and dispersing throughout the region. This previously unreported feature suggests a broader AAW influence on the western Arctic. Additionally, 129I concentrations provide direct evidence that the cold halocline effectively limits the upward transfer of matter from AAW to the Arctic surface."

Observational estimates are often restricted to measuring the BCP efficiency over short timescales. Here we use an ocean biogeochemical model to diagnose where, and on what timescales, the mesopelagic is sufficiently in steady state that balancing the carbon budget may be possible. For the majority of the ocean the sources and sinks of organic carbon in the mesopelagic do not balance on timescales shorter than 1 year.

To address this problem, we used boosted regression trees to relate a compilation of DOC observations to different environmental climatologies, and extrapolated these inferred relationships to the entire ocean to compute annual layer‐wise DOC climatologies with uncertainties. Prediction performance was satisfactory, with R2 ${\mathrm{R}}^{2}$ values within 0.6–0.8 for all layers and prediction error comparable to within‐pixel measurement variability.

In this study, we conducted a series of numerical experiments to explore the impact of IMLR on the variability of the magnetopause. Our results indicate that an enhanced IMLR results in a larger magnetosphere with greater variability in the magnetopause location, due to a higher radial dynamic pressure originated from interchange structures.

Specifically, an opposite‐phase temperature anomaly in NA occurs about 1 week after a Eurasian temperature anomaly, influenced by wave propagation in both the troposphere and stratosphere. Conversely, a same‐phase temperature anomaly appears over central Eurasia approximately 1 week after a North American temperature anomaly, primarily driven by a Scandinavian‐like pattern in the troposphere. These relationships sometimes overlap, forming a sequence of temperature changes across mid‐high latitudes, closely tied to the stratosphere‐troposphere coupling process.

Here, the authors report the use of catechol and boronic acid chemistry to design a self-crosslinkable hydrogel-based microneedle patch that delivers Zinc-Glucagon at low glucose levels and prevents insulin-induced hypoglycemia. 
 Hypoglycemia is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. To provide a safeguard against hypoglycemia, we introduce a “smart” microneedle (MN) patch that senses glucose levels and delivers a blood glucose-raising agent (Zinc-Glucagon (Z-GCN)) in response to hypoglycemia. Herein, we describe the use of catechol and boronic acid chemistry to design a self-crosslinkable hydrogel-based MN that stimulates the release of Z-GCN during hypoglycemia. In this design, the catechol groups bind to Z-GCN through metal-ligand complexation. At hyperglycemia, boronic acids react with glucose to generate cyclic boronate esters. As the glucose concentration decreases, the boronic acid groups dissociate and are favored over Z-GCN in binding with catechol, which promotes the release of Z-GCN. We fully characterize the fabricated MN in vitro. Moreover, we further evaluate the MN and demonstrate the in vivo glucose-responsive delivery of Z-GCN from the patch. We also show its effectiveness in preventing hypoglycemia for up to 6 h in type 1 diabetic male rats against two consecutive insulin overdose challenges. Since many proteins/peptides have a high binding affinity to metal ions, the introduced mechanism driven by the competitive binding of catechol-metal ions has great implications in drug delivery applications of various protein/peptide-based therapeutics.

 In murine models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the parasitization of resident Kupffer cells (resKCs) drives early Leishmania infantum growth in the liver, leading to granuloma formation and subsequent parasite control. Using the chronic VL model, we demonstrate that polyclonal resKCs redistributed to form granulomas outside the sinusoids, creating an open sinusoidal niche that was gradually repopulated by monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs) acquiring a tissue specific, homeostatic profile. Early-stage granulomas predominantly consisted of CLEC4F+KCs. In contrast, late-stage granulomas led to remodeling of the sinusoidal network and contained monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs) along with KCs that downregulated CLEC4F, with both populations expressing iNOS and pro-inflammatory chemokines. During late-stage infection, parasites were largely confined to CLEC4F-KCs. Reduced monocyte recruitment and increased resKCs proliferation in infected Ccr2−/− mice impaired parasite control. These findings show that the ontogenic heterogeneity of granuloma macrophages is closely linked to granuloma maturation and the development of hepatic immunity in VL.

 Governments worldwide have pledged to reduce antimicrobial use in the agri-food system. This study projects global livestock antibiotic use quantities through 2040 under various scenarios. This work indicates that under a business-as-usual scenario, global antibiotic use could reach ~143,481 tons by 2040, representing a 29.5% increase from the 2019 baseline of ~110,777 tons. However, alternative scenarios suggest that these projections could vary by +14.2% to -56.8%, depending on changes in livestock biomass and antibiotic use intensity. A key contribution of this research is the development of the Livestock Biomass Conversion method, a novel indicator offering improved accuracy in estimating livestock biomass. The findings have important policy implications, highlighting that meaningful reductions in antibiotic use quantity can only be achieved through coordinated efforts targeting both antibiotic use intensity and livestock biomass.

Here, using a LUC dataset drawing on remote sensing and forest inventory data, the authors show that in China the carbon sink from LUC (such as afforestation) may be underestimated. 
 The size and attribution of the regional net carbon flux from land-use change (LUC) activities (ELUC) are often highly debated, especially in regions such as China, which has experienced decades-long extensive reforestation activities. Here, using a LUC dataset incorporating remote-sensing and national forest inventory data with two modelling approaches, we show that ELUC in China shifted from a carbon source to a sink in the 1990s, contributing to a net cumulative CO2 removal of 2.0 Pg C during 1981–2020. From 2001 to 2020, the average ELUC was −0.14 Pg C yr−1, accounting for over one-third of the national land carbon sinks. Forest-related LUC activities contributed greatly to national carbon fluxes, while non-forest-related activities played a dominant role in certain areas. Our findings suggest that the carbon sinks from LUC activities in China may be largely underestimated in global assessments, underscoring the need to develop region-specific modelling for evaluation and potential regulation.

Aided by a nickel phosphorus trisulfide nanosheet electrocatalyst, this work shows a sustainable synthetic route to produce H2O2 from seawater with high yield and impressive stability. 
 Electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) in seawater offers a sustainable route for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, due to the high concentration of Cl− ions and competitive 4e− ORR, there is a lack of efficient and long-term stable seawater electrocatalysts. Here we report a high-performance electrocatalyst design based on NiPS3 nanosheets enabling efficient H2O2 production from seawater. Specifically, the NiPS3 nanosheets deliver a 2e− ORR selectivity of ∼98%, a H2O2 yield of 6.0 mol gcat−1 h−1 and robust stability for over 1,000 h in simulated seawater. Underlying the exciting performance is the synergy of the S2−, Ni2+ and P4+ sites where the octahedral S2− skeleton repels Cl− ions, the Ni2+ sites enable the modest binding strength of *OOH intermediate, and the P4+ sites interact with H2O to trigger the protonation of proximal O atom of *OOH. The seawater electrocatalysis system also allows for scalable synthesis of solid H2O2, tandem oxidation reaction of biomass to organic acid and direct use of the produced H2O2 as a sterilizing agent. Once integrated with photovoltaics, the solar-powered electrolysis device can operate in real seawater. Our findings pave the way for sustainable conversion of seawater into value-added products.

Thackeray;Alex Hall,Uncertainty of 21st Century western U.S. snowfall loss derived from regional climate model large ensemble,"Uncertainty of 21st Century western U.S. snowfall loss derived from regional climate model large ensemble 
 The western United States is dependent on winter snowfall over its major mountain ranges, which gradually melts each year, serving as a natural reservoir for water resources. In a future warmer climate, much of this snowfall could be replaced by rain, making it more challenging to capture and store water. In this study, we utilize an ensemble of dynamically downscaled simulations forced by 14 global climate models (GCMs). These GCMs project wildly different futures, in terms of both temperature and precipitation change, producing significant uncertainty in snowfall projections. Here we exploit the robust statistics of the downscaled ensemble, and diagose the sensitivity of end-of-century snowfall loss across the region to both warming and regional wetting/drying in the driving GCM. The windward slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades are particularly sensitive to warming (losing ~ 15% annual snowfall per degree warming), with little influence of precipitation. By contrast, snowfall loss in the inter-mountain west is less sensitive to warming (~ 5% K−1), but is significantly offset/exacerbated by precipitation changes (~ 0.5% snow per 1% precipitation). Combining such sensitivities with the warming and regional precipitation signals in the full CMIP6 ensemble, we can fully quantify likely snowfall loss and its uncertainty at any location, for any emissions scenario. We find that the western U.S. as a whole will lose 34 ± 8% of its total volumetric snowfall by end-of-century under the high-emissions SSP3-7.0 scenario, but 25 ± 6% and 17 ± 6% under the lower-emissions SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios."

 The 2023/24 El Niño commenced with an exceptionally large warm water volume in the equatorial western Pacific, comparable to the extreme 1997/98 and 2015/16 events, but did not develop into a super El Niño. This study highlights the critical role of contrasting Northern Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) conditions in this divergence. Warm NPMM conditions during the 1997/98 and 2015/16 events created a positive zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial western-central Pacific and enhanced Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagation, driving sustained westerly wind bursts (WWBs) and downwelling Kelvin waves that intensified both events. In contrast, the cold NPMM during 2023/24 induced a negative SST gradient and suppressed MJO activity, resulting in weaker WWBs and limited eastward wave activity, preventing the event from reaching super El Niño intensity. A 2,200-year CESM1 pre-industrial simulation corroborates these observational findings, underscoring the importance of NPMM interference in improving El Niño intensity predictions."

 Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) increase evaporation, convection, and latent heat release in the atmosphere, which favors tropical cyclone (TC) intensification and ultimately leads to stronger storms. However, in this study, we find that the intensity of TCs in the western North Pacific, called typhoons, is on average higher in the colder autumn season than during the warmer summer season. The primary reason for this is that despite the decrease in SSTs during autumn, the deepening of the ocean mixed layer increase the TC heat potential and reduces storm-induced SST cooling. Atmospheric thermodynamic conditions also become more favorable to TC intensification in autumn than in summer due to higher heat and sensible heat fluxes in autumn resulting from the increased air-sea temperature/moist differences at the interface. Lastly, during autumn, the TC’s track shifts towards the equator as a result the TCs in this season travel over more favourable ocean condition which also contribute in the TC intensification. This finding will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms causing seasonal differences in TC intensity, which will aid in TC seasonal forecasting and risk assessment."

 The spectral invariants theory (p-theory) has received much attention in the field of quantitative remote sensing over the past few decades and has been adopted for modeling of canopy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). However, the spectral invariant properties (SIP) in simple analytical formulae have not been applied for modeling canopy fluorescence anisotropy primarily because they are parameterized in terms of leaf total scattering, which precludes the differentiation between forward and backward leaf SIF emissions. In this study, we have developed the canopy-SIP SIF model by combining geometric-optical (GO) theory to account for asymmetric leaf SIF forward and backward emissions at the first-order scattering and by modeling multiple scattering based on the p-theory, thus avoiding the dependence on radiative transfer models. The applicability of the model simulations especially over 3D heterogeneous canopies was improved by incorporating canopy structure through multi-angular clumping index, and by modeling single scattering from the four components of the scene in view according to the GO approach. The results show good consistency with both the state-of-the-art SIF models and multi-angular field SIF observations over grass and chickpea canopies. The coefficient of determination (R2) between the simulated SIF and field measurements was 0.75 (red) and 0.74 (far-red) for chickpea, and 0.65 (both red and far-red) for grass. The average relative error was approximately 3 % for 1D homogeneous scenes when comparing the canopy-SIP SIF model simulations to the SCOPE model simulations, and around 4 % for the 3D heterogeneous scene when comparing to the LESS model simulations. The results indicate that the proposed approach for separating asymmetric leaf SIF emissions is a robust way to keep a balance between satisfactory simulation accuracy and efficiency.

 Mangrove canopy height (MCH) is a critical indicator used to evaluate blue carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. However, mapping MCH is challenging because of the dense tree canopy and fluctuating tide conditions. To solve the issue, this study developed a novel approach to retrieve MCH by training a robust XGBoost regression model using UAV-LiDAR, SDGSAT-1, and time series Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument imagery. The approach was applied to mangrove forests along China's coast. The study resulted in a 10 m resolution MCH map and so named China's mangrove canopy height (CMCH). The accuracy of CMCH was assessed using in-situ and UAV-LiDAR data, achieving an R2 of 0.84 and an RMSE of 1.19 m. Band 6 from SDGSAT-1, the only available 10 m resolution red edge spectral band of current available satellite data, was identified as the most crucial feature for predicting MCH. After analyzing the geographic characteristics of CMCH at species level, we had three innovative and quantitative discoveries. Firstly, the mean height of mangrove forests in China was 6.0 m, significantly lower than the global average of 12.7 m. Secondly, the height of mangrove forests in China was found to decrease with increasing latitude. Thirdly, the exotic S. apetala was identified as the tallest mangrove species in China, with the highest trees in 18.7 m along the coasts of Inner Deep Bay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first national-scale study to investigate the geographic characteristics of MCH at species level. The resultant CMCH map and species-level findings provide essential information for managing mangrove ecosystems in China. The technical methodology employed has the potential to be expanded globally, thereby enhancing the execution of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals related to coastal and marine ecosystems. Additionally, it can contribute to the safeguarding of nature, fostering the preservation of biodiversity."

 Accurately estimating snow water equivalent (SWE) in near-real-time is important for water resources management and water supply forecasting in snow-dominant regions. However, conventional SWE estimation approaches have large uncertainties in mountainous regions due to complex terrain, snow-vegetation interactions, and other challenging factors. This study develops a SWE bias correction framework (SWE-BCF) that utilizes the Airborne Snow Observatories (ASO) SWE data and machine learning (ML) algorithms to correct biases in a near-real-time SWE estimation linear regression model (LRM). The spatial distribution of LRM SWE residuals, which are estimated using the ASO SWE, is explicitly modeled using multiple ML algorithms and evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) workflow. A wide range of commonly used ML algorithms is examined to model LRM SWE residuals, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks (BRNN), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that all ML algorithms substantially improve LRM SWE estimation accuracy. While the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates no significant difference (p-value >0.05) among the bias correction models, the RF model outperforms others, with the highest median R2 (0.89), the lowest median RMSE (69 mm), MAE (41 mm), and NRMSE (37.4 %), as well as the second-best median PBIAS (−6.6 %) in the LOOCV for correcting SWE bias. Four performance metrics (R2, MAE, RMSE, NRMSE) show significant improvements (p-value <0.05) over the original LRM model, highlighting the effectiveness of SWE-BCF in correcting the spatial patterns of SWE. However, the correction in the basin-wide average SWE, as indicated by the PBIAS values, exhibits high variance and does not show significant improvement (p-value >0.05). Among the three land cover types in the Upper Tuolumne River Basin, the alpine area showed the most substantial SWE improvements with the SWE-BCF. The structural adaptability of the SWE-BCF enables its transferability to various geographic locations and SWE datasets, allowing for an extension of coverage and frequency of more accurate SWE estimates. This potential advancement may improve water management decisions which rely on accurate water supply forecasts."

 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has garnered attention due to its outstanding performance in multisource remote sensing (RS) image classification. However, classical CNN-based methods primarily concentrate on information within a fixed-size neighborhood and a standard square region, neglecting long-range and global information. As non-Euclidean data, the topological structure enables flexible construction of relationships between objects, which can be served as an effective carrier of global information. Graph Neural Network (GNN), capable of extracting features from the topological structure, is considered as a solution for capturing global information. Nevertheless, GNN faces challenges as the manually defined static graph structure might not accurately capture the complexity of the data. We propose a double dual dynamic graph neural network (D3GNN) with dynamic topological structure refinement for multisource RS data classification. D3GNN generates multiple topological structures to achieve a comprehensive perception of scene features by utilizing local spatial information and distinctive data from various sources. Given the characteristics of heterogeneous-structure data, D3GNN implements targeted topological structure remodeling and refinement to overcome the limitations imposed by static graph, thereby enabling the network to generate feature embeddings with enhanced discriminative power. The experimental results show that D3GNN achieves superior performance compared to other current methods."

 The movement of a vessel generates cold and warm wake patterns with temperature gradients on the sea surface, which provide detection possibilities for satellite-based infrared detection systems. This work analyzes the temporal characteristics of ship wake dissipation on the sea surface, based on multi-source data from low Earth orbit satellite thermal infrared imaging, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and numerical simulation results, revealing the dynamic information contained within the thermal wake. The temperature images of sea surface thermal wakes generated by vessels at different speeds were obtained using numerical simulation methods. The thermal infrared characteristics of the surface vessel wakes were verified using images from the thermal imaging spectrometer aboard the SDGSAT-1 satellite. The simulation results reveal the patterns of generation, diffusion, and attenuation of the infrared thermal wake produced by moving vessels in the ocean. By combining simulations with infrared images from the SDGSAT-1 satellite, the thermal infrared temperature characteristics of wakes on the sea surface are summarized. This method overcomes the limitations of traditional optical monitoring techniques at night, while capturing more information on sea surface temperature variations.

 Accurate and effective coastal wetland classification using hyperspectral remote sensing technology is crucial for their conservation, restoration, and sustainable development. However, the large scale variance of land covers in complex wetland scenes poses challenges for existing methods and leads to misclassifications. Additionally, existing methods encounter difficulties in practical wetland classification tasks due to the high cost of hyperspectral wetland data labeling. This paper introduces SAM-CTMapper, a coastal wetland classification framework that incorporates a scale-aware mixed CNN-Transformer (CTMapper) to precisely identify wetland cover types using hyperspectral images, and the advanced segment anything model (SAM) to save labor costs in data labeling. Specifically, a novel scale-aware mixed CNN-Transformer layer is designed in CTMapper to effectively leverage local and long-range spectral–spatial features from the whole HSI to reduce misclassification. This layer comprises a multi-head scale-aware convolution layer to capture local land-cover details, a multi-head superpixel self-attention layer for extracting long-range contextual features, and a dynamic selective module to facilitate effective aggregation of local and long-range information. Additionally, we devise a SAM-based semi-automatic labeling strategy to construct two PRISMA hyperspectral wetland (PRISMA-HW) datasets over Liaoning Shuangtai and Shanghai Chongming for evaluation purposes. Experimental results on two PRISMA-HW datasets and two publicly available hyperspectral wetland datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CTMapper method in terms of both accuracy metrics and visual quality.

 The sublimation of snow has a major impact on the global climate. We present a simple empirical formula that allows snow sublimation to be quantified on the interannual scale in the Altai Mountains. This empirical formula is based on the fitting of measured temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) data for midwinter collected between 2011 and 2018 at the Koktokay snow station, located at the outlet of the Kayiertesi River Basin. The results suggest that there is a best-fitting linear relationship (r = −0.98; p < 0.001) between the temperature and snow sublimation rates. The low sublimation rate, which was only 0.2 mm day−1, corresponded to a low air temperature and high relative humidity, and the sublimation loss accounted for 2.6 % and 5.6 % of the annual precipitation and snowfall, respectively. Based on the proposed empirical formula and the hourly meteorological data from the ERA5 Land reanalysis, we calculated the sublimation rate in the Irtysh River Basin from 2011 to 2018. The results reveal that the cumulative snow sublimation loss was 14.3 mm y−1, comprising 8.2 % of the snowfall and 3.9 % of the annual precipitation. Due to the relative ease of collecting field observations of the temperature and SWE, this simple formula, which has a high level of goodness of fit, is more applicable to the study of issues related to snow mass balance over long time scales in the Altai Mountains, and it also provides support for local snowmelt flood warning and water resource management."

 The Dutch real-time gauge-adjusted radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) product provides 5 min accumulations every 5 min on a ∼ 1 km2 grid covering the Netherlands and the area around it (∼ 4.5×105 km2). It plays a key role in hydrological decision-support systems and as input for nowcasts in order to inform decision makers. Major changes to the production of this QPE product were implemented on 31 January 2023, and include (polarimetric) fuzzy logic clutter removal, rain-induced attenuation correction and vertical profile of reflectivity correction. Moreover, the mean-field bias rain gauge ad- justment was replaced by a spatially variable rain gauge adjustment. We evaluate the potential quality improvement resulting from these changes by comparing the last year of the old and the first year of the renewed QPE product. Clutter leading to overestimation in the old radar product is effectively removed in the renewed radar product. Evaluation against rain gauge accumulations shows a strong improvement. Average underestimation decreases by about ten percentage points to 15 % over the Netherlands. Improvements of statistics are clear for daily precipitation over a large part of the QPE product domain, but also show the potential for incorporating rain gauge accumulations outside the Netherlands. The 1 h and daily extremes over the Netherlands are also better captured by the renewed product.

The pregnant ICR mouse and JAR cell (a monolayer model), in combination with molecular docking, were used to explore the underlying mechanism. OPFRs were rapidly metabolized into diester metabolites following oral gavage in the ICR mouse, with considerable concentrations detected in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and placenta, as well as fetus within 3 h. After 6 h, the accumulation ratios of OPFRs between the mother and fetus exhibited a parabolic relationship with log KOW. Oral exposure resulted in a decrease in interstitial cells in the decidua and an expansion of vascular systems in the labyrinthine area. RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulated expression levels of transporter mRNA in the placenta, suggesting a protective mechanism characterized by greater efflux than influx transport efficiency. Metabolic inhibitors applied during in vitro transepithelial transport experiments using the JAR cells significantly reduced the transport efficiency, indicating that active transport facilitated the transplacental transport of aryl-OPFRs, with reductions exceeding 50%.

Currently, nontargeted screening of ECs has been developed for their assessment, which requires sophisticated instrumentation. Although satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective technology for water quality assessment, accurately measuring ECs in a river-to-ocean continuum remains a significant challenge due to their trace levels. To address this challenge, we innovate a strategy utilizing satellite remote sensing to achieve high-resolution nontargeted EC screening. By employing DOM as an intermediary variable, bridging the gap between satellite remote sensing and ECs in river-to-ocean continua. DOM, including the total sum of ECs, reflects their distribution and spectral sensitivity, enabling satellite sensing to capture their unique fingerprints. In this study, this strategy has enhanced the accuracy of nontargeted EC screening from 32.2 to 95.7% using machine learning.

Additionally, the band reflectance is influenced by the proportion of polarity-related heterogeneity in the ECs.

Nevertheless, little is known about the photochemical activity of colored microplastics and the associated risks that are ubiquitous in the environment. In this study, we report the strong photochemical activity of microplastics colored with cadmium pigments. These colored microplastics can be excited by photons within the solar spectrum (<514 nm), readily generating •OH, O2•–, and H2O2. Consequently, they can effectively degrade 17β-estradiol, achieving >91% degradation within 23 h under simulated solar exposure. Among microplastics colored with different cadmium pigments, those with a cadmium pigment S/Se ratio of 2:5 exhibited the highest photoactivity. This is attributed to the narrow band gap, fast charge separation, and efficient charge transfer of the microplastics, as suggested by the energy band, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance results. Meanwhile, hazardous Cd2+ was leached from colored microplastics mainly owing to the oxidation of pigment lattices by photogenerated holes. Our results reveal that microplastics colored with photoactive inorganic pigments behave drastically differently from uncolored counterparts. This highlights the importance of considering pigments as a critical factor for better assessing the environmental fate and risks of colored microplastics and plastic products."

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most toxic substances in petroleum oil, yet their behavior in sea-ice-covered waters remains poorly studied. Here, we report an outdoor microcosm study to examine the partitioning behavior of four PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene) across the seawater-sea-ice-atmosphere interface in the presence of particulate humic acid as a surrogate for particulate organic carbon (POC). We show that the higher the molecular weight of the PAH, the higher its concentration in sea-ice and the POC fraction. The POC-aqueous phase (seawater or bulk sea-ice) partition coefficients, Kd, are reasonably well explained by temperature and salinity for all four PAHs in seawater and for phenanthrene and pyrene in sea-ice. Relationships of Kd with temperature and salinity in sea-ice and freezing seawater are complex and nonunidirectional, most likely due to the dynamic nature of sea-ice and seawater under such temperatures. This suggests that conventional equilibrium-based approaches developed for open-water conditions need to be revisited when describing the behavior of PAHs in ice-covered waters."

This study introduces a novel design strategy that leverages surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) in photocatalysts to maximize both oxygen (O2) utilization from the air and photocarrier efficiency at the air–water interface, building upon previous research that demonstrated that oxygen concentration at the interface can be significantly higher than that in bulk water. By enhancing oxygen adsorption and facilitating charge carrier separation, OVs significantly improve reactive oxygen species (ROS, including ·O2– and ·OH) generation and overall photocatalytic activity. As a demonstration, the surface OVs-engineered BiOCl-based photocatalytic solar interfacial evaporator demonstrated a 3.41-fold increase in VOC (phenol) removal efficiency compared to a conventional system, achieving over 99.6% VOC removal in condensed water and maintaining a high water vapor generation flux of 1.90 kg/m2/h. This innovative design was further validated using ZnO-based photocatalysts, demonstrating the broad applicability of OV-engineering in interfacial systems. By fully utilizing both the high oxygen content at the air–water interface and improving photocarrier dynamics, this approach represents a significant advancement in photocatalytic water treatment technologies, offering a scalable and highly efficient solution for VOC removal and clean water production."

However, whether LPS participates in atmospheric chemistry and how its biological health impacts change with the relevant processes are poorly understood. In this study, we employed the rat model to investigate the impact of ozone oxidation on the biological toxicity of LPS and used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry to study the underlying reaction mechanisms. The results show that the LPS can be oxidized by ozone and the resulting reactant greatly enhanced inflammatory anemia with a 177% capacity increase despite a minor influence on its immunogenicity. In contrast to the control, rats exposed to oxidized LPS were observed to release characteristic exhaled biomarkers, indicating that the formed reactant indeed altered the biological effects of LPS. Mechanistic investigation reveals that ozone oxidation of the hydroxyl group in the key toxic part of LPS, kdo2-lipid A, can cause dysregulation of iron homeostasis in rats, which is the mechanism of oxidized LPS-enhanced anemia. Unfortunately, these chemical structure changes and the resulting health impacts cannot be detected by the conventional LPS analysis method.

Previous field studies have observed an inverse correlation between these two pollutants indoors, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Given the semivolatile behavior of HONO, a possible mechanism is its multiphase reaction with ozone. In this study, we measured ozone uptake on surface HONO/NO2– under environmentally relevant conditions in a flow tube. The ozone deposition velocities (vd = 0.002 ± 0.001–0.3 ± 0.005 cm s–1) and uptake coefficients (γ = (0.2 ± 0.1) × 10–6–(2.0 ± 0.2) × 10–4) depend on reactant concentrations, relative humidity, and reaction time but are less affected by illumination. The lifetimes of gaseous HONO and ozone are approximately 10 min due to this multiphase reaction under indoor conditions, which is a significant sink for HONO and O3 as compared to those of other indoor reactions and air exchange. This study for the first time revealed the previously overlooked vital role of the reaction of surface HONO/NO2– with O3 in affecting both indoor HONO and O3 and has significance for understanding the multiphase chemistry of HONO and O3, with implications for outdoor surfaces and model studies to better constrain HONO sinks."

However, limited understanding of electron propagation mechanisms during discharge has led previous research to focus on hydrated electrons (eaq–) while neglecting free electrons (e–). In this study, a consistent and modeled dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was employed to degrade PFOA. Contribution analysis indicated that reactions driven by e– were dominant, with substantial contributions from hydroxyl radical (•OH)-mediated oxidation. By integrating a kinetic model with a streamer solver, a basic discharge unit model was developed. Simulation of e– streamer propagation identified a high-intensity response electric field formed by the e– memory effect, with a peak strength of 1.816 × 106 V/m. This electric field facilitated a secondary acceleration of e–, allowing e– to penetrate the surface water layer and directly attack PFOA via chain-shortening mechanisms. The delocalized state of e– restricted degradation primarily to the gas–liquid interface, minimizing interference from the surrounding medium.

However, current preferred end-of-life waste management solutions, such as aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion, are not optimal for bioplastics, due to their slow and variable degradation rates. Thus, the isolation of novel microbes and their plastic-degrading enzymes is necessary to improve existing bioplastic disposal and create more sustainable routes to valorize waste plastic. In this study, through functional enrichment cultures, we isolated 14 unique microbes capable of PLA and PBAT degradation and applied a computational discovery pipeline to identify plastic-degrading enzymes. Through this, a focused set of 97 enzymes was functionally characterized, finding three active PLA-degrading enzymes. The two most active enzymes, JW45_1534 and JW44_1708, displayed broad polyester degrading activity against PLA, PBAT, PBSA, PCL, and Impranil polyurethane.

Estuarine sediments function as major sinks for MPs and hotspots for critical biogeochemical processes, which are significantly influenced by benthic bioturbation. However, the impacts of MPs on the behavior of highly mobile benthic organisms and the ecological effects of bioturbation activities remain poorly understood. This study utilized laboratory simulation experiments, AI-based behavioral tracking, and metagenomic sequencing to systematically examine the effects of sand crab bioturbation on MPs migration, sediment physicochemical properties and sulfur cycling processes. Results demonstrated that sand crab bioturbation substantially enhanced the vertical migration of MPs, with fluxes to surface layers and the overlying water increasing by 27-fold compared to undisturbed conditions. Exposure to PE-MPs reduced sand crabs’ surface foraging intensity and induced behavioral abnormalities. The crabs actively avoided MPs, exhibiting a preference for burrowing and residing in deeper sediment layers. This behavioral shift significantly altered microbial community distributions, with an increase of Pseudomonadota abundance and a decline of sulfate-reducing bacteria Thermodesulfobacteriota abundance. Furthermore, bioturbation accelerated sulfate oxidation in deeper sediments while inhibited dissimilatory sulfate reduction. This study is the first to identify the role of bioturbation in promoting the upward migration of MPs in sediments.

In this study, we recruited 20 AAs and 28 individuals of other races, oversampled for vapers, with no statistical differences in age, sex, sugar intake, income, or education across groups. Whole saliva samples collected at the time of the visit were processed for untargeted UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS proteomics and HPLC-MS/MS metabolomics. Our results revealed vaping preferentially impaired redox pathways and amino acid metabolism among AAs, with elevated malondialdehyde levels and an oxidized glutathione to glutathione ratio and lowered levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ascorbate. Salivary proteomics demonstrated salivary secretion was upregulated in AAs while Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, bacterial invasion defense, natural killer cell function, leukocyte migration, and phagosome function were downregulated, suggesting dysregulated innate immune function in AA vapers. Additionally, focal adhesion, cell–substrate junction, and actin cytoskeleton regulation were downregulated in AA vapers, indicating that mucous epithelium barrier integrity may be disrupted. Lastly, the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Need (CPITN), a dental assessment tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate periodontal health and determine the need for treatment, revealed that a significantly higher proportion of AA vapers had CPITN scores of 3 or higher, suggesting the need for further clinical assessment of periodontal disease.

Co‐application of inorganic (silicate rocks) with organic (biochar and compost) amendments revealed not just additive, but synergistic effects whereby organic amendments increased rates of weathering. This is important because field CDR rates were <10% of the theoretical maximum (i.e., the rate if basalt was completely weathered); thus, methods to improve weathering rates will be necessary for this practice to scale in a meaningful way.

Nguyen;Stefano Galelli;Serena Ceola;Alberto Montanari,Bridging Information From Paleo‐Hydrological and Climate Model Ensembles to Assess Long Term Hydrological Drought Hazard,"Characterizing the evolution of drought frequency and severity under anthropogenic global warming remains a key challenge because of the mismatch between the length of instrumental records and the long‐term variability of drought features. To address this gap, we propose a modeling framework that combines river flow observations, paleo‐hydrological reconstructions, and climate model simulations. Such diversity of climate information, that is bridged in a flexible approach, allows evaluating the hazard of hydrological droughts for any large catchment globally. By focusing on the specific case of Alpine regions and analyzing the information contained in an ensemble for the period 1100–2100, we show that, compared to the past nine centuries, the mean annual flow in the Po River (Italy's main water course) may decrease by about 10% during the 21st century, while the mean drought duration and severity are likely to increase by approximately 11% and 12%, respectively. Future drought conditions are likely to match, or even exceed, the driest period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly under different emissions scenarios. This indicates unprecedented drought conditions in Alpine regions in the coming decades, thus calling for an increased preparedness in managing water resources under climate change."

Juno exited the magnetosphere on approach to Jupiter, coinciding with modeled high‐speed solar wind impact that compressed the magnetosphere. This hot feature may be dynamic, transported equatorward by winds following auroral activity enhancements from magnetospheric compression akin to a large‐scale traveling ionospheric disturbance on Earth, or driven by the inner magnetosphere particle precipitation. Exploring the dynamic case, we calculated equatorward velocities ranging from 0.46 to 2.02 km s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$, similar to those seen at Earth.

However, studies using geophysical methods to assess how soil crack patterns and shrinkage respond to climate change remain scarce. Induced polarization, a non‐intrusive geophysical technique, is highly sensitive to the moisture content and pore structure of the porous media. For the first time, we investigate the effect of soil surface crack patterns on complex conductivity under freeze‐thaw cycling and desiccation processes using a new experimental set‐up. Results show that Y‐junction‐dominated crack patterns form on the sample surface after freeze‐thaw cycling, and surface cracking network extends along existing cracks until desiccation ceases. Our findings from induced polarization experiments reveal that two components of complex conductivity are linearly sensitive to surface crack ratio and gravimetric water content. Additionally, they both exhibit a similar decay behavior with drying time. In summary, these results indicate that induced polarization provides a preliminary approach for monitoring the surface crack patterns of clayey soils."

Here, we apply statistical analyses to existing δ13C records and reveal that the G point is sensitive to underlying δ13C uncertainties. We generate a probabilistic‐based CIE detection limit, which constrains the time range over which the PETM is detected in δ13C records.

Two upper‐tropospheric quasi‐biweekly oscillations (QBWO), propagating eastward along the mid‐ and high‐latitudes, respectively, have been confirmed to trigger a low‐tropospheric cyclonic anomaly (LCA) via potential vorticity advection and meridional secondary circulation. This LCA generated the BTH ECE by reducing incoming solar radiation due to increased snowfall and cloud cover, and by advecting cold air into BTH. Both the subseasonal dynamical prediction and long‐term historical observational diagnosis further indicate a strong connection between mid‐high‐latitude QBWO and the regional ECEs.

 Accurately extracting forest land and understanding its spatial distribution are crucial for forest monitoring and management. However, variations in tree species, human activities, and natural disturbances create diverse and distinct forest land characteristics in remote sensing images, posing challenges for precise forest land extraction. To address these challenges, we propose a spatial-semantic information fusion network (S2-IFNet) integrated with boundary feature enhancement for forest land extraction from Sentinel-2 data. S2-IFNet employs a dual-branch network to separately extract the spatial and semantic features of forest land. In the semantic branch, two modules are introduced: a boundary enhancement module using the Sobel operator to capture forest land boundary details, and an attention module to strengthen the feature representation capability. Finally, a spatial-semantic fusion module effectively combines the spatial, semantic, and boundary detail information to improve the forest land extraction accuracy. S2-IFNet was evaluated across five regions in different global climate zones, with a comparative analysis conducted against four forest land-cover products in Yunnan, China. The results show that S2-IFNet can achieve an overall accuracy exceeding 90%, demonstrating its strong forest land extraction capability. Compared to the different forest land extraction models, S2-IFNet shows a superior performance, with ablation experiments confirming the effectiveness of each module. In particular, the boundary feature enhanced spatial-semantic fusion strategy enables S2-IFNet to focus more precisely on the boundaries and range of forest land, thereby enhancing the extraction accuracy. Meanwhile, S2-IFNet can adapt to complex scenarios, including varying forest density and similar object confusion. Furthermore, S2-IFNet can achieve results that are superior to the four other products."

 Fall Armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), poses a significant risk to global food and income security by attacking various crops, particularly maize. Early detection and management of FAW infestation are crucial for mitigating its impact on crop yields. This study investigated the effect of FAW infestation on the spectral signature of maize fields and classified infestation severity in Bangladesh using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Random Forest (RF) classification. Field observations on FAW infestation severity (none, moderate, and severe), collected by the Bangladesh Department of Agricultural Extension during 2019 and 2020, were used to train the RF classifier. Six thousand nine hundred ninety-eight observations were collected from 579 maize fields through weekly scouting. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s post-hoc test were applied to identify the most significant spectral bands (P < 0.05) for detecting FAW incidence and severity across different maize growth stages. The results demonstrated that the spectral reflectance from Sentinel-2 bands varied significantly among different classes of FAW infestation, with noticeable differences observed during the early developmental stages of maize (vegetative growth stages 3 to 8). RF identified nine spectral bands and two spectral vegetation indices as important for FAW infestation discrimination. The RF classifier was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation, achieving an overall accuracy between 74 % and 84 %. The independent test set’s accuracy ranged from 72 % to 82 %. The mean multiclass AUC ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. Moreover, the results demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the severity of FAW infestation using temporal Sentinel-2 data and machine learning techniques. These findings underscore the potential of remote sensing and machine learning techniques for effectively monitoring and managing crop pests.

 With the increasing frequency of ozone (O3) pollution episodes in China, there is a growing emphasis on understanding the contributions of precursors to O3. Identifying key volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that drive O3 formation has become a primary research focus. However, comprehending these key VOCs' distribution characteristics and patterns remains challenging. This study employs the convergent cross-mapping (CCM) method to identify and quantify causal relationships between 25 VOCs and O3 simulated by WRF-Chem model. The results indicate that key VOCs identified by CCM can correspond well with those calculated based on observational data. Furthermore, the contributions and sources of various VOCs exhibits notable regional variations, showing a change with the O3 formation sensitivity (OFS). In areas where OFS is strongly limited by VOCs, such as coastal ports and cities with concentrated resources or populations, alkenes, ketoaldehyde, and alcohols contribute more to O3 formation. Meanwhile, the proportion of primary emission sources of oxygenated VOCs is relatively high (62.36–78.64 %), while secondary production sources are relatively low. Conversely, in regions where OFS is minimally limited by VOCs, such as agricultural areas in northern China, alkanes, aromatics, and phenols become more important. In this context, primary source contributions diminish while secondary source contributions rise to 19.1 %–45.6 %. Given North China's complex VOCs sources, this study suggests reducing key VOCs by targeting OFS characteristics within specific regions."

 The prominent decadal variations can be observed in the warming-induced long-term decline of Eurasian spring snow cover, which have reversed or accelerated the decreasing trend during some periods, making the understanding and prediction of the response of snow cover to climate warming more complicated. However, it remains unknown what contributes to such decadal variations. This study reveals that the spring snow cover over the mid-high latitudes of Eurasia features a consistent oscillation on the decadal timescale, which is tightly associated with the preceding winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The sea surface temperature anomaly related to the winter PDO can persist into the following spring and excite an anomalous wave train type circulation extending eastward from North Pacific to Eurasia. In the positive PDO phases, there is an anticyclonic and a cyclonic circulation over northern Europe and northeast Eurasia that would reduce the surface air temperature over northern Eurasia via favoring the cold advection and negative diabatic heating. Consequently, the decreased air temperature is conducive to forming the positive anomaly of snow cover. Our results can provide a valuable clue for the decadal prediction of spring Eurasian snow cover variations."

 High-resolution precipitation data aid climate research and forecasting, reveal precipitation mechanisms, assess extreme events, provide empirical support for models, enhance prediction accuracy, and have application value for weather forecasting and beyond. The Xinjiang region of China, characterized by its vast expanse and complex terrain, exhibits a pronounced spatial and temporal disparity in precipitation distribution. Traditional ground meteorological observation stations are sparse and unevenly distributed, leading to considerable limitations and uncertainties in precipitation observation data. The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement products (i.e., IMERG) provide new-generation satellite precipitation measurements, but they are inaccurate in regions with complex terrain. Leveraging the advantages of multiple data sources to achieve complementary fusion of precipitation data can effectively increase the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of data. In this study, we proposed a merged (automatic weather station and IMERG measurements) high-spatiotemporal resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) hourly precipitation product (M-AWSI), and then evaluated its applications. For the 2027 AWS in Xinjiang, the RBFN (radial basis function neural network) method was used to obtain the gridded data, and RBFN can overcome the insufficient of traditional interpolation in local approximation ability. Furtherly, the gridded data is fused with the IMERG data by using an optimized probability matching total correction scheme, where multiple constraints are incorporated, such as effective correction radius and distance weight correction to avoid temporal and spatial discontinuity of the data in neighboring areas. Compared with observational data, the IMERG product effectively captures the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation in the Xinjiang region. However, it exhibits significant underestimation of heavy precipitation and overestimations of weak precipitation, while failing to accurately depict the peak time in the diurnal precipitation variation. The M-AWSI data have markedly elevated the representation indices for daily precipitation across various intensities, with particularly prominent performance in augmenting the hit rate for identifying heavy rain and rainstorm events. Furthermore, in relation to the hourly probability density distribution and the attributes of daily precipitation variability, the alignment between M-AWSI and observational data has been significantly strengthened. Additionally, the M-AWSI data demonstrates a substantial improvement in its ability to represent extreme precipitation zones and their evolutionary characteristics compared to IMERG data. The M-AWSI data effectively overcomes the limitations of IMERG, which tend to underestimate heavy precipitation and overestimate weak precipitation. The establishment of this dataset will contribute to a deeper understanding of precipitation characteristics, particularly extreme precipitation events, in the Xinjiang region."

Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal Tregcells (mTregcells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mTregcells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD+sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for Tregcell–mediated immunosuppression.

We developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of master transcription factors (TFs). We examined the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks."

In two independent cohorts, we identified altered microbial bile acid metabolism with reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in osteoarthritis. Suppressing farnesoid X receptor (FXR)—the receptor of GUDCA—alleviated osteoarthritis through intestine-secreted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in mice. GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance ofClostridium bolteae, which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment withC. bolteaeand Food and Drug Administration–approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR–joint GLP-1 axis in mice. UDCA use was associated with lower risk of osteoarthritis-related joint replacement in humans. These findings suggest that orchestrating the gut microbiota–GUDCA–intestinal FXR–GLP-1–joint pathway offers a potential strategy for osteoarthritis treatment."

We report that lattice strain locks Rb ions into the α-phase of the lattice of a triple-halide WBG perovskite, preventing phase segregation into a nonperovskite Rb-cesium–rich phase. This process cooperates with chloride accommodation and promotes halide homogenization across the entire film volume. The resulting 1.67–electron volt WBG perovskite exhibits photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 14% under 1-sun-equivalent irradiation, corresponding to a quasi–Fermi level splitting of ~1.34 electron volts. A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiativeVOClimit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites."

It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials."

We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types—peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells—with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns.

In this work, using methods borrowed from distributional semantics, we investigated compositionality in wild bonobos and found that not only does each call type of their repertoire occur in at least one compositional combination, but three of these compositional combinations also exhibit nontrivial compositionality. These findings suggest that compositionality is a prominent feature of the bonobo vocal system, revealing stronger parallels with human language than previously thought."

Extant bacterial phyla trace their diversity to the Archaean and Proterozoic, and bacterial families prior to the Phanerozoic.

Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the θ phase of the intralaminar and medial nuclei during conscious perception.

Here, we combine atomic force microscopy and single-particle cryo–electron microscopy to determine DNA structures on five different types of single-chirality SWCNTs, achieving unprecedented subnanometer resolution. This resolution enables the direct observation of left-handed helical DNA structures with pitches ranging from 1.59 to 2.20 nm, depending on the DNA sequence and nanotube chirality. These findings provide structural insights into the mechanisms by which DNA differentiates the chirality of SWCNTs, and governs the sensitivity, dynamic response range, and analyte differentiability of SWCNT sensors.

Genome sequencing data of 244 individuals uncovered relatively low overall genomic diversity/heterozygosity and long runs of homozygosity, with captive populations exhibiting higher heterozygosity and smaller inbreeding coefficients compared to wild individuals. The decreased level of inbreeding in the captive population demonstrates the contribution of the large captive breeding population. The estimated recent effective population size was around a few dozen. To combat challenges of inbreeding depression and reduced adaptability, we used genome-wide SNP-based kinship analysis on captive populations to enable a genome-informed breeding program that minimizes inbreeding. Long-term field monitoring revealed that the Chinese government greatly advanced the conservation ofA. sinensisthrough conservation measures and reintroduction programs.

Here, we present a versatile denial-of-spread (DoS) strategy to target and eliminate specific conjugative plasmids. Our strategy exploits retrotransfer, whereby an engineered DoS plasmid is introduced into host cells containing a target plasmid. Acting as a predatory gene drive, DoS propagates itself at the expense of the target plasmid, through competition or active elimination. Once the target plasmid is eradicated, DoS is removed via induced plasmid suicide, resulting in a community containing neither plasmid. The strategy is tunable and scalable for various conjugative plasmids, different mechanisms of plasmid inheritance interruption, and diverse environmental contexts.

This study uncovers a mechanism for reliable neural information processing, leveraging a biologically plausible network model incorporating neural heterogeneity. First, we investigate neuronal timescale diversity, revealing that it disrupts intrinsic coherent spatiotemporal patterns, induces firing rate heterogeneity, enhances local responsive sensitivity, and aligns network activity closely with input. The system exhibits globally input-slaved transient dynamics, essential for reliable neural information processing. Other neural heterogeneities, such as nonuniform input connections, spike threshold heterogeneity, and network in-degree heterogeneity, play similar roles, highlighting the importance of neural heterogeneity in shaping consistent stimulus representation. This mechanism offers a potentially general framework for understanding neural heterogeneity in reliable computation and informs the design of reservoir computing models endowed with liquid wave reservoirs for neuromorphic computing."

In addition, a novel curriculum-based learning rate scheduler accelerates convergence. We demonstrate that the choice of curriculum biases the progression of learning for dexterous manipulation across objects with different weights, sizes, and shapes—underscoring the robustness of our learning approach. Unexpectedly, learning is achieved even in the absence of haptic information. This challenges conventional thinking about task “complexity” and the necessity of haptic information for dexterous manipulation for this task.

The most common method for determining spatial wind speed patterns in cities relies on numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which resolve Navier–Stokes equations around buildings. While effective, these simulations are computationally intensive and require specialised expertise, limiting their broader applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a more cost-effective alternative while achieving 90 performance in capturing the mean and maintaining spatial wind patterns captured by CFD. We developed a machine learning (ML) approach with U-net architecture to predict time mean wind speed patterns from prevailing wind directions and three-dimensional urban morphology, which are increasingly available for global cities. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 512 numerical simulations of urban neighbourhoods, representing diverse morphological configurations in cities worldwide. We find that the ML algorithm accurately predicts complex wind patterns, achieving a normalised mean absolute error of less than 10 , which is comparable to wind anemometer measurement in a low wind speed environment. In predicting wind statistics, the ML model also surpasses that of regression models based solely on statistical representations of urban morphology. The R2 values measuring grid-level agreement between ML and CFD range from 0.94–0.99 and 0.65–0.95 for the idealised and whole datasets, respectively. However, we find that grid-based R2 is not an effective metric for evaluating the 2D model performance due to localised biases arising from faster wind speed grid regions, which is revealed by the wind probability density function. These findings demonstrate that complex pedestrian wind patterns can be effectively predicted using an image-based ML approach, offering the potential to emulate physics-based large-eddy simulation models, which are computationally expensive, thereby significantly reducing computing costs."

Due to the high demand for food security, driven by rapid population growth and national initiatives to reduce dependency on rice imports, rice cultivation is intensified in West Africa. However, its contribution to atmospheric CH4 remains largely unknown. Here, for the first time, cutting-edge eddy covariance tower measurements were conducted parallelly in a rice field (Janga) and a reserve forest (Mole National Park), both located in the Guinea savanna region of West Africa. Using CH4 measurement data from June to October 2023 (rice cultivation period), the dynamic interplay between methane emissions from rice cultivation and its potential mitigation through forest methane uptake was assessed. Our results show that the rice field acted as a net source of CH4 at a rate of 2037 mgCH4m−2, whereas the most intense flooded period (August) accounted for 70% of the total emissions. On the other hand, the forest reserve acted as a sink, with a net uptake of −560 mgCH4m−2, and the highest uptake observed in October. Accounting for the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 over a 20 year period, the forest had a wet season negative GWP of −47.04 gCO2eq, while the rice field emitted CH4 of 171.36 gCO2eq. This implies that under similar conditions during the measurement campaigns, the forest per square area needs approximately a factor of ∼4 to balance the positive radiative effect per square area of rice cultivated. This work emphasizes the need to integrate forests to compensate for methane released by rice cultivation in the semi-arid West African savannah region."

To guide decision-making around testing, deploying, and regulating CDR as part of a portfolio of climate mitigation strategies, we need to better understand how the deep sea and broader Earth system would respond to increased biomass addition. The central processes driving this response are sensitive to choices about biomass type and storage site, and they span spatial and temporal scales from microns to kilometers and from minutes to millennia. To organize this interdisciplinary challenge, we define five generalizable phases for biomass-based marine carbon storage projects: inputs, placement, short-term response, long-term response, and functional stability. Each phase is associated with observational needs with characteristic spatial and temporal scales that could be met through direct field measurements, investigations of analog sites, experiments, and/or models. Predicting the effects of potential interventions over global and centennial scales will require the strategic integration of diverse observational types into process-based Earth System models that can be used to support planning. Beyond assessing carbon storage and ensuring regulatory compliance, future research should therefore prioritize generating the data required to improve models for impacts of biomass-based marine carbon storage at climatically-relevant scales."

However, the contributions of thermodynamic and dynamic processes resulting from internal climate variability and external forcing to the non-uniform warming rates remain unclear. In this study, we attribute the Eurasian multidecadal temperature variations by using a combination of low-frequency component analysis and the dynamical adjustment method. We show that anthropogenic forcing has caused pronounced non-linear warming, particularly over Europe–West Asia (EWA) and Northeast Asia (NEA). In contrast, internal variability is manifested as a meridional tripole pattern tightly linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Silk Road Pattern. Furthermore, we reveal that the forced SAT changes are strongly influenced by forced thermodynamic processes, which contribute more than 62.4% (62.4% – 99.5%) to the forced long-term warming over EWA and NEA. The contributions of internal thermodynamic and dynamic processes on decadal scales are more complex, as dynamic processes contribute ∼50% to the internal multidecadal SAT variations over NEA, while thermodynamic processes account for approximately 86% of the internal SAT variations over EWA. Our study not only detects and attributes multidecadal summer SAT variations, but also provides strong evidence for the decisive role of different thermodynamic and dynamic processes in the non-uniform multidecadal warming over Eurasia."

While this energy transition is still at an early phase, the risks of negative social and environmental impacts associated with the extraction of these materials are becoming increasingly apparent. The challenges associated with resource extraction are well documented. However, there are significant gaps in knowledge about how the energy transition reconfigures natural resource governance and how this shapes impacts from resource extraction. This knowledge is critical for understanding the full impact of transition policies, and for identifying opportunities for, and barriers, to more sustainable and just extractive practices. We contribute to addressing this gap by exploring how Indonesian nickel governance has been reconfigured and centralized in the context of early energy transition efforts, and examining the social and environmental impacts this is having in Sulawesi, Indonesia, one of the largest nickel production areas in the world. Drawing on 88 interviews and six focus group discussions with key stakeholders, we show that while this centralization has enabled a 14-fold increase in extraction rates over a 10 year period, it has also resulted in a series of well-known negative social and environmental impacts that degrade important ecosystem services and threaten health, livelihoods, and ways of life. Importantly, these impacts are exacerbated by the rapidly shrinking political space for local participation caused by the centralization of nickel governance, highlighting the tension between urgency in up-scaling extraction of energy transition materials and undertaking a just low-carbon transition. Reflecting and addressing this tension will be essential to designing policies that can achieve just outcomes while successfully addressing the current nature and climate crisis."

Here, some knowledge gaps and opportunities to narrow this gap are discussed. Merely adopting practices (e.g., regenerative agriculture, conservation agriculture, cover crops) based on their intended C benefits with limited consideration of the mechanisms affecting C gains will not result in significant atmospheric C capture in the soil profile. Biomass C input primarily drives soil C gains. Yet, the aboveground and belowground biomass C input in croplands even under improved practices such as no-till is mostly concentrated near the soil surface and, in some climates, does not exceed minimum thresholds. Low biomass productivity and limited biomass input into the soil profile probably constrain C gains more than other factors (e.g., initial soil C, C priming, duration, soil texture). Designing or redesigning strategies that photosynthetically capture some of the abundant atmospheric C in deeper soil profile should be first on our agenda. This includes introducing high aboveground and belowground biomass producing forages, perennials, and cover crops, while balancing with food production. C-depleted soils or marginally productive croplands may have a high potential for C storage, but climate, a strong predictor of biomass production, merits consideration. Overall, many factors affect C gains, but none probably are as critical as boosting biomass C input into the soil profile if the goal is to narrow the C gap."

This dataset can be used to explore carbon exchange, assess ecosystem responses to climate change, support upscaling studies, and evaluate carbon cycle models. 
 The eddy covariance (EC) technique is currently the most widely used method for measuring carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere at the ecosystem scale. Using this technique, a regional carbon flux network comprising a total of 34 sites has been established in the Heihe River basin (HRB) in northwest China. This network has been measuring the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 for a variety of vegetation types. In this study, we have compiled and post-processed half-hourly flux data from these 34 EC flux sites in the HRB to create a continuous, homogenized time series dataset. We employ standardized processing procedures to fill data gaps in meteorological and NEE measurements at half-hourly intervals. NEE measurements are also partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Furthermore, half-hourly meteorological and NEE data are aggregated into daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly timescales. As a result, we produced a continuous carbon flux and auxiliary meteorological dataset, which includes 18 sites with continuous multi-year observations during 2008–2022 and 16 sites observed only during the 2012 growing season, amounting to a total of 1513 site months. Evapotranspiration and energy flux measurements are also included. Using the post-processed dataset, we explored the temporal and spatial characteristics of carbon exchange in the HRB. In the diurnal variation curve, GPP, net carbon uptake, and Reco peak later for ecosystems in the artificial oasis (cropland and wetlands) compared to those outside the artificial oasis (grassland, forest, woodland, and Gobi/desert). Seasonal net carbon uptake, GPP, and Reco peak in early July for grassland, forest, woodland, and cropland but remain close to zero throughout the year for Gobi/desert. In the last decade, net carbon uptake of wetlands has significantly increased, while NEE for other ecosystems has not exhibited significant trends. Annual net carbon uptake, GPP, and Reco are significantly higher for sites inside the artificial/natural oasis compared to those outside the oasis. This post-processed carbon flux dataset has numerous applications, including exploring the carbon exchange characteristics of alpine and arid ecosystems, analyzing ecosystem responses to climate extremes, conducting cross-site synthesis from regional to global scales, supporting regional and global upscaling studies, interpreting and calibrating remote sensing products, and evaluating and calibrating carbon cycle models.

Gingerich,Spatially-Resolved Analysis of Water Use for Vapor Compression and Evaporative Air Conditioning Systems for Commercial Buildings in the United States,"Shifting from electricity-reliant vapor compression (VC) air conditioning systems toward alternatives like evaporative cooling (EC) is one strategy being considered to reduce energy use and electricity demand associated with space cooling in the United States (U.S.). However, little work has been done to understand other environmental consequences of this potential shift. In this work, we assess the consumptive water use of these two technologies for nine commercial building archetypes across the continental U.S. To do so, we modeled on-site water use for EC, electric energy consumed by both VC and EC systems, and water consumed by electricity generation at a regional level. We find that while indirect water use for EC systems is less than that of VC systems by approximately 50%, EC systems consume around 5–8 times as much water overall, owing to their on-site water use. The largest differences occur in the hot, humid climates of the Southeastern U.S. due to the region’s large cooling needs and saturated atmosphere. Together, these findings indicate the need to design EC systems that include condensation steps in more closed-loop designs."

This study addresses this critical knowledge void by utilizing a whole-body inhalation exposure system to investigate the distribution, accumulation, and pulmonary toxicity of polystyrene MP/NP (1.5 × 105 particles/m3) in male ICR mice (n = 16/group). Fluorescently labeled MP/NP revealed the highest particle accumulation in the lungs, followed by the bloodstream and spleen, with minimal detection in the brain. Unsurprisingly, 80 nm nanoplastics displayed greater intertissue transport efficiency than 1 μm microplastics. Chronic exposure to both microplastics and nanoplastics disrupted oxidative balance and exacerbated oxidative stress within the extracellular environment of the lungs. The impaired antioxidant defenses and disrupted intra- and extracellular metabolism led to inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Intriguingly, 1 μm microplastics induced more severe pulmonary toxicity than their smaller counterparts, promoting epithelial–mesenchymal transition and fibrosis.

Large bioaerosols can be formed by pollen, fungal spores, and cell debris. However, the abundance, dynamics, and composition of large marine aerosols remain poorly understood. This study observed wave and atmospheric conditions driving aerosol production, the resulting SSA abundance, and sizes (up to 90 μm), and collected collocated SSA samples for microscopy analysis during a two-month time period. SSA above 20 μm were frequently observed, containing a diverse range of intact phytoplankton cells, including small flagellates (2 μm), to diatoms, and colonial cells (above 40 μm). The abundance of small flagellates suggests that sea-to-air transfer may be an important, yet overlooked, dispersal mechanism for these groups.

Because of favorable solubility differences, these wastes can be repurposed for engineered carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration. Understanding the fate and mobility of heavy metals during this process is important. This study focuses on Pb and the effect of zinc (Zn) on Pb in carbon mineralization. Synthesized gypsum was treated with a carbonate-rich solution at pH 11.5 to convert the sulfates to carbonates. Aqueous solutions and mineral solids were analyzed. Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence and a novel application of Pb M3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure provided detailed insights into Pb distribution and mineral forms. Results showed significant reductions in aqueous Pb and Zn concentrations, indicating effective metal sequestration. Carbon mineralization transformed Pb from soluble anglesite (PbSO4) into insoluble cerussite (PbCO3) and hydrocerussite (Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2). Pb primarily precipitated onto calcium carbonate surfaces through surface-mediated precipitation reactions. While the presence of Zn modified crystallization dynamics, it did not impede Pb sequestration and potentially enhanced surface reactivity, facilitating greater Pb immobilization.

In this study, the environmental formation of OH-sulfonated and sulfonated PCBs was shown for the first time in treatments using eight PCB congeners as a carbon source in a flask experiment. Here, 10 environmental inocula from different sources were tested to evaluate, in a semiquantitative way, the formation of OH-sulfonated and sulfonated PCBs. OH-PCBs were also monitored, as they represent one of the first degradation steps of PCBs. All inocula could generate these metabolites, although the number of congeners varied greatly. In general, OH-PCBs and OH-sulfonated PCBs were produced at the highest concentrations. For sulfonated PCBs, the highest number of congeners was produced from an inoculum derived from plant leaves and from a PCB-contaminated site.

Freeze–thaw cycles commonly occur in the atmosphere, surface water, and soil in cold regions; however, their effects on Hg(0) oxidation, particularly during environmentally relevant freeze–thaw processes, remain unknown. Here, we investigated the freeze-induced dark oxidation of Hg(0) by potential reactive oxygen species under controlled freeze–thaw conditions. Freeze–thaw cycles (25 to −20 to 25 °C and 10 to −10 to 10 °C) accelerated the oxidation of Hg(0) compared with constant 25/10 °C, especially in acidic solutions (pH 4.0). Subsequent characterization and radical quenching experiments confirmed that the spontaneously produced hydroxyl radical (•OH) was the predominant oxidant responsible for Hg(0) oxidation. Notably, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) loading at environmental levels did not accelerate Hg(0) oxidation, suggesting that the observed oxidation is distinct from the mechanism of the freeze-concentration effect (Hg(0) and H2O2 enrichment increase the oxidation rate) as previously documented. This work demonstrated a novel pathway for Hg(0) oxidation driven by the spontaneous production of •OH at the liquid–ice interface, independent of H2O2.

Using double‐cylinder shear experiments on wet granular systems as analogs for landslide lateral faults, we observe anomalous shear stress variations with fluid volume fractions, defying an expected unimodal relationship associated with capillary cohesion. At low fluid volume fractions, shear strength weakens as the wet grain assembly experiences reduced lateral pressure and increased boundary slip. This boundary slip subsequently vanishes, with an abrupt strengthening due to the dilation of the grain assembly against fluid surface tension as saturation approaches. Strike‐slip motion and confinement in this system explain the strength anomaly, highlighting a critical role of lateral faults in landslide stability, particularly in cases where dynamics cannot be adequately explained by monitored pore‐water pressure or basal friction."

However, the mechanisms driving this connection remain unclear. By analyzing a high‐resolution, three‐dimensional baroclinic ocean reanalysis, we identify a pathway that links open ocean dynamics to SAB coastal sea level variability through the shelf edge near Cape Hatteras. Gulf Stream meanders in this region induce sea level fluctuations that propagate along the entire SAB shelf. Using an idealized barotropic model, we further demonstrate that topographic waves mediate the propagation of the Gulf Stream signal onto the shelf. Moreover, the Gulf Stream variability is driven by zonal wind stress in the Northwest Atlantic, which is likely modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation. These findings offer new insights into regional sea level prediction and contribute to broader climate research efforts."

Various surface elements in drylands are closely related and studying their long‐term coupling processes and mechanisms is beneficial for managing global warming impacts on drylands. This article reports on a new aeolian sedimentary sequence since the Last Deglaciation (LD) in Hexi Corridor. Combined with our previous eolian and lacustrine sedimentary sequences in the surrounding area, we found a unique regional climate‐water‐dust coupling process. This coupled pattern is a combined response to Northern Hemisphere solar radiation, ice sheets, and North Atlantic freshwater forcing since the LD. The melting of permafrost during the LD period and substantial erosion of the rivers originating in the Qilian Mountains jointly destroyed the stability of the surface conditions in the Hexi Corridor. Alluvial fans in the plain released a large amount of dust, which quickly accumulated in the upstream mountainous areas after transportation, thereby forming a dust cycle. However, the warmer Middle Holocene experienced stable surface conditions and weak dust activity owing to abundant water resources. As human activities continue to intensify, the climate‐water‐dust coupling process in this region is closely related to human interference with the surface environment, which is entirely different from the situation where natural processes predominate.

However, there have been few systemic assessments of the response of orbital‐scale East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variability to the iNHG, partly due to controversies regarding the interpretation of the dominant orbital rhythms of the EASM. Here, we present grain size and other proxy records from mainly silt‐sized lacustrine‐fluvial deposits in northern China. The results shows that the EASM underwent stepwise weakening at ∼2.7 and ∼1.8 Ma, coincident with two major cooling steps of the global climate and that its dominant orbital periodicity changed from ∼41 kyr during ∼3.6–2.7 Ma, to ∼100 kyr during ∼2.7–1.8 Ma. However, these findings are inconsistent with the strengthening of the 41‐kyr cyclicity in marine δ18O records after the iNHG, whereas they are consistent with northern high‐latitude sea surface temperature records that bear the imprint of local climate signals when the Arctic ice sheets were of limited extent during the Early Pleistocene. We propose that the dominant ∼41‐kyr cyclicity during the Late Pliocene resulted from obliquity‐induced changes in the meridional insolation gradient, or in heat and moisture transport from low latitudes; whereas the dominant ∼100‐kyr cyclicity during ∼2.7–1.8 Ma reflects an increased response to northern high‐latitude forcing. Our findings, combined with previous studies, highlight the importance of eccentricity in modulating the EASM and other key climate system components prior to the Mid‐Pleistocene Transition during the course of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation."

Matthews,Physical Controls on the Variability of Offshore Propagation of Convection From Sumatra,"Previous work has explained the physical mechanisms behind nocturnal offshore propagation of convection southwest of Sumatra. Low‐level moisture flux convergence due to the land breeze front controls the progression of convection, typically a squall line, away from the coast overnight. However, the diurnal convection over the mountains occurs on only 57% of days in December–February (DJF) and propagates offshore on only 49% of those days. We investigate day‐to‐day variability in dynamical and thermodynamical conditions to explain the variability in diurnal convection and offshore propagation, using a convection‐permitting simulation run for 900 DJF days. A convolutional neural network is used to identify regimes of the diurnal cycle and offshore propagation behavior. The diurnal cycle and offshore propagation are most likely to occur ahead of an active Madden‐Julian oscillation, or during El Niño or positive Indian Ocean Dipole; however, any regime can occur in any phase of these large‐scale drivers, because the major control arises from the local scale. When the diurnal cycle of convection occurs over land, low‐level wind is generally onshore, providing convergence over the mountains, and low‐level humidity over the mountains is high enough to make the air column unstable for moist convection. When this convection propagates offshore, midlevel offshore winds provide a steering flow, combined with stronger convergence offshore due to more onshore environmental winds. Low‐level moisture around the coast also means that as the convection propagates, the storm‐relative inflow of air into the system adds greater instability than would be the case on other days."

This paper extends the investigation to both the US Rocky Mountain (RM) region and the TP, considering the 1998 summer drought/flood event in North America/East Asia, respectively, as a case study. A previously developed initialization method for land surface temperature/subsurface temperature (LST/SUBT) is used in the NCEP Global Forecast System, coupled with a land model, SSiB2 (GFS/SSiB2), to produce observed RM cold May temperature anomaly. Forward simulation yields June precipitation anomalies at five remote locations. Likewise, the TP warm May temperature anomaly also produces June precipitation anomalies at these five locations. The effects of RM (cold) and TP (warm) temperature anomalies are consistent in the US South Coastal regions and the south Yangtze River Basin, yielding 49% (42%) of observed drought and 34% (44%) of observed flood, respectively. These LST/SUBT effects in RM and TP induce a global large‐scale wave train linking North America with the TP, affecting the subtropical westerly jet and thereby modulating summer precipitation. Global SST effect is examined for comparison but does not yield statistically significant June precipitation anomalies in GFS/SSiB2.

The North Pacific (NP) AR climatology in the boreal winter to early fall seasons in a QBO easterly (QBOE) phase is systematically shifted poleward compared with those in a QBO westerly (QBOW) phase, and such difference peaks in the local late spring season. We also find the similar poleward shift for the AR climatology over the South Pacific (SP) in the austral winter seasons in the QBOE phase. A significant equatorward shift and an overall enhancement of the AR climatology over the SP are observed in the QBOE phase during local spring and summer seasons, respectively. The QBO impacts on the AR climatology over the Atlantic Ocean are less organized. Strong QBO impacts exist in almost all seasons for the North Atlantic AR but only in the austral spring season for the South Atlantic AR. These QBO modulations of the AR climatology over the ocean basins also change the season‐mean AR frequencies around coastal regions, suggesting significant QBO impacts on the local land‐falling AR events. The QBO modulations of the seasonal background mean states and the MJO‐teleconnections are two potential mechanisms mostly over the north hemisphere. The QBOE modulation of the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO)‐teleconnection over the northern hemisphere is asymmetric between the MJO convection over the Indian Ocean and that over the Pacific Ocean, which is the key to explain the QBO influences on the AR activity on the seasonal timescale."

Before implementing OAE at climate‐relevant scales, questions about its safety and verifiability must be addressed. Operational deployment poses a dilemma between pursuing large detectability, essential for effective monitoring, reporting, and verification, and ensuring environmental safety and satisfying regulatory requirements. In this study, we present a computationally efficient approach, based on a high‐resolution, coupled circulation‐dissolution model of Halifax Harbor, to simulating the addition, transportation, dissolution, and sinking of various theoretical alkaline feedstocks for different dosages, seasons, and addition sites. Detectability and exposure risk of OAE are quantified and an approach for optimizing OAE deployment is demonstrated. Mean residence times (MRT) are calculated for different subregions and seasons. Results show that for a given amount of feedstock, summer is more favorable from the perspective of detectability but also creates higher exposure risks than other seasons because of a longer MRT. The exposure risk can be mitigated while maintaining large detectability by choosing optimal feedstocks with different characteristics for different seasons. The exposure risk can also be reduced by spreading alkalinity over multiple addition sites. The optimum allocation, where the largest detectability is sought without violating regulatory requirements, is specific to each season, dosage, and choice of feedstock. OAE deployments should be tailored taking into account local hydrography, season, dosage, and feedstock characteristics. Our approach provides a practical avenue for optimizing deployments."

 Deracemization is an emerging strategy for generating enantioenriched compounds wherein the two enantiomers of a readily available racemic starting material are transformed into a single enantiomer, typically through the action of a light-induced catalyst1,2. Excellent proof of principle for this potentially powerful approach to asymmetric catalysis has been described3–8; nevertheless, substantial challenges have not yet been addressed, including the exploitation of carbon–heteroatom (rather than only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon) bond cleavage to achieve deracemization, as well as the development of processes that provide broad classes of useful enantioenriched compounds and tetrasubstituted stereocentres. Here we describe a straightforward method that addresses these challenges, using a chiral copper catalyst, generated in situ from commercially available components, to achieve the photoinduced deracemization of tertiary (and secondary) alkyl halides through carbon–halogen bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies (including the independent synthesis of postulated intermediates, photophysical, spectroscopic and reactivity studies, and density functional theory calculations) provide support for the key steps and intermediates in our proposed catalytic cycle, as well as insight into the origin of enantioselectivity.

 Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia1–5. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects6–9. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system10. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence. Using a natural experiment that avoids common bias concerns, this study finds that the live-attenuated shingles vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis within a follow-up period of 7 years by approximately one-fifth."

 Accumulating evidence indicates that antibiotic exposure may lead to impaired vaccine responses1–4; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Here we prospectively followed 191 healthy, vaginally born, term infants from birth to 15 months, using a systems vaccinology approach to assess the effects of antibiotic exposure on immune responses to vaccination. Exposure to direct neonatal but not intrapartum antibiotics was associated with significantly lower antibody titres against various polysaccharides in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate and diphtheria toxoid antigens in the combined 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine at 7 months of age. Blood from infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics had an inflammatory transcriptional profile before vaccination; in addition, faecal metagenomics showed reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species in these infants at the time of vaccination, which was correlated with reduced vaccine antibody titres 6 months later. In preclinical models, responses to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were strongly dependent on an intact microbiota but could be restored in germ-free mice by administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species or a probiotic already widely used in neonatal units. Our data suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could mitigate the detrimental effects of early-life antibiotics on vaccine immunogenicity.

 Photons can carry angular momentum, which is conventionally attributed to two constituents—spin angular momentum (SAM), which is an intrinsic property related to the polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is related to the photon spatial distribution. In paraxial optics, these two forms of angular momentum are separable1, such that entanglement can be induced between the SAM and the OAM of a single photon2,3 or of different photons in a multi-photon state4. In nanophotonic systems, however, the SAM and the OAM of a photon are inseparable5,6, so only the total angular momentum (TAM) serves as a good quantum number7–9. Here we present the observation of non-classical correlations between two photons in the near-field regime, giving rise to entanglement related to the TAM. We entangle those nanophotonic states by coupling photon pairs to plasmonic modes and use quantum imaging techniques10,11 to measure their correlations. We observe that entanglement in TAM leads to a completely different structure of quantum correlations of photon pairs, compared with entanglement related to the two constituent angular momenta.

 Although Earth, together with other terrestrial planets, must have had an early-formed protocrust, the chemical composition of this crust has received little attention. The protocrust was extracted from an extensive magma ocean formed by accretion and melting of asteroidal bodies1. Both experimental and chronological data suggest that the silicate melt ascending from this magma ocean formed in equilibrium with, or after, metal was extracted to form Earth’s core. Here we show that a protocrust formed under these conditions would have had incompatible (with respect to silicate minerals) trace-element characteristics remarkably similar to those of the current average continental crust. This has major implications for subsequent planetary evolution. Many geochemical arguments for when and how plate tectonics began implicitly assume that subduction is required to produce the continental trace-element signature. These arguments are severely compromised if this signature was already a feature of the Hadean protocrust.

 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximized metal use and discrete energy levels hold promise for broad applications in heterogeneous catalysis, energy conversion, environmental science and biomedicine1–7. The activity and stability of SACs are governed by the pair of metal–adsorbate and metal–support interactions8–10. However, the understanding of these interactions with their catalytic performance in nature is challenging. Correlations of activity with the charge state of metal atoms have frequently reached controversial conclusions11–15. Here we report that the activity of palladium (Pd1) SACs exhibits a linear scaling relationship with the positions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of oxide supports across 14 types of semiconductor. Elevation of the LUMO position by reducing the support particle size to a few nanometres boosts a record high activity along with excellent stability in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. We show that the elevated LUMO of support reduces its energy gap with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Pd1 atoms, which promotes Pd1–support orbital hybridizations for high stability and further amends the LUMO of anchored Pd1 atoms to enhance Pd1–adsorbate interactions for high activity.

 Temporary pacemakers are essential for the care of patients with short-lived bradycardia in post-operative and other settings1–4. Conventional devices require invasive open-heart surgery or less invasive endovascular surgery, both of which are challenging for paediatric and adult patients5–8. Other complications9–11 include risks of infections, lacerations and perforations of the myocardium, and of displacements of external power supplies and control systems. Here we introduce a millimetre-scale bioresorbable optoelectronic system with an onboard power supply and a wireless, optical control mechanism with generalized capabilities in electrotherapy and specific application opportunities in temporary cardiac pacing. The extremely small sizes of these devices enable minimally invasive implantation, including percutaneous injection and endovascular delivery. Experimental studies demonstrate effective pacing in mouse, rat, porcine, canine and human cardiac models at both single-site and multi-site locations. Pairing with a skin-interfaced wireless device allows autonomous, closed-loop operation upon detection of arrhythmias. Further work illustrates opportunities in combining these miniaturized devices with other medical implants, with an example of arrays of pacemakers for individual or collective use on the frames of transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems, to provide unique solutions that address risks for atrioventricular block following surgeries. This base technology can be readily adapted for a broad range of additional applications in electrotherapy, such as nerve and bone regeneration, wound therapy and pain management.

 Recently the quest for post-silicon semiconductors has escalated owing to the inherent limitations of conventional bulk semiconductors, which are plagued by issues such as drain-induced barrier lowering, interfacial-scattering-induced mobility degradation and a constrained current on/off ratio determined by semiconductor bandwidth. These challenges have prompted the search for more advanced materials, with atomic-layer-thick two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors emerging as a potential solution. Following over a decade of research advances, recent developments1–3 in wafer-scale growth and device fabrication have led to breakthroughs in 2D semiconductor electronics. However, the level of integration remains constrained to a few hundred transistors. We describe a reduced instruction set computing architecture (RISC-V) microprocessor capable of executing standard 32-bit instructions on 5,900 MoS2 transistors and a complete standard cell library based on 2D semiconductor technology. The library contains 25 types of logic units. In alignment with advances in silicon integrated circuits, we also co-optimized the process flow and design of the 2D logic circuits. Our combined manufacturing and design methodology has overcome the significant challenges associated with wafer-scale integration of 2D circuits and enabled a pioneering prototype of an MoS2 microprocessor that exemplifies the potential of 2D integrated-circuit technology beyond silicon.

 Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses1–4. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity5,6, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells7–9. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics’ behavioural actions10. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin’s ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin’s effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action.

 Thromboinflammation occurs in various diseases, leading to life-threatening microvascular occlusion with resulting end-organ failure1–4. Importantly, how microvascular thromboinflammation resolves remains poorly understood due to the small size-scale of microvasculature and the long duration (weeks to months) of this process. Here we introduce a hydrogel-based thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model with long-term culture capabilities to model microvascular thromboinflammation and monitor clot resolution over clinically and physiologically relevant timescales (up to months). Using this system, we mapped out the distinct temporal phases of clot resolution in microvascular thromboinflammation. Using multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with our thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model, we observed that inflammation shifts the endothelium fibrinolytic balance to favour thrombosis and pinpointed neutrophil elastase as a double-edged sword that induces clot resolution but also tissue damage. We then investigated the mechanisms of potential therapeutic agents that either prevent microvascular thrombosis or accelerate clot resolution. Specifically, we observed that, in thromboinflammation, (1) early tissue plasminogen activator administration within 3 h directly improves endothelial barrier function; (2) prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms; and (3) combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease. These data introduce a paradigm in investigating the underlying mechanisms of thromboinflammatory clot resolution and conducting drug discovery thereof.

Witten,A neural mechanism for learning from delayed postingestive feedback,"Illness signals from the gut reactivate and strengthen flavour representations in the amygdala to support learning from delayed postingestive feedback. 
 Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic1–10 and preferences to those that are nutritious11–13. However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel14,15, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback. Illness signals from the gut reactivate and strengthen flavour representations in the amygdala to support learning from delayed postingestive feedback."

 Anthropogenic biodiversity decline threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the many benefits they provide to humanity1. As well as causing species losses in directly affected locations, human influence might also reduce biodiversity in relatively unmodified vegetation if far-reaching anthropogenic effects trigger local extinctions and hinder recolonization. Here we show that local plant diversity is globally negatively related to the level of anthropogenic activity in the surrounding region. Impoverishment of natural vegetation was evident only when we considered community completeness: the proportion of all suitable species in the region that are present at a site. To estimate community completeness, we compared the number of recorded species with the dark diversity—ecologically suitable species that are absent from a site but present in the surrounding region2. In the sampled regions with a minimal human footprint index, an average of 35% of suitable plant species were present locally, compared with less than 20% in highly affected regions. Besides having the potential to uncover overlooked threats to biodiversity, dark diversity also provides guidance for nature conservation. Species in the dark diversity remain regionally present, and their local populations might be restored through measures that improve connectivity between natural vegetation fragments and reduce threats to population persistence. A comparison of alpha diversity (number of plant species) and dark diversity (species that are currently absent from a site despite being ecologically suitable) demonstrates the negative effects of regional-scale anthropogenic activity on plant diversity."

 Flowering plant sexual reproduction requires double fertilization, yielding embryo and endosperm seed compartments: the latter supports embryo growth and seed germination. In an experiment to generate haploid embryos through inhibition of pollen phospholipase activity in sunflower (Helianthus annus), we serendipitously discovered that emasculated sunflowers spontaneously form parthenogenic haploid seed. Exploration of genetic, chemical and environmental factors demonstrated that a specific genotype background enabled high parthenogenesis and that full spectrum high-intensity light supplementation boosted parthenogenesis, yielding hundreds of haploid seeds per head. Induction of doubled haploid plants can greatly accelerate plant breeding efficiency; however, despite successful engineering of haploid induction in many crops, few reported systems are commercially scalable1. Here we report efficient methods of chemical emasculation and genome doubling to produce fertile plants and enable a scalable sunflower doubled haploid system.

 Human RAD52 is a multifunctional DNA repair protein involved in several cellular events that support genome stability, including protection of stalled DNA replication forks from excessive degradation1–4. In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress, protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1 motor3. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses, we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1.

 Inhaled therapeutics have high potential for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases of high unmet medical need, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Preclinical and early clinical evidence show that cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), previously called connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is a promising target for the treatment of IPF.

 Abundant geomorphological, biological, and isotopic records show that Arabia repeatedly underwent significant climate-driven environmental changes during late Quaternary humid periods. Precisely mapping how the enhancement and expansion of the African Monsoon during these humid periods have affected landscape evolution and human occupation dynamics in Arabia remains a scientific challenge. Here we reconstruct an ancient water-sculpted landscape consisting of lake and river deposits, coupled with a large outlet valley in the Rub’ al Khali Desert of Saudi Arabia. During the peak of the Holocene Humid Period or before, intense rainfall reactivated alluvial floodplains and filled a ~1100 km² topographic depression, which eventually breached, carving a deep ~150 km-long valley. Coupling geologic reconstructions with transient Earth system model simulations shows that this hydrological activity was linked to higher seasonal precipitation punctuated by repeated heavy events. Analysis of lacustrine and fluvial sedimentary deposits implies sediment routing across distances of up to 1000 km from the Asir Mountains. Our results indicate that such intense flooding challenges the conventional view of simple, weak, and linear landscape stabilization following increased rainfall in Arabia. Our findings highlight the crucial role of an enhanced African Monsoon in driving rapid landscape transformations in the Arabian Desert.

 The capacity of mangroves to reduce coastal flood risk resulted in legislation for mandatory widths of mangrove greenbelts in several countries with mangrove presence. Prescribed forest widths vary between 50 and 200 m. Here, we performed 216,000 numerical model runs informed by realistic conditions to quantify confidence in wave reduction capacity of mangroves for wind and swell waves. This analysis highlights that tidal flat areas fronting mangrove forests already account for 70% of reduction in wave heights. Within mangrove forests that are below 500 m wide, wave dissipation is strongly dependent on local water levels, wave characteristics and forest density. For forest widths of over 500 m, which constitute 46% of global coastal mangroves, around 75% or more of the incoming wave energy is dissipated. Hence, for relying on mangroves to dampen shorter waves, a new standard should be adopted that strives for mangrove widths of 500 m or more.

 Phytoplankton play a major role in carbon export and storage in the ocean interior through remineralization of particulate carbon into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and represent the “gain” side of the biological carbon pump. Shifts in phytoplankton community structure and species succession impact primary production, quality of food for zooplankton consumers and the fate of organic matter in marine ecosystems.In the Labrador Sea (LS), a sub-arctic environment, the emergence of large blooms of Phaeocystis spp. in spring at the expenses of diatoms may disrupt phytoplankton species succession with drastic consequences on the carbon cycle and the functioning of the marine ecosystem as these small flagellates aggregate in colonies of up to several millimeters, embedded in gelatinous matrices, that modify elemental stoichiometry, sinking rates and transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. In this study, we develop an ecological approach to estimate primary production due to Phaeocystis sp. in the LS from satellite remote sensing data. We used a regionally-tuned primary production model to assign phytoplankton photosynthesis efficiency as a function of oceanographic regimes defined by phytoplankton community structure and biomass, and sea-surface temperature. We found that four oceanographic regimes corresponded to broad phytoplankton taxonomic assemblages and environmental factors in the LS: the diatom-dominated Shelf, the low chlorophyll-a Basin, the mesotrophic Basin regimes and a last oceanographic regime within the Basin, where the flagellated prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis spp. likely dominated the assemblage. Annual primary production in the Labrador Sea varied between 200 and 300 Tg of carbon between 2014 and 2022 in agreement with previous studies. While Phaeocystis spp. contributed about 10 % of the annual production, two unusual blooms that occurred in 2015 and 2022 contributed about 14 and 20 % of total production, respectively. During these two events Phaeocystis sp. contributed 40 % and 60 % to the May production and extended over more than half the Labrador Sea. Spring blooms dominated by Phaeocystis may occur more frequently due to climate change and have the potential to impact the fate of carbon and alter the functioning of the LS ecosystem."

 Seasonal phenological transformations alter tree appearances, notably by influencing the size and color of the foliage. It has long been anticipated that such phenology induced characteristics can help address the tree-species recognition problem, a fundamental challenge in forest science. Yet, studies on tree-species recognition using remote sensing and phenological characteristics have been rare, due to the very limited availability of high spatiotemporal resolution observations. Moreover, the interactions between the effectiveness of phenological characteristics, remote sensing data, and the analytical methodologies have not yet been sufficiently explored. The understanding of how to integrate multi-temporal observations and phenological characteristics in tree-species recognition has been lacking. This study aims to identify principles for optimizing species recognition by combining data, methods, and phenological dynamics. This involves understanding the impact factors of various methodologies, and how they interact with phenological characteristics and datasets at different times and/or frequencies. The study was carried out using multi-temporal high-resolution optical images of a temperate forest, which were collected in 2021 during leaf growth and senescence periods between May and October, i.e., three leaf growth (May–August) and three leaf senescence (September–October) periods. The test site comprised 14 different tree classes, including 11 species, 2 genera, and 1 dead tree class. The experimental results showed that, for deep learning approaches, the current main limitations in the tree species recognition lie in sample imbalance as the targeted species number increases. With the state-of-the-art data and methods, distinguishing between species within a same genus is much more challenging than differentiating between species from different genera or families. It is also revealed that the best timing for tree species classification is early autumn (September) or late spring (May) when a single-temporal (one-timepoint) data is applied; all-temporal (six-timepoint) data improves the recognition results in comparison with single-temporal observations; however, the improvements from adding additional timepoints became marginal after two timepoint are used with one from late spring and other from early autumn. Furthermore, prior knowledge of individual crown boundaries, typically obtained through individual tree crown delineation, is essential for efficiently incorporating phenological variations into species recognition."

 Forest productivity, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in California and the Western United States are closely tied to fire. However, fire regimes are shifting toward larger, more severe fires driven by factors such as high fuel loads and increased temperature and aridity. While multispectral satellite (e.g., Landsat) burn indices provide valuable insights into fire severity, they primarily capture top-of-canopy greenness, missing important sub-canopy changes in vegetation structure and residual fuels. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar mission provides current and consistent, near-global 3D forest structure measurements, enabling detailed assessment of forest changes from disturbances such as wildfire. This study utilized near-coincident, bitemporal pre- and post-fire GEDI on-orbit measurements to analyze structural changes across thirty-four large California wildfires (2019 to 2021). We examined twelve GEDI-based forest structure metrics representing a variety of 3D fuels properties, including forest height, low-stature fuels, biomass, canopy heterogeneity, volume and cover. Our broad goals were to: 1) assess GEDI's ability to detect structural changes in burned areas relative to control areas; and 2) in burned areas, explore relationships between forest structural change and factors such as pre-fire fuel loads, Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), topographic slope, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit, evapotranspiration, and time since fire. Results showed significant structural loss in all GEDI structural metrics for burned areas relative to nearby controls. Pre-fire fuel loads measured by GEDI metrics were the strongest predictors of post-fire structural change, with linear models explaining an average of 46 % of variance. Model slopes showed increasing levels of pre-fire fuels were associated with large, significant post-fire decreases in canopy structure – that is, more fuels lead to higher wildfire severity, particularly for conifer forests of the Klamath, Cascades and Sierra Nevada ecoregions. One metric, measuring the proportion of waveform energy below 10 m height, increased significantly after fire in mixed and conifer forests due to canopy opening, which enhanced lidar penetration toward the ground. In contrast, the widely-used dNBR burn severity index was less correlated with GEDI-based forest structural change than pre-fire fuels, particularly in sub-canopy fuels, with models explaining no more than 32 % of the variance (average 19 %). GEDI overcomes key limitations of airborne lidar, including high cost, limited extent, and data latency, enabling scalable and timely assessments of wildfire impacts needed to manage fuels and track forest resilience and recovery. Further, GEDI metrics are physically-based and ecologically interpretable, providing complimentary information to multispectral burn severity indices."

 Internal solitary waves (ISW) are widespread in global oceans, and satellite/in-situ observations showed that the Banda Sea has frequent ISW activities, characterized by long-wave crests, fast propagation speeds, and large amplitudes exceeding 100 m. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive ISW study in the Banda Sea to reveal ISW characteristics by collecting 417 synthetic aperture radar and optical images from 2013 to 2019. The constructed dataset comprises 134 pairs of matched satellite images and a total of 12,021 ISW propagation vectors were extracted. Satellite observation reveals that ISWs in the Banda Sea mainly originate from the Ombai Strait and propagate northward, with an average propagation speed of over 2.50 m/s and with seasonal variation of less than 20 %. To forecast ISW propagations, we developed a physics-informed neural network ISW forecast model combining the classic Eikonal Eq. (EE) and the data-driven AI algorithms following a two-step transfer learning scheme. The forecast model employs a three-hidden-layer structure with 512 nodes in each layer. Firstly, the hybrid model includes ISW physics by setting the EE as the loss function. The second step is the data-driven process, which exploits a fully connected neural network and collected ISW dataset to improve EE-based model performance by 61 % with a loss function of the mean squared error. Through the two-step training, the forecast model adopts ISW physics and also benefits from the high accuracy of the data-driven process. We randomly selected 188/118 satellite images from the built dataset to serve as the training/test dataset for the data-driven process. After the second-step training, the root mean square (average) error of the model-predicted ISW propagation time reduced from 2.59 (2.37) h to 1.01 (−0.01) h. Error analysis shows that the data-driven process can efficiently correct the systematic error in the first-step model, which stems from errors in determining the ISW source and the propagation speed distribution map. Using the developed model, we predicted the propagation time of the ISWs and compared these predictions with satellite observations and in-situ observations. The comparison showed a high degree of agreement regarding the ISWs' location and their wave crests' geometry between model predictions and satellite/in-situ observations. Key differences between the proposed model and previous models are discussed."

 The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, placing tundra ecosystems at the forefront of global climate change. Plant biomass is a fundamental ecosystem attribute that is sensitive to changes in climate, closely tied to ecological function, and crucial for constraining ecosystem carbon dynamics. However, the amount, functional composition, and distribution of plant biomass are only coarsely quantified across the Arctic. Therefore, we developed the first moderate resolution (30 m) maps of live aboveground plant biomass (g m−2) and woody plant dominance (%) for the Arctic tundra biome, including the mountainous Oro Arctic. We modeled biomass for the year 2020 using a new synthesis dataset of field biomass harvest measurements, Landsat satellite seasonal synthetic composites, ancillary geospatial data, and machine learning models. Additionally, we quantified pixel-wise uncertainty in biomass predictions using Monte Carlo simulations and validated the models using a robust, spatially blocked and nested cross-validation procedure. Observed plant and woody plant biomass values ranged from 0 to ∼6000 g m−2 (mean ≈ 350 g m−2), while predicted values ranged from 0 to ∼4000 g m−2 (mean ≈ 275 g m−2), resulting in model validation root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) ≈ 400 g m−2 and R2 ≈ 0.6. Our maps not only capture large-scale patterns of plant biomass and woody plant dominance across the Arctic that are linked to climatic variation (e.g., thawing degree days), but also illustrate how fine-scale patterns are shaped by local surface hydrology, topography, and past disturbance. By providing data on plant biomass across Arctic tundra ecosystems at the highest resolution to date, our maps can significantly advance research and inform decision-making on topics ranging from Arctic vegetation monitoring and wildlife conservation to carbon accounting and land surface modeling."

 Efficient and accurate extraction of road networks from high-resolution satellite images is essential for urban planning, construction, and traffic management. Recently, various road datasets and advances in deep learning models have greatly enhanced road extraction techniques. However, challenges remain when trying to apply existing research to rural areas. Specifically, most public road datasets focus on urban areas and only contain a small number of rural scenes with complex backgrounds. The application of current public datasets for rural road extraction is challenging due to significant stylistic differences between urban and rural roads. In this article, a large-scale high-resolution remote sensing road dataset, termed WHU-RuR+, is proposed for rural road extraction, which contains 36,098 pairs of 1024 × 1024 high-resolution satellite images with the corresponding road annotation, covering a 6866.35 km2 of rural areas in eight countries around the world.

 Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) from uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for assessing forest structures. Maximizing data completeness and representativeness is essential to accurately retrieve key structural parameters. However, knowledge on how data acquisition approaches affect canopy volume exploration is sparse. This study investigated the effects of selected sensing and flight settings on canopy occlusion in a central European forest using a cost-effective sensor system. We conducted 44 flights with a DJI Matrice 300 RTK UAV and a DJI Zenmuse L1 LiDAR sensor, with different combinations of flight speed, azimuthal flight directions, sensor tilt angles, and scan patterns. Using sensor position reconstruction and a ray tracing algorithm to quantify occlusion, we found that: (1) A larger sensor tilt angle up to 15° increased total occlusion, enhancing exploration in the upper canopy, while decreasing it below due to reduced canopy penetration. (2) Flying multiple azimuthal directions with a linear scanning mode reduced vertical occlusion by up to 15.0% due to improved coverage from diverse perspectives. (3) Lissajous scanning patterns resulted in 10.1% less vertical occlusion compared to linear patterns, underscoring the importance of additional viewing angles. Based on these findings, we recommend: (a) incorporating nadir sampling for below-canopy assessment; (b) using off-nadir angles for upper canopy evaluation; and (c) maximizing sampling perspectives and viewing angles to reduce occlusion effects. Our results offer transferable insights to optimize UAV LiDAR data acquisitions, thereby contributing to an enhanced structural metric retrieval and improved analysis of forest functional properties."

 Prenol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol), a second-generation biofuel, is released in the atmosphere during its use and storage where it can react with atmospheric oxidants. In this study, the ozonolysis reaction of prenol was investigated in two atmospheric simulation chambers CHARME (CHamber for the Atmospheric Reactivity and Metrology of the Environment) and THALAMOS (Thermally Regulated Atmospheric Simulation Chamber). PTR-ToF-MS and SIFT-MS were used to monitor the concentrations of organic compounds versus time. The room temperature (293 ± 2 K) rate coefficient was determined using the relative and pseudo-first order methods. The values obtained using both methods in the two chambers were in accordance, leading to an average rate coefficient of (3.26 ± 0.33) × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The temperature-dependent rate coefficient of this reaction was also investigated using the relative method in the temperature range 283–353 K. The following Arrhenius expression: k=(9.83±1.7)×10−16×exp(−331±53T) cm3 molecule−1 s−1 was obtained. The gas-phase oxidation products formed, at room temperature (293 ± 2 K), from this reaction were investigated using PTR-ToF-MS, SIFT-MS and GC-EI-MS analyses. Several products were identified and quantified (in %), including acetone (9 ± 2), whose formation yield was determined using a calibration standard, and acetaldehyde (30 ± 5), glycolaldehyde (30 ± 5), formaldehyde (8 ± 1), methylglyoxal (8 ± 1) and hydroxyacetone and/or methylacetate (5 ± 1) %, whose formation yields were estimated using a generic H3O+ rate coefficient for their protonation reaction.

 Compound dry-hot extreme events (CDHEs), as the most typical compound extreme events, bring more harm to human society than single extreme events. Traditional indicators based on stationary assumptions of hydrometeorological variables for CDHEs detection may no longer be valid due to anthropogenic and climate change impacts. The nonstationary hydrometeorological series has been extensively studied but rarely considered in identifying CDHEs. Therefore, this paper develops a nonstationary compound dry-hot index (NCDHI) with climate index and anthropogenic factors as covariates, to revisit CDHEs in China from 1961 to 2020 using the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) model. The results show that the nonstationary model is better than the traditional stationary model in fitting precipitation and temperature series. Validation using typical disaster events and losses data reveals a higher correlation between the NCDHI and actual disaster losses, confirming the good applicability of the NCDHI in China. Areas affected by CDHEs of varying severity have increased in China during the study period. Meanwhile, the severity of CDHEs has also been exacerbated, with more severe in the central and eastern regions. Furthermore, CDHEs in the western regions, though less intense, occur more frequently. The proposed NCDHI can capture the characteristics of CDHEs in China, which provides a new idea for constructing a compound dry-hot index that can effectively adapt to environmental changes. The index can further improve the scientific understanding of compound extreme events' temporal and spatial patterns and provide a scientific basis for regional risk management and disaster prevention and mitigation."

 November 2023 was marked by abnormally heavy rainfall across equatorial Central Africa, causing considerable material damage and loss of life. The present study investigates the underlying mechanisms by examining the vertical advection of moisture and moist static energy (MSE) anomalies and the net energy flux components. We find that the vertical moisture and MSE advection components are mostly induced by vertical velocity anomalies (increase of up to 5 mm/day in moisture and 80 Wm−2 in MSE) rather than by specific humidity and MSE anomalies. Additionally, mean sea level pressure and 2 m temperature are significantly larger than climatology. The increase (decrease) in the mean net long (short) wave radiation of up to 30 Wm−2 at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface favored conditions of atmospheric instability. Analysis of the net energy flux indicates positive anomalies dominated by radiative anomalies (increase of up to 30 Wm−2), mainly along the Gulf of Guinea, while in the eastern Congo Basin, a decrease (up to −27 Wm−2) in the energy balance was observed during the formation of this extreme rainfall event. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering thermodynamic processes associated with radiative effects to accurately anticipate such events. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving projections of climate extremes under the influence of global warming."

 Despite the recognized significance of wet deposition of atmospheric dissolved organic carbon (DOC), its dynamics within large reservoir catchments remain poorly understood. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variations in rainwater DOC concentrations and deposition fluxes across urban, agricultural, and reservoir areas around the Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. Volume-weighted mean (VWM) DOC concentrations varied significantly, with the highest levels observed in urban areas (7.52 mg C L−1) compared to agricultural (4.94 mg C L−1) and reservoir areas (4.66 mg C L−1). Elevated DOC concentrations occurred seasonally in spring and winter, likely due to reduced rainfall scavenging, increased heating emissions, and stable atmospheric conditions favoring pollutant accumulation. Source apportionment indicated dominant terrestrial contributions to rainwater DOC. Agricultural activities, mineral dust, and mobile emissions were associated with DOC in agricultural and reservoir areas, whereas stationary sources like coal combustion and industrial emissions contributed more to urban areas. Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified rainfall amount and electrical conductivity (EC) as significant DOC concentration predictors, reflecting atmospheric washout and terrestrial influences. Monthly DOC fluxes ranged from 0.24 to 14.12 kg C ha−1 in different sites, highlighting the temporal variability driven by precipitation. Summer witnessed the highest regional DOC deposition fluxes across all regions (16.43–25.88 kg C ha−1), over twofold higher than spring and winter. The urban area had the highest annual DOC deposition flux (56.07 kg C ha−1 yr−1), followed by the reservoir (34.77 kg C ha−1 yr−1) and agricultural areas (30.29 kg C ha−1 yr−1). Annually, atmospheric wet deposition contributes an estimated 1898 t of DOC to the reservoir, potentially enriching the upper two meters by 1.74 mg C L−1. This study enhances the understanding of DOC wet deposition dynamics in a large reservoir catchment, emphasizing the importance of considering atmospheric inputs in reservoir water quality management."

We developed a mouse model overexpressing a mutated transfer RNA synthetase in muscle fibers, enabling specific protein labeling using an artificial methionine substitute, which can be revealed through click chemistry. This model revealed that denervation increases protein labeling in oxidative muscle fibers through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, while deleting the mTORC1 scaffold protein Raptor reduces labeling in glycolytic fibers. On the other hand, increased muscle activity acutely decreases protein synthesis, accompanied by reduced mTORC1 signaling, glycogen depletion, and adenosine 5′-monophosphate kinase activation.

Human retinal circulation is an intricate vascular system emerging and remerging at the optic nerve head (ONH). Tracing retinal vascular branching from ONH can allow detailed morphological quantification, and yet remains a challenging task. We presented a robust semi-automatic vessel tracing algorithm on human fundus images by an instance segmentation neural network (InSegNN). InSegNN separates and labels individual vascular trees and enables tracing each tree throughout its branching.

We achieved 83% specificity, 50% improvement in symmetric best dice (SBD) compared to literature, and outperformed baseline U-net, and achieved 91% precision with 71% sensitivity.

Incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles has profound effects on viral spread; however, the mechanisms promoting their incorporation were unknown. We found that depletion of cellular PIP2blocks incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles. Expansion microscopy revealed that PIP2depletion diminishes nanoscale coclustering between viral structural protein Gag and the three transmembrane proteins at the PM and that Gag induces PIP2enrichment at its vicinity. CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 also increased local PIP2density, revealing their PIP2affinity.

Despite evidence showing associations between pain and depression, the additive effect of co-occurring pain conditions on depression risk and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Leveraging data from 431,038 UK Biobank participants with 14-year follow-up, we found a significantly increased risk of depression incidence in individuals reporting pain, irrespective of body site or duration (acute or chronic), compared with pain-free individuals. The depression risk increased with the number of co-occurring pain sites. Mendelian randomization supported potential causal inference. We constructed a composite pain score by combining individual effects of acute or chronic pain conditions across eight body sites in a weighted manner. We found that depression risks increased monotonically in parallel with composite pain scores. Moreover, some inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, partially mediated the association between composite pain scores and depression risk. Considering the high prevalence of comorbid depression and pain, pain screening may help identify high-risk individuals for depression."

Simulations ascribe this to competing zero-point energies (ZPEs): Intermolecular ZPEs stabilize hydrogen-bonds, while intramolecular ZPEs destabilize them. However, experimental validation has been lacking due to the difficulty in quantifying NQEs. The air/water interface provides an ideal platform to quantify NQEs in liquid water using surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. By analyzing the excess/depletion of interfacial HOD, H2O, and D2O molecules with one free OH/OD group and the other H-bonded OH/OD group, we found that the intermolecular ZPE destabilizes the hydrogen-bonds by 0.74 ± 0.20 kilojoule per mole upon isotope substitution from H to D, while the intramolecular ZPE stabilizes them by 0.78 ± 0.33 kilojoule per mole.

Fear extinction is considered to rely mostly on neuronal function. However, whether and how astrocytes contribute to fear extinction is largely unknown. Here, we show that hippocampal CA1 astrocytes exhibit de novo Ca2+dynamics during fear extinction. Inhibition of these astrocytic Ca2+dynamics impairs, while their activation facilitates, fear extinction. In this regulation of fear extinction, the posterior basal forebrain (pBF) cholinergic input to hippocampus drives CA1 astrocytic Ca2+dynamics through the activation of α4 and α7 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Clinically used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases CA1 astrocytic Ca2+dynamics and facilitates fear extinction.

Oxygen plays a major role in inland-water ecosystem functioning, but long-term changes in its cycling remain unknown. Here, we quantify global inland-water oxygen production, consumption, and exchange with the atmosphere during 1900–2010 using a spatially explicit, mass-balanced, mechanistic model that takes into account changes in climate, hydrology, human activities, and the coupled biogeochemical (oxygen-nutrient-organic matter) dynamics. The model results show that global inland-water oxygen turnover increased during 1900–2010: production from 0.16 to 0.94 Pg year−1and consumption from 0.44 to 1.47 Pg year−1. Inland waters overall remained heterotrophic and a sink of atmospheric oxygen. Direct human perturbations (changes in hydrology and nutrient supply) were more important in increasing oxygen turnover than indirect effects via warming."

We generate a quantum superposition of displaced thermal states within a microwave cavity using only unitary interactions with a transmon qubit. We measure the Wigner functions of these “hot” Schrödinger cat states for an initial purity as low as 0.06. This corresponds to a cavity mode temperature of up to 1.8 kelvin, 60 times hotter than the cavity’s physical environment.

How IFT subcomplexes reach the ciliary base and assemble into IFT trains is poorly understood. Here, we perform quantitative single-molecule imaging inCaenorhabditis eleganschemosensory cilia to uncover how IFT subcomplexes arrive at the base, organize in IFT trains, and enter the cilium. We find that BBSomes reach the base via diffusion where they either associate with assembling IFT trains or with the membrane surrounding the base. In contrast, IFT-B and IFT-A reach the base via directed transport most likely on vesicles that stop at distinct locations near the base. Individual subcomplexes detach from the vesicles into a diffusive pool and associate to assembling trains.

Upon mtDNA replication stress, the mitochondrial genome transfers to endosomes for degradation. Using proximity biotinylation, we found that mtDNA stress leads to the rewiring of the mitochondrial proximity proteome, increasing mitochondria’s association with lysosomal and vesicle-related proteins. Among these, the retromer complex, particularly VPS35, plays a pivotal role by extracting mitochondrial components. The retromer promotes the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles shuttled to lysosomes. The mtDNA, however, directly shuttles to a recycling organelle in a BAX-dependent manner. Moreover, using aDrosophilamodel carrying a long deletion on the mtDNA (ΔmtDNA), we found that ΔmtDNA activates a specific transcriptome profile to counteract mitochondrial damage. Here,Vps35expression restores mtDNA homoplasmy and alleviates associated defects. Hence, we demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown quality control mechanism for the mitochondrial matrix and the essential role of lysosomes in mtDNA turnover to relieve mtDNA damage."

Previous research has provided several interpretations of this attraction, including potential drug abuse, or a self-medicating coping strategy after mate rejection. We posit that the ecologically adaptive value of alcohol attraction has not been fully explored. Here, we assert a simple yet vital biological rationale for this alcohol preference. Flies display attraction to fruits rich in alcohol, specifically ethanol and methanol, where contact results in a rapid amplification of fatty acid–derived pheromones that enhance courtship success. We also identify olfactory sensory neurons that detect these alcohols, where we reveal roles in both attraction and aversion, and show that valence is balanced around alcohol concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that methanol can be deadly, and adult flies must therefore accurately weigh the trade-off between benefits and costs for exposure within their naturally fermented and alcohol-rich environments."

Chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals.

However, the mechanisms underlying the impact of available-Fe levels on PFAS accumulation and translocation in plants remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the impacts of available-Fe levels on the accumulation of an emerging PFAS, 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), in soybean, a typical dicot, through hydroponic experiments. Interestingly, Fe deficiency significantly enhanced soybean root volume, surface area, root tip count, and lipid content, thus favoring 6:2 Cl-PFESA adsorption on the root epidermis. However, its absorption and translocation to aboveground tissues were markedly suppressed due to significantly reduced transpiration rate and soluble protein content induced by Fe deficiency. Conversely, although excessive available-Fe also inhibited transpiration, it notably increased root membrane permeability and soluble protein content in aboveground tissues, thus greatly facilitating the absorption and translocation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA within soybeans. These findings demonstrate that appropriate Fe application in agricultural soils is essential to promote the growth of dicot crops and mitigate the potential ecological risks associated with the accumulation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in the aboveground tissues of soybeans."

Since 2020, fuel sulfur (S) content limits have been reduced, requiring either the use of low-S fuels or the installation of marine scrubbers to continue using heavy fuel oil (HFO). While scrubbers are a widely adopted solution for reducing S emissions, their benefits are controversial and uncertainty remains regarding scrubber environmental impacts and their appropriate evaluation. Here, we systematically assess the environmental impacts of scrubbers operating on HFO to those of low-S fuels across various categories, through a measurement-informed Well-to-Wake (WtW) life cycle assessment (LCA). Gaseous and particulate matter (PM) emissions data were collected while a bulk carrier vessel was burning 3% S HFO, 0.1% S marine gas oil (MGO), and 0.5% S very low-S fuel oil (VLSFO) under similar engine operating modes during an actual ocean voyage. Seawater and washwater samples were also analyzed, alongside fuel, cylinder oil, and lubricant samples. The results suggest that, in various instances the use of HFO with a scrubber can be considered equivalent to MGO use while outperforming VLSFO use from a WtW perspective, for large, ocean-going bulk carrier vessels in open seas. These findings indicate that end-of-pipe solutions may not always be inferior to start-of-pipe alternatives, underscoring the need for comprehensive LCA studies to properly assess emission abatement technologies."

High-resolution 3D bioimaging confirmed differential internalization: PS-COOH accumulated in the yolk and intestine, while PS-NH2 localized mainly in the intestine. PS-NPs up to 10 ppm did not significantly affect mortality or hatching rates, likely due to effective dialysis, minimizing toxic chemical leaching. PS-NP exposure led to noninflated swim bladders and affected swimming. RNA sequencing identified impacted neurological molecular pathways like circadian rhythm and visual function; weighted gene coexpression network analysis indicated strong correlations between key gene modules and phenotypic traits like eye development and dopamine level. We highlight the low acute toxicity of clean dialyzed NPs despite bodily uptake and surface-charge-dependent sublethal neurotoxicity.

Fast-moving sediment avalanches (called turbidity currents) are hypothesized to efficiently transport microplastics into the deep sea. However, while this has been inferred from field sampling of the seafloor, it has never been demonstrated outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we provide direct field-scale evidence that turbidity currents in submarine canyons not only transport globally significant volumes of mineral and organic matter into the deep sea but also carry large quantities of anthropogenic particles, including microfibers and microplastic fragments. In situ hydrodynamic monitoring, coupled with direct sampling of the seafloor and material suspended by turbidity currents, reveals that even a submarine canyon whose head lies hundreds of kilometers from land acts as an efficient conduit to flush sediment and pollutants from the continental shelf to water depths greater than 3200 m. Frequent and fast turbidity currents supply oxygen and nutrients that sustain deep-sea biodiversity and fishing grounds in, and adjacent to, such canyons. Our study therefore confirms that these biodiversity hotspots are colocated with microplastic hotspots, indicating that the more than 5000 land-detached canyons worldwide can be important but previously unproven conveyors of anthropogenic pollution to the deep sea."

During underground hydrogen storage operations, it is expected that microbial communities will use the injected hydrogen as electron donor for diverse metabolisms, and induce a variety of microbial-triggered risks. A significant concern is the formation of biofilm and induced bioclogging, which may reduce the hydrogen injectivity and storage operation efficiency by altering the subsurface hydrogen flow. This study investigates how different electron donors─specifically hydrogen and lactate─affect the growth dynamics of a sulfate-reducing bacterium (Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis G20) and the associated biofilm formation in porous media. The pore-scale observations reveal that lactate promotes robust biofilms resulting in bioclogging, compared to hydrogen promoting increased microbial motility with less biomass production. Potential hydrogen chemotaxis leads to biofilm dispersal and detachment over time as the cells seemingly favor a planktonic lifestyle over biofilm formation. Multiple hydrogen injections enhanced biofilm detachment and reduced the risk of pore blockage associated with microbial growth. Three hydrogen injections resulted in 69% biofilm detachment, while nitrogen injection caused only 31% detachment over three cycles. The combination of increased cell motility and reduced biofilm attachment indicates that the risk of bioclogging during cyclic UHS operation might be low for this model bacterial strain."

Detailed characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the EMSI induces electron transfer from Ru to CeO2, optimizing the coordination and electronic structure of single-atom Ru and accordingly facilitating the adsorption and activation of CB. Moreover, the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) at the Ru–O–Ce interface is demonstrated as the critical reactive oxygen species, the mobility and reactivity of which are also prompted by the EMSI, leading to the boosted conversion of reaction intermediates.

Here, we cloned 11 nAChR subunit genes, comprising Nlα1 to Nlα8, Nlα10, Nlβ1 and Nlβ3, from Nilaparvata lugens, a highly damaging insect pest of rice crops worldwide. Analysis of the expression of these genes in different tissues of N. lugens by qPCR analysis identified the brain as the primary site of expression. Knock down of the expression of Nlα1, Nlα2, Nlα8 and Nlβ1 using RNAi reduced N. lugens sensitivity to triflumezopyrim, suggesting these genes encode potential target subunits for triflumezopyrim. Knock out of Nlα2 and Nlα8 nAChR subunits by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing showed that their deletion significantly reduced the toxicity of triflumezopyrim toward N. lugens.

Ward,Similar Oxygen Sensitivities of Different Steps of Denitrification in Estuarine Waters,"Hypoxia is observed and projected to expand in many aquatic environments, largely due to excess anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate change, thus influencing biogeochemical processes. Denitrification, generally an anaerobic process, removes bioavailable nitrogen and produces nitrous oxide (N2O). However, limited observations of the effect of oxygen on denitrification restrict our ability to estimate changes in the amount of bioavailable nitrogen and N2O emissions under anthropogenic perturbations and climate change. Here, we show that all denitrification steps increased, while the N2O production yield from denitrification decreased with decreasing oxygen in Chesapeake Bay – the largest estuary in the United States. The different steps of denitrification responded similarly to oxygen changes in Chesapeake Bay, unlike open ocean oxygen minimum zones, with implications for the accumulation or depletion of denitrification intermediates such as nitrite and N2O. Our observations also suggest that current model parametrizations of denitrification in Chesapeake Bay likely overestimate denitrification and nitrogen removal in the presence of oxygen, which would bias the evaluation of nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and the extent of hypoxia. Overall, our newly derived oxygen sensitivities of denitrification could be used to improve model parametrizations of denitrification and constrain the nitrogen budget and N2O emissions in estuarine and coastal environments experiencing hypoxia."

Since 2005, Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) has experienced accelerating ground uplift, seismicity rates, and degassing. Here we conduct petrological and 4D X‐ray microtomography investigations on cored rocks from a ∼3 km deep geothermal well located near the center of caldera, complemented by 3D high‐resolution seismic tomography. At a depth of ∼2.5–3.0 km we identify the transition to a weak tuff layer likely to trap magmatic fluids. Simulations of magma pathways indicate that stresses generated by caldera unloading may have arrested at the limestone/tuff transition past ascending dykes, which deformed, heated, and released magmatic fluids, deteriorating the surrounding rocks. This weak layer may play a crucial role in building up overpressure, causing deformation and seismicity, thus influencing the dynamics of recent unrests, and possible future magma ascent episodes."

The correlation with groundwater pressure variations in confined aquifers, which are often strategic, is an open scientific question, as is the stored groundwater volume. Based on an experimental site equipped with a low‐cost seismometer located close to a borehole in a confined fractured aquifer, we demonstrate that (a) the auto and inter‐components correlation of the time series of the seismometer enables detecting variations in seismic velocities, (b) these changes are negatively correlated with the groundwater pressure variations, and (c) these changes occur above a groundwater pressure threshold related to the fractures' properties.

 Pyrazoles are heterocycles commonly found as key substructures in agrochemicals and medicinally active compounds alike.1,2 Despite their pervasiveness, established methods fall notably short in delivering complex pyrazoles selectively due to issues of differentiation during either assembly or N-functionalization.3 This is a direct consequence of a dominant synthetic strategy that attempts to control selectivity-determining bonds between poorly differentiated starting materials. To overcome this longstanding challenge, we here describe a prototypical example of an alternative conceptual approach, “Strategic Atom Replacement”, in which we synthesize N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles. The net forward transformation is a “swap” of the isothiazole sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole.4,5 Linking the two azoles is an orphaned heterocycle class, 1,2,3-Thiadiazine-S-Oxides, whose synthetic potential has yet to be tapped.6 By proceeding via these unusual heterocycles, the typical selectivity and separation challenges associated with exclusively bond-based pyrazole preparations are circumvented, and even minimally differentiated peripheral substituents can be discriminated to afford isomerically pure products."

 The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2)1–4. Experiments to date have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at ν = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moiré unit cell) 1–6. In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist exotic quantum phases 7–15, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators (FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional states. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy 16,17 on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states 18. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing 1,3,19–21. Besides the known states, we observe additional fractional fillings between ν = 0 and -1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (ν > 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at ν = -4/3, -3/2, -5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases 7–15. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct moiré conduction and valence bands."

 Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors1. Frequency differences between overtone modes—large separations—probe stellar density2, whereas differences between low-degree modes—small separations—probe the sound-speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main-sequence Sun-like stars3, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterized by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and become proportional to large separations4,5. Here we present evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolutions, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.

 Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch1. DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara’s genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco2, associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch. Pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into the Green Sahara, where an isolated, distinct North African ancestry persisted."

 Anion doping offers immense potential for tailoring material properties, but precise control over anion incorporation remains challenging due to complex synthesis and limitations in dopant detection. This study investigates F-ion intercalation within an infinite-layer NdNiO2+x/SrTiO3 superlattice using a two-step process. We employ advanced four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to map the F distribution and its impact on the atomic and electronic structure. Our observations reveal a fluorination-induced geometric reconstruction of the infinite layer structure, resulting in a more distorted orthorhombic phase compared to the pristine perovskite. F-ion are primarily located at apical polyhedral sites, with some basal sites occupation in localized regions, leading to the formation of two distinct domains. These domains reflect a competition between polyhedral distortion and Nd displacement at domain interfaces. Interestingly, we observe an anomalous structural distortion where basal site anions are displaced in the same direction as Nd atoms, potentially linked to the partial basal site F-ion occupation. This coexistence of diverse structural distortions signifies a locally disordered F-ion distribution with distinct configurations. These findings provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of anion doping at the atomic level, contributing to the design of materials with tailored functionalities.

 The UniProt database is a valuable resource for biocatalyst discovery, yet predicting enzymatic functions remains challenging, especially for low-similarity sequences. Identifying superior enzymes with enhanced catalytic properties is even harder. To overcome these challenges, we develop ESM-Ezy, an enzyme mining strategy leveraging the ESM-1b protein language model and similarity calculations in semantic space. Using ESM-Ezy, we identify novel multicopper oxidases (MCOs) with superior catalytic properties, achieving a 44% success rate in outperforming query enzymes (QEs) in at least one property, including catalytic efficiency, heat and organic solvent tolerance, and pH stability. Notably, 51% of the MCOs excel in environmental remediation applications, and some exhibited unique structural motifs and unique active centers enhancing their functions. Beyond MCOs, 40% of L-asparaginases identified show higher specific activity and catalytic efficiency than QEs. ESM-Ezy thus provides a promising approach for discovering high-performance biocatalysts with low sequence similarity, accelerating enzyme discovery for industrial applications. ESM-Ezy combines the ESM-1b protein language model with similarity analysis to predict enzymatic functions in low-similarity sequences. It identifies high-performance biocatalysts, such as novel multicopper oxidases and L-asparaginases, with enhanced efficiency, stability, and industrial potential, advancing sustainable biotech solutions."

 The genesis of kimberlites is unclear despite the economic and scientific interest surrounding these diamond-bearing magmas. One critical question is whether they tap ancient, deep mantle domains or the shallow convecting mantle with partial melting triggered by plumes or plate tectonics. To address this question, we report the He-Ne-Ar isotopic compositions of magmatic fluids trapped in olivine from kimberlites worldwide. The kimberlites which have been least affected by addition of deeply subducted or metasomatic components have Ne isotopes less nucleogenic than the upper mantle, hence requiring a deep-mantle origin. This is corroborated by previous evidence of small negative W isotope anomalies and kimberlite location along age-progressive hot-spot tracks. The lack of strong primordial He isotope signatures indicates overprinting by lithospheric and crustal components, which suggests that Ne isotopes are more robust tracers of deep-mantle contributions in intraplate continental magmas. The most geochemically depleted kimberlites may preserve deep remnants of early-Earth heterogeneities.

 Longitudinal multi-view omics data offer unique insights into the temporal dynamics of individual-level physiology, which provides opportunities to advance personalized healthcare. However, the common occurrence of incomplete views makes extrapolation tasks difficult, and there is a lack of tailored methods for this critical issue. Here, we introduce LEOPARD, an innovative approach specifically designed to complete missing views in multi-timepoint omics data. By disentangling longitudinal omics data into content and temporal representations, LEOPARD transfers the temporal knowledge to the omics-specific content, thereby completing missing views. The effectiveness of LEOPARD is validated on four real-world omics datasets constructed with data from the MGH COVID study and the KORA cohort, spanning periods from 3 days to 14 years. Compared to conventional imputation methods, such as missForest, PMM, GLMM, and cGAN, LEOPARD yields the most robust results across the benchmark datasets. LEOPARD-imputed data also achieve the highest agreement with observed data in our analyses for age-associated metabolites detection, estimated glomerular filtration rate-associated proteins identification, and chronic kidney disease prediction. Our work takes the first step toward a generalized treatment of missing views in longitudinal omics data, enabling comprehensive exploration of temporal dynamics and providing valuable insights into personalized healthcare.

 The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses challenges for manual knowledge curation and synthesis. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs—GPT and LLaMA representatives—on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with the traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here, we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero- or few-shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open-source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps.

Here, authors report tailoring the pore chemistry of framework polymer membranes, which alters the interaction between Cl- and membranes and speeds Cl- transport, improving flow battery performance. 
 Studying ion transport in the interaction confinement regime has important implications for membrane design and advanced electrochemical devices. A key example is the rapid-charging capability of aqueous organic redox flow batteries, enabled by near-frictionless Na+/K+ transport within triazine framework membranes. However, achieving similar breakthroughs for devices using anions (e.g., Cl-) is challenging due to the suppression of anion transport under confinement, known as the charge asymmetry effect. We present a series of anion-selective covalent triazine framework membranes with comparable densities of subnanometer ion transport channels and identical micropore size distributions, which help to overcome the charge asymmetry effect and promote fast anion conduction. We demonstrate that regulating the charge distribution in the membrane frameworks reduces the energy barrier for anion transport, resulting in nearly doubled Cl- conductivity and adding almost no additional energy barrier for F- transport. This membrane enables an aqueous organic redox flow battery using Cl- ions to operate at high current densities, exceeding battery performance demonstrated by current membranes. These findings could benefit various electrochemical devices and inspire single-species selectivity in separation membranes.

 Particle exchange heat engines are a novel class of cyclic heat engines that are all-electrical, contain no moving parts and can therefore be scaled down to nanometer size. At the center of their operation is the manipulation of a particle flow between a hot and a cold reservoir through energy filtering mechanisms, where their efficiency depends primarily on the sharpness of the energy filter. In this study, we investigate the efficiency enhancement of such engines by utilizing ultra-sharp transmission resonances formed by magnetic impurities interacting with superconductors, known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states. To this end, we couple a neutral and stable diradical molecule to superconducting break-junction electrodes, and study its thermoelectric properties at ultra-low temperatures. By driving the molecular heat engine through a phase transition from a Kondo state into the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime, we observe a five fold increase in the thermoelectric power factor.

 The dissolution of polymer crystals often proceeds at rates varying in time and space. Here, using low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) as a model polymer, we exploit step-wise selective dissolution for unveiling how spatial variations in metastability are generated during the growth of lamellar polymer single crystals. The dissolution velocity along defined crystal faces is constant, but ca. 5 times faster for rough than for smooth faces. From the temperature dependence of dissolution, we derive detachment energies of 420 ± 40 kJ/mol and 650 ± 50 kJ/mol for rough and smooth faces, respectively, suggesting that on a rough face polymer chains have ca. 1/3 less neighboring molecules to interact with. The observed high values of the activation energy indicate that, for dissolving a polymer crystal, the progressive detachment of whole chains is indispensable.

 Recycling large quantities of lithium-ion batteries facing retirement is pivotal for resource conservation and environmental sustainability. Direct recycling, while offering a promising avenue with reduced waste compared with pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, often involves intricate and long processes. Here we introduce a water electrolysis-induced separation approach, using H2 or O2 gas bubbling to efficiently separate electrode materials from current collectors. The process achieves 99.5% materials recovery with metal impurities <40 ppm within 34 s for LiFePO4 and 3 s for graphite at 10 mA cm−2, with minimal energy consumption of 11 and 1.1 kJ kgcell−1. Moreover, this approach accommodates various electrode types, encompassing cathodes and anodes from spent batteries or manufacturing scraps. The subsequent dry electrode manufacturing process with lithium replenishment substantially enhances environmental sustainability by eliminating the use of N-methyl pyrrolidone, while maintaining performance through the effective mixing of active materials and conductive agents. An EverBatt analysis underscores a remarkable reduction in energy consumption and waste generation compared with industrially adopted recycling methods. This finding provides an efficient and sustainable solution for battery recycling while ensuring high-quality materials production. Current battery recycling processes face sustainability challenges.

 Turbulent air motions determine the local environment in which cloud ice crystals form. Homogeneous freezing of aqueous solution droplets is the most fundamental pathway to nucleate ice crystals in cirrus. Lack of knowledge about the role of turbulence in cirrus ice formation limits our understanding of how uncertainties in small-scale cloud processes affect the climatological radiative effect of cirrus. Here we shed first light on how turbulent fluctuations in temperature and supersaturation interact with probabilistic homogeneous freezing. We show that spatial model resolution substantially below 1–10 m is needed to properly simulate homogeneous freezing events. Importantly, microscale turbulence generates large variability in nucleated ice crystal number concentrations. Previous research ascribed this variability to mesoscale dynamical forcing due to gravity waves alone. The turbulence-generated microphysical variability has macrophysical implications. The wide range of predicted cloud radiative heating anomalies in anvil cirrus due to turbulence-ice nucleation interactions, comparable to typical mean values, is potentially large enough to affect the response of tropical cirrus cloud systems to global warming. Our results have ramifications for the multiscale modeling of cirrus clouds and the interpretation of in situ measurements."

 The production of olive oil, a cornerstone of Mediterranean diet, faces important threats from recurring droughts and the anticipated decline in cyclical solar activity. These escalating challenges cast uncertainty on the long-term sustainability of olive-growing regions. Here we draw on 8000 years of olive pollen data - closely related to flowering, fertilization and fruit production - to identify the key long-term determinants influencing olive yields. Our findings indicate that pollen production, and therefore yields, are primarily driven by photosynthesis, which is influenced not only by temperature and CO2 levels, but also by precipitation during olive phenological stages and changes in the radiation balance, rather than by variations in solar energy alone. Changes in photosynthetic activity emerge as a critical determinant of the future of the Mediterranean olive oil economy and have major implications for food security in the region.

 Warming temperatures have been invoked as a potential mechanism for widespread change to the erosional regime in Arctic regions, where large portions of watersheds are underlain by permanently frozen soils. Yet recent site-specific studies have delivered conflicting results regarding how erosion along Arctic rivers has responded to past temperature increase, and how erosion will respond to rising temperatures in the future. Here we use 92,009 observations of fluvial erosion across 13,400 stream kilometers in the Mackenzie River watershed to show that erosion rates along rivers across the Canadian Arctic are positively correlated to temperature and uncorrelated with vegetative cover over the satellite record (1985-present). While temperature’s erosive effect appears to be mediated by discharge, our results nevertheless suggest warming will lead to increased erosion in the Arctic but that the enhanced erosive regime may be less dramatic than earlier predictions.

These extra-territorial emissions are influenced by global climate policies. Additionally, broadening the scope of environmental indicators is crucial as more countries pursue net-zero goals. Our findings highlight trade-offs, showing how environmental impacts other than those on climate change (ecosystem impacts, air pollution, natural resource use) could increase and shift beyond Switzerland as the country electrifies its economy. Even if domestic greenhouse gas emissions were reduced to net zero in Switzerland by 2050, 2 to 5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year could persist abroad due to imports and energy-related infrastructure needs, according to a life cycle assessment of model simulations."

 Climate models project reduced temperature variability in Northern high latitudes due to global warming, but impacts on mid-latitude variability remain uncertain. Here, using multi-model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, we find that daily winter temperature variability increases across the Eurasian mid-latitudes under future warming. This variability strongly correlates with the North Atlantic sea surface temperature gradient, characterized by a warm tropics–cold high-latitude sea surface temperature pattern linked to a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Idealized simulations using a climate model confirm that a stronger North Atlantic Sea surface temperature gradient amplifies Eurasian mid-latitude temperature variability by enhancing the meridional temperature gradient. Additional simulations show that warming in the tropical Indian Ocean-western Pacific warm pool has a weaker effect on Eurasian temperature variability than the North Atlantic sea surface temperature gradient. These findings suggest that Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakening could lead to heightened winter variability in Eurasian mid-latitudes. Winter temperature variability in the Eurasian mid-latitudes is projected to increase under future warming and be modulated by the degree of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakening, according to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and idealized model experiments."

 Climate change is expected to alter the frequency and intensity of extreme events, modifying the natural disturbance regimes to which ecosystems are adapted. Here, we present a spatially explicit risk index for mangroves and associated biodiversity and ecosystem services based on projected frequency changes of tropical cyclone wind speeds and rates of relative sea level rise under SSPs 245, 370 and 585 by 2100. Globally, approximately half of the total mangrove area (40–56% depending on the SSP) will be at high to severe levels of risk due to climate-modified tropical cyclone disturbance regimes. Further, we find mangrove areas with high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem services provision, including coastal protection for people and assets, carbon sequestration, and fishery benefits, are at proportionally higher levels of risk. Our findings emphasize the need to anticipate changes in natural disturbance regimes and adapt ecosystem management to sustain mangroves and their services in the future.

 Foliar stable carbon isotope is an excellent indicator of plant water use efficiency, providing crucial insights into vegetation dynamics under climate change. However, in arid and semiarid grassland ecosystems, the factors driving variations in community-level foliar stable carbon isotope remain unclear. Here, we combined community-weighted mean foliar stable carbon isotope from 399 sampling sites across three grassland types in Inner Mongolia with environmental factors and leaf traits to reveal the mechanisms driving variations in community-level foliar carbon isotopes. We examined the impact of environmental factors (climate and soil factors) and leaf traits on community-level foliar stable carbon isotope.

 Biological nitrogen fixation is an important source of new nitrogen, influencing ocean fertility and carbon uptake. While recently documented in Arctic waters, its role in the Southern Ocean remains uncertain. We measured nitrogen fixation along the Western Antarctic Peninsula and at Palmer Station over two austral summer months. Rates from 15N2 assay were below conservative detection limits but detectable under less stringent detection thresholds. Continuous acetylene reduction assay provided further support. nifH gene sequencing identified Gammaproteobacteria as the dominating identified diazotrophs, while Epsilonproteobacteria contributed disproportionally to nifH expression when putative nitrogen fixation was highest. Combined with environmental observations, we hypothesize that vertical water mixing resuspended sediments into the water column and contributed to the limited nitrogen fixation. Given the sporadic and low rates, further research is needed to determine whether nitrogen fixation plays a minor role or represents an overlooked process with biogeochemical significance in the Southern Ocean.

Yet, it is less clear who citizens expect to take the lead on climate action across different regions of the world: historical emitters, their own governments, or themselves? Our analysis of Africa’s largest public opinion survey, the Afrobarometer, across 39 countries finds that Africans place primary responsibility for addressing climate change on their own government, a further third see ordinary citizens as most responsible, while very few place responsibility on historical emitters. Multinomial logistic regression analysis shows that education, decreased poverty, and access to new media sources are associated with increased attribution of responsibility to historical emitters.

 Current space-borne L-band radiometers have been routinely providing global soil moisture maps every 2 to 3 days for more than 15 years. However, they can only estimate soil moisture in the top 5 cm of the soil, which limits its usefulness in applications that need deep layer soil moisture. Fortuitously, recent work has shown that there is a potential to retrieve root zone soil moisture (RZSM) when combining P-band radiometer data with L-band radiometer data at the same spatial resolution. Nevertheless, there are antenna size limitations that currently restrict L-band radiometer data to a resolution of 40 km. Accordingly, if the same antenna is used for a joint P-band (750 MHz) and L-band (1.4GHz) satellite mission, the footprint size at P-band will be double that attained at L-band, limiting its usefulness in applications and making joint interpretation difficult. It is therefore essential to downscale the P-band radiometer measurements to at least the same resolution as the L-band measurements. Consequently, this paper has explored three alternative passive-passive P-band downscaling algorithms using the spatial information that exists in the L-band radiometer data, to achieve P-band brightness temperature (Tb) information at the same resolution as the L-band passive measurements. Analysis was conducted using data from three airborne campaigns in south-eastern Australia, with resolutions ranging from 36 km to 200 m under a range of moisture conditions and spatial characteristics. The three alternate downscaling algorithms used in this paper, designated as Algorithm A, B, and C, were not only compared to determine which generated the best performance, but were also analysed according to different land cover types and seasons. The results demonstrated that the Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM) method, referred to as Algorithm A, outperformed the others, with a median root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the original observations of 3 K when downscaling to half of the original spatial resolution, increasing to around 8 K when downscaling to 36 times finer than the original resolution."

 Iron tailings are crystalline powders predominantly composed of iron (Fe) and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Spatially characterizing the physical and chemical properties of iron tailings is greatly important for optimal utilization and proper disposal of tailings. Visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR; 350–2500 nm) spectroscopy offers a rapid, non-destructive, and cost-effective method for quantitatively analyzing tailings properties. This study aimed to quantify and map the spatial distribution of total Fe (TFe) and SiO2 contents of tailings dams at the largest iron cluster in China using laboratory spectra and GF-5 hyperspectral images. A total of 230 samples were collected from the surface of 11 tailings dams and scanned by a VIS–NIR–SWIR reflectance spectrometer in the laboratory. A novel spectral index was developed through a multi-objective programming methodology. This novel index utilizes band ratios to identify the optimal combination of spectral bands that show a strong correlation with concentrations of TFe and SiO2. Simultaneously, it minimizes the impact of moisture content and particle size variations in surface tailings. In addition, the partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms based on laboratory spectra were used to calibrate spectral information with associated tailing properties. The contribution of wavelength in the calibration modeling process by calculating SHaply Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. According to the results, the reflectance spectra were negatively correlated to TFe content and positively correlated to SiO2 content. The three-band spectral index (TBI) calculated by R827/(R900 × R2200) correlated best to TFe with the correlation coefficient (r) of 0.87, while the R2397/(R776×R900) correlated best to SiO2 with r of 0.70. It also minimized the effect of particle size and moisture content on the reflectance spectra of tailings properties. The CNN algorithm with laboratory spectra yielded the highest estimation accuracy for TFe (R2 = 0.74, RPD = 1.79, RMSE = 3.69 %, LCCC = 0.74 and bias = -0.41) and SiO2 (R2 = 0.81, RPD = 2.15, RMSE = 1.28 %, LCCC = 0.86 and bias = −0.49). The direct standardization (DS) algorithm was applied to correct GF-5 hyperspectral image. Subsequently, the ability of TBI and the CNN model was compared for estimating and mapping the spatial distribution of TFe and SiO2 contents based on the corrected GF-5 images. The SHAP could obtain the wavelength contribution of the CNN model in tailings spectral modeling. It can be concluded that the proposed TBI is able to rapidly characterize the spatial distribution of tailings properties, and the interpretable CNN model can provide a technical mean for accurate estimation of tailings properties based on laboratory spectra."

 In this study, a global Lagrangian chemistry-transport model, STOCHEM-CRI, was employed to study the formation of hydrogen (H2) from the oxidation of twenty anthropogenic and natural biogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The base case STOCHEM-CRI model was perturbed by applying a step-change to the emissions of each VOC in turn. Differences between each perturbed case and the base case were used to derive the responses in the fluxes through the formaldehyde photolysis source of H2 and in the oxidation rate of each VOC. H2 yields were largest for the natural biogenic VOCs: isoprene, α- and β-pinene and least, close to zero, for ethyne and benzene. Differences in yields were driven by the number of carbon atoms, by the chemical mechanisms of the hydroxyl radical and ozone reactions and by the involvement of long-lived oxidation products. These responses were then used to estimate the global H2 source strengths from the oxidation of anthropogenic and natural biogenic VOCs. Ethene oxidation dominated the global H2 source from the oxidation of anthropogenic VOCs, totalling 1.6 Tg yr−1. Isoprene oxidation dominated the natural biogenic VOC oxidation source, totalling 20 Tg yr−1, over ten times higher than the anthropogenic source. Uncertainties in the VOC oxidation source of H2 make a considerable contribution to the uncertainties in the global warming potentials for H2 estimated with current chemistry-transport models."

 This study investigates the influence of the summer Victoria Mode (VM) in the North Pacific on autumn precipitation over the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) between 1980 and 2010. The results show a statistically significant negative correlation between the summer VM (June–August: JJA) and autumn rainfall (August–October: ASO) in the GMS, which is independent of the effects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from the preceding winter. The positive phase of the summer VM leads to reduced autumn rainfall in key areas such as Yunnan Province, southern Myanmar, western and central Thailand, and central and southern Cambodia. Here we explored the dynamic mechanisms that link the summer VM to GMS rainfall, and identified three primary pathways: (1) the modulation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the development of a cyclonic circulation over the South China Sea, which reduces moisture transport to the GMS; (2) induced low-level divergence over the GMS, which suppresses ascending air motion; and (3) the propagation of a Rossby wave train that influences geopotential height anomalies and upper-level convergence around the GMS. These findings enhance our understanding of extratropical influences on autumn precipitation in the GMS and suggest that the summer VM could serve as a valuable predictor for seasonal rainfall forecasts, thereby assisting disaster prevention and mitigation efforts."

 This study identified two distinct categories of subseasonal precipitation events (SPEs) over the middle and low reaches of the Yangtze River Valley (MLYRV) during boreal summer based on the wet-dry rapid transition (WDRT) phenomenon, namely: subseasonal WDRT precipitation events (SRTPEs) and non-WDRT precipitation event (SNPEs). Although after cessations of these two events, area-averaged negative intraseasonal precipitation anomalies over the MLYRV both reach their peaks at pentad 2, the amplitude is greater for SRTPEs, in contrast to SNPEs. In conjunction with the stronger negative precipitation anomaly, the intensity of the anomalous descending motion at 500 hPa and the moisture flux divergence anomaly at 700 hPa averaged over the MLYRV are larger for SRTPEs. Furthermore, observational and model results reveal that the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) activities over the western North Pacific (WNP) are more vigorous for SRTPEs and the BSISO variations serve as a pivotal origin for discrepancies in these two dynamic factors at pentad 2 through the linear dry dynamic process. In order to elucidate underlying mechanisms of the area-averaged BSISO convection change, moisture budget and multi-scale interaction diagnoses are conducted and results underscore the crucial role of the difference in regionally averaged vertical gradient of low-frequency background moisture over the WNP in driving such BSISO convection variation. Additionally, some individual cases of SRTPEs and SNPEs are also examined. These discoveries provide us with a novel perspective to comprehend diversities of SPEs over the MLYRV and may contribute potentially to the subseasonal forecasting for this region."

Early and accurate diagnosis of PD is highly desirable for therapeutic interventions but remains a substantial challenge. We developed a soft, portable intelligent keyboard leveraging magnetoelasticity to detect subtle pressure variations in keystroke dynamics by converting continuous keystrokes into high-fidelity electrical signals, thus enabling the quantitative analysis of PD motor symptoms using machine learning. Relying on a fundamental working mechanism, the intelligent keyboard demonstrates highly sensitive, intrinsically waterproof, and biocompatible properties, with the successful demonstration in a pilot study on patients with PD. To facilitate the potential continuous monitoring of PD, a customized cellphone application was developed to integrate the intelligent keyboard into a wireless platform.

However, the synthesis of such advanced amines is challenging due to a higher level of structural complexity and stereo-control. Here, we report a modular protocol for short de novo synthesis of bis-α-chiral amines. This protocol uses commercially available Ellman sulfinamide,tert-butanesulfinamide (tBS), as the exclusive chiral source to selectively produce all possible stereoisomers. Sequential formation of contiguous α-amino chiral carbons is achieved by chirality induction and transfer mechanisms that are both enabled bytBS, the stereoselective imine functionalization and alkyne-participated rearrangement reaction. The second step we developed is crucial for high diastereoselectivity, which is problematic in previous methods.

Here, we present time- and momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, and we apply it to graphite, demonstrating that large (Δq≃1.2 Å−1) photoexcited electron-hole pockets induce a renormalization of in-plane and bulk plasmons. This effect is explained by intra- and intervalley scattering processes mediated by E2gandA′1phonon modes, which we directly observe via ultrafast electron diffraction and identify via ab initio calculations. Conversely, smaller electron-hole pockets (Δq≃0.7 Å−1) result in the renormalization of in-plane plasmons, which can only be partially explained by phonon-mediated scattering and thermal expansion.

Longstanding theories employing “gray” radiation tie the tropopause temperature to outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), but this is in contrast to recent work in which simulations exhibit a Fixed Tropopause Temperature (FiTT) even as OLR increases. The FiTT is thought to result from the interaction between upper tropospheric moisture and radiation, but a predictive theory for FiTT has not yet been formulated. Here, we build on a recent explanation for the temperature of anvil clouds and argue that tropopause temperature, defined by where radiative cooling becomes negligible, is set by water vapor's maximum spectroscopic absorption and Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling. This “thermospectric constraint” makes quantitative predictions for tropopause temperature that are borne out in single column and general circulation model experiments where the spectroscopy is modified and both the radiative and lapse‐rate tropopause change in response. This constraint provides a theoretical foundation for the FiTT hypothesis and a more refined explanation for why the tropopause rises with surface warming, shows how tropopause temperature can decouple from OLR, suggests a way to relate the temperatures of anvil clouds and the tropopause, and shows how spectroscopy manifests in Earth's general circulation."

Using a simple numerical model, we assess these assumptions under the free‐slip condition and compare it with the no‐slip case.

The change in the trend of the electrical conductivity profile has been observed at around ∼83 GPa, suggesting the increase of the relative abundance of the new component. The pressure dependence of hyperfine parameters indicates the spin transitions of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ occur above 100 GPa, which is likely related to the structural change of the glass.

Using an idealized Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model basin‐channel model, we vary both Southern Ocean wind stress and the isopycnal mixing coefficient independently. We find that when the wind and isopycnal mixing coefficient are small, a strong halocline in the far south prevents AABW formation. Increasing the wind stress and/or isopycnal mixing brings warmer, saltier water to the surface of the Southern Ocean, where it cools, becomes denser, and forms AABW.

Data limitations can be mitigated by using regionalization techniques, which augment observational information, and by employing effective statistical models, such as the Metastatistical Extreme Value Distribution (MEVD), which maximizes the use of available observations. In this work, we develop the MEVD Regionalized framework (MEVD‐R), with the aim of reducing the uncertainty in estimating the probability of rare events that are not present, or are not well sampled, in the observational record. Extensive testing using a global data set of 40,000 rain gauges across Europe, North America, and Australia demonstrates that MEVD‐R yields negligible systematic error and greatly reduces predictive uncertainty, quantified via the use of independent test data subsets, compared to traditional approaches. The MEVD‐R framework proves to be useful in data‐scarce areas, even when conventional methods fail."

Higher SSTs in IPWP drive northeastward movements of WPSH, causing increased rainfall in the mid‐lower reaches of the Yellow River Valley, but decreased rainfall in the mid‐lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley, and vice versa for lower SSTs. In addition, enlarged variability of WPSH associated with that of SSTs in IPWP can enhance the strength of the abrupt hydroclimate events.

 Amines have significant impacts on air quality, regional climate, and human health. To date, the emissions of amines from traffic sources remain unclear. In this study, we collected fine particulate matters from vehicle and ship exhausts, and subsequently characterized the emissions of 17 amines using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The concentrations and composition of particulate amines vary depending on the types of vehicles and ships. Trimethylamine and 2-Amino-1-butanol were predominant in vehicle exhausts, whereas dimethylamine and diethylamine were prominent in ship exhausts. Diesel vehicles exhibited the highest levels of total amines, followed by gasoline vehicles and compressed natural gas vehicles. Small ships emitted significantly more amines than large ones, with amine concentrations decreasing as engine power increased. Amines emissions from vehicles and ship's exhausts were hypothesized to originate primarily from the three-way-catalyst, selective catalytic reduction, or exhaust gas recirculation systems in the presence of ammonia and organic compounds. Based on the determined emission factors, the annual emissions of fine particulate amines from vehicles and ships in China were approximately 312 kg and 534 kg, respectively. According to the gas particle partitioning coefficient from field measurements, the annual emissions of gaseous amines from vehicles and ships in China were estimated to be 4.2–12.0 Mg and 7.2–20.5 Mg, respectively.

 Based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its data assimilation (DA) system, different hydrometeor retrieval schemes are explored in the indirect assimilation of radar reflectivity for two convective storm cases occurred in Jiangsu and Anhui. In indirect radar reflectivity data assimilation, two frequently-used hydrometeor retrieval methods exist: background-temperature-dependent (BTD) and background-hydrometeors-dependent (BHD) schemes. The BTD method empirically assigns contribution ratio of hydrometeors to the total equivalent reflectivity across different background temperature thresholds. The BHD scheme derives each type of hydrometeor based on proportions estimated from the background for different heights and reflectivity intervals. In this study, an adaptive blending scheme is developed to integrate the BTD and BHD methods. This approach aims to mitigate errors associated with empirical temperature relationships and the fixed proportion of the weights for snow and graupel in the BTD scheme and with uncertainties inherent in the hydrometers from the background in the BHB scheme. The standard deviations of the hydrometeor mixing ratios from each scheme based on surrounding 25 grid points are utilized to derive weights that dynamically blend the contributions of the two methods. The results from the Exp_hydro experiment using the blending scheme demonstrate that this approach adaptively adjusts the hydrometeor weights of the other two retrieval schemes in response to background changes during the DA cycle. Consequently, the analysis achieves hydrometeor mixing ratios that are more consistent with the background conditions. Furthermore, the forecasts from the Exp_hydro experiment demonstrate that blending scheme improves the accuracy of the reflectivity echo structure and surface wind in the short term for the Jiangsu case. For the Anhui case, the FSSs for precipitation and reflectivity further demonstrate the measurable improvements of the blending hydrometeor retrieval scheme."

However, global LIA knowledge is still lacking. This study generated the first global 500 m LIA products by gap-filling LIA measurement data. The global LIA is 41.47° ± 9.55° and increases with latitude. LIA products could enhance our understanding of global LIA and assist remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies. 
 Leaf inclination angle (LIA), the angle between the leaf surface normal and zenith directions, is a vital trait in radiative transfer, rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. Due to the difficulty of obtaining large-scale field measurement data, LIA is typically assumed to follow the spherical leaf distribution or simply considered to be constant for different plant types. However, the appropriateness of these simplifications and the global LIA distribution are still unknown. This study compiled global LIA measurements and generated the first global 500 m mean LIA (MLA) product by gap-filling the LIA measurement data using a random forest regressor. Different generation strategies were employed for noncrops and crops. The MLA product was evaluated by validating the nadir leaf projection function (G(0)) derived from the MLA product with high-resolution reference data. The global MLA is 41.47°±9.55°, and the value increases with latitude. The MLAs for different vegetation types follow the order of cereal crops (54.65°) > broadleaf crops (52.35°) > deciduous needleleaf forest (50.05°) > shrubland (49.23°) > evergreen needleleaf forest (47.13°) ≈ grassland (47.12°) > deciduous broadleaf forest (41.23°) > evergreen broadleaf forest (34.40°). Cross-validation shows that the predicted MLA presents a medium consistency (r=0.75, RMSE = 7.15°) with the validation samples for noncrops, whereas crops show relatively lower correspondence (r=0.48 and 0.60 for broadleaf crops and cereal crops, respectively) because of the limited LIA measurements and strong seasonality. The global mean G(0) is 0.68±0.11. The global G(0) distribution is out of phase with that of the MLA and agrees moderately with the reference data (r=0.62, RMSE = 0.15). This study shows that the common spherical and constant LIA assumptions may underestimate the interception of most vegetation types. The MLA and G(0) products derived in this study could enhance our knowledge of global LIA and should greatly facilitate remote sensing retrieval and land surface modeling studies.The global MLA and G(0) products can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12739662 (Li and Fang, 2025)."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and evapotranspiration (ET) have been widely recognized as proxies for carbon gain and water loss at the ecosystem level. However, most SIF and ET products on the global scale are generally at coarse temporal resolutions of at least one day, which limits their ability to characterize diurnal carbon and water cycles. In this study, we extended the spatiotemporal scale of satellite SIF (from OCO-2 and OCO-3) and ET (from ECOSTRESS) data using machine learning methods, resulting in a global hourly SIF and ET dataset (HOUR_SIFOCO and HOUR_ETECO) spanning from 1982 to 2022, with a spatial resolution of 0.1°. Our product also provides photosystem-level SIF derived from direct estimation and simulation of Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, aiming to offer a more accurate description of photosynthesis. Our satellite-derived products show good correlations with in-situ flux tower measurements from the FLUXNET2015 community (hourly-scale median R2 for SIF: 0.72, and ET: 0.53; daily-scale median R2 for SIF: 0.73, and ET: 0.63). Globally, our product shows good consistency with popular SIF and ET gridded products: the mean proportions of pixels with monthly R2 exceeding 0.7 are 69.5 % and 68.1 % when compared with four popular products, respectively.

 We introduce the development of CLIMADAT-GRid, the first publicly available daily air temperature and precipitation gridded climate dataset for Greece at a high resolution of 1 km x 1 km, covering the period 1981–2019. The dataset is derived from quality-controlled and homogenized daily measurements from an extensive network of meteorological stations: 122 for temperature and 312 for precipitation. Several approaches are evaluated for generating the daily gridded datasets, and their accuracy is assessed against withheld observational data. To address the lack of observations in high-elevation areas, high-resolution simulations from the WRF model are blended with the observational data to provide the gridded temperature data. CLIMADAT-GRid is benchmarked against the CHELSA-W5E5, a global climate product with a similar resolution, for the overlapping period 1981–2016. While both datasets show comparable results for temperature, CLIMADAT-GRid demonstrates superior spatial variability and closer agreement with observational data for both the mean and for the extreme values. Regarding precipitation, CLIMADAT-GRid consistency indicates higher values than CHELSA, especially during the rainy season, but exhibits better agreement with observations. In terms of the number of wet days, both datasets overestimate spatial means relative to observations, with CLIMADAT-GRid showing a more pronounced orographic pattern than CHELSA.

 The global near-surface soil freeze-thaw (FT) states are crucial for understanding complex interactions with hydrological, ecological, and climatic processes. However, current remote sensing of FT states primarily relies on passive microwave remote sensing, which, despite its all-weather monitoring capabilities, suffers from low spatial resolution. This limitation restricts its application to hydroclimatological scales, precluding its use in finer-scale studies such as soil erosion and hydrometeorological applications. To address this, this study introduces a novel downscaling approach that integrates passive microwave and optical satellite data to generate a long-term (2002–2023), high-resolution (0.05°) dataset of global near-surface FT states, ensuring daily seamless continuity. The dataset was validated against in situ measurements, demonstrating that the high-resolution product maintains an overall accuracy of 83.78 %, consistent with the coarse-resolution microwave-based dataset, while offering enhanced spatial detail. Comprehensive global trend analyses provided new insights into the dynamics of freeze-thaw cycles, revealing that the average annual number of frost days in regions north of 45° N is 187.8 ± 12.7 days, with 14.35 % of the area showing a decreasing trend in frozen persistence. Additionally, the average annual number of freeze onset dates is 240.3 ± 7.2, and 9.10 % of the area exhibits a trend of delayed freeze onset.

Our findings show Africa's cropland grew by 8.5 % over two decade, while 11.5 % of cropland was abandoned by 2018 – revealing hidden challenges in agricultural sustainability. These yearly, field-sized maps help governments track where farming grows or shrinks, plan food supplies, and protect vital cropland. 
 Accurate cropland mapping is essential for understanding agricultural dynamics in Africa, a critical global issue with significant implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., Zero Hunger). Large-scale cropland mapping encounters several challenges, including the varying landscape characteristics of cropland across different regions, extended cultivation periods, and the limited availability of reference data. The study developed a 30-meter resolution African annual cropland distribution (namely AFCD) dataset for Africa spanning the years 2000 to 2022. To extract this large-scale cropland distribution data, we employed random forest classification and Continuous Change Detection algorithms on the Google Earth Engine platform. Robust training samples were generated, and a locally adaptive model was applied for cropland extraction. The final output consists of annual binary Crop/Non-Crop maps from 2000 to 2022. Independent validation samples from numerous third-party sources confirm that the map’s accuracy is 0.86±0.01. A comparison of the cropland area estimates from AFCD with those of the FAO for Africa yielded an R-squared value of 0.86. According to our estimates, Africa’s cropland expanded from 194.35 Mha in 2000 to 210.92 Mha by 2022, marking a net increase of 8.53 %. Prior to 2005, changes in Africa’s cropland area were gradual, but after 2006, there was a marked acceleration in cropland expansion. Despite this continued growth, Africa also experienced significant cropland abandonment. By 2018, abandoned cropland accounted for 11.52 % of the total active cropland area. AFCD also avoided the misclassification of buildings, roads, and trees surrounding cropland, a common issue in LGRIP products. The study further highlights the unique advantage of AFCD in providing a dynamic annual cropland dataset at 30-meter resolution for Africa. This dataset is a crucial resource for understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of cropland and can support policies on food security and sustainable land management.

Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between flux and pool size data, where cumulative imbalances can reach hundreds of gigatons of carbon or nitrogen. These imbalances appear primarily due to missing or inconsistently reported fluxes – especially for land-use and fire emissions. To enhance data quality, we recommend that future climate data protocols address this issue at the reporting stage. 
 Reliable, robust, and consistent data are essential foundations for analysis of carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we consider the data from multiple Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We identify a mass conservation issue in the reported carbon and nitrogen data, with a few exceptions for specific models and reporting levels. The accumulated mass imbalance in the reported data can amount to hundreds of gigatons of carbon or nitrogen by the end of the simulated period, largely exceeding the total carbon–nitrogen pool size changes over the same period. Nitrogen mass imbalance is evident across all reported organic and inorganic pools, with mineral nitrogen exhibiting the most significant cumulative mass imbalance.  Due to a lack of detail in the reported data, we cannot uniquely identify the cause of this imbalance. However, we postulate that the carbon mass imbalance primarily arises from missing fluxes in the reported data and inconsistencies between these data and the definitions provided by the C4MIP protocol (e.g., land-use and fire emissions), rather than from an underlying mass conservation issue in the models themselves. Our findings suggest that future CMIP reporting protocols should consider incorporating mass conservation into their data validation processes so that such issues are caught before users have to deal with them, rather than forcing all users to handle this issue in their own way. In addition, attention from model groups to the detailed diagnostic request and definitions, along with their own quality control, will also help to avoid such issues in future. Given that no additional CMIP6 data are currently being published and none are expected in the future, we recommend that data users that rely on a closed carbon–nitrogen cycle address potential flux imbalances by using the workarounds provided in this study."

Using chemical extractions combined with laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we revealed that Mn oxides serve as primary Cd carriers in Mn-rich nodules, accounting for approximately 63.6% of total Cd, dominating Cd enrichment through binding mechanisms of Cd–O and Cd–OH bonds characteristic of inner-sphere surface complexation and structural incorporation. The stability of these chemical interactions was confirmed by pH-dependent experiments, showing <5.0% of total Cd release even at pH = 3.0. The high Mn(III) mass ratios (36.0%–40.0%) in nodules facilitated stable inner-sphere complexation, resulting in increased Cd retention. These study findings reveal the exceptional Cd sequestration capacity of natural Mn-rich nodules, and provide insights for the high concentrations and low availabilities of soil Cd in karst, which can aid in developing strategies for managing Cd-polluted karst soils."

Most UHI studies have focused on the impacts of two-dimensional (2D) urbanization, which involves outward city expansion and increased built-up area. However, as cities mature, they typically transition from horizontal expansion to vertical densification (3D urbanization), leading to increased material stock density. The implications of this shift for the UHI effect remain underexplored. This study compared the 2D and 3D urbanization–induced impacts on UHI across 384 Chinese cities from 2000 to 2020, using impervious surface and gridded material stocks. Our results surprisingly indicated that 2D urbanization lost explanatory power of the UHI intensity when the impervious surface area percentage exceeded 87%. Relative importance analysis utilizing a random forest algorithm revealed that the population, vegetation abundance, and precipitation significantly moderated the effects of 3D urbanization, emphasizing the crucial role of urban green spaces in mitigating thermal stress. This study examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the UHI effect in China, emphasizing the key role of 3D urbanization. Our findings highlight the urgent need to incorporate 3D urbanization characteristics when devising UHI mitigation strategies."

This study examines the behavior of Cd-loaded ferrihydrite (Fh) with/without organic matter (OM) undergoing S(-II)-induced reduction followed by O2-induced reoxidation. During sulfidation, S(-II) was fully consumed, and Fh was partially reduced to Fe(II) species, with some OM released from the Fh surface. Meanwhile, Cd initially adsorbed on Fh was completely converted to CdS, regardless of Cd loading or the presence of OM. Upon reoxidation, Fe(II) species were reoxidized to Fe(III) oxides, which recaptured OM, while solid-phase S(-II) was oxidized to S0 and sulfate. Concurrently, partial oxidation of CdS occurred, mainly driven by H2O2 generated during Fe(II) oxidation, with minor contributions from •OH and O2, but OM inhibited CdS oxidation, primarily by scavenging H2O2. Released Cd from CdS oxidation was predominantly readsorbed on Fe(III) oxides. Additionally, released Cd was partially structurally incorporated into newly formed Fe(III) oxides while some CdS was encapsulated within Fe(III) oxide aggregates. However, OM interactions with Fe(III) oxides reduced the formation of these Cd species. These findings provide insights into the molecular-scale mechanisms governing Cd dynamics in redox-dynamic environments."

Recent evidence suggests that AnAOB can perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), potentially coupling Fe(III) reduction with NH4+–N oxidation (Feammox). However, whether AnAOB directly participate in Feammox within complex wastewater treatment systems remains unclear. Here, we investigated the iron-mediated nitrogen metabolism pathways in a microaerobic granular sludge (MGS) reactor by integrating enzyme inhibition assays with analyses of gene dynamics and co-occurrence patterns of nitrogen- and iron-cycling genes. Results demonstrate that AnAOB contributed to Feammox activity. The iron reduction gene CT573071, coding a porin-cytochrome c protein complex associated with EET, co-occurred with hao, hzsABC, and hdh genes in Candidatus Kuenenia, suggesting its role in Feammox. Furthermore, four high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with Kuenenia stuttgartiensis_A harbored CT573071, hao-like, hzsABC, and hdh genes, along with the hao-cluster, which catalyzes the oxidation of NH4+–N to hydroxylamine. This genomic evidence further supports their dual metabolic capacity. Metatranscriptomic analysis confirmed CT573071 upregulation and its coexpression with the hao, hzsABC, and hdh genes.

Sowerby’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens), elusive deep-sea foragers, offer a unique opportunity to assess the impacts of anthropogenic pollutants in this remote environment. This study examined a range of legacy and emerging hydrophobic pollutants, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), across tissues from five stranded whales foraging in Swedish waters. Despite global efforts to reduce pollution, significant pollutant levels in these whales underscore the persistence of legacy contaminants and the widespread use of PCAs. Most pollutants were concentrated in lipid-rich blubber, while PCAs exhibited particularly high levels in whole blood (941–13100 ng/g lipid), indicating tissue-specific accumulation. Blubber pollutant levels were similar to those of harbor porpoises from the same waters, with p,p′-DDE (1020–2280 ng/g lipid) and PCBs (1230–1930 ng/g lipid) exceeding or nearing effect thresholds. Blood concentrations of legacy pollutants were approximately an order of magnitude higher than those in humans from the region, while PCA levels were comparable to those of humans.

Pronounced north‐south hemispheric differences in this asymmetry, by up to 40 days, were attributed to the eccentricity of Earth's orbit. However, we propose that the dominant factor comes from the difference in the land‐sea fraction between hemispheres, because the asymmetry is strongly influenced by the annually varying heat capacity and land‐sea interactions. The oceanic temperature annual cycle generally features a longer cooling period than warming due to the seasonal variation in ocean mixed layer depth, and exhibits the opposite situation when there is seasonal sea ice. Land‐sea interactions impact the zonal mean temperature annual cycle by resulting in an earlier winter trough of the downstream oceanic temperature and delaying the summer peak in west coasts."

Two methods for computing cross‐frequency kinetic energy flux are compared to observed dissipation. One method, coarse graining, allows strongly nonlinear dynamics while the other assumes weak nonlinearity. Fluxes from both methods agree within a factor of 3 with dissipation estimates from a finescale parameterization which is often used in climate‐scale ocean models. Coarse graining predicts 68% of energy fluxing to dissipation from frequencies lower than 8cpd, while the weakly nonlinear method predicts 34%. The weighting of energy flux toward lower frequencies supports a shorter frequency‐space pathway to dissipation in the presence of topographic wave breaking than assumed by parameterizations. Enhanced near‐boundary mixing and upwelling has implications for the rate and spatial distribution of the upwelling branch of the global overturning circulation."

In this study, we investigated changes in the duration of seasonal surface soil freeze‒thaw cycles across China and subregions divided by climate and ecosystem types (temperate and warm‒temperate deserts of northwestern China, temperate grasslands of Inner Mongolia, temperate humid and subhumid zones of northeastern China, warm‒temperate humid and subhumid zones of North China, and high‒elevation and cold zones of the Tibetan Plateau) from 1981 to 2017 and examined their relationships with meteorological elements using both homogenized weather station data and gridded observations. The results showed that the freeze start date has been delayed by 8.6 days and that the freeze end date has advanced by 8.6 days, resulting in a shortened freeze duration by 17.2 days in China. This change was most pronounced in the high‒elevation and cold zones of the Tibetan Plateau, with a shortened freeze duration by 25.2 days, and the weakest change was present in the temperate humid and subhumid zones of northeastern China. Nationwide, the decreasing trend of the freeze duration first increased but then decreased with increasing elevation, and it consistently decreased with increasing latitude. Changes in the freeze duration are significantly correlated with the following factors: air temperature in spring, autumn and winter, snow depth in spring, autumn and winter; and vegetation in autumn. Distinct regional differences exist in these relationships. These results provide a new understanding of surface freeze‒thaw cycle changes and their causes in China."

Although the basin has a fetch‐limited environment, extra‐tropical cyclones can still produce high waves. With increasing global temperatures altering the climate system, wave climate changes are anticipated, albeit with varying reliability across modeled climate variables. This study investigates projected wave climate changes in the Mediterranean using an extensive ensemble of EURO‐CORDEX GCM‐RCMs wave simulations based on the high‐emission scenario RCP8.5. We assess future shifts in wave climate statistics while incorporating model variability for comprehensive results. Consistent with previous studies, our results indicate an overall reduction in significant wave height Hs $\left({H}_{s}\right)$, with reductions up to 0.45 m in autumn and winter, alongside significant shifts in wave direction. The future extreme wave climate changes were further evaluated by computing 100‐year Hs ${H}_{s}$ return levels. Extreme event distributions from all simulations were bias‐corrected and aggregated into a single coherent distribution for each period. Our findings reveal for the first time robust evidence of intensification of extreme waves toward the end of the century in several regions of the Mediterranean, with increases of 0.50–2 m in Hs ${H}_{s}$. While focusing solely on a high‐emission scenario limits the scope of these findings for mitigation strategies, this study underscores the need to analyze both full and extreme distributions in wave climate projections.

Quantifying C flux is crucial for learning C cycling, but is challenging due to its complex cycling and significant impacts from intensive human activities. Here, we developed a process‐based model (CDP) to achieve a daily estimation of C dynamics in agricultural ponds within lowland artificial watersheds (polders), and proposed a dual evaluation approach (concentration and flux) to assess the model's performance using two data sets obtained from eight typical polders in the Lake Taihu Basin. The developed model captured pond C dynamics, achieving a Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.44 ± 0.27. Our C flux estimations based on the newly‐developed model showed large C emissions, primarily through carbon dioxide (CO2) (497.5 g C m−2 yr−1), along with significant C burial (27.8 g C m−2 yr−1) with a hot moment in summer. Scenario simulations revealed the distinct impacts of pond C emissions and burial associated with the growth and death of phytoplankton and macrophytes.

However, quantifying just how quickly high‐tide flooding rates are changing, and whether some places experience more high‐tide flooding than others, is challenging. To quantify trends in high‐tide flooding from tide‐gauge observations, flood thresholds—elevations above which flooding begins—must be specified. Past studies of high‐tide flooding in the United States have used different data sets and approaches for specifying flood thresholds, only some of which directly relate to coastal impacts, which has lead to sometimes conflicting and ambiguous results. Here we present a novel method for quantifying, with uncertainty, high‐tide flooding thresholds along the United States coast based on sparsely available impact‐based flood thresholds. We use those newly modeled thresholds to make an updated assessment of changes in high‐tide flooding across the United States over the past few decades. From 1990–2000 to 2010–2020, high‐tide flooding rates almost certainly (probability P>99% $P > 99\%$) increased along the United States East Coast, Gulf Coast, California, and Pacific Islands, while they very likely (P=93%) $(P=93\%)$ decreased along Alaska during that time; significant changes in high‐tide flooding rates between the two decades were not detected in Oregon, Washington, and the Caribbean. Averaging spatially, we find that high‐tide flooding rates probably (P=85%) $(P=85\%)$ more than doubled nationally between 1990–2000 and 2010–2020.

However, the potential of the carbon sink effect still lacks scenario‐based systematic estimation. By backdating the GFGP carbon sink increase in the Loess Plateau (LP) over the past 20 years, we forecast and reveal the spatial distribution of the carbon sink and the contribution of the GFGP in the “Double Carbon Target” years under three scenarios. Our results showed that places restored to forests (GFGP‐Forest) will always lead to a carbon sink increase by (33.62 Tg C for 2000–2020) 0.78–1.09 Tg C and 1.29–2.13 Tg C in 2030 and 2060, respectively. However, the places restored to grasslands (GFGP‐Grassland) will lead to an increase for 2000–2020 (72.52 Tg C), but a decrease in 2030 and 2060 (0.89–9.95 Tg C and 7.42–11.18 Tg C). This conversion is due to the combination of the decrease of the Net Primary Productivity and the increase of the heterotrophic respiration in the future, which indicates that the restoration programs involved in converting croplands into grasslands will severely decrease the carbon sink benefits and potential. In summary, it is essential to correctly quantify the carbon contribution in the LP resulting from the GFGP, and properly manage to augment the carbon sink from the GFGP‐Forest and avoid the carbon source of GFGP‐Grassland in the future. Our results highlight the hidden danger of leaking carbon sink of grasslands in a typical semi‐arid region under future climate‐changing conditions."

Exposure to produced water can occur following its release to the environment through spills or leaks during its handling and management. Exposure can also arise from authorized releases, including permitted discharges to surface water, crop irrigation, and road treatment.

To quantify heat exposure more effectively, integrated heat stress indicators (HSIs) have been developed to simplify the classification of heat stress severity and assist in public heat warnings. However, their ability to accurately predict daily heat stroke cases has not been fully assessed. In this study, we evaluated the performance of multiple HSIs in forecasting the number of heat stroke‐related emergency ambulance dispatches (HT‐EADs) across 47 prefectures in Japan and compared their accuracy to models using raw meteorological variables. Our results indicate that, while HSIs simplify the process of assessing heat stress, they generally show lower performances than models based on raw meteorological data. Among the eight HSIs tested, the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (TWBG) showed the strongest predictive power, with median R2 values of 0.77 and 0.70 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. However, models incorporating air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation outperformed TWBG, achieving R2 values of 0.85 and 0.74. We also observed spatial variability in HSI performance, particularly in cooler regions like Hokkaido, where HSIs provided no improvement over temperature alone. Given these findings, we recommend that HSIs be rigorously evaluated with local health data before being used in heat warning systems for specific locations. For predictions requiring high accuracy, raw meteorological variables could be prioritized to ensure greater precision."

 The rheology of the lower crust and upper mantle influences Earth’s plate tectonic style of mantle convection, yet its spatial variability is poorly resolved, particularly in continental interiors. Here we use satellite radar interferometry to map the delayed uplift resulting from the desiccation of the Aral Sea, which has lost ~1,000 km3 of water since 1960. From this we constrain the rheology of the underlying upper mantle by elastic and viscoelastic modelling. We find a long-wavelength uplift of up to ~7 mm yr–1 between 2016 and 2020 that decays radially from the Aral Sea. This uplift pattern is best explained by viscoelastic relaxation of the asthenosphere below a strong lithospheric mantle. We estimate that the asthenosphere has an effective viscosity of 4–7 × 1019 Pa s below 130–190 km depth, slightly larger than the values inferred from post-seismic deformation at subduction zones, but 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than estimates from glacial isostatic adjustment in other tectonically stable regions. Such uplift highlights the potential for human activities to influence deep-Earth dynamics and the interconnectedness of surface and mantle processes.

Between 2022 and 2023, the heating from EEI was over 75% larger than during the onset of similar recent El Niño events. We show further how regional processes shaped distinct patterns of record-breaking sea surface temperatures in individual ocean basins.

 Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) measures the difference between saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure, and its variability is closely related to fire activity in the western United States (US). Here, we assess the forecast skill of monthly VPD variability using a state-of-the-art dynamical forecast system and statistical predictions, such as the persistence forecast and model-analog forecasts. In the model-analog framework, we select analog states resembling the observed initial conditions from the model space, and the subsequent evolution of those initial model-analogs yields forecast ensembles. Dynamical forecasts demonstrate skillful predictions of VPD variability in the western US, exceeding the persistence forecast skill, which indicates additional sources of VPD predictability within the climate system. To quantify the contribution of different climate variables to VPD prediction, we develop a weighted model-analog forecast and evaluate its skill in comparison to VPD-only and unweighted forecasts. Our findings suggest that sea surface temperature is a critical source of VPD predictability over the western US. The optimally weighted model-analog exhibits forecast skill for VPD variability comparable to that of the dynamical forecast system."

 Traditionally, deriving water-quality parameters from satellite ocean color measurements involves multiple complex steps, including in-orbit radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and water property retrieval, all of which require substantial resources and effort. Given the abundance of water-quality related products provided by established ocean color satellite missions, we propose a scheme (DN2WP) to estimate water-quality parameters directly from the digital number (DN) data obtained at satellite altitude. Using Secchi Disk Depth (ZSD) as an example and the ZSD data from Sentinel-3 as a reference, HiSea-II DN data were converted to ZSD directly by DN2WP. In the training phase, the coefficient of determination (R2) for ZSD reached 0.95, with a mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of ∼10 %. When applied to new datasets, the R2 for ZSD exceeded 0.8, and the MAPD remained within 20 %. The DN2WP scheme was further tested using the multispectral sensors of the CZI on board the HY-1C satellite and MII on the SDGSAT-1 satellite, respectively, and a high level of performance was maintained by achieving an R2 of 0.83 (0.84) with MAPD as 19.8 % (15.8 %) for CZI (SDGSAT-1) on independent data. These results are significantly better than the consistency measure of ZSD between such satellites and Sentinel-3A/3B obtained individually through the traditional multi-step approach. It indicates that DN2WP is an efficient approach to get water-quality parameters from top-of-atmosphere DN data measured by a satellite sensor, which also results in much better consistency across different satellite missions."

 Delivery of suspended particles, referred hereafter also to as suspended sediment, to coastal zones plays a first order control on the development and maintenance of muddy geomorphic features like river deltas, mudflats, and tidal wetlands. While sediment delivery from rivers is relatively straightforward to monitor and has been well studied, suspended sediment derived from erosion of coastal bluffs and resuspension of shallow subtidal sediments remains poorly constrained. Estimates of the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) provide one of the best remotely sensed metrics for suspended sediment supply to the coast. Spaceborne ocean color sensors with coarse spatial resolution (∼1 km pixel size at nadir) are generally inadequate to resolve smaller-scale sediment dynamics in coastal waters and additionally there is a limitation associated with adjacency effect of 1-km land pixels on near-shore water pixels. In contrast, satellites dedicated primarily to land observations with a smaller pixel size (∼30 m) provide more adequate spatial resolution for observations of coastal waters. This paper presents a particle composition adaptive algorithm for retrieving SPM from ocean remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs(λ), in coastal waters which is applicable to most land observation satellites. For the algorithm development, we compiled more than 800 paired in situ spectral reflectance and SPM measurements from 12 marine sites worldwide, representing a wide range of suspended particle concentration and composition. We first classify the satellite image data into three water types: organic-rich, mineral-rich, or extremely mineral-rich based on the POC/SPM ratio that is derived from Rrs(λ). The ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to SPM serves as a particle composition metric. Then, SPM is estimated from Rrs(λ) using a particle composition-specific algorithm which employs the reflectance at red band for organic-rich waters and near-infrared (NIR) for mineral-rich waters. We compared the performance of this algorithm with eight previously published SPM algorithms, including empirical, semi-analytical, and machine learning approaches. Results show that our algorithm produces reliable SPM estimation with coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE in log space), and median absolute percent error (MAPE) of 0.91, 0.20, and 30.5 %, respectively. To examine the capability of our algorithm to study the long-term variability in coastal SPM at high spatial resolution, we implemented the algorithm to the 40-year Landsat data archive in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Landsat mapping results of SPM were validated using both the satellite-in situ matchups of SPM data as well as in situ water turbidity measurements. Finally, we demonstrate a few scenarios of fine-scale SPM patterns as well as seasonal and long-term variability across different marine coastal environments using the satellite high spatial resolution SPM mapping. These results collectively demonstrate the promise of this new SPM retrieval algorithm for mapping and monitoring global coastal suspended sediment dynamics."

 Hydraulic erosion-induced soil loss critically undermines soil fertility, leading to vegetation degradation, reduced crop yields, and increased flood and pollution risks, thereby threatening food security, ecological integrity, and economic stability. Existing soil erosion estimations using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model are constrained by the absence of high-resolution (30 m) nationwide rainfall data, significant spatial and temporal inconsistencies among multi-source data, and limited regional adaptability of empirical RUSLE parameters. To address these challenges, we developed the first 30-m resolution Hydraulic Soil Erosion Dataset (CSWED) for Chinese mainland, spanning from 1990 to 2022. This was achieved by implementing a Random Forest (RF) interpolation method to generate 30-m annual rainfall data and designing a multi-equation combined vegetation cover management factor tailored to China’s diverse soil characteristics. The mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the China Soil and Water Conservation Bulletin was 9.48%, and the CSWED illustrates good consistency with collected runoff plot observation data, significantly surpassing the accuracy of existing publicly available datasets. Our analysis reveals a predominant influence of slope length, steepness, and support practice factors on soil erosion, coupled with a synergistic effect of vegetation cover and topography. Notably, soil erosion in Chinese mainland has exhibited an overall decreasing trend from 1990 to 2022, with significant reductions in light, moderate, and severe erosion categories by 31.70%, 22.24%, and 44.74%, respectively. Also, the sensitivity of soil erosion in 2022 was dominated by strong sensitivity and moderate sensitivity, accounting for 74.149 % and 14.072 %. Then, the decrease in cropland area creates a decrease in soil erosion of 123.54 t/hm2 from 1990 to 2022, while for every additional hectare of forested area, soil erosion was reduced by 58.67 t. Special attention should be given to the substantial expansion of soil erosion brought on by extreme rainfall in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLYR) and Southwest China (SWC), where mean soil erosion was 11.71 t/(hm2a) and 15.79 t/(hm2a), respectively, accounting for 60% of the national total."

 Monitoring and mapping of forest stands, including tree species composition can support forest protection and management. Sentinel-2 imagery provide a viable data source due to their high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution. However, especially in temperate mixed forests challenges with tree species classification persist, mainly due to the high mixing ratio of tree species, which cannot be fully resolved even with the 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 data. Additional challenges are associated with the commonly low number of reference data for rare tree species, resulting in low classification accuracy for these species. This study proposes an approach to map sub-pixel tree species fractions in mixed temperate forests by combining dense annual multi-spectral Sentinel-2 time series to target differences between species in phenological relevant periods with synthetically mixed training data. This allows for a limited number of pure training samples per tree species, which serves as basis for randomized linear mixing to compute a synthetic spectral library. An artificial neural network is trained for regression for tree species fractions per pixel. To enhance model robustness and stabilize predictions, we implemented this library generation and artificial neural network regression as an ensemble approach. We effectively mapped tree species fractions for the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, with Mean Absolute Errors of 2.76% to 16.05% and R2 values up to 0.92 – when validated against forest planning data. We show that the data augmentation through synthetic mixing allows for a sample size as small as 30 pure pixels per class, to sufficiently distinguish nine tree species and one ‘other species’ class, hence substantially increasing the operational potential for deployment when reference data for rare species are limited – while simultaneously generating accurate and information-rich tree species distributions over large areas of mixed forest."

 In August 2022 and 2024, Southern China experienced unprecedented heatwaves. Using ERA5 reanalysis data, we conducted a comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between these two extreme heatwaves. Our findings reveal that while the 2024 heatwave was less intense than the one in 2022, it was more concentrated in late August, unlike the prolonged heatwave in 2022, which spanned the entire month. Despite these variations in intensity and duration, both heatwaves were driven by a common atmospheric mechanism: anomalous easterly winds resulted in subsidence and significant temperature anomalies across Southern China. These easterly winds were closely associated with an anticyclone anomaly over the region, influenced by an upstream wave train from Europe. Crucially, warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Barents Sea played a vital role in sustaining and forming this wave train. To further validate this mechanism, we conducted a regression analysis using historical data from 1979 to 2024, confirming its broad applicability in explaining heatwaves in Southern China, including those of shorter durations like the 2024 event. This study significantly advances our understanding of heatwave dynamics in Southern China and offers novel insights that can improve future predictive capabilities."

Identifying gaps in the consideration of freshwater ecosystems,"Growing evidence suggests that freshwater ecosystems incur exacerbated impacts during drought due to anthropogenic activities. This has prompted calls for the development of drought management strategies that more effectively incorporate these ecosystems. Efforts to examine how drought management instruments care for freshwater ecosystems are scarce, limited to a few geographic regions, and do not systematically analyse each of the elements of the drought management process. In this study, we review drought management instruments in 26 countries or regions within countries to assess the extent and the manner with which freshwater ecosystems are considered. We apply an analytical framework integrating knowledge from drought management, ecological risk assessment and ecological drought to extract data from these instruments and identify patterns and gaps. Results indicate that care for freshwater ecosystems in drought management is as yet at an early stage. This is reflected in the limited inclusion of freshwater ecosystems across critical elements of the drought management process, as well as significant shortcomings in how these ecosystems are considered. We synthesise these shortcomings in four gaps. First, the socio-ecological perspective of ecological drought, particularly regarding the combined natural-human causes of drought impacts on freshwater ecosystems, is often lacking in drought definitions, exposure and vulnerability assessments. Second, despite their importance to ecosystems, there is limited consideration of variables related to groundwater, water quality, and aquatic habitats in freshwater ecosystem indicators, exposure assessments and measures. Third, the duration, frequency and timing of drought, which are relevant to the ecology of freshwater ecosystems, are rarely considered in drought indicators and measures. Finally, exposure and vulnerability assessments often lack a comprehensive understanding of ecological drought risk in freshwater ecosystems. We discuss these gaps and provide an outlook towards more integrated and sustainable drought policy and management."

It is evident that micro-sized wastes are just as significant as macro-sized ones, and this issue should be prioritized. The use of textile waste in sound insulation materials is increasingly gaining attention. However, conventional sound absorption materials, such as fiberglass, polyurethane, and melamine foams, offer high-performance acoustic properties, but are derived from non-renewable resources and contribute to environmental degradation. This study aims to develop environmentally friendly fibrous sound absorption panels by reusing MF waste generated during textile finishing processes. Waste MFs used within the scope of the study were collected from a textile finishing process’ wastewater containing a variety of fibers, including wool, cotton, acrylic, polyamide, polyester, polypropylene, and viscose by filtration method and blended with polyester fiber as a binder. Then, acoustic panels were produced using a hot press technique by varying the panel thickness, density, and binder fiber ratio, and the physical, chemical, morphological, and acoustic properties of these panels were tested. Findings revealed that thickness emerged as a critical factor, with the thickest samples exhibiting the highest sound absorption coefficient (0.9 at 3000 Hz). Moreover, an increase in sample density correlated positively with enhanced sound absorption values, while the binder fiber ratio demonstrated a negative impact. Additionally, all samples exhibited hydrophobic characteristics, showcasing water resistance. The statistical analysis of sound absorption performance was conducted using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s honestly significant difference test, with the results visualized through boxplots. Compared to conventional materials, the developed MF-based panels provide an eco-friendly alternative by reducing reliance on virgin synthetic materials while achieving competitive sound absorption properties. This study enables sustainable waste management in the textile industry and the reuse of MF waste, providing alternative and environmentally friendly solutions to currently used sound absorption materials. While the recyclability and reuse potential of these panels remain promising, further research is needed to evaluate their long-term mechanical performance, resistance to environmental degradation, and practical implementation in real-world applications. Future investigations should focus on optimizing large-scale production processes and assessing the environmental footprint of these materials throughout their lifecycle."

This study presents a global assessment of the energy potential of an unconventional wind energy technology called airborne wind energy system (AWES) for onshore applications. This technology has a considerably small material footprint and visual impact compared to the conventional wind turbines. The target technology is a system currently available in the market that generates electricity based on a soft kite connected by a tether to a generator. It was found that globally, this technology can theoretically deliver 38.5 PWh yr−1. After considering topographic and land suitability restrictions the energy potential decreases to 12.5 PWh yr−1 (equivalent to around half of 2022 electricity consumption). The high-grade energy potential (annual average capacity factor >32%) constituted around three quarters of the global total. Further analyses will clarify the effect of uncertainties involved in the assessment (such as the height of operation and the land suitability constraints, among others), and the conditions under which AWES outperform conventional wind turbines. Also, the assessment can be extended to offshore applications and to include the economic evaluation of the energy potential.

Yet there has been little analysis of how quickly carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies could scale to meet this expected need. We develop a new integrated modeling approach for assessing scalability that combines insights from the history of analogous technological revolutions with information about the efficacy and specific constraints of CDR strategies. We illustrate our approach with genetically enhanced crops that grow larger roots and, in turn, increase soil carbon. Unlike many CDR technologies whose deployment will be slowed by the need for novel and costly infrastructures, history suggests that crop innovations can scale rapidly in countries that admit them. Within 13 years of first deployment, diffusion of enhanced crops could peak and remove 0.9–1.2 GtCO2 yr–1—about 7 times larger than all CO2 offsets supplied today to the global voluntary offsets market. Upscaling depends on policy and politics, as they affect the total land area on which carbon-absorbing crops are allowed. Early scaling could allow crop engineering to play an outsized role in a portfolio of CDR strategies that, overall, scales to IPCC-like levels of carbon removal, even though carbon storage in soils is less permanent than geological storage."

Between the 1930s and 2023, Medellín’s population increased from about 120 thousand to 2.5 million inhabitants, while its area expanded from 9 km2 to 107 km2.

Landslides have predominantly impacted the outskirts of the urban area, causing harm primarily to newly emerged neighbourhoods towards the city’s north, northeast, and west especially since 1960s. Thus, we argue that struggling settlement on Medellín’s margins has likely increased the city’s landslide hazards. Landslides kill 2 to 3.5 times more people per km2 in informal neighbourhoods (categorised as Informal II and III) than in the most hazardous formal neighbourhood type.

We explore future uncertainty in three key dimensions: realisable mitigation potentials, cost dynamics, and resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that afforestation and reforestation, and soil carbon sequestration appear as robust options, deployed regardless of the removals required. Direct air carbon capture and storage emerges as the most deployed technology in 2100 at median value (6.7 GtCO2 yr−1), but with the widest range of possible outcomes (interquartile range from 4 to 8.7 GtCO2 yr−1) depending largely on future renewable energy capacity and annual geological storage injection rates. Bioenergy with CCS deployment remains severely constrained by available land, as the median falls from 1.8 to 0.3 GtCO2 yr−1 in land-constrained scenarios, but gains portfolio share when future energy availability is bounded. Our simulations also reveal that ocean alkalinisation could become a dominant solution in high removal scenarios.

It is critical to evaluate the impacts of CDHW and assess global socio-economic risks to formulate appropriate risk mitigation strategies. Most studies have focused on projecting the likely variation in the multidimensional hazard of CDHW. However, the discrepancies among global population projection datasets based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and their potential impacts on disaster risk assessments remain underexplored. In this study, multiple global high-resolution population projection datasets are used in combination with projected CDHW hazards via the multimodel ensemble from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to investigate how different sources of population data could affect the assessment of CDHW-exposed populations under SSPs. The results show that at the global scale, the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the CDHW-exposed population under climate change can be depicted consistently on the basis of different population data. However, at the subcontinental scale, substantial spatial heterogeneity exists in the projected exposure. For regions such as the Mediterranean, South Asia, and western Central Asia, the projections from different datasets are consistent with low uncertainty. In contrast, for regions including the northern hemisphere above 40°N, Oceania, eastern Central Asia, East Asia, the South American monsoon region, western Africa, Central Africa, etc., the uncertainty in the estimated exposed population is higher and is expected to increase from the 2020s to the end of the 21st century.

While socio-hydrology offers a conceptual framework emphasizing the equal importance of social and hydrological processes in water management outcomes, the relative significance of each may vary depending on the specific context, water users’ perspectives, and their particular needs. To study these relationships, we applied the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) to explore how livelihood assets of water user groups affect their water security in the headwaters of Cusco, Peru. We surveyed 154 residents about their perceptions of their natural, physical, social, human, and financial assets, alongside external influences like climate change and water legislation. We found that while water infrastructure (physical asset) is critical for water access, it does not ensure water security. Robust social assets are essential, as well as contributions from other assets. Furthermore, our results indicate that water user profiles (e.g. domestic water users or farmers) explain better the variability in water-related livelihood assets than geographical location or altitude. Using the SLF approach, we were able to identify the unique water-related needs, priorities, and challenges faced by each water user group. Therefore, water management in high mountain areas may pass through holistic community engagement and the strengthening of diverse assets—especially social ones—which can be achieved and included in policy frameworks aimed at sustainable water management and equitable water access. This would enable mountain communities to be better equipped to handle environmental and economic changes, moving towards more resilient and inclusive water security solutions."

Current resilience studies in the Amazon rely on passive and active remote sensing forest cover metrics that offer limited insight into nuanced forest canopy structural changes associated with degradation. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar provides detailed information on canopy structure, a key factor in forest recovery, resilience, and ability to provide ecosystem services. We evaluate GEDI spaceborne lidar’s capability to characterise forest structure along a gradient of degradation (e.g. primary unburned (PU), secondary recovering, fire frequency), and investigate the potential of quantifying forest structure to advance understanding of forest responses to disturbance across the Amazon. We assess the correspondence of GEDI structural metrics such as relative height (RH) and canopy cover to airborne lidar metrics across the Brazilian Amazon using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). We evaluate GEDI forest structure variation along a gradient of forest degradation. We explore the potential of principal component (PC) analysis applied to GEDI data to derive a continuous descriptor of forest structural state that characterises the forest degradation continuum, and use a multinomial logistic regression model (MNLR) to further evaluate this descriptor. The strongest positive correspondence for all sampled GEDI and airborne lidar footprints occurs at RH96 (CCC; 0.57) of the canopy height profile, with strongest agreement in primary forest burned at least three times (CCC; 0.91). Whilst canopy cover showed significant recovery 15–25 years after disturbance, forest canopy height and aboveground biomass density had not fully recovered to pre-disturbance levels within 38 years. The PCA identified the importance of RH75, RH96, foliage height diversity index and canopy directional gap probability, with PC1 and PC2 explaining 80% and 15% of variance, respectively. The MNLR suggests that the ratio of these PCs effectively characterises the forest degradation gradient. We demonstrate the ability of GEDI 2A/B structural metrics to differentiate forest structure along a gradient of PU to secondary severely degraded forest in the Amazon rainforest, despite some overlap in structural characterisations between similar degradation classes. Our new method for deriving a forest structural state metric supports future research on forest monitoring, conservation, and the study of Amazon-wide ecosystem resilience."

This study aimed to optimize the freight structure in China and to develop a low-carbon freight transportation system. As one of the main factors influencing freight CEs, research on the freight structure is helpful for understanding the comparative advantages and potential environmental impacts of various freight transportation modes. The freight structure was characterized by calculating the proportion of the freight turnover of four transportation modes, and the mechanism of the influence of the freight structure on freight CEs was examined by combining the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model and geographically and temporally weighted regression model. It is worth noting that from 2005 to 2023, the transport carbon intensity (CEI) has decreased significantly in some provinces, such as Beijing and Tianjin Province, by 22.94% and 75.49%, respectively. But freight costs in both Hebei and Gansu have risen by more than 65%. Nevertheless, the overall freight CEI in China has decreased by approximately 25.69% over the past 15 years due to freight transportation mode and technology advancements. The findings provide valuable insights for establishing government transport policies to reduce freight CEs and promote sustainable transport systems. Emphasizing the importance of restructuring freight transport, this study offers a methodological framework for future research, and strategies are proposed to reduce CEs from the perspectives of institutional adjustment, potential direction exploration, and policy incentives."

DCESS II is designed for global simulations over timescales of years to millions of years using limited computer resources like a personal computer. With its flexibility and comprehensive treatment of the global carbon cycle, DCESS II is a useful, computationally friendly tool for simulations of past climates as well as for future Earth system projections. 
 A new Earth system model of intermediate complexity, DCESS II, is presented that builds upon, improves and extends the Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth system model (DCESS I). DCESS II has considerably greater spatial resolution than DCESS I while retaining the fine, 100 m vertical resolution in the ocean. It contains modules for the atmosphere, ocean, ocean sediment, land biosphere and lithosphere and is designed to deal with global change simulations on scales of years to millions of years while using limited computational resources. Tracers of the atmospheric module are temperature, nitrous oxide, methane (12,13C isotopes), carbon dioxide (12,13,14C isotopes) and atmospheric oxygen. For the ocean module, tracers are conservative temperature, absolute salinity, water 18O, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon (12,13,14C isotopes), alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, the ocean module considers simplified dynamical schemes for large-scale meridional circulation and sea ice dynamics, stratification-dependent vertical diffusion, a gravity current approach to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, and improvements in ocean biogeochemistry. DCESS II has two hemispheres with six zonally averaged atmospheric boxes and 12 ocean sectors distributed across the Indian–Pacific, the Atlantic, the Arctic and the Southern oceans. A new extended land biosphere scheme is implemented that considers three different vegetation types whereby net primary production depends on sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide. The ocean sediment and lithosphere model formulations are adopted from DCESS I but now applied to the multiple ocean and land regions of the new model.Model calibration was carried out for the pre-industrial climate, and model steady-state solutions were compared against available modern-day observations. For the most part, calibration results agree well with observed data, including excellent agreement with ocean carbon species. This serves to demonstrate model utility for dealing with the global carbon cycle. Finally, two idealized experiments were carried out in order to explore model performance. First, we forced the model by varying Ekman transport out of the model Southern Ocean, mimicking the effect of Southern Hemisphere westerly wind variations, and second, we imposed freshwater melting pulses from the Antarctic ice sheet on the model Southern Ocean shelf. Changes in ocean circulation and in the global carbon cycle found in these experiments are in line with results from much more complex models. Thus, we find DCESS II to be a useful and computationally friendly tool for simulations of past climates as well as for future Earth system projections."

CNit effectively reproduced the global carbon–nitrogen cycle dynamics observed in complex models. Our results show persistent nitrogen limitations on plant growth (net primary production) from 1850 to 2100, suggesting that nitrogen deficiency may constrain future land carbon sequestration. 
 The integration of a nitrogen cycle represents a recent advancement in Earth system models (ESMs). However, diverse formulations introduce uncertainty in the nitrogen effect on the carbon cycle, leaving the global carbon–nitrogen coupling effect unclear. In this study, we present CNit v1.0, a newly developed carbon–nitrogen cycle model designed for integration with MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change), a widely used reduced-complexity model. CNit v1.0 has been calibrated to two land surface models (CABLE and OCN) and (the land component of) a set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ESMs. CNit v1.0 is able to capture the dynamics of the more complex models' carbon–nitrogen cycle at the global-mean, annual scale. The emulation results suggest a consistent nitrogen limitation on net primary production (NPP) in CMIP6 ESMs, persisting throughout the simulations (i.e., over the period 1850–2100) in most models. The emulation provides a way to disentangle diverse nitrogen effects on carbon pool turnovers in CMIP6 ESMs, with our results suggesting that nitrogen deficiency generally inhibits litter production and decomposition while enhancing soil respiration (from a multi-model mean perspective). However, this disentanglement is limited due to a lack of simulations from CMIP6 ESMs which would allow us to fully separate the nitrogen and carbon responses. The results imply a potential reduction in land carbon sequestration in the future due to nitrogen deficiency. Future studies will use CNit to further investigate the carbon–nitrogen coupling effect, including uncertainty, in future climate projections."

However, the diverse molecular scenarios of groundwater DOM under uneven recharging levels remain largely unexplored. We combined molecular characteristics, carbon isotopic signatures of organic molecules, and end-member mixing analysis to explore the sensitivity and potential tracking capabilities of DOM to AGR along with recharging gradients. Our findings suggested that AGR enriched groundwater with diverse, saturated, labile, and sulfur-rich molecules, amplifying DOM abundance and intensity, which intensified with recharge gradients. Additionally, S-containing molecules and their indicators like CHOS% (with threshold values of 7.82%) exhibited high sensitivity and predictive power for AGR recognition. The major signatures (diversity, saturated degree, and stability) indicated by 13C-containing molecules were similar to the whole molecular pool. Notably, specific molecules (C12H10O5S and C15H16O12), although not detected in all groundwater samples, exhibit robust stability or favorable solubility, rendering them potential candidates as AGR-sensitive molecules. The R13C/12C ratio of 13C-containing C19H24O5 emerged as the most robust tracer, exhibiting a strong correlation with the recharge ratio and the smallest deviation from the theoretical mixing line, signifying its optimal suitability for precise groundwater DOM source apportionment.

Soil serves as a long-term source of PFAS for the adjacent groundwater and surface water, but the lack of extractable organofluorine (EOF) mass balance data in the AFFF-impacted soils may lead to an underestimation of PFAS contamination. This study analyzed ten surface soil samples from three AFFF-impacted sites in Sweden, using alkaline extraction followed by acidic extraction. The alkaline and acidic fractions were subjected to further cleanup and analyzed separately for target, suspect screening, and EOF analysis to evaluate the extraction efficiencies of different PFAS in the soil samples and reveal PFAS remaining unknown in the AFFF-impacted soils. Total target PFAS concentrations ranged from 33.0 to 2.40 × 104 ng/g dry weight. Thirty-six PFAS were identified using suspect screening.

Microbial reductive dehalogenation plays crucial roles in attenuating PCBs, but comprehensive insights into PCB dechlorination pathways, reactivity, and governing factors are limited by the vast number of congeners and costly experimental approaches. We address this challenge by establishing a high-throughput in vitro assay approach of reductive dehalogenation (HINVARD), which increases dechlorination test throughput by 30-fold and enhances reagents and cell utilization efficiency by over 10-fold compared to conventional assay methods. Using HINVARD, we screened 61 PCB congeners across 9 enrichment cultures and 3 Dehalococcoides isolates, identifying active dechlorination of 31–44 congeners. Results showed that PCB congener properties (chlorine substitution patterns, steric hindrance, and solubility) primarily determine the dechlorination potential, leading to consistent reactivity trends across cultures. In contrast, different organohalide-respiring bacteria catalyzed distinct dechlorination pathways, preferentially removing para- or meta-chlorines. Structural modeling of reductive dehalogenases revealed unique binding orientations governing substrate specificity, offering molecular insights into these pathways. This study provides a high-efficiency strategy for investigating microbial reductive dehalogenation, yielding the first comprehensive understanding of PCB dechlorination patterns and mechanisms.

Utility was demonstrated by applying it to five types of microenvironments where the 13 OPEs were ubiquitous (indoor dust: 993–14000 ng/g; indoor air: 0.549–14.1 ng/m3).

Analyses of abandoned tidal channels in the Venice Lagoon (Italy) demonstrate that they take up organic carbon at significantly faster rates than neighboring marshes.

Traditional methods, such as time of arrival algorithms, rely on precise arrival time picking, which can compromise localization accuracy. Conversely, time reversal (TR) algorithms bypass picking but are hindered by time‐consuming grid search requirements. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) based method for accurate, real‐time multi‐station lightning location. Our approach processes continuous lightning waveform data from multiple sensors, achieving simultaneous denoising, event detection, and direct localization without arrival time picking. Specifically, denoising enhances the signal‐to‐noise ratio, thereby improving the accuracy of subsequent event detection and localization. Events are identified by matching signals across sensors and retaining high‐match segments, resulting in waveforms that contain valid lightning signals. These waveforms are then input into a GNN, which integrates time series features with spatial information from the sensors, effectively handling multi‐station localization and delivering accurate, real‐time results. To address the lack of training data sets for lightning location, we propose a novel procedure for constructing a labeled lightning data set, laying a data foundation for future data‐driven approaches in this domain. In extensive synthetic experiments, our method achieved a low average localization error of 0.61 km and high efficiency with a localization time of only 0.4 milliseconds, significantly outperforming the traditional TR algorithm's 1.16 km error and 1.65 s. When tested on natural cloud‐to‐ground lightning data, our method successfully detected and located 198 lightning sources consistent with reference results."

Past decades have seen the rapid economic development and air quality improvement in China, but the changes in interprovincial pollution transfers and the related inequalities are still unclear. Our results show that from 2007 to 2017, Chinese domestic consumption drives the national value added to rise steadily from 2.1 to 6.8 billion RMB, while the corresponding emissions first to increase from 46.6 Tg in 2007 to 51.2 Tg in 2012, and then to fall sharply to 29.9 Tg in 2017. Consumption in the sector construction contributes most to the emissions with the proportion of contribution increasing during the studied decade. Eastern provinces, as environmental‐economic beneficiaries, tend to see net emission inflows, and the east‐to‐west emission transfer is substantially reduced by 2/3 during 2007–2017. In contrast, the number of Western provinces suffering from environmental‐economic loss has decreased, and some even transform into achieving environmental‐economic win. Greener production is the dominant factor of the reduced emission flow, resulting in the alleviated regional environmental‐economic inequalities. For further air quality improvement and regional inequality alleviation in China, we suggest improving pollution responsibility sharing mechanism and strengthening regional cooperation on pollution mitigation."

Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of climate extremes, potentially impacting the duration and magnitude of future influenza epidemics. However, the extent of these projected effects on influenza outbreaks remains understudied. Here, we use an epidemiologic model adapted for temperate and tropical climates to explore how climate variability may affect seasonal influenza. Using climate anomalies derived from historical data, we found that simulated periods of anomalous climate conditions impacted both the projected influenza outbreak peak size and the total proportion infected, with the strongest effects observed when the anomaly was included just before the typical peak. Effects varied by climate: temperate regions showed a unimodal relationship, while tropical climates exhibited a nonlinear pattern. Our results emphasize that the intensity of weather extremes is key to understanding how climate change may affect influenza outbreaks, laying the groundwork for utilizing weather variability as a potential early warning for influenza activity."

 Periodic sediment patterns have been observed on Earth in riverbeds and sand and snow deserts, but also in other planetary environments. One of the most ubiquitous patterns, familiar wind or ‘impact’ ripples, adorns sand beaches and arid regions on Earth. The observation of aeolian impact ripples on Mars the same size as their terrestrial counterparts despite a thinner atmosphere raises questions about their formation. Here we show in a numerical simulation that the emergent wavelength of impact ripples is controlled by the mechanics of grain–bed impacts and not the characteristic trajectories of grains above the bed. We find that the distribution of grain trajectories in transport is essentially scale-free, invoking the proximity of a critical point and precluding a transport-related length scale that selects ripple wavelengths. By contrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections introduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the ripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant ripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that for high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand grains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and field experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such ‘antiripples’, we suggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be used to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from the sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples. Numerical simulations suggest the wavelength of wind ripples is controlled by the mechanics of grain–bed impacts, not grain hop length, explaining why ripples on Mars and Earth are the same scale despite very different atmospheric conditions."

This paper shows how PACT prevents aberrant PKR activation by endogenous dsRNAs like Alu. PACT disrupts PKR’s dsRNA scanning without blocking its binding, resetting its activation threshold to tolerate cellular dsRNA and preserve homeostasis. 
 The innate immune sensor PKR for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is critical for antiviral defense, but its aberrant activation by cellular dsRNA is linked to various diseases. The dsRNA-binding protein PACT plays a critical yet controversial role in this pathway. We show that PACT directly suppresses PKR activation by endogenous dsRNA ligands, such as inverted-repeat Alu RNAs, which robustly activate PKR in the absence of PACT. Instead of competing for dsRNA binding, PACT prevents PKR from scanning along dsRNA—a necessary step for PKR molecules to encounter and phosphorylate each other for activation. While PKR favors longer dsRNA for increased co-occupancy and scanning-mediated activation, longer dsRNA is also more susceptible to PACT-mediated regulation due to increased PACT-PKR co-occupancy. Unlike viral inhibitors that constitutively suppress PKR, this RNA-dependent mechanism allows PACT to fine-tune PKR activation based on dsRNA length and quantity, ensuring self-tolerance without sequestering most cellular dsRNA. The antiviral dsRNA sensor PKR is regulated by PACT. This paper shows how PACT prevents aberrant PKR activation by endogenous dsRNAs like Alu.

This manuscript documents an approach to estimate the economic impacts of widespread, long duration (WLD) power interruptions. 
 We partnered with a utility in the U.S. state of Illinois to develop and pilot an approach to estimate the economic impacts of widespread, long duration (WLD) power interruptions. We surveyed their customers about hypothetical blackouts, identifying and classifying mitigating/resilience behaviors and quantifying their costs and benefits. Survey results are scaled up to the broader regional economy, and used to drive a computational general equilibrium (CGE) simulation of the effects of power interruptions and attendant customer responses (e.g., relocation, backup generation). Impacts are severe: 1-, 3-, and 14-day interruptions reduce the utility service area’s three-month GDP by $1.8 Bn (1.3%), $3.7 Bn (2.6%) and $15.2 Bn (10.4%), respectively, with losses driven overwhelmingly by disequilibrium responses to shortages as opposed to price signals (71%–88%). Doubling backup power penetration moderates GDP losses by 11%–14%, and is relatively least beneficial during the longest interruption duration. Results highlight previously unquantified economic losses that can potentially be avoided by investments in power system resilience.

Scheer,Daytime eating during simulated night work&#xa0;mitigates changes in cardiovascular risk factors: secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial,"Circadian misalignment, which typically occurs in shift work, associates with cardiovascular diseases. Here the authors report that eating only in the daytime during simulated night work mitigates adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors (including autonomic cardiac control, prothrombotic factor, and blood pressure) in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. 
 Effective countermeasures against the adverse cardiovascular effects of circadian misalignment, such as effects experienced due to night work or jet lag, remain to be established in humans. Here, we aim to test whether eating only during daytime can mitigate such adverse effects vs. eating during the night and day (typical for night shift workers) under simulated night work (secondary analysis of NCT02291952). This single-blind, parallel-arm trial randomized 20 healthy participants (non-shift workers) to simulated night work with meals consumed during night and day (Nighttime Meal Control Group) or only during daytime (Daytime Meal Intervention Group). The primary outcomes were pNN50 (percentage consecutive heartbeat intervals >50 ms), RMSSD (root mean square of successive heartbeat differences), and LF/HF (low/high cardiac frequency). The secondary outcome was blood concentrations of prothrombotic factor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These measures were assessed under Constant Routine conditions, before (baseline) and after (postmisalignment) simulated night work. The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on cardiac vagal modulation and PAI-1 (pFDR = 0.001). In the Control Group, the postmisalignment Constant Routine showed a decrease in pNN50 by 25.7% (pFDR = 0.008) and RMMSD by 14.3% (pFDR = 0.02), and an increase in LF/HF by 5.5% (pFDR = 0.04) and PAI-1 by 23.9% (pFDR = 0.04), vs. the baseline Constant Routine. In the Intervention Group, there were no significant changes in these outcomes. For exploratory outcomes, the intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on blood pressure (P < 0.05), with no significant change in the Control Group, and a significant reduction by 6-8% (P < 0.01) in the Intervention Group; without significant effects for heart rate or cortisol. These findings indicate that daytime eating, despite mistimed sleep, may mitigate changes in cardiovascular risk factors and offer translational evidence for developing a behavioral strategy to help minimize the adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors in individuals exposed to circadian misalignment, such as shift workers. Circadian misalignment, which typically occurs in shift work, associates with cardiovascular diseases. Here the authors report that eating only in the daytime during simulated night work mitigates adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors (including autonomic cardiac control, prothrombotic factor, and blood pressure) in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial."

While marked variations in TCR-p-MHC docking topologies have been observed from structural studies, the co-recognition paradigm has held fast.

The crystal structures of TCR-HLA-DQ2.5-peptide complexes show that the G9 TCR binds HLA-DQ2.5 in a reversed docking topology without contacting the peptide, with the TCR contacting the β1 region of HLA-DQ2.5 and distal from the peptide antigen binding cleft. High-throughput screening of HLA class I and II molecules finds the G9 TCR to be pan-HLA-DQ2 reactive, with leucine-55 of HLA-DQ2.5 being a key determinant underpinning G9 TCR specificity excluding other HLA-II allomorphs. Consistent with the functional assays, the interactions of the G9 TCR and HLA-DQ2.5 precludes CD4 binding, thereby impeding T cell activation. Collectively, we describe a naturally selected αβTCR from human peripheral blood that deviates from the TCR-p-MHC co-recognition paradigm. T cell receptors co-recognizing both MHC and antigenic peptide for a tri-party specific interaction has been a central dogma of T cell-mediated responses. Here the authors use X-ray crystallography to identify a TCR that contacts only the MHC beta chain of HLA-DQ2, with this specificity potentially enforced by Leucine-55 of HLA-DQ2.5 to exclude interaction with other MHCs."

Here, the authors examine sedimentary DNA from fish parasites in Lake Redon, suggesting fish were introduced by Late-Roman or Visigoths in the 7th century. 
 High-mountain lakes were historically fishless due to natural barriers, but human introductions have led to widespread fish presence. Although particularly intensive during the last decades, historical documents indicate introductions in European high mountains already during the 14th and 15th centuries, but they could have occurred before, provided the intensive land use of the high mountain had started earlier. We used ancient environmental DNA from lake sediments (sedDNA) to investigate this hypothesis. Fish ectoparasites from various clades were identified using the 18S rRNA gene in the sediment record of a deep, high-mountain Pyrenean lake, with Ichthyobodo (Kinetoplastea) being of particular interest due to its consistent occurrence. The study shows a continued presence of fish parasites in the lake since the 7th century, which coincides with the Late-Roman and Visigothic extensive mountain use for sheep pasturing as supported by nearby archeological remains and increased lake primary production evidenced by photosynthetic pigments.

 Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based proteomics, particularly in the bottom-up approach, relies on the digestion of proteins into peptides for subsequent separation and analysis. The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum, often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger’s fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each tandem mass spectrum, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides.

Here, authors show that high-entropy alloys can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction by activating the lattice oxygen mechanism through multi-path electron transfer, particularly in nickel. 
 Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to several energy technologies but suffers from low activity. Leveraging the lattice oxygen activation mechanism (LOM) is a strategy for boosting its activity. However, this approach faces significant thermodynamic challenges, requiring high-valent oxidation of metal ions without compromising their stability. We reveal that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can efficiently activate the LOM through synergistic multi-path electron transfer. Specifically, the oxidation of nickel is enhanced by this electron transfer, aided by the integration of weaker Co-O bonds, enabling effective LOM at the Ni-Co dual-site. These insights allow the design of a NiFeCoCrW0.2 HEA that exhibits improved activity, achieving an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It also demonstrates good stability, maintaining the potential with less than 5% variation over 90 days at 100 mA cm−2 current density. This study sheds light on the synergistic effects that confer high activity in HEAs and contribute to the advancement of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.

 Accurate detection of nostril airflow is vital for real-time respiratory monitoring. However, the developed methods only rely on single stimulus sensing for nostril airflow, which is extremely susceptible to interference in the complex environment, and severely affects the accuracy of detection results. Here, a multimodal integrated eutectogel sensor is explored to simultaneously sense the pressure and temperature stimuli of nostril airflow, by independently outputting capacitance and resistance, respectively, without cross-coupling. The completely physical crosslinking and the synergistic interaction of hydroxyapatite and tannic acid within the network endow this eutectogel with extremely low modulus, remarkable self-healing efficiency, robust adhesion, good environmental stability, and bio-compatibility. A multimodal sensor is developed by integrating this synthetic eutectogel with circuit design, which exhibits superior pressure sensitivity compared to other reported gel-based sensors. As a proof of concept, this sensor is further explored to diagnose the traditional respiratory disease of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome by simultaneously detecting five kinds of stimuli in the sleeping process, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of the detection results.

Higher risks were observed among populations ≤19 or ≥60 years old, from low-income or high non-wildfire PM2.5 communities, and residing in Brazil, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam. Australia and New Zealand exhibited a greater hospitalization risk for asthma associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5.

Wildfire-specific PM2.5 contributed to 42.4% of PM2.5-linked respiratory hospitalizations, dominating in Thailand. Overall, the substantial contribution of wildfire-specific PM2.5 to respiratory hospitalizations demands continued mitigation and adaptation efforts across most countries.

 The expansion and interconnection of protected areas are central to achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework’s ambitious goals, yet their synergistic relationship remains underexplored. Here, we propose a framework integrating wildlife dispersal-based connectivity to address two key objectives in China: (1) constructing a cost-effective nature conservation network by combining connectivity and biodiversity prioritization, and (2) evaluating climate and anthropogenic risks while addressing habitat representation gaps.

 A just transition to green economy sectors must be grounded in optimizing job matching, that is, suitable opportunities of aligning employers with job seekers, which is critical for meeting a zero-emissions future. However, the interaction between job matching and emission patterns remains unclear. Here we examine both historical and future trends in this interaction using a global unifying explanation with high-aggregated model. Our findings reveal national-level latitude and wealth effects. In high-latitude regions, 79% of job matching in relatively wealthy nations show a positive correlation with emissions reductions. In contrast, this trend is observed in only 10% of poorer nations located at low latitudes. Introducing the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, our projection shows global job matching will be consistently improved under SSP1-2.6, but only nations in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa will benefit under SSP5-8.5.

 Ocean alkalinity enhancement is a potential strategy for gigatonne-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. It uses alkaline substances to convert seawater carbon dioxide into (bi)carbonate, enabling uptake of additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A critical knowledge gap is how ocean alkalinity enhancement could influence marine plankton communities. Here we conducted 19 ship-based experiments in the Equatorial Pacific, examining three prevalent alkaline substances (sodium hydroxide, olivine, and steel slag) and their effects on natural phytoplankton populations under realistic and moderate alkalinity enhancements (16–29 μmol kg−1). Results demonstrate that sodium hydroxide had a negligible effect on phytoplankton while providing predictable alkalinity. Conversely, olivine disrupted plankton, especially cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and picoeukaryotes while only providing 0.06 mmol alkalinity g−1 olivine. Steel slag moderately changed phytoplankton communities and fertilized growth while delivering 8 mmol alkalinity g−1 slag.

We show a polar vortex strengthening in winter 1, followed by a weakening in winters 2–3 due to surface cooling, where ocean–atmosphere interactions play a major role in the detected response. This weakening appears to trigger sudden stratospheric warming events that can cause severe cold spells throughout the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Stratospheric aerosols after major explosive volcanic eruptions can trigger climate anomalies for up to several years following such events. Whereas the mechanisms responsible for the prolonged response to volcanic surface cooling have been extensively investigated for tropical eruptions, less is known about the dynamical response to high-latitude eruptions. Here we use global climate model simulations of an idealized 6-month-long Northern Hemisphere high-latitude eruption to investigate the stratospheric circulation response during the first three post-eruption winters. Two model configurations are used, coupled with an interactive ocean and with prescribed sea-surface temperature. Our results reveal significant differences in the response of the polar stratosphere with an interactive ocean: the surface cooling is enhanced and zonal flow anomalies are stronger in the troposphere, which impacts atmospheric waveguides and upward propagation of large-scale planetary waves. We identify two competing mechanisms contributing to the post-eruption evolution of the polar vortex: (1) a local stratospheric top-down mechanism whereby increased absorption of aerosol-induced thermal radiation yields a polar vortex strengthening via thermal wind response and (2) a bottom-up mechanism whereby anomalous surface cooling yields a wave-activity flux increase that propagates into the winter stratosphere. We detect an unusually high frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings in the simulations with interactive ocean temperatures that calls for further exploration. In the coupled runs, the top-down mechanism dominates over the bottom-up mechanism in winter 1, while the bottom-up mechanism dominates in the follow-up winters."

This study presents the results from a year-long in situ monitoring of atmospheric water vapor stable isotopes (δ18O, δD) at Matara, Sri Lanka, from March 2020 to February 2021 to assess how oceanic sources and moisture transport influence coastal atmospheric moisture isotopic composition. We identified clear seasonal patterns in the isotopic composition, with δ18O, δD, and d-excess showing substantial variation between the southwest and northeast monsoon periods. The primary moisture sources were the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean during the southwest monsoon (May to September), characterized by small amplitude fluctuations of δ18O (−20.4 ‰ to −9.1 ‰). During the northeast monsoon, the northern Bay of Bengal, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia were primary moisture sources, resulting in large-amplitude fluctuations in δ18O (−23.9 ‰ to −7.5 ‰) and higher d-excess values (up to 25 ‰). The study also identified significant influences of sea surface temperature and sea surface relative humidity on the isotopic composition of water vapor. Additionally, we could use outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to gauge the intensity of convective activity. Observational periods with low OLR, indicative of stronger and deeper convection, were associated with air masses that were more depleted in δ18O than periods with high OLR.

Stability during atmospheric transformation processes is crucial for predicting their environmental fate and assessing the associated risks. Here, we conducted field studies and laboratory simulation experiments to reveal the mechanisms, influencing factors and products for XPAHs' heterogeneous phototransformation. Results revealed that the conversion of XPAHs led to a reduction in environmental risk. 
 Chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (XPAHs) are emerging pollutants widely found in atmospheric particulate matter (PM).  However, their environmental transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we collected PM samples of varying sizes over a year for XPAH analysis and found that the average concentrations of XPAHs peaked in winter and were dominated by the contribution of PM1 (particulate matter ≤ 1 µm in aerodynamic diameter) (47.0 %). Correlation analysis with relevant meteorological parameters showed strong associations between XPAH fluctuations and PM, temperature and humidity. Hence, controlled laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the influence of particle size, sunlight duration, temperature, humidity and oxidant concentrations on XPAHs. Our results indicated that the transformation rates of XPAHs were influenced by the parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures (with phenanthrene < fluoranthene < pyrene < benz[a]anthracene ≈ anthracene < benzo[a]pyrene) as well as the substitution of halogens (chlorinated < brominated). Furthermore, the photoirradiation promoted the heterogeneous transformation of XPAHs; this process was accelerated by the increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species and elevated temperature, peaking at a humidity level of 45 %. The transformation products were identified by nontarget analysis. According to that, we then proposed phototransformation pathways for XPAHs, suggesting a mechanism involving dehalogenation followed by oxidation. Predictions were made regarding the persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transportation, and toxicities of XPAHs and their transformation products, showing a decrement in environmental risk as the transformation progressed. This study provides novel insights into the primary influencing factors for particulate XPAH variations and the mechanisms of heterogeneous phototransformation."

Here, we established a hierarchical quantitative analysis framework to understand the driving factors of aerosol acidity on different timescales. Its application in Changzhou, China, revealed distinct driving factors and corresponding mechanisms of aerosol acidity from annual trends to random residuals. 
 Aerosol acidity (or pH) plays a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry, influencing the interaction of air pollutants with ecosystems and climate. Aerosol pH shows large temporal variations, while the driving factors of chemical profiles versus meteorological conditions are not fully understood due to their intrinsic complexity. Here, we propose a new framework to quantify factor importance, which incorporated an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach and time series analysis. In particular, a hierarchical influencing factor relationship is established based on the multiphase buffer theory with ISM. A long-term (2018–2023) observation dataset in Changzhou, China, is analyzed with this framework. We found the pH temporal variation is dominated by the seasonal and random variations, while the long-term pH trend varies little despite the large emission changes.  This is an overall effect of decreasing PM2.5, increasing temperature and increased alkali-to-acid ratios. Temperature is the controlling factor of pH seasonal variations, through influencing the multiphase effective acid dissociation constant Ka∗, non-ideality cni and gas–particle partitioning. Random variations are dominated by the aerosol water contents through Ka∗ and chemical profiles through cni. This framework provides quantitative understanding of the driving factors of aerosol acidity at different levels, which is important in acidity-related process studies and policy-making."

 Monitoring global radiation resources relies on sunshine duration (SD) as an important indicator; however, research examining high-resolution SD data is scarce. This study established a daily 5 km SD dataset in China from 2016 to 2023 using Himawari's Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) Level 3 shortwave radiation fitted with the Ångström–Prescott model based on a time series. We used ground-measured SD at 2380 Chinese Meteorological Administration stations to verify the SD dataset accuracy.

Additionally, we investigated the effects of wind speed, vapour pressure, precipitation, aerosol optical depth, and cloud capacity on the estimation performance of SD and found that temperature had the greatest effect. We also found that cloud capacity that was both too low and too high, and wind speed that was too high affected SD estimation on an average annual scale.

Therefore, it is beneficial for both oceanographic communities and policymakers. 
 A new dedicated 20 Hz coastal sea level dataset, called the International Altimetry Service 2024 (IAS2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13208305, Peng et al., 2024c), is presented for monitoring sea level changes along the world's coastlines. One of the reasons for generating this dataset is that the quality of coastal altimeter data has been greatly improved with advanced coastal reprocessing strategies. In this study, the Seamless Combination of Multiple Retrackers (SCMR) strategy is adopted to obtain the reprocessed Jason data from January 2002 to April 2022. The evaluation/validation results show that the IAS2024 20 Hz along-track coastal sea level dataset achieves good performance over global coastal oceans. The good consistency between IAS2024 and independent altimeter datasets, including the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative version 2.4 (ESA CCI v2.4) 20 Hz along-track coastal sea level dataset and the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service Level-3 (CMEMS L3) 1 Hz along-track sea level dataset, is observed. The closure of sea level trend differences (0.16 ± 3.97 mm yr−1) between IAS2024 and Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) tide gauge data at the global scale is also achieved. Moreover, 1548 virtual stations have been constructed using the IAS2024 coastal sea level dataset, which will contribute to the analysis of coastal sea levels for the ocean community and to risk management for the policymakers. Our study also finds that no obvious variations exist in the linear sea level trends from the offshore to the coast over the last 20 km coastal strip at the global scale. In addition, the vertical land motion (VLM) estimates from the combination of the IAS2024 dataset with the PSMSL tide gauge records agree well with the University of La Rochelle 7a (ULR7a) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) solution, with the mean difference of VLM estimates being 0.12 ± 2.27 mm yr−1, suggesting that altimeter-derived VLM estimates can be used as an independent data source to validate the GNSS solutions."

 Understanding global livestock dynamics is essential for global food security, public health, socio-economic and sustainable development. This study developed an automated global livestock mapping framework that integrated Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the Random Forest regression model. By implementing the mapping scheme on Google Earth Engine (GEE), we develop the first annual gridded livestock of the world (AGLW), covering the period from 1961 to 2021 at a spatial resolution of 5 km. The annual maps of AGLW were then evaluated from three perspectives: model level, finer-scale statistic level, and pixel level, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.54–0.73, 0.79–0.98, and 0.73–0.83, respectively. The AGLW maps reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of global livestocks over the past six decades, highlighting both global expansion and localized fluctuations, such as the notable increase in pig stock in China and the decline in horse stock in Poland. By offering a reliable and continuous dataset, AGLW overcomes the limitations of existing livestock mapping products in terms of spatio-temporal continuity and resolution. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for enhancing our understanding of global livestock dynamics, informing policy decisions, guiding sustainable agricultural practices, and promoting resilience in both ecological and human systems.

 The Extended European Alpine Region (EEAR) exhibits a well-established and very high density network of in situ weather stations, hardly attained in other mountainous regions of the world. However, the strong fragmentation of the area into national and regional administrations and the diversity of data sources have hampered the full exploitation of the available data for climate research. Here, we present EEAR-Clim, a new observational dataset gathering in situ daily measurements of air temperature and precipitation from a variety of meteorological and hydrological services covering the whole EEAR. The data collected include time series from recordings of diverse lengths up to 2020, with the longest records spanning up to 200 years. The overall observational network encompasses about 9000 in situ weather stations, significantly enhancing data coverage at high elevations compared to existing datasets and achieving an average spatial density of one station per 6.8 km2 over the 1991–2020 period, the most covered by measurements. Data collected from many sources were tested for quality to ensure the internal, temporal, and spatial consistency of time series, including outlier removal. Data homogeneity was assessed through a cross-comparison of the break points detected by three methods that are well established in the literature, namely Climatol, ACMANT, and the RH test. Quantile matching was applied to adjust inhomogeneous periods in time series. Overall, about 4 % of data were flagged as unreliable, and about 20 % of air temperature time series were corrected for one or more inhomogeneous periods. In the case of precipitation time series, fewer break points were detected, confirming the well-known challenge of properly identifying inhomogeneities in noisy data. The high quality, homogeneity, unprecedented spatial density, and completeness of data and the inclusion of the most recent records are important add-on improvements compared to other observational products available for the EEAR.

The task of monitoring those impacts across the globe is formidable and must necessarily rely on satellites – at a significant cost: the measurements are only indirect and require comprehensive physical understanding. We have created a comprehensive modelling system that we offer to the research community to explore how satellite data can be better exploited to help us capture the changes that happen on our lands. 
 Advances in Earth observation capabilities mean that there is now a multitude of spatially resolved data sets available that can support the quantification of water and carbon pools and fluxes at the land surface. However, such quantification ideally requires efficient synergistic exploitation of those data, which in turn requires carbon and water land-surface models with the capability to simultaneously assimilate several such data streams. The present article discusses the requirements for such a model and presents one such model based on the combination of the existing Data Assimilation Linked Ecosystem Carbon (DALEC) land vegetation carbon cycle model with the Biosphere Energy-Transfer HYdrology (BETHY) land-surface and terrestrial vegetation scheme. The resulting D&B model, made available as a community model, is presented together with a comprehensive evaluation for two selected study sites of widely varying climate. We then demonstrate the concept of land-surface modelling aided by data streams that are available from satellite remote sensing. Here we present D&B with four observation operators that translate model-derived variables into measurements available from such data streams, namely fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence  (SIF), vegetation optical depth (VOD) at microwave frequencies and near-surface soil moisture (also available from microwave measurements).

It remains unknown whether the unique alkyl–OH-6PPD-Q contributes to the toxicity of 6PPD-Q. To test this, we herein synthesized chemical standards of alkyl–OH-6PPD-Q isomers and investigated their metabolic formation mechanism and toxicity. The predominant alkyl–OH-6PPD-Q was confirmed to be hydroxylated on the C4 tertiary carbon (C4–OH-6PPD-Q). The formation of C4–OH-6PPD-Q was only observed in microsomal but not in cytosolic fractions of rainbow trout (O. mykiss) liver S9. A general cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited the formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 6PPD-Q, supporting that CYP450 catalyzed the hydroxylation. This well-explained the compound- and regio-selective formation of C4–OH-6PPD-Q, due to the weak C–H bond on the C4 tertiary carbon. Surprisingly, while cytotoxicity was observed for 6PPD-Q and C3–OH-6PPD-Q in a coho salmon (O. kisutch) embryo (CSE-119) cell line, no toxicity was observed for C4–OH-6PPD-Q. To further confirm this under physiologically relevant conditions, we fractionated 6PPD-Q metabolites formed in the liver microsome of rainbow trout. Cytotoxicity was observed for the fraction of 6PPD-Q, but not the fraction of C4–OH-6PPD-Q. In summary, this study highlighted the C4 tertiary carbon as the key moiety for both metabolism and toxicity of 6PPD-Q and confirmed that alkyl hydroxylation is a detoxification pathway for 6PPD-Q."

Aiming to identify potential replacement antiozonants for 6PPD that do not produce toxic quinones, seven PPD-quinones with distinct side chains were synthesized to investigate their structure-related toxicities in vivo using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). While 6PPD-Q exerted high toxicity (96 h LC50 = 0.35 μg/L), toxicity was not observed for six other PPD-quinones despite their similar structures. The fish tissue concentrations of 6PPD-Q after sublethal exposure (0.29 μg/L) were comparable to the other PPD-quinones, which indicated that bioaccumulation levels were not the reason for the selective toxicity of 6PPD-Q. Hydroxylated PPD-quinones were detected as the predominant metabolites in fish tissue. Interestingly, a single major aromatic hydroxylation metabolite was detected for the alternate PPD-quinones, but two abundant OH-6PPD-Q isomers were detected for 6PPD-Q. MS2 spectra confirmed that hydroxylation occurred on the alkyl side chain for one isomer. The structurally selective toxicity of 6PPD-Q was also observed in a coho salmon (CSE-119) cell line, which further supports its intrinsic toxicity.

This study examined the association of phthalate metabolites with allergic symptoms (wheeze, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema), T2 biomarker (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophil count, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE)), and non-T2 biomarker (absolute neutrophil count (ANC)) and also their association with oxidative stress biomarkers, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, hexanoyl-lysine, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. Ten urinary phthalate metabolites were measured using UPLC-MS/MS in 421 children (aged 9–12 years) from The Hokkaido Cohort, Japan. Symptoms were defined using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, and biomarkers were measured in blood. Logistic regression assessed individual metabolites, while quantile-g computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression analyzed mixture effects on binary outcomes. Individual analysis showed that MnBP (mono-n-butyl phthalate) was positively associated with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and eosinophil ≥ 300 cells/μL, while ∑DBP (dibutyl phthalate) and OH-MiNP (mono-hydroxy-isononyl phthalate) were linked with FeNO ≥ 35 ppb. DEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) metabolites were associated with a high prevalence of blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/μL. We found a positive association between phthalates and oxidative stress markers, but no link was observed between oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Mixture analysis identified MnBP as a major contributor to the high FeNO level, with di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and DEHP metabolites contributing to eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/μL and ANC ≥ 4400 cells/μL. These findings suggest that phthalate exposure from DnBP and DEHP is associated with immune dysregulation by triggering both T2 and non-T2 inflammatory responses."

Recent studies indicate that certain keystone taxa impact both composition and function, but independent of their abundance. However, an effective framework for identifying these taxa from numerous high-throughput sequencing data is still lacking, particularly without the challenging task of reconstructing the detailed microbial correlation network. We developed a deep learning framework that quantifies microbial impact values across samples, bypassing network reconstruction. This algorithm effectively avoids the tricky issue of differing keystoneness across species in various samples, making it applicable to AS assemblage samples from various environmental and climatic conditions. In this work, we applied this framework to the high-throughput sequencing of the global wastewater treatment sample and identified 61 candidate taxa as the keystones for the wastewater treatment process. We found that the temperature and dissolved oxygen are the primary factors influencing the keystone taxa. Moreover, we found that the increased connectivity of keystone taxa with other members promotes tighter integration within the activated sludge microbial community. In summary, this study introduces an expeditious framework for efficient keystone taxa identification and reveals their role in enhancing microbial community integration in wastewater treatment systems."

In this study, following detection of PPD-Qs in human blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we investigated their toxicities to the blood–brain barrier (BBB). After ethical approval and signed informed consent, 27 participants were enrolled, and 20 blood and 20 CSF samples were collected. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-3Q-MS) was used to detect the PPD-Qs in the samples. Cell biology and molecular biology technologies were applied to investigate the toxicological effects and the mechanisms of PPD-Qs on the BBB model by using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC-D3). PPD-Qs were frequently detected in both extracts of serum and CSF samples, with 6PPD-Q, N-isopropyl-N′-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine-quinone (IPPD-Q), and N,N′-bis(1,4-dimethylpentyl)-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (77PD-Q) being the most abundant. 77PD-Q and IPPD-Q exhibited greater toxicity compared with 6PPD-Q. 6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q, and 77PD-Q led to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells by upregulating PAI-1, resulting in BBB dysfunction.

The role of the sea surface microlayer (SML) in mediating these exchanges was investigated. Samples were collected across a latitude gradient in the Pacific Ocean, and 16S rRNA gene and transcript sequences from surface seawater (SW), SML, and atmospheric samples were analyzed. The genomic signature varied diurnally and spatially, with the SW community being the most consistent and the air community the most variable. The SML displayed genomic characteristics intermediate between SW and air. The 16S rRNA transcript signature, a proxy for active microbial communities, showed tight clustering in the air and SML, suggesting selective control compared to SW. The transcriptional community composition in the air clustered between the SML and SW, pointing to viable non-SML-mediated exchange. Furthermore, taxa from air- and marine-associated communities showed a gradient of presence through all three environments, suggesting an exchange of key species through the SML. Additionally, certain volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere demonstrated a noteworthy relationship with specific bacterial taxa in the SML.

Our findings enrich this framework, revealing that a pIOD without El Niño can independently trigger IOB warming, and both types of pIODs can induce La Niña events. While El Niño primarily forces IOB warming and subsequent La Niña development via the atmospheric bridge across the Maritime Continent, pIODs independent of El Niño influence IOB warming through oceanic dynamics, which further favors La Niña development in the following year.

The result shows that the spring NAT is significantly positive correlated with the subsequent autumn tropical Pacific YFT catch per unit effort (CPUE). The spring NAT triggers eastward‐propagating Rossby waves, inducing VM‐like SSTAs in the North Pacific.

This study investigates how AUSM rainfall is affected by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) by simulating scenarios with a closed and an opened Drake Passage with the Community Earth System Model.

Here, we use diagnostics of local wave activity, waveguidability, and soil moisture‐temperature coupling to gain insights into the previously underexplored dynamic and land drivers underlying these early pre‐monsoon heatwave episodes. Our findings reveal a sudden surge in wave activity in the upper troposphere over the heatwave region during the first episode of the heatwave. The intensified wave activity results from strong transient waves, due to transfer of energy from the extratropical to the subtropical waveguide, leading to strong anticyclonic circulation. The April heatwave event, in contrast to the first episode, is found to be the result of a strong soil moisture‐temperature coupling over the heatwave region. Further, the low‐level winds revealed an advection of heat from highly coupled regions (Pakistan and Afghanistan) to the Indian landmass during the heatwave episode in April. Our findings indicate that waveguide interaction together with equatorward energy transfer drives early heat in March, subsequently setting the stage for further heat in the following weeks by depleting soil moisture levels."

Our results show that WRF adequately represents the seasonal occurrence of MCSs, although large discrepancies arise during periods in which the Intertropical Convergence Zone migrates northward and southward. The complex diurnal cycles of MCS initiation and occurrence are well reproduced by the model, including in‐land nocturnal convection, oceanic hotspots during the morning, and an afternoon maximum in the flatlands. WRF reproduces the evolution of MCS size, minimum brightness temperature, and maximum rainfall through the lifecycle, but especially for short‐lived systems. In terms of MCS features, simulated and observed storms travel comparable distances, and both propagate westward with the trade winds. Notably, the model is able to capture higher MCS speeds on the Amazon‐Savannas flatlands and lower velocities over and to the west of the Andes. Nevertheless, WRF simulates smaller and shorter‐lived systems, while the rainfall intensity and the fraction of heavy rainfall are largely overestimated. A more detailed analysis showed that rainfall overestimation is especially marked in smaller MCS objects and during the development stage. After separating the results by region, we notice a marked overestimation of rainfall intensity in MCSs occurring east of the Andes, while the model underestimates the area of those occurring west of the Andes and in the ocean."

Here we show that the number of human‐caused fires in 2020 also was elevated, nearly 20% higher than the 1992–2019 average. Although anomalously dry conditions enabled ignitions to spread and contributed to record area burned, these conditions alone do not explain the surge in the number of human‐caused ignitions. We argue that behavioral shifts aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID‐19 altered human‐environment interactions to favor increased ignitions. For example, the number of recreation‐caused wildfires during summer was 36% greater than the 1992–2019 average; this increase was likely a function of increased outdoor recreational activity in response to social distancing measures. We hypothesize that the combination of anomalously dry conditions and COVID‐19 social disruptions contributed to widespread increases in human‐caused ignitions, adding complexity to fire management efforts during the 2020 western US fire season. Knowledge of how social behavior changes indirectly contributed to the increased number of ignitions in the 2020 wildfire season can help inform resource management in an increasingly flammable world."

This study assessed the Kakia‐Esamburmbur catchment's water sustainability status for drinking purposes by analyzing water samples from the catchment. In‐depth physical, chemical, and microbiological investigations were undertaken using a dual approach. This entailed using the Water Quality Index (WQI) for domestic uses and applying a health risk assessment model. The study revealed that turbidity, total viable bacteria, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli exceeded WHO, East African, and Kenyan standards (EAS and KEBS) for domestic use and that 50% of samples tested for electrical conductivity also exceeded these guidelines. According to EAS for natural drinking water, 30% of water sources were classified as poor, 20% as very poor, and 50% as unsuitable for domestic use. Overall mean WQI values, based on standards, indicated that the WQ was unfit for domestic use. Nine pesticides associated with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were identified and quantified using Pesticide Human Health Risk Assessment (PHHRA). As a result, 70% of water samples had high levels of carbendazim (CBD), rendering them unsafe for children and infants to consume.

 Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation1,2. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer’s disease.

 Radio-frequency (RF) accelerators providing high-quality relativistic electron beams are an important resource enabling many areas of science, as well as industrial and medical applications. Two decades ago, laser-plasma accelerators1 that support orders of magnitude higher electric fields than those provided by modern RF cavities produced quasi-monoenergetic electron beams for the first time2–4. Since then, high-brightness electron beams at gigaelectronvolt (GeV) beam energy and competitive beam properties have been demonstrated from only centimetre-long plasmas5–9, a substantial advantage over the hundreds of metres required by RF-cavity-based accelerators. However, despite the considerable progress, the comparably large energy spread and the fluctuation (jitter) in beam energy still effectively prevent laser-plasma accelerators from driving real-world applications. Here we report the generation of a laser-plasma electron beam using active energy compression, resulting in a performance so far only associated with modern RF-based accelerators. Using a magnetic chicane, the electron bunch is first stretched longitudinally to imprint an energy correlation, which is then removed with an active RF cavity. The resulting energy spread and energy jitter are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to below the permille level, meeting the acceptance criteria of a modern synchrotron, thereby opening the path to a compact storage ring injector and other applications.

 Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin1. Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing2,3. However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)4 of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release5,6. Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin7. These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement. A study using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy reveals the swinging lever mechanism of myosin, providing information on the molecular basis behind the production of force and movement by myosin."

 The complexity of neural circuits makes it challenging to decipher the brain’s algorithms of intelligence. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have produced models that accurately simulate brain activity, enhancing our understanding of the brain’s computational objectives and neural coding. However, it is difficult for such models to generalize beyond their training distribution, limiting their utility. The emergence of foundation models1 trained on vast datasets has introduced a new artificial intelligence paradigm with remarkable generalization capabilities. Here we collected large amounts of neural activity from visual cortices of multiple mice and trained a foundation model to accurately predict neuronal responses to arbitrary natural videos. This model generalized to new mice with minimal training and successfully predicted responses across various new stimulus domains, such as coherent motion and noise patterns. Beyond neural response prediction, the model also accurately predicted anatomical cell types, dendritic features and neuronal connectivity within the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset2. Our work is a crucial step towards building foundation models of the brain. As neuroscience accumulates larger, multimodal datasets, foundation models will reveal statistical regularities, enable rapid adaptation to new tasks and accelerate research.

 Plant absorption is important for the entry of many pollutants into food chains. Although terrestrial microplastics (MPs) can be absorbed by the roots1,2, their upward translocation is slow1. Meanwhile, atmospheric MPs are widely present3,4, but strong evidence on their direct absorption by plants is still lacking. Here, analyses using mass spectrometry detection show the widespread occurrence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) polymers and oligomers in plant leaves, and identify that their levels increase with atmospheric concentrations and the leaf growth duration. The concentrations of PET and PS polymers can reach up to 104 ng per g dry weight in leaves at the high-pollution areas studied, such as the Dacron factory and a landfill site, and 102–103 ng per g dry weight of PET and PS can be detected in the open-air-grown leafy vegetables. Nano-sized PET and PS particles in the leaves were visually detected by hyperspectral imaging and atomic force microscopy–infrared spectroscopy. Absorption of the proactively exposed non-labelled, fluorescently labelled or europium-labelled plastic particles by maize (Zea mays L.) leaves through stomatal pathways, as well as their translocation to the vascular tissue through the apoplastic pathway, and accumulation in trichomes was identified using hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the absorption and accumulation of atmospheric MPs by plant leaves occur widely in the environment, and this should not be neglected when assessing the exposure of humans and other organisms to environmental MPs.

 Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations—sometimes affecting the same gene—will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions1. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1+/− deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine.

 Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system1,2. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel NaV1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony. These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.

 Mammalian neocortex contains a highly diverse set of cell types. These cell types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches1–4. Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell-type specialization. Cellular-scale electron microscopy provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective on the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometre-scale morphology. In data that contain tens of thousands of neurons, most of which have incomplete reconstructions, identifying cell types becomes a clear challenge for analysis5. Here, to address this challenge, we present a systematic survey of the somatic region of all cells in a cubic millimetre of cortex using quantitative features obtained from electron microscopy. This analysis demonstrates that the perisomatic region is sufficient to identify cell types, including types defined primarily on the basis of their connectivity patterns. We then describe how this classification facilitates cell-type-specific connectivity characterization and locating cells with rare connectivity patterns in the dataset.

 The DNA damage response (DDR) is a multifaceted network of pathways that preserves genome stability1,2. Unravelling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge3,4. Here we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening to comprehensively map the genetic interactions required for survival during normal human cell homeostasis across all core DDR genes. We captured known interactions and discovered myriad new connections that are available online. We defined the molecular mechanism of two of the strongest interactions. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain PCNA degradation in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM directly unwind TA-rich DNA cruciforms, preventing catastrophic chromosome breakage by the ERCC1–ERCC4 complex. Our data yield fundamental insights into genome maintenance, provide a springboard for mechanistic investigations into new connections between DDR factors and pinpoint synthetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cancer therapy.

 At subduction zones, lithospheric material descends through the upper mantle to the mantle transition zone (MTZ), where it may continue to sink into the lower mantle or stagnate1,2. Several factors may be important in influencing this flow, including chemical heterogeneity3–5. However, tight constraints on these mantle flows and the exact factors that affect them have proved challenging. We use P-to-S receiver functions to image the subducting slab and the MTZ beneath the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. We image a singular, superdeep (>700 km) 660-km discontinuity over a 200-km-wide zone within the slab, accompanied by nearby double 660 discontinuity phases (normal and superdeep). Combined geodynamic and waveform modelling shows that this observation cannot be explained by temperature effects in typical mantle compositions but requires a large basalt-rich chemical anomaly, strongest in the location of the singular, deep 660. The inferred basalt signature is near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge6,7, where basalt is probably present in greater proportions. Our finding suggests that past tectonic events impart chemical heterogeneity into slabs, and the heterogeneities, in turn, may affect the inherent tendency of the slab to sink.

 Materials with a high electrocaloric effect (ECE)1,2 tend to favour a disordered yet easily tunable polar structure. Perovskite ferroelectrics3 stand out as ideal candidates owing to their high dielectric responses and reasonable thermal conductivity. The introduction of multielement atomic distortions induces a high-polar-entropy state4 that notably increases the ECE by effectively overcoming the constraints imposed by highly ordered, polar-correlated perovskite structures. Here we developed a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric with strong polar disorder through targeted multielement substitution at both the A and B sites of the perovskite, effectively distorting the lattice structure and inducing a variety of nanoscale polar configurations, polymorphic polar variants and non-polar regions. A combination of these multielement-induced features led to an increased density of interfaces, significantly enhancing the polar entropy. Remarkably, a high ECE for an entropy change of about 15 J kg−1 K−1 under a 10 MV m−1 field is observed for the material across a broad temperature range exceeding 60 °C. The formation of ultrafine, dispersed, multiphase lattice configurations leads to high-polar-entropy ferroelectric oxides with a high ECE and a long lifetime of over 1 million cycles that are suitable for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors for practical electrocaloric refrigeration applications.

Streams of vapourized molecular substances that pass out of or into the skin alter the properties of the microclimate defined in this chamber in ways that can be precisely quantified using an integrated collection of wireless sensors. A programmable, bistable valve dynamically controls access to the surrounding environment, thereby creating a transient response that can be quantitatively related to the inward and outward fluxes of the targeted species by analysing the time-dependent readings from the sensors. The systems reported here offer unique capabilities in measuring the flux of water vapour, volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide from various locations on the body, each with distinct relevance to clinical care and/or exposure to hazardous vapours. Studies of healing processes associated with dermal wounds in models of healthy and diabetic mice and of responses in models using infected wounds reveal characteristic flux variations that provide important insights, particularly in scenarios in which the non-contact operation of the devices avoids potential damage to fragile tissues. A non-contact wearable device that defines and modulates a microclimate adjacent to the skin can measure incoming and outgoing streams of vapourized substances, offering valuable insights into physiological health, wound healing and environmental exposures."

 Retroelements have a critical role in shaping eukaryotic genomes. For instance, site-specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons have spread widely through preferential integration into repetitive genomic sequences, such as microsatellite regions and ribosomal DNA genes1–6. Despite the widespread occurrence of these systems, their targeting constraints remain unclear. Here we use a computational pipeline to discover multiple new site-specific retrotransposon families, profile members both biochemically and in mammalian cells, find previously undescribed insertion preferences and chart potential evolutionary paths for retrotransposon retargeting. We identify R2Tg, an R2 retrotransposon from the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as an orthologue that can be retargeted by payload engineering for target cleavage, reverse transcription and scarless insertion of heterologous payloads at new genomic sites. We enhance this activity by fusing R2Tg to CRISPR–Cas9 nickases for efficient insertion at new genomic sites. Through further screening of R2 orthologues, we select an orthologue, R2Tocc, with natural reprogrammability and minimal insertion at its natural 28S site, to engineer SpCas9H840A–R2Tocc, a system we name site-specific target-primed insertion through targeted CRISPR homing of retroelements (STITCHR). STITCHR enables the scarless, efficient installation of edits, ranging from a single base to 12.7 kilobases, gene replacement and use of in vitro transcribed or synthetic RNA templates. Inspired by the prevalence of nLTR retrotransposons across eukaryotic genomes, we anticipate that STITCHR will serve as a platform for scarless programmable integration in dividing and non-dividing cells, with both research and therapeutic applications. A study of retrotransposon activity repurposes a retroelement called R2Tocc to create a programmable system called STITCHR that enables diverse genome edits including efficient, scarless large payload insertions."

 The Maltese archipelago is a small island chain that is among the most remote in the Mediterranean. Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka)1. In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys2–4. Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta’s geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region.

 We are in the era of millimetre-scale electron microscopy volumes collected at nanometre resolution1,2. Dense reconstruction of cellular compartments in these electron microscopy volumes has been enabled by recent advances in machine learning3–6. Automated segmentation methods produce exceptionally accurate reconstructions of cells, but post hoc proofreading is still required to generate large connectomes that are free of merge and split errors. The elaborate 3D meshes of neurons in these volumes contain detailed morphological information at multiple scales, from the diameter, shape and branching patterns of axons and dendrites, down to the fine-scale structure of dendritic spines. However, extracting these features can require substantial effort to piece together existing tools into custom workflows. Here, building on existing open source software for mesh manipulation, we present Neural Decomposition (NEURD), a software package that decomposes meshed neurons into compact and extensively annotated graph representations. With these feature-rich graphs, we automate a variety of tasks such as state-of-the-art automated proofreading of merge errors, cell classification, spine detection, axonal-dendritic proximities and other annotations.

 The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from comparative studies1–3. Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (<1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives.

 In the same way that the mRNA-binding specificities of transfer RNAs define the genetic code, the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) form the molecular basis of the gene regulatory code1,2. The human gene regulatory code is much more complex than the genetic code, in particular because there are more than 1,600 TFs that commonly interact with each other. TF–TF interactions are required for specifying cell fate and executing cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. Despite this, the landscape of interactions between DNA-bound TFs is poorly defined. Here we map the biochemical interactions between DNA-bound TFs using CAP-SELEX, a method that can simultaneously identify individual TF binding preferences, TF–TF interactions and the DNA sequences that are bound by the interacting complexes. A screen of more than 58,000 TF–TF pairs identified 2,198 interacting TF pairs, 1,329 of which preferentially bound to their motifs arranged in a distinct spacing and/or orientation. We also discovered 1,131 TF–TF composite motifs that were markedly different from the motifs of the individual TFs. In total, we estimate that the screen identified between 18% and 47% of all human TF–TF motifs. The novel composite motifs we found were enriched in cell-type-specific elements, active in vivo and more likely to be formed between developmentally co-expressed TFs. Furthermore, TFs that define embryonic axes commonly interacted with different TFs and bound to distinct motifs, explaining how TFs with a similar specificity can define distinct cell types along developmental axes. A large-scale analysis of DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs) shows how the presence of DNA markedly affects the landscape of TF interactions, and identifies composite motifs that are recognized by complexes of TFs rather than by individual ones."

 Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food1. However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood. Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes. PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food. These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations. Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later. These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.

 Ceria nanoparticles supported on alumina are widely used in various catalytic reactions, particularly in conjunction with platinum group metals (PGMs)1–9. Here we found that treating these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and about 1,000 °C in the presence of CO and NO in steam (reactive treatment under reducing atmosphere) leads to the dispersion of ceria nanoparticles into high-density 2D (roughly one atomic layer thin) CexOy domains, as confirmed by microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These domains, which densely cover the alumina, exhibit substantially enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity, facilitating easier extraction of oxygen and the formation of Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies. As a result, these catalysts—whether with or without PGMs, such as Rh and Pt—show improved activity for several industrially important catalytic reactions, including NO and N2O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation, even after exposure to harsh ageing conditions. This study shows a catalyst architecture with superior redox properties under conditions that typically cause sintering, offering a pathway to more efficient metal–ceria catalysts for enhanced general catalysis.

 Mammalian cortex features a vast diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties1. Synaptic connectivity shapes how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but mapping connectivity rules at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here we used millimetre-scale volumetric electron microscopy2 to investigate the connectivity of all inhibitory neurons across a densely segmented neuronal population of 1,352 cells spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. Inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on targeting of dendritic compartments and developed an excitatory neuron classification based on dendritic reconstructions with whole-cell maps of synaptic input. Single-cell connectivity showed a class of disinhibitory specialist that targets basket cells. Analysis of inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of spatially intermingled subpopulations. Inhibitory targeting was organized into ‘motif groups’, diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking contemporary multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.

 The water contents of the lunar interior record important clues for understanding the formation and subsequent thermochemical evolution of the Moon1. The Chang’e-6 (CE6) mission returned samples from the South Pole–Aitken impact basin of the lunar farside2–4, providing an opportunity to study the water contents of the farside mantle. Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite and melt inclusions from CE6 mare basalt, derived from partial melting of the lunar mantle. The parent magma of CE6 mare basalt is estimated to have a water abundance of 15–168 μg g−1 with a δD value of −123 ± 167‰. Our estimate of water abundance of 1–1.5 μg g−1 for the mantle source indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier than its nearside counterpart. This contrast thus suggests that the distribution of water in the interior of the Moon may exhibit a hemispheric dichotomy similar to numerous surface features5. The new estimate for the lunar farside mantle represents a landmark for estimating the water abundance of the bulk silicate Moon, providing critical constraints on the giant impact origin hypothesis6–8 and the subsequent evolution of the Moon for which the role of water is central1,9.

 Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits1. More than 300 mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists2. Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA.

 Osteoarthritis is the third most rapidly growing health condition associated with disability, after dementia and diabetes1. By 2050, the total number of patients with osteoarthritis is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide2. As no disease-modifying treatments exist for osteoarthritis, a better understanding of disease aetiopathology is urgently needed. Here we perform a genome-wide association study meta-analyses across up to 489,975 cases and 1,472,094 controls, establishing 962 independent associations, 513 of which have not been previously reported. Using single-cell multiomics data, we identify signal enrichment in embryonic skeletal development pathways. We integrate orthogonal lines of evidence, including transcriptome, proteome and epigenome profiles of primary joint tissues, and implicate 700 effector genes. Within these, we find rare coding-variant burden associations with effect sizes that are consistently higher than common frequency variant associations. We highlight eight biological processes in which we find convergent involvement of multiple effector genes, including the circadian clock, glial-cell-related processes and pathways with an established role in osteoarthritis (TGFβ, FGF, WNT, BMP and retinoic acid signalling, and extracellular matrix organization). We find that 10% of the effector genes express a protein that is the target of approved drugs, offering repurposing opportunities, which can accelerate translation.

 Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons’ functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis1,2. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types3–6, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column4, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data4,7. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space8, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances9 and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas10,11.

 Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis with hooks, are a diverse endoparasitic group that infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates1. Although long regarded as a separate phylum, they have several putative sister taxa based on morphological features, including Platyhelminthes (flatworms)2, Priapulida (penis worms)3 and Rotifera (wheel animals)4. Molecular phylogenies have instead recovered them within rotifers5–10, suggesting acanthocephalans are derived from free-living worms with a jaw apparatus (Gnathifera). Their only fossil record is Late Cretaceous eggs11, contributing limited palaeontological information to deciphering their early evolution. Here we describe an acanthocephalan body fossil, Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis gen. et. sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou biota of China. Juracanthocephalus shows unambiguous acanthocephalan characteristics, for example a hooked proboscis, a bursa, as well as a jaw apparatus with discrete elements that is typical of other gnathiferans. Juracanthocephalus shares features with Seisonidea (an epizoic member of Rotifera) and Acanthocephala, bridging the evolutionary gap between jawed rotifers and the obligate parasitic, jawless acanthocephalans. Our results reveal previously unrecognized ecological and morphological diversity in ancient Acanthocephala and highlight the significance of transitional fossils, revealing the origins of this highly enigmatic group of living organisms.

 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These clusters can be found at the centre of all galaxy types but tend to favour galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 109M⊙ (refs. 1,2). At present, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in situ star formation from gas infall3 and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction4. Studies5–9 of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, whereas the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, until now, no ongoing merger of GCs has been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N-body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need for large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps.

 Chronic stress remodels brain homeostasis, in which persistent change leads to depressive disorders1. As a key modulator of brain homeostasis2, it remains elusive whether and how brain autophagy is engaged in stress dynamics. Here we discover that acute stress activates, whereas chronic stress suppresses, autophagy mainly in the lateral habenula (LHb). Systemic administration of distinct antidepressant drugs similarly restores autophagy function in the LHb, suggesting LHb autophagy as a common antidepressant target. Genetic ablation of LHb neuronal autophagy promotes stress susceptibility, whereas enhancing LHb autophagy exerts rapid antidepressant-like effects. LHb autophagy controls neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity by means of on-demand degradation of glutamate receptors. Collectively, this study shows a causal role of LHb autophagy in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress. Disrupted LHb autophagy is implicated in the maladaptation to chronic stress, and its reversal by autophagy enhancers provides a new antidepressant strategy. Acute stress activates autophagy in the lateral habenula, whereas chronic stress suppresses it, with this autophagy having a causal role in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress, and its restoration through autophagy enhancers offers a novel antidepressant strategy."

 The Saharo-Arabian Desert is one of the largest biogeographical barriers on Earth, impeding dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, including movements of past hominins. Recent research suggests that this barrier has been in place since at least 11 million years ago1. In contrast, fossil evidence from the late Miocene epoch and the Pleistocene epoch suggests the episodic presence within the Saharo-Arabian Desert interior of water-dependent fauna (for example, crocodiles, equids, hippopotamids and proboscideans)2–6, sustained by rivers and lakes7,8 that are largely absent from today’s arid landscape. Although numerous humid phases occurred in southern Arabia during the past 1.1 million years9, little is known about Arabia’s palaeoclimate before this time. Here, based on a climatic record from desert speleothems, we show recurrent humid intervals in the central Arabian interior over the past 8 million years. Precipitation during humid intervals decreased and became more variable over time, as the monsoon’s influence weakened, coinciding with enhanced Northern Hemisphere polar ice cover during the Pleistocene. Wetter conditions likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, with Arabia acting as a key crossroads for continental-scale biogeographic exchanges.

 Intersectionality describes interdependent systems of inequality related to sex, gender, race, age, class and other socio-political dimensions. By focusing on the compounded effects of social categories, intersectional analysis can enhance the accuracy and experimental efficiency of science. Here we extend intersectional approaches that were predominantly developed in the humanities, social sciences and public health to the fields of natural science and technology, where this type of analysis is less established. Informed by diverse global and disciplinary examples—from enhancing facial recognition for diverse user bases to mitigating the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized populations—we extract methods to demonstrate how quantitative intersectional analysis functions throughout the research process, from strategic considerations for establishing research priorities to formulating research questions, collecting and analysing data and interpreting results. Our goal is to offer a set of guidelines for researchers, peer-reviewed journals and funding agencies that facilitate systematic integration of intersectional analysis into relevant domains of science and technology.

 Numerous natural products and drugs contain flexible alkyl chains.

Here we demonstrate that by using pillar[5]arene-incorporated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and taking advantage of pillar[5]arene−alkyl chain host−guest recognition12–15, it is possible to reduce this motion and bring order to alkyl-chain-containing molecules as the result of docking within accessible pillar[5]arene units present in an overall MOF. This has allowed the single-crystal structures of 48 alkyl-chain-containing molecules, including 6 natural products, 2 approved drugs and 18 custom-made compounds collected from 16 research groups, to be determined using standard SCXRD instrumentation. The structures of alkyl-chain-containing molecules derived from crude reaction products can also be determined directly by SCXRD analyses without further purification. The simplicity, high efficiency and apparent generality of the present pillar[5]arene-incorporated MOF-based supramolecular docking approach suggest that it could emerge as a new tool for the analyses of natural products and drugs that might not be amenable to traditional SCXRD-based structure determination.

 At the heart of medicine lies physician–patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust1,2. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians’ expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE’s performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM–patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.

 Integrated photonics, particularly silicon photonics, have emerged as cutting-edge technology driven by promising applications such as short-reach communications, autonomous driving, biosensing and photonic computing1–4. As advances in AI lead to growing computing demands, photonic computing has gained considerable attention as an appealing candidate. Nonetheless, there are substantial technical challenges in the scaling up of integrated photonics systems to realize these advantages, such as ensuring consistent performance gains in upscaled integrated device clusters, establishing standard designs and verification processes for complex circuits, as well as packaging large-scale systems. These obstacles arise primarily because of the relative immaturity of integrated photonics manufacturing and the scarcity of advanced packaging solutions involving photonics. Here we report a large-scale integrated photonic accelerator comprising more than 16,000 photonic components. The accelerator is designed to deliver standard linear matrix multiply–accumulate (MAC) functions, enabling computing with high speed up to 1 GHz frequency and low latency as small as 3 ns per cycle. Logic, memory and control functions that support photonic matrix MAC operations were designed into a cointegrated electronics chip. To seamlessly integrate the electronics and photonics chips at the commercial scale, we have made use of an innovative 2.5D hybrid advanced packaging approach. Through the development of this accelerator system, we demonstrate an ultralow computation latency for heuristic solvers of computationally hard Ising problems whose performance greatly relies on the computing latency.

 The mammalian nucleus is compartmentalized by diverse subnuclear structures. These subnuclear structures, marked by nuclear bodies and histone modifications, are often cell-type specific and affect gene regulation and 3D genome organization1–3. Understanding their relationships rests on identifying the molecular constituents of subnuclear structures and mapping their associations with specific genomic loci and transcriptional levels in individual cells, all in complex tissues. Here, we introduce two-layer DNA seqFISH+, which enables simultaneous mapping of 100,049 genomic loci, together with the nascent transcriptome for 17,856 genes and subnuclear structures in single cells. These data enable imaging-based chromatin profiling of diverse subnuclear markers and can capture their changes at genomic scales ranging from 100–200 kilobases to approximately 1 megabase, depending on the marker and DNA locus. By using multi-omics datasets in the adult mouse cerebellum, we showed that repressive chromatin regions are more variable by cell type than are active regions across the genome. We also discovered that RNA polymerase II-enriched foci were locally associated with long, cell-type-specific genes (bigger than 200 kilobases) in a manner distinct from that of nuclear speckles. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that cell-type-specific regions of heterochromatin marked by histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me3) are enriched at specific genes and gene clusters, respectively, and shape radial chromosomal positioning and inter-chromosomal interactions in neurons and glial cells. Together, our results provide a single-cell high-resolution multi-omics view of subnuclear structures, associated genomic loci and their effects on gene regulation, directly within complex tissues. A genomic barcoding scheme called two-layer DNA seqFISH+ enables the simultaneous mapping of more than 100,000 loci and has been used to identify cell-type-specific subnuclear compartments in the mouse brain."

 Understanding the relationship between circuit connectivity and function is crucial for uncovering how the brain computes. In mouse primary visual cortex, excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected1–8; however, broader connectivity rules remain unknown. Here we leverage the millimetre-scale MICrONS dataset to analyse synaptic connectivity and functional properties of neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar response properties are preferentially connected within and across layers and areas—including feedback connections—supporting the universality of ‘like-to-like’ connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections beyond what could be explained by the proximity of axons and dendrites. We also discovered a higher-order rule whereby postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Recurrent neural networks trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns that mirror both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitudes similar to those in MICrONS data. Ablation studies in these recurrent neural networks reveal that disrupting like-to-like connections impairs performance more than disrupting random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may have a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems. The MICrONS mouse visual cortex dataset shows that neurons with similar response properties preferentially connect, a pattern that emerges within and across brain areas and layers, and independently emerges in artificial neural networks where these ‘like-to-like’ connections prove important for task performance."

 Mutation of some genes drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) provided the very first such genetic link to cancer1,2. However, little is known about the trajectory to CML, the rate of BCR::ABL1 clonal expansion and how this affects disease. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 haematopoietic colonies from nine patients with CML aged 22 to 81 years, we reconstruct phylogenetic trees of haematopoiesis. Intronic breaks in BCR and ABL1 were not always observed, and out-of-frame exonic breakpoints in BCR, requiring exon skipping to derive BCR::ABL1, were also noted. Apart from ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, extra myeloid gene mutations were mostly present in wild-type cells. We inferred explosive growth attributed to BCR::ABL1 commencing 3–14 years (confidence interval 2–16 years) before diagnosis, with annual growth rates exceeding 70,000% per year. Mutation accumulation was higher in BCR::ABL1 cells with shorter telomere lengths, reflecting their excessive cell divisions. Clonal expansion rates inversely correlated with the time to diagnosis. BCR::ABL1 in the general population mirrored CML incidence, and advanced and/or blast phase CML was characterized by subsequent genomic evolution. These data highlight the oncogenic potency of BCR::ABL1 fusion and contrast with the slow and sequential clonal trajectories of most cancers.

 A critical challenge in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the simultaneous attainment of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high stability. Employing polymers interfaces in PSCs can enhance durability by blocking water and oxygen, and by suppressing ions interdiffusion, but their electronic shielding poses a challenge for efficient and stable PSCs1–3. In this study, we report a magnetic endohedral metallofullerene Nd@C82-polymer coupling layer, which features ultra-fast electron extraction and in-situ encapsulation, thereby promoting homogeneous electron extraction and suppressing ions interdiffusion. The Nd@C82-polymer coupling layer in PSCs exhibited PCE of 26.78% (certified 26.29%) and 23.08% with an aperture area of 0.08 square centimetres and 16 square centimetres (modules), respectively.

 California data demonstrate failures in latent tuberculosis screening to prevent progression to tuberculosis disease. Therefore, we developed a clinical risk prediction model for tuberculosis disease using electronic health records. This study included Kaiser Permanente Southern California and Northern California members ≥18 years during 2008-2019. Models used Cox proportional hazards regression, Harrell’s C-statistic, and a simulated TB disease outcome accounting for cases prevented by current screening which includes both observed and simulated cases. We compared sensitivity and number-needed-to-screen for model-identified high-risk individuals with current screening. Of 4,032,619 and 4,051,873 Southern and Northern California members, tuberculosis disease incidences were 4.1 and 3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The final model C-statistic was 0.816 (95% simulation interval 0.805-0.824). Model sensitivity screening high-risk individuals was 0.70 (0.68-0.71) and number-needed-to-screen was 662 (646-679) persons-per tuberculosis disease case, compared to a sensitivity of 0.36 (0.34-0.38) and number-needed-to-screen of 1632 (1485-1774) with current screening.

 Total sea ice extent (SIE) across the Southern Ocean increased from 1979-2014, but declined rapidly after 2016. Significant sea ice decline has emerged since the peak of SIE in 2014, coincident with Pacific sub-decadal sea surface temperature (SST) trends resembling a strong La Niña-like cold condition and the negative phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Previous studies suggest that the warm subsurface Southern Ocean was an important driver of the low sea ice in spring 2016 and the sustained low sea ice state since. Here we show that the observed atmospheric circulation changes near Antarctica during the period from June 2013-May 2023 are conducive to increasing surface temperature via warm advection from north and reducing Antarctic SIE, involving a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low and anomalous high pressures over the Weddell Sea and West Pacific sectors. Through coupled pacemaker experiments, we demonstrate that Pacific sub-decadal SST trends have dominantly driven these atmospheric circulation changes through tropical–polar teleconnections and also induced significant Southern Ocean subsurface warming in the recent decade. The consequent decreasing SIE has enhanced the Southern Ocean subsurface warming effect and significantly contributed to the rapid Antarctic SIE decline.

 Electron spin qubits in semiconductors are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing due to their small size, long coherence and manufacturability. Typically, readout in spin qubits has been performed using energy-selective readout with extremely high fidelities up to 99.95% at millikelvin temperatures. Despite achieving record fidelities at low electron temperatures, the readout time remains on the order of 1 μs to 100 μs and comparable to the electron spin coherence time. In this paper we show that by engineering the location of two multi-donor quantum dot qubits with nanoscale precision we can demonstrate latched parity readout of two electrons in only 175 ns integration time with a fidelity of 99.44% at mK temperatures. Most importantly we show that this combination of strong confinement potential present in donor qubits with precision engineering of the tunnel rates allows us to operate our compact sensors at the highest temperatures recorded so far (3.7 K) using latched spin readout, giving a maximum fidelity of 97.87% in 1.5 μs.

Here, the authors report an actuating hydrogel used for untethered pneumatic actuators. 
 Pneumatic artificial muscles have been widely used in the field of robotics because of their large output force and fast actuation, however, the accompanying bulky compressors and pumps limit their miniaturized applications. Despite current untethered pneumatic artificial muscles can be driven by adjusting the internal pressure, it is challenging to structurally mimic natural muscles with high water content. Here, we propose untethered pneumatic artificial muscles comprising a hydrogel actuator with snap-through instability and an air storage chamber. These hydrogel actuators can realize the conversion from hydrophobic association of octyl acrylate moieties to host-guest interaction between β-cyclodextrin and octyl acrylate under thermal stimuli, leading to the decrease of their moduli. The inflated hydrogel actuators exhibit rapid actuation with a radial expansion speed of 200% s−1, which are powered by snap-through instability, thermal expansion of the gas inside the hydrogel actuator, and evaporation of water on its internal surface. With the pneumatic artificial muscles miniaturized, we demonstrate diving and rolling robots, exemplifying bionic robots able to adapt to and modify the environment. We expect that the design of hydrogel actuator in miniaturized pneumatic artificial muscles will facilitate rapid locomotion for future bionic robotic platforms.

 Despite extensive work on the evolution of cooperation, the roles of teaching and leadership in transmitting opaque cultural norms—foundations of cooperative behaviors—are underexplored. Similarly, while teaching is well-studied in the evolution of instrumental culture, little attention is given to its role in transmitting opaque culture, such as social values and norms. Transmitting opaque culture often requires teaching, and group leaders are well-positioned to facilitate this process. Using comparative ethnographic data, we explore teaching, leadership, and instrumental versus opaque culture by examining whether opaque culture is primarily transmitted via teaching, which age groups tend to learn these norms, and whether leaders are disproportionately involved in teaching. Drawing on ethnographic data from 23 egalitarian foraging societies, we find teaching is more strongly associated with transmitting cultural values and kinship knowledge than subsistence skills and is closely linked to opaque culture and leadership. Leader-directed teaching may drive cooperation, suggesting new research avenues. Teaching and leadership are under-studied in connection with the opaque norms that underpin cooperation.

 While seasoned organic chemists can often predict suitable catalysts for new reactions based on their past experiences in other catalytic reactions, developing this ability is costly, laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, replicating this remarkable expertize of human researchers through machine learning (ML) is compelling, albeit that it remains highly challenging. Herein, we apply a domain-adaptation-based transfer-learning (TL) approach to photocatalysis. Despite being different reaction types, the knowledge of the catalytic behavior of organic photosensitizers (OPSs) from photocatalytic cross-coupling reactions is successfully transferred to ML for a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, improving the prediction of the photocatalytic activity compared with conventional ML approaches. Furthermore, a satisfactory predictive performance is achieved by using only ten training data points. This experimentally readily accessible small dataset can also be used to identify effective OPSs for alkene photoisomerization, thereby showcasing the potential benefits of TL in catalyst exploration.

 Obesity is a major and increasingly prevalent chronic metabolic disease with numerous comorbidities. While recent incretin-based therapies have provided pharmaceutical inroads into treatment of obesity, there remains an ongoing need for additional medicines with distinct modes of action as independent or complementary therapeutics. Among the most promising candidates, supported by phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, is cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. As such, understanding how cagrilintide functionally engages target receptors is critical for future development of this target class. Here, we determine structures of cagrilintide bound to Gs-coupled, active, amylin receptors (AMY1R, AMY2R, AMY3R) and calcitonin receptor (CTR) and compare cagrilintide interactions and the dynamics of receptor complexes with previously reported structures of receptors bound to rat amylin, salmon calcitonin or recently developed amylin-based peptides. These data reveal that cagrilintide has an amylin-like binding mode but, compared to other peptides, induces distinct conformational dynamics at calcitonin-family receptors that could contribute to its clinical efficacy.

 Secure access to energy services is a prerequisite to economic productivity and a chief strategic concern of national governments, yet it is unclear how the trade in fuels and critical materials in scenarios with net-zero emissions relates to energy security risks. Here we find that overall trade risks decrease in most countries (70%) in net-zero scenarios due to reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels, but trade risks to either electricity or transportation systems increase in the majority (82%) of countries that become more dependent on imported materials. Countries with abundant mineral reserves (for example, Australia and China) become much less dependent on imports, but the opposite is true of countries with large fossil fuel reserves (for example, Russia and the Middle East). We further evaluate the sensitivity of countries’ trade risks to differences in trading networks, energy systems, the material intensities of technologies and recycling rates, highlighting opportunities for technological innovation and policy changes.

 Plastics used in agriculture improve productivity and resource efficiency. As they fragment over time, microplastics are unintentionally released into soil, raising concerns regarding long-term implications for soil structure and fertility. Here we investigated microplastics transport and their impact on soil structure through a two-year field experiment. 45 re-packed soil columns were installed with three treatments: indium-doped polyethylene terephthalate fragments or fibers in the top 2 cm and a control with no microplastics. Soil pore structure was monitored with X-ray tomography, and microplastics vertical transport was assessed via the indium tracer. With time macropore volume, biopore fraction and critical pore diameter increased independent of microplastic addition. Microplastic transport was minimal, with only ~1% reaching below 8 cm soil depth in two years. This experimental design, simulating natural soil conditions, suggests that microplastics have a negligible influence on soil macropore architecture and its transport rate is limited in the short term.

 Artisanal and Small-Scale mining (ASM) provides essential livelihoods for many in developing countries but often lacks regulation, leading to environmental issues such as water pollution and deforestation. Timely and accurate mapping of ASM activities is vital for responsible mining that benefits the environment and local communities. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for regular ASM monitoring in cloudy regions due to its ability to penetrate clouds. However, atmospheric effects can limit its effectiveness, particularly with shorter wavelengths in wet tropical areas during the rainy season. This study utilised a time series smoothing technique to improve Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR time series data, reducing SAR noise and atmospheric effects from heavy rainfall for early ASM activity detection. We tested three change point detection (CPD) methods, including cumulative sum (CuSuM), pruned exact linear time (PELT), and binary segmentation (BinSeg) in the Western and Ashanti wet regions in southern Ghana using the smoothed S-1 data for early ASM detection. We observed a relatively fast response of ASM activity tracking when utilising smoothed S-1 data at both sites for VV and VH polarizations during the rainy seasons. However, VH polarization is more effective than VV polarization during rainy seasons. While all CPD algorithms showed similar performance, CuSuM had the shortest lag time of up to 9 days, compared to 11 days for PELT and BinSeg. This method significantly reduces ambiguity caused by heavy rainfall when identifying change points due to ASM activity, making it a viable option for near real-time monitoring in wet tropical regions."

 Soil moisture products with long-term, high spatial continuity, and high accuracy are essential for meteorological management and hydrological monitoring. Microwave remote sensing retrieval and land surface model simulation are the two primary sources of global-scale soil moisture data, but each has inherent limitations, making it difficult to balance accuracy and spatial coverage. In this paper, to tackle this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based spatiotemporal fusion framework to integrate the two data sources and generate a global soil moisture product with high spatial continuity and accuracy. Specifically, we leverage the high accuracy of the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) microwave soil moisture data and the spatiotemporal continuity of the Noah assimilation soil moisture data. The proposed model employs a deep residual cycle GAN (DrcGAN) to capture the nonlinear complementary spatiotemporal features between the SMAP and Noah data, generating a seamless global daily product at a 36-km resolution, spanning April 4, 2015, to November 26, 2023, referred to as STSG-SM. Various validation methods, including spatial pattern analysis, time-series comparison, and in-situ validation, are utilized to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the product. In comparison to the selected in-situ measurements, the STSG-SM dataset (original SMAP-P36) exhibits a bias of 0.0230 m3/m3 (0.0243 m3/m3), R of 0.8388 (0.8405), RMSE of 0.0629 m3/m3 (0.0628 m3/m3), and ubRMSE of 0.0585 m3/m3 (0.0579 m3/m3), indicating that the proposed method sustains the high precision of satellite-retrieved soil moisture and demonstrates strong consistency with the in-situ measurements."

 Up-to-date cadastral maps are vital to local governments in administrating real estate in cities. With its growing availability, remote sensing imagery is the cost-effective data for updating semantic contents on cadastral maps. In this study, we address the problem of updating buildings on cadastral maps, as city renewal is mainly characterized by new construction and demolition. While previous works focus on extracting all buildings from remote sensing images, we argue that these methods not only disregard preliminary information on cadastral maps but also fail to preserve building priors in unchanged areas on cadastral maps. Therefore, we focus on the task of extracting changed buildings (i.e., newly built and demolished buildings) from remote sensing images and cadastral maps. To address this task, we create an image-map building change detection (IMBCD) dataset, formed by around 27K pairs of remote sensing images and maps and their corresponding changed buildings in six distinct geographical areas across the globe. Accordingly, we propose a Bilateral Attention Network (BANet), introducing a novel attention mechanism: changed-first (CF) attention and non-changed-first (NCF) attention. This bilateral attention mechanism helps to refine the uncertain areas between changed and non-changed regions. Extensive experiments on our IMBCD dataset showcase the superior performance of BANet. Specifically, our BANet outperforms state-of-the-art models with F1 scores of 90.00% and 63.00% for the IMBCD-WHU and IMBCD-Inria datasets. This confirms that the leverage of bilateral attention blocks (BAB) can boost performance."

 Buildings are crucial to cities, and tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR) is an important tool for monitoring the heights, linear deformations and thermal amplitudes of buildings. However, existing TomoSAR height inversion methods do not fully leverage a priori knowledge, compromising the accuracy of deformation estimation; deep learning-based methods involve the integration of multiple steps, complicating the process. Additionally, the computational inefficiency of existing algorithms significantly hinders the large-scale practical deployment of TomoSAR. To address the above issues, this study proposes a novel large-area urban TomoSAR method integrating limited a priori knowledge constraints with a complex-valued (CV) deep learning model. By refining scatterer types and Permanent Scatterer (PS) height sample sets under limited a priori height data constraints, the proposed CV-TomoPS-Net establishes an end-to-end framework for scatterer classification and PS height regression. Additionally, the proposed fast beamforming method, paired with an adaptive spatial search mechanism, enables rapid large-area inversion of deformation and thermal amplitude parameters. Experiments were conducted in Shenzhen city using COSMO-SkyMed SAR data from 2020 to 2023 and limited a priori data. Results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of scatterer type classification by 16 %, reduces the height calculation error by 30 %, and improves the monitoring efficiency by 80 % compared with the traditional beamforming method. Validation via corner reflectors deformation monitoring confirmed reliability, with a 1.5 mm average error. These results highlight the practical applicability of the proposed method for large-scale urban monitoring and its potential to provide technical support for sustainable urban development."

 In the processing of Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, two-dimensional (2-D) phase unwrapping (PU) is crucial for ensuring the quality of InSAR data inversion. Traditional methods, based on the assumption of phase continuity, often struggle with abrupt terrain changes and the influence of severe noise, leading to poor performance or failure. To address these challenges, this paper presents a dilated multi-path phase unwrapping network (DMP-PUNet) for 2-D PU under conditions of severe noise and complex fringes. To train this model, we developed a multi-effect interferometric phase simulation (ME-IPS) strategy that aims to simulate interferometric phases that closely resemble real-world conditions by comprehensively considering various factors, including terrain and digital elevation model (DEM) errors, atmospheric turbulence, vegetation effects, baseline geometry, multiple scattering, and noise. This simulation, combined with quasi-real interferometric phase data obtained from DEM inversion algorithms, forms the comprehensive training dataset. Finally, experiments on simulated data, quasi-real data, the InSAR-DLPU dataset, and InSAR data demonstrate that DMP-PUNet outperforms existing methods. For simulated data, DMP-PUNet achieved an overall average mean absolute error (MAE) in residuals of 0.221 rad, improving accuracy by 54.75 % with an average processing time of 0.81 s. For quasi-real data, the average MAE was 0.320 rad, a 119.06 % increase in accuracy, with an average processing time of 0.82 s. For the InSAR-DLPU dataset, overall, the MAE of DMP-PUNet was 20.34 % to 64.96 % lower than that of the best-performing baseline method (DLPU), with an average processing time of 1.90 s. For InSAR data, DMP-PUNet performed stably, with lower noise levels, smooth phase transitions, and deformation spatial patterns and profile shapes that conform to the laws of mining subsidence, averaging a processing time of 1.71 s, outperforming existing methods."

 There has been an industrial shift towards replacing legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic and sulfonic acids (PFECA and PFESA) including hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), also known as GenX. These compounds have been detected in the atmosphere but their potential sources remain poorly understood.In this study, aerosolisation of six PFECA and PFESA from PFAS-contaminated water at concentrations and pHs representative of industrial sewage was investigated. All studied PFECA and PFESA were observed in the aerosols from the aeration of PFAS-fortified water at pH 6, 7 and 8. The aerosolisation behaviour of PFECA and PFESA increased with the analyte's carbon chain length and was influenced by the PFAS functional groups and pH of the aerated solution. PFESA with sulfonic acid groups aerosolised more from the solutions than PFECA with carboxylic acid groups. The ability of new generation PFAS to transfer from contaminated waters and become airborne (aerosolise up to a mass fraction 30.4 ± 2.7 %) raises concerns due to their potential health and environmental impacts.

 High-quality satellite quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is crucial for theoretical studies and disaster monitoring. However, it remains unclear which information is effective or relatively less valuable. Accurately eliminating ineffective variables and applying effective ones as predictors can further enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency for QPE. In this study, an hourly QPE algorithm was developed using three machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM. We focused on obtaining high-precision precipitation estimations and further analyzing the contribution of different input variables. Sensitivity experiments revealed that satellite visible channels and cloud properties are key factors for accurate QPE. In contrast, information provided solely by infrared channels and meteorological variables is relatively limited. Among three ML models, LightGBM achieved the best QPE, and was comparable to, or even slightly better than GPM IMERG, which may be attributed to its incorporation of more effective variables and training with ground rain gauge. However, it sometimes underestimates heavy precipitation compared to GPM IMERG, probably due to few training samples and saturation of satellite spectral signals. The analysis of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) indicates that QPE are more sensitive to cloud properties (e.g., cloud water path), but some meteorological factors, such as relative humidity at different pressure levels are becoming more important as the environment becomes drier. Additionally, the performance of ML model and GPM IMERG deeply relies on cloud type. These findings are expected to provide valuable references for the construction of future satellite QPE algorithms in terms of feature selection and data processing."

 This study uses HadISST and ERA5 reanalysis data to investigate the trend-removed variability of the 0 °C isotherm elevation, and the main controls on this variability, along the southern slopes of the Himalayas in pre-monsoon season. Here we show that the sea surface temperature (SST) in the north tropical Atlantic Ocean (NTAO) exerts a phase-locked effect on the anomalous seesaw pattern in the 0 °C isotherm elevation with a node around 84.5°E, after the upward trend in the 0 °C isotherm elevation is removed. When the NTAO SST anomalies are warmer than normal, wave-train-like patterns are forced out over western Africa–southeastern Tibetan Plateau with the same anomalous centers from the lower to upper troposphere. An anomalous temperature dipole associated with this wave-train-like pattern is the direct cause of the rise (fall) in the 0 °C isotherm elevation along the southern slopes of the western (eastern) Himalayas in pre-monsoon season. When the NTAO SST anomalies are colder than normal, the opposite situation develops. This significant phase-locked correlation between NTAO SST and trend-removed isotherm elevation, which persists from the previous autumn to the current pre-monsoon season, will help to both elucidate and mitigate the risks posed by glacier-related hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and avalanches over the southern Himalayas."

Loss of EIF3D disrupted the balance of pluripotency-associated signaling pathways, thereby compromising primed pluripotency. Moreover, EIF3D ensured robust proliferation by controlling the translation of various p53 regulators, which maintain low p53 activity in the undifferentiated state.

We reveal that two resonances with nearly orthogonal polarizations become strongly coupled in an engineered chiral metasurface. The inherent phase difference of the resonances, associated with the coherent destruction on the decay channel, can endow high-Qfactor and maximize chirality to one of the hybrid modes. We verify this approach experimentally by measuring transmission spectra, angle-resolved photoluminescence, and laser emission.

We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs. Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage. αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion."

Our robot can hop continuously while controlling jump height and frequency in the range of 1.5 to 20 centimeters and 2 to 8.4 hertz. The robot can follow positional set points, overcome tall obstacles, and traverse challenging surfaces. It can also hop on a dynamically rotating plane, recover from strong collisions, and perform somersaults. Compared to flight, this design reduces power consumption by 64 percent and increases payload by 10 times. Although the robot relies on offboard power and control, the substantial payload and efficiency improvement open opportunities for future study on autonomous locomotion."

Whether depletion described by classical theories is the mechanism for polymer-mediated nanosphere attractions is less evident. Colloidal hard nanospheres and nonadsorbing polymers are challenging to realize given the diverse interactions typically present in nanoparticle dispersions. Here, we use small-angle x-ray scattering to assess whether the depletion mechanism holds at the nanoscale, leveraging a recent finding that uncharged, oleate-capped indium oxide nanocrystals exhibit near–hard-sphere interactions in toluene. Classical modeling of polystyrene depletant as penetrable spheres predicts depletion-induced phase boundaries, nanocrystal second osmotic virial coefficients, and colloidal structuring in agreement with experiments for polymer radii of gyration up to 80% of the nanocrystal radius. Experimentally observed weakening of depletion interactions for larger polymer-to-nanocrystal size ratios qualitatively follows theoretical predictions that account for how polymer physics influences depletant interactions."

Traditional damping materials often fail to meet these demands because of a trade-off between damping and mechanical strength. We introduce an innovative strategy to fabricate armored polymer-fluid gels (APFGs) that combine high damping and high modulus for effective damping and impact protection under extreme conditions. By using a controlled surface cross-linking process through diffusion, we greatly enhance the mechanical strength of polymer-fluid gels without sacrificing their damping capabilities. This asymmetric design results in an unprecedented loss factor (tanδ > 0.5 from −45 degrees to 135 degrees Celsius, peaking at tanδ = 2.2) while achieving a tensile modulus of 20 megapascals. This method resolves the long-standing damping-modulus trade-off, positioning APFGs as promising candidates for robust damping and impact protection in electronics and human motion applications."

Recognition of dsRNAs activates innate immune pathways, leading to cellular inflammation and inhibition of cell growth. Here, we show that an effective dsRNA response may occur without the onset of inflammation. Pro-inflammatory [RLR (retinoic acid–inducible gene I–like receptor)–dependent pathway] and cell growth inhibitory mechanisms [oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/ribonuclease L (RNase L)– and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)–dependent pathways] can act independently. We found that the 5′ ends of dsRNA direct the onset of cellular inflammation, whereas the RNA duplex activates the OAS/RNase L and PKR pathways. Unexpectedly, three of the most common human RNA epitranscriptomic marks—i.e.,N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and pseudouridine—had almost no influence on the immunogenicity of dsRNA; however, the presence ofN6-methyladenosine inhibited the OAS/RNase L pathway.

Silencing PRCAT71 inhibited cancerous properties of PCa cells and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Mechanistically, PRCAT71 acts as a scaffold to recruit K homology (KH)–type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) to AR messenger RNA (mRNA) and stabilize AR mRNA, leading to activated AR signaling. KHSRP plays a critical role in PCa progression. PRCAT71 is transcriptionally regulated by AR-driven enhancers, forming a positive regulatory loop between AR and PRCAT71 in PCa.

Regionally, the highest carbon mitigation potential of forestation concentrates in tropical areas, while mid-high-latitude regions demonstrate higher heterogeneity, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies and further refinement of nature-based mitigation plans.

A photometer was used to observe the vertical component of the GWs, whereas the horizontal component was observed by an all-sky imager. Using the parameters from these two instruments and background wind from meteor radar, the momentum flux and potential energy of the GWs were determined and studied. It is noted that the dynamics of the downward-propagating GWs were controlled by observed ducts. 
 Momentum flux and propagation dynamics of two vertically propagating atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are studied using observations at São João do Cariri (7.40° S, 36.31° W), Brazil, from co-located photometer, all-sky imager, and meteor radar instruments. Time series of the atomic oxygen green line (OI 557.7 nm), molecular oxygen (O2 (0–1)), sodium D-line (NaD), and hydroxyl (OH (6–2)) airglow intensity variations measured by the photometer were used to investigate the vertical characteristics and vertical phase progression of the GWs with similar (± 10 % of the error margin) or nearly the same (± 5 % of the error margin) period across these emission layers. The horizontal parameters of the same GWs were determined from the OH airglow images, whereas the intrinsic parameters of the horizontal and vertical components of the GWs were estimated with the aid of the observed winds. Using the phase of the GWs at each emission layer, the characteristics of the phase progression exhibited near-vertical propagation under a duct background propagation condition. This indicates that the duct contributes significantly to the observed near-vertical phase propagation. The GW momentum flux and potential energy were estimated using the rotational temperatures of OH and O2, revealing that the time series of momentum fluxes and potential energies are higher in the O2 emission band than in the OH band, indicating a transfer of momentum and energy across OH to the O2 altitude. These results reveal the effect of a duct on vertically propagating GWs and the associated momentum flux and potential energy transfer from the lower to the upper altitudes in the mesosphere."

We develop climatological relationships to estimate potential persistent contrail formation for existing as well as future aircraft and propulsion system designs. We identify latitudes and pressure levels where the introduction of novel aircraft designs would result in significant changes in potential persistent contrail formation compared to existing conventional aircraft. 
 Mounting evidence has highlighted the role of aviation non-CO2 emissions in anthropogenic climate change. Of particular importance is the impact of contrails, to which recent studies attribute over one-third of the total effective radiative forcing from aircraft operations. However, the relative importance of the aircraft-design-dependent and environmental factors that influence the formation of persistent contrails is not yet well understood. In this paper, we use ERA5 data from the 2010s to better understand the interplay between the factors on a climatological timescale. We identify ice supersaturation as the most limiting factor for all aircraft designs considered, underscoring the importance of accurately estimating ice supersaturated regions. We also develop climatological relationships that describe potential persistent contrail formation as a function of the pressure level and Schmidt–Appleman mixing line slope. We find that the influence of aircraft design on persistent contrail formation reduces with increasing altitude. Compared to a state-of-the-art conventional aircraft with an overall propulsion system efficiency of 0.37, water vapour extraction technologies envisioned for the future have the potential to reduce persistent contrail formation by up to 85.1 %. On the other hand, compared to the same reference, hydrogen combustion and fuel cell aircraft could increase globally averaged persistent contrail formation by 46.5 % and 54.7 % respectively. Due to differing contrail properties, further work is required to translate these changes into climate impacts. This study is a step towards the development of a new and computationally inexpensive method to analyse the contrail climate impact of novel aviation fuels and propulsion technologies."

To address these, it introduces the empirical scattering model (ESM) based on high-quality Doppler spectra from a 94 GHz radar. The ESM offers improved accuracy and directly incorporates natural rain's microphysical effects. This new model can enhance retrieval and calibration methods, benefiting cloud radar polarimetry experts and scattering modelers. 
 The established relationships between the size, shape, and terminal velocity of raindrops, along with the spheroidal shape approximation (SSA), are commonly employed for calculating radar observables in rain. This study, however, reveals the SSA's limitations in accurately simulating spectral and integrated backscattering polarimetric variables in rain at the W-band.Improving existing models is a complex task that demands high-precision data from both laboratory settings and natural rain, enhanced stochastic shape approximation techniques, and comprehensive scattering simulations. To circumvent these challenges, this study introduces a simpler and more straightforward approach – the empirical scattering model (ESM).The ESM is derived from an analysis of high-quality, low-turbulence Doppler spectra, which were selected from measurements taken with a 94 GHz radar at three different locations between 2021 and 2024. The ESM's primary advantages over the SSA include superior accuracy and the direct incorporation of microphysical effects observed in natural rain.This study demonstrates that the ESM can potentially clarify issues in existing retrieval and calibration methods that use polarimetric observations at the W-band. The findings of this study are valuable not only for experts in cloud radar polarimetry but also for scattering modelers and laboratory experimenters since explaining the presented observations necessitates a more profound understanding of the microphysical properties and processes in rain."

 From autumn 2021 through summer 2023, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and partners conducted the Study of Precipitation, the Lower Atmosphere, and Surface for Hydrometeorology (SPLASH) campaign in the East River watershed of Colorado. One objective of SPLASH was to observe the transfer of energy between the atmosphere and the surface, which was done at several locations. Two remote sites were chosen that did not have access to power utilities. These were along the valley floor near the East River in the vicinity of the unincorporated town of Gothic, Colorado. Energy balance measurements were made at these locations using autonomous, single-level flux towers referred to as atmospheric surface flux stations (ASFSs). The ASFSs were deployed on 28 September 2021 at the Kettle Ponds Annex site and on 12 October 2021 at the Avery Picnic site and operated until 19 July and 21 June 2023, respectively. Measurements included basic meteorology; upward and downward longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes and subsurface conductive flux, each at 1 min resolution; 3-D winds from a sonic anemometer and H2O/CO2 from an open-path gas analyzer, both at 20 Hz from which sensible, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes were derived; and profiles of soil properties in the upper 0.5 m (both sites) and temperature profiles through the snow (at Avery Picnic), each reported between 10 min and 6 h. The system uptime was 97 % (Kettle Ponds) and 90 % (Avery Picnic), and collectively 1184 d of data was obtained between the stations.

The provided time series and catchment attributes will be of interest to those modelers wishing to analyze hydrological behavior and perform model assessments. 
 Over the last decade, large-sample approaches, i.e., based on large catchment sets, have become increasingly popular in hydrological studies. Efforts were made to assemble and disseminate national catchment datasets. This article aims to make a contribution to the construction of a large international database of catchments by proposing the CAMELS-FR dataset, a contribution to the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) initiative. The first version presented here gathers hydroclimatic data and physical attributes for a set of 654 catchments in France. These catchments cover a wide spectrum of hydroclimatic conditions (from oceanic to continental, mountainous, or Mediterranean conditions) and are considered to have limited human influence. Data include time series of daily streamflow (with at least 30 years over the 1970–2021 period, also aggregated to monthly and yearly time steps) and of 11 catchment-scale daily climate variables (including precipitation, potential evaporation, and air temperature), as well as a total of 255 catchment attributes organized into 10 classes (e.g., geology, soil, land cover). River flow time series were quality-checked. Along with the database itself, two graphical tools are proposed, namely dynamic graphs to visualize time series and graphical fact sheets to summarize the main catchment characteristics. Care was taken to provide as many metadata as possible to help users interpret their results based on this dataset.

However, comprehensively quantifying the contribution of microplastics with different biodegradability to AMR is lacking. In this study, we systematically quantified AMR risk mediated by biodegradable and nonbiodegradable microplastics using abundance-based methods and a custom AMR risk ranking framework that includes antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) abundance, mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our results demonstrated that biodegradable microplastics exhibited higher AMR risk compared to that of nonbiodegradable plastics. Key resistance genes, including those for multidrug, bacitracin, and aminoglycoside resistance, were predominant. Machine learning analysis identified cell motility as the most significant signature associated with AMR risk, highlighting its potential role in promoting ARGs dissemination. In addition, biodegradable microplastics promoted oxidative stress and SOS responses, which likely enhanced horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and AMR. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) analysis uncovered the colocalization of microplastic degradation genes, ARGs, and virulence factors (VFs), further supporting the elevated risk in biodegradable plastisphere. The proximity of ARGs to mobile genetic elements (MGEs) suggests that microplastic degradation processes might favor ARGs mobility.

Biofilm formation was significantly higher on UV-aged MPs than on pristine MPs, ethanol-washed MPs, and silica sand. Microplastics and their leachates enhanced the bioluminescence of the bacteria with maximum increases of 60% and 70% for pristine and UV-aged MPs, respectively, primarily driven by Ca2+ release. Behavioral assays showed that fish preferentially fed on glowing MPs, indicating that bioluminescence enhanced the visibility and attractiveness of MPs. These findings suggest that interactions between MPs and luminescent bacteria may boost the tendency of fish to feed on MPs, raising concerns about their potential accumulation in marine food webs."

Here, we test the effect of n=3 $n=3$ versus n=4 $n=4$ in a series of 300‐year forward simulations of the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica. We find that in periods of rapid grounding line retreat, uncertainty in n $n$ leads to a larger spread in ice‐loss projections than the spread due to uncertainty in climate forcing. The spatial sensitivity of n $n$ is generally proportional to change in strain rates, so we expect regions undergoing more moderate dynamic change to be less sensitive to n $n$."

Globally, observations indicate larger decreases in high cloudiness than state‐of‐the‐art climate models suggest. In fact, half of the 16 models considered here predict radiative feedbacks inconsistent with observations, likely due to misrepresenting the stability iris mechanism.

Given the difficulty in modeling these conditions, some key properties of core convection are still debated, including the dominant energy‐carrying lengthscale. Different regimes of rapidly rotating, unmagnetized, turbulent convection exist depending on the importance of viscous and inertial forces in the dynamics, and hence different theoretical predictions for the dominant flow lengthscale have been proposed. Here we study the transition from viscously dominated to inertia‐dominated regimes using numerical simulations in spherical and planar geometries.

By 2050, they anticipate an approximate 40%–75% cut in GHG emissions, falling short of the IMO's 2050 net‐zero GHG goal. Responding experts see decarbonization occurring through three types of measures: operational, technological, and alternative energy sources. In the short‐term, decarbonization is predicted to be dominated by operational measures, while in the long‐term, it will be dominated by alternative energy, although there is no consensus on which fuels will dominate. Technological upgrades are expected to play crucial supporting roles. The experts believe that differences in business models and governance may lead to different decarbonization pathways by ship segment. The experts' qualitative responses highlight: alternative energy systems, ship fleet turnover, spillover effects from other sectors, reducing industry pessimism, and the supply chain as critical leverage points that can propel shipping toward sustainable decarbonization pathways.

 A comprehensive differential diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical care that is often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process1. Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar’s test: 45.7, P < 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar’s test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians’ diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients’ access to specialist-level expertise.

 Neural circuit function is shaped both by the cell types that comprise the circuit and the connections between them1. Neural cell types have previously been defined by morphology2,3, electrophysiology4, transcriptomic expression5,6, connectivity7–9 or a combination of such modalities10–12. The Patch-seq technique enables the characterization of morphology, electrophysiology and transcriptomic properties from individual cells13–15. These properties were integrated to define 28 inhibitory, morpho-electric-transcriptomic (MET) cell types in mouse visual cortex16, which do not include synaptic connectivity. Conversely, large-scale electron microscopy (EM) enables morphological reconstruction and a near-complete description of a neuron’s local synaptic connectivity, but does not include transcriptomic or electrophysiological information. Here, we leveraged morphological information from Patch-seq to predict the transcriptomically defined cell subclass and/or MET-type of inhibitory neurons within a large-scale EM dataset. We further analysed Martinotti cells—a somatostatin (Sst)-positive17 morphological cell type18,19—which were classified successfully into Sst MET-types with distinct axon myelination and synaptic output connectivity patterns. We demonstrate that morphological features can be used to link cell types across experimental modalities, enabling further comparison of connectivity to gene expression and electrophysiology.

 Four-wave mixing is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that can be used for wideband low-noise optical amplification and wavelength conversion. It has been extensively investigated for applications in communications1, computing2, metrology3, imaging4 and quantum optics5. With its advantages of small footprint, large nonlinearity and dispersion-engineering capability, optical integrated waveguides are excellent candidates for realizing high-gain and large-bandwidth four-wave mixing for which anomalous dispersion is a key condition. Various waveguides based on, for example, silicon, aluminium gallium arsenide and nonlinear glass have been studied6–10, but suffer from considerable gain and bandwidth reductions, as conventional design approaches for anomalous dispersion result in multi-mode operation. We present a methodology for fabricating nonlinear waveguides with simultaneous single-mode operation and anomalous dispersion for ultra-broadband operation and high-efficiency four-wave mixing. Although we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, the design approach can be used with other platforms as well. By using higher-order dispersion, we achieved unprecedented amplification bandwidths of more than 300 nm in these ultra-low-loss integrated waveguides. Penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit s−1 data in a single optical channel of over 200 nm was realized. These single-mode dispersion-engineered nonlinear waveguides could become practical building blocks in various nonlinear photonics applications.

 Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins (dsRBPs) play crucial roles in various cellular processes, especially in the innate immune response. Comprehensive characterization of dsRBPs is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms for dsRNA sensing and response. Traditional methods have predominantly relied on affinity purification, favoring the isolation of strong dsRNA binders. Here, we adopt the proteome integral solubility alteration (PISA) workflow for characterizing dsRBPs, resulting in the observation of 18 known dsRBPs and the identification of 200 potential dsRBPs. Next, we focus on zinc finger protein 385 A (ZNF385A) and discover that its knockout activates the transcription of interferon-β in the absence of immunogenic stimuli. The knockout of ZNF385A elevates the level of endogenous dsRNAs, especially transcripts associated with retroelements, such as short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), long interspersed nuclear element (LINE), and long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, loss of ZNF385A enhances the bioactivity of 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR) and tumor-killing effect of NK cells. Our findings greatly expand the dsRBP reservoir and contribute to the understanding of cellular dsRNA homeostasis. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is key in immunity and cellular regulation.

 Rangeomorphs are among the oldest anatomically complex macroscopic fossil organisms and, originating prior to 574 Ma, they represent the earliest total-group eumetazoans. Rangeomorph morphogenesis is therefore significant for understanding the early diversification of eumetazoan bodyplans. However, previous analyses of rangeomorph development have focused on uniterminal forms (possessing only one frond), leaving biterminal and multiterminal rangeomorph bodyplans poorly understood. We describe a population of the biterminal rangeomorph Fractofusus andersoni from the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve UNESCO World Heritage Site of Newfoundland, Canada, and construct a model of growth in F. andersoni that rationalises variation between Fractofusus, Charnia, Bradgatia and other rangeomorphs, providing a framework for explaining evolutionary transitions between the bodyplans of these members of the eumetazoan stem-group. Our results imply that complex developmental regulatory machinery was already being utilised during the late Ediacaran in the earliest-diverging eumetazoan taxa represented in the fossil record.

 The biotransformation of nanoparticles plays a crucial role in determining their biological fate and responses. Although a few engineering strategies (e.g., surface functionalization and shape control) have been employed to regulate the fate of nanoparticles, the genetic control of nanoparticle biotransformation remains an unexplored avenue. Herein, we utilized a CRISPR-based genome-scale knockout approach to identify genes involved in the biotransformation of rare earth oxide (REO) nanoparticles. We found that the biotransformation of REOs in lysosomes could be genetically controlled via SMPD1. Specifically, suppression of SMPD1 inhibited the transformation of La2O3 into sea urchin-shaped structures, thereby protecting against lysosomal damage, proinflammatory cytokine release, pyroptosis and RE-induced pneumoconiosis. Overall, our study provides insight into how to control the biological fate of nanomaterials.

 The dynamic three-dimensional spatial conformations of chromosomes demonstrate complex structural variations across single cells, which plays pivotal roles in modulating single-cell specific transcription and epigenetics landscapes. The high rates of missing contacts in single-cell chromatin contact maps impose significant challenges to reconstruct high-resolution spatial chromatin configurations. We develop a data-driven algorithm, Tensor-FLAMINGO, based on a low-rank tensor completion strategy. Implemented on a diverse panel of single-cell chromatin datasets, Tensor-FLAMINGO generates 10kb- and 30kb-resolution spatial chromosomal architectures across individual cells. Tensor-FLAMINGO achieves superior accuracy in reconstructing 3D chromatin structures, recovering missing contacts, and delineating cell clusters. The unprecedented high-resolution characterization of single-cell genome folding enables expanded identification of single-cell specific long-range chromatin interactions, multi-way spatial hubs, and the mechanisms of disease-associated GWAS variants.

Here, the authors report cryoEM structures of intermediate states and provide insights into phosphorylation and transmembrane signalling. 
 The regulation of polymerisation and translocation of biomolecules is fundamental. Wzc, an integral cytoplasmic membrane tyrosine autokinase protein serves as the master regulator of the biosynthesis and export of many bacterial capsular polysaccharides and exopolysaccharides. Such polysaccharides play essential roles in infection, defence, and some are important industrial products. Wzc comprises a large periplasmic domain, two transmembrane helices and a C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain with a tyrosine-rich tail. Wzc regulates polymerisation functions through cycling the formation and dissociation of an octameric complex, driven by changes in the phosphorylation status of the tyrosine-rich tail. E. coli Wzc serves a model for a wider family of polysaccharide co-polymerases. Here, we determine structures of intermediate states with different extents of phosphorylation. Structural and computational data reveal the pre-ordering of the tyrosine-rich tail, the molecular basis underlying the unidirectionality of phosphorylation events, and the underlying structural dynamics on how phosphorylation status is transmitted.

 Conjugated bile acids (BAs) are multi-functional detergents in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract produced by the liver enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) and by the microbiome from the acyltransferase activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an enrichment in both host and microbially conjugated BAs (MCBAs), but their impacts on GI inflammation are not well understood. We investigated the role of host-conjugated BAs in a mouse model of colitis using a BAAT knockout background. Baat−/− KO mice have severe phenotypes in the colitis model that were rescued by supplementation with taurocholate (TCA). Gene expression and histology showed that this rescue was due to an improved epithelial barrier integrity and goblet cell function. However, metabolomics also showed that TCA supplementation resulted in extensive metabolism to secondary BAs. We therefore investigated the BSH activity of diverse gut bacteria on a panel of conjugated BAs and found broad hydrolytic capacity depending on the bacterium and the amino acid conjugate. The complexity of this microbial BA hydrolysis led to the exploration of bsh genes in metagenomic data from human IBD patients. Certain bsh sequences were enriched in people with Crohn’s disease particularly that from Ruminococcus gnavus. This study shows that both host and microbially conjugated BAs may provide benefits to those with IBD, but this is dictated by a delicate balance between BA conjugation/deconjugation based on the bsh genes present.

Vaccine responses assessed using anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion (IgA), stool shedding of vaccine virus and vaccine take (IgA seroconversion and/or shedding). Here we report, high alpha diversity, beta diversity differences and high abundance of Bacteroides is associated with positive vaccine take and shedding following RV3-BB administered in the neonatal schedule, but not with IgA seroconversion, or in the infant schedule. Higher alpha diversity was associated with shedding after three doses of RV3-BB in the neonatal schedule compared to non-shedders, or the placebo group. High abundance of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus is associated with no shedding in the neonatal schedule group. RV3-BB vaccine administered in a neonatal schedule modulates the early microbiome environment and presents a window of opportunity to optimise protection from rotavirus disease. Here, the authors show that high alpha diversity, differences in beta diversity, and a high abundance of Bacteroides in the gut microbiome are associated with positive vaccine take and stool shedding following administration of RV3-BB vaccine in the neonatal schedule, but not in the infant schedule or placebo groups, suggesting that the early-life gut microbiome provides a gut environment that optimizes the potential for a positive vaccine response."

 Conventional lithography methods involving pattern transfer through resist templating face challenges of material compatibility with various process solvents. Other approaches of direct material writing often compromise pattern complexity and overlay accuracy. Here we explore a concept based on the Moiré interference of molecular beams to directly pattern complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces made by any evaporable materials, such as metals, oxides and organic semiconductors. Our proposed approach, termed the molecular-beam holographic lithography (MBHL), relies on precise control over angular projections of material flux passing through nanoapertures superimposed on the substrate, emulating the interference of coherent laser beams in interference lithography. Incorporating with our computational lithography (CL) algorithm, we have demonstrated self-aligned overlay of multiple material patterns to yield binary up to quinary superlattices, with a critical dimension and overlay accuracy on the order of 50 and 2 nm, respectively. The process is expected to substantially expand the boundary of materials combination for high-throughput fabrication of complex superstructures of translational symmetry on arbitrary substrates, enabling emerging nanoimaging, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.

 Climate change is altering both the duration and the rate of carbon uptake in plants, thereby affecting terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, little is known about the relative strengths of these processes or underlying mechanisms. Here, using satellite and carbon-flux data, we show that the duration and mean daily rate of carbon uptake (GPPrate) have both increased in recent decades, enhancing total GPP with a rate of ~0.56% per year during the growing season across the Northern Hemisphere. Notably, the mean daily GPPrate, driven primarily by rising CO2 concentrations and temperatures, contributed ~65% to the changes in total GPP during the growing season over time, with higher contributions in early season (~83%) compared with late season (~55%). These findings highlight the importance of vegetation physiology in driving temporal changes in terrestrial GPP and suggest that the asymmetric changes in productivity across seasons will exacerbate under ongoing climate change.

 Lake heatwaves (extreme hot water events) can substantially disrupt aquatic ecosystems. Although surface heatwaves are well studied, their vertical structures within lakes remain largely unexplored. Here we analyse the characteristics of subsurface lake heatwaves (extreme hot events occurring below the surface) using a spatiotemporal modelling framework. Our findings reveal that subsurface heatwaves are frequent, often longer lasting but less intense than surface events. Deep-water heatwaves (bottom heatwaves) have increased in frequency (7.2 days decade−1), duration (2.1 days decade−1) and intensity (0.2 °C days decade−1) over the past 40 years. Moreover, vertically compounding heatwaves, where extreme heat occurs simultaneously at the surface and bottom, have risen by 3.3 days decade−1.

 Antarctic basal melt is crucial for the future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet and ocean circulation. However, few Earth system models explicitly simulate ice-shelf cavities. Here, using an Earth system model with interactive Antarctic ice-shelf cavities, we show that regional hydrography and topography determine a cavity tipping point.

 The Antarctic landscape is one of the most stable environments on the Earth, at least since approximately 14 million years ago when most glaciers in continental Antarctica changed from temperate to cold-based, and previous extensive fluvial activity disappeared. Here, we detected a large landscape change on a coastal glacier in continental Antarctica (Boulder Clay Glacier) that occurred in the Medieval Warm Period. Such change consists in a glacial unconformity marked by a continuous sediment layer and an erosion channel on the past glacier surface. This channel, more than 4 kilometers long, represents a local deepening of a glacial unconformity that cuts the underlying glacial strata and was clearly imaged and mapped by Ground Penetrating Radar data. Four boreholes were allowed to calibrate the sediment layer so identified because it was observed in all boreholes at depths between 1.85 and 3.07 m. Moreover, the occurrence at a depth of 11.11 meters of mosses suitable for the dating through radiocarbon dating provided the age of 1050 calibrated years before the present, implying that the erosion event occurred during the Medieval Warm Period between 900 and 989 before the present.

 Fisheries’ effects on marine life have been widely acknowledged for decades, but only recently have we considered their impact on marine nutrient cycles. Through the removal of marine biomass, fisheries represent a unique and historically novel pathway for nutrients to be extracted from the sea. Here, we examined the magnitude of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus extraction by industrial fisheries through large spatiotemporal scales and broad ecological contexts. Between 1960 and 2018, industrial fisheries removed approximately 431 million tonnes of carbon, 110 million tonnes of nitrogen, and 23 million tonnes of phosphorus. Nutrient extractions occurred most intensely in highly productive regions within Exclusive Economic Zones. Additionally, >53% of all nutrient extractions occurred through the removal of mid-level trophic groups and pelagic species. Our findings indicate that fisheries can remove substantial amounts of nutrients each year and warrant further studies that consider the ecosystem-level impacts of nutrient reductions.

Globally, 436.66 million tonnes (Mt) of plastics were traded in 2022, with final products alone accounting for 111 Mt. Our findings suggest that plastics are subject to geographical concentration, with feedstocks concentrated in oil-resource rich countries and processing in countries with large manufacturing capacity. Furthermore, there is a significant shift in waste disposal: incineration is emerging as a prominent waste disposal method (34%), landfill is decreasing substantially (40%), while the global recycling rate remained stagnant (9%). Income disparities among countries diminish in the context of plastic waste imports, reshaping the global plastics trade patterns.

 The Caspian Sea is the world’s largest landlocked waterbody, providing habitat for hundreds of endemic and migratory species, along with ecosystem services that sustain millions of people. Global warming is projected to drive declines in water levels of up to 21 m by 2100. Using geospatial analyses, we assessed the impact of sea level decline on habitats, protected areas, and human infrastructure. We show that a water level decline of just 5–10 m will critically disrupt key ecosystems (including habitats for endemic Caspian seals and sturgeon), reduce existing marine protected area coverage by up to 94%, and render billions of dollars of civil and industrial infrastructure obsolete. Replacing traditional static conservation planning with a pre-emptive, dynamic approach that allows protected areas to track shifting ecosystems, is recommended to help endemic Caspian Sea biodiversity adapt to these changes, and to avoid conflicts with mitigation efforts directed at protecting human activities.

 Identifying the effectiveness of anti-leakage policies across competitiveness, demand, and energy channels is crucial for unilateral climate policy design. Here we combine a global equilibrium model and channel decomposition approach to unravel the effectiveness of anti-leakage policies—free allocation system, carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), and climate clubs—within the European Union Emissions Trading System. Free allocation (excluding power sector) and indirect emission cost aids modestly reduce carbon leakage across all channels. CBAM achieves negative leakage in competitiveness and demand channels, but increases leakage in the energy channel. Voluntary climate clubs without penalties, mainly mitigate leakage among member countries, but are less effective for non-members in the demand channel. The Buchanan club with imposing penalties on non-members, achieves the negative leakage, suggesting its potential to fully resolve leakage. However, these policies are less effective in the energy channel, potentially undermining efforts in other channels.

 Diurnal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) significantly influences ocean–atmosphere thermal interactions. Conventional numerical methods for reconstructing hourly SST are limited by high computational demands and difficulties in accommodating real-time atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Therefore, this study introduces the Physics-Assisted Reconstruction Adversarial Network (PARAN), a novel deep-learning framework that reconstructs high-resolution (2 km), hourly SST using geostationary satellite data.

We applied the PARAN framework to the Northwest Pacific region, generating a continuous, hourly subskin SST layer from January 2019 to December 2021. The network was validated against high-resolution satellite data and in situ buoy observations, demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements over existing high-resolution numerical models (GLO12v4 and HYCOM).

 Tire and road wear particles (TRWP) are an important component of non-exhaust emissions from road traffic. They are internal mixtures of tire material, road wear, brake wear, and soil minerals. In contrast to tire material analysed by bulk analytical techniques, there is little literature on the air concentrations and deposition rates of TRWP. The main purpose of our study was to determine deposition rates and air concentrations of TRWP at a motorway in Germany. TRWP were collected with passive samplers and analysed by scanning electron microscopy. Number deposition rates varied between approximately 100 particles cm−2 day−1 at 3.5 m distance and 30 particles cm−2 day−1 at 30.5 m distance from the road, and mass deposition rates between 7.8 mg m−2 day−1 and 2.8 mg m−2 day−1, respectively. Air concentrations of TRWP calculated from the mass deposition rates varied between approximately 3.8 μg/m3 (3.5 m distance) and 0.95 μg/m3 (30.5 m distance). The influence of potential particle misclassification, density of TRWP, and volume approximation on the deposition rates and air concentrations is small. Air concentrations of TRWP observed in this study are reasonably consistent with the results of previous electron microscopy studies, but are significantly higher than the values used in risk assessment. This discrepancy clearly shows that further exposure measurements are required.

 Atmospheric deposition significantly influences nutrient and chemical inputs to ecosystems, playing a crucial role in water quality and environmental management. This study utilizes long-term monitoring data spanning 43 years to evaluate changes in deposition for Dorset (a representative rural/remote area) and 27 years for Simcoe (representing a mixed-use landscape including agricultural, urban, natural and industrial areas) located along a north-south transect in south-central Ontario, east of Georgian Bay. Analysis focused on the annual deposition trends of 21 chemicals in Dorset and 12 chemicals in Simcoe, comparing changes within and between the two regions. Many consistent patterns emerged in both regions, revealing decreasing trends in nitrogen, chloride, sulphate and calcium deposition, and no significant trend in total phosphorus deposition. Metals and silica deposition, which were only measured at Dorset, also significantly declined. Notably, the magnitude and rate of these trends varied between Dorset and Simcoe. Simcoe exhibited higher deposition levels and more rapid/larger trends, attributed to its proximity to urbanization, agriculture, shipping, and industries.

 Based on vertically pointing Ka-band MMCR observation in 2020–2021, we investigate the vertical structure and diurnal and seasonal variations of cirrus clouds at a midlatitude monsoon site in central China. Statistical analysis shows that the cirrus clouds occur mostly at 7–15 km with the reflectivity of −42—7 dBZ in summer, and at 5–12 km with the reflectivity of −47— −2 dBZ in winter. From spring to winter, the maximum cirrus occurrence frequency (COF) arises at about −36, −34, −37 and −37 dBZ in the reflectivity domain, at 10.23, 12.00, 10.41, and 8.79 km in the spatial dimension, and at −46, −52, −39 and −43 °C in the temperature domain, respectively. In both the spatial and temperature domains, the COF distribution is approximately consistent with the Gaussian distribution. The seasonal mean ice water content (ice effective radius) is mainly distributed in 1×10‐3-7×10‐3gm−3 (34–46 μm). There is an obvious diurnal change in the cirrus activities. In summer, the COF is relatively small from 5:00 to 12:00, and reaches the maximum at about 20:00, while in autumn, the cirrus clouds are rare between 4:00 and 14:00, and have a significant COF from 19:00 to 24:00. The COF reaches the maximum of 20.03 % in July in 2020 but only 16.16 % in June in 2021. In 2020, the monthly mean cloud base and top heights show a first increase and then decrease, whereas, their evolution exhibits large fluctuations in 2021. The COF has a correlation coefficient of 0.61 with oceanic Niño index (ONI), and the difference of cirrus clouds between 2020 and 2021 is closely associated with the ONI evolution."

In this work, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β cell identity after the loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders."

Although translation- and transcription-related genes often cluster near the origin of replication, the extent of positional biases across gene families remains unclear. We hypothesized that natural selection broadly favors specific chromosomal positions to optimize growth rate–dependent expression. Analyzing 910 bacterial species and proteomics data fromEscherichia coliandBacillus subtilis, we found that about two-thirds of bacterial gene families are positionally biased. Natural selection drives genes mainly toward the origin or terminus of replication, with the strongest selection in fast-growing species. Our findings reveal chromosomal positioning as a fundamental mechanism for coordinating gene expression with growth rate, highlighting evolutionary constraints on bacterial genome architecture."

Using laboratory- and field-based experiments across multiple years in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar;n= 730), we show that the globally detected anxiolytic pollutant clobazam accumulates in the brain of exposed fish and influences river-to-sea migration success. Clobazam exposure increased the speed with which fish passed through two hydropower dams along their migration route, resulting in more clobazam-exposed fish reaching the sea compared with controls. We argue that such effects may arise from altered shoaling behavior in fish exposed to clobazam. Drug-induced behavioral changes are expected to have wide-ranging consequences for the ecology and evolution of wild populations."

How activated T cells receive the paracrine signals required for their differentiation once they have disengaged from DCs and resumed their migration has been unclear. We identified a distinct priming phase that favors CD8 T cells expressing receptors with high affinity for antigen. CXCR3 expression by CD8 T cells was required for their hours-long reengagement with DCs in specific subfollicular niches in lymph nodes. CD4 T cells paused briefly at the sites of CD8 T cell and DC interactions and provided Interleukin-2 (IL-2) before moving to another DC.

Larger birth canals were linked to slower walking pace and reduced back pain but increased hip osteoarthritis risk, whereas narrower birth canals were associated with reduced pelvic floor disorder risk but increased obstructed labor risk. Lastly, genetic correlation between birth canal and head widths provides evidence of coevolution between the human pelvis and brain, partially mitigating the dilemma."

First, condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. Second, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion as sisters separate. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II, and condensin I alone or in combination lead to refined models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase, loops are extruded in vivo at ∼1 to 3 kilobases per second by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids."

Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction.

Patients with cachexia experience extreme fatigue, apathy, and clinical depression, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these behavioral symptoms and their relationship to the disease remain unclear. In a mouse cancer model, cachexia specifically induced increased effort-sensitivity, apathy-like symptoms through a cytokine-sensing brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit. This neural circuit detects elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at cachexia onset and translates inflammatory signals into decreased mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity. We alleviated these apathy-like symptoms by targeting key circuit nodes: administering an anti–IL-6 antibody treatment, ablating cytokine sensing in the brainstem, and optogenetically or pharmacologically boosting mesolimbic dopamine. Our findings uncovered a central neural circuit that senses systemic inflammation and orchestrates behavioral changes, providing mechanistic insights into the connection between chronic inflammation and depressive symptoms."

We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo–electron microscopy analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering itsN-myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate production on membranes.

N-footprint tools offer a valuable method for predicting Nr emissions, helping to identify leakage points across the entire production chain, from farm to plate. This study estimates the N-footprint of an average Danish individual based on population-based consumption patterns. The results indicate an annual N-footprint of 27.5 kg N cap−1 yr−1. Food production and consumption account for 82% of the N-footprint, with agricultural production and consumption at 22.7 Kg N cap−1 yr−1. Goods and services constitute 12% of the footprint (3.2 kg N cap−1 yr−1), followed by transport at 4% (1.1 kg N cap−1 yr−1) and housing at 2% (0.5 kg N cap−1 yr−1). Denmark has implemented extensive environmental policies that have successfully mitigated part of the Nr load to the environment. While top–down regulatory frameworks play a crucial role, this study emphasizes the significance of individual agency in shaping consumption patterns and reducing Nr emissions. A holistic approach to Nr management is essential, integrating stringent regulations with community-driven initiatives. The study highlights three key abatement strategies for Denmark: (1) shifting Danish meat and meat derived consumption (71% of the diet) towards more plant-based alternatives, (2) improving nitrogen use efficiency at the farm gate level and (3) reducing waste and enhancing recycling throughout the entire farm-to-plate supply chain.

The impact of forest degradation on the forest’s sensitivity to climate extremes has not been fully explored because of a lack of data and the complex interplay of forest structure and climate drivers. Here, we combined forest structure data from 545 airborne lidar transects (375 ha each) across the Brazilian Amazon with the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED2). We explore the forest’s functional response to near-present (1981–2019) climate extremes under observed forest structure from lidar (Control) and two forest structure change scenarios: (1) forest recovery by excluding all future deforestation and degradation (Recovery) and (2) expansion of selective logging and deforestation (Degradation). Using the Control simulation, we found a close and positive association between local forest aboveground biomass and the predicted gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Moreover, both GPP and ET respond negatively to extremes in vapor pressure deficit and downwelling shortwave irradiance in degraded forests in Eastern and Southern Amazon, indicating high sensitivity to droughts. Locally high-biomass forest patches showed little or no negative response of GPP and ET to extreme drought conditions whereas low-biomass forest patches in the same locations—typically degraded forest canopies—responded negatively to higher moisture stress. The results from the Recovery scenario showed similar results to simulations with observed structure; however, under the Degradation scenario, low-biomass forest patches became more abundant, resulting in more regions where GPP and ET are negatively impacted by hot drought conditions according to the ED2 model. Our results suggest that local forest structure is a critical determinant of an ecosystem’s response to climate variability, and that the loss of canopy trees in the Amazon through forest degradation could increase and expand forest vulnerability to droughts."

In this study, we evaluate the influence of decadal-scale climate change on the net primary production (NPP) in the SNP by performing a hindcast experiment for 1979–2016 using an ice–ocean coupled model with a simple biogeochemical model with iron cycle. Simulation results show a significant NPP decrease in the subtropical–subarctic gyre boundary (SGB) region since the 1990s; the trend is −48 mgC m−2 d−1/37 years with a magnitude that is 14.3% of the climatological mean NPP. The NPP decrease in the SGB is prominent during the spring, indicating weakening of the spring bloom. Diagnostic analysis of simulation data reveals that the NPP decrease in the SGB can be explained by the decrease in both dFe and light availability. Sensitivity experiments indicate that wind-driven circulation change mainly explains both the reduction in dFe and the light availability through the northward expansion of oligotrophic subtropical water, but the thermohaline change in the Sea of Okhotsk also has a non-negligible effect on the dFe reduction. Results from our numerical model simulations suggest the importance of lateral and vertical advection of dFe on the decadal-scale changes of NPP in the SNP."

Reliance on rudimentary and inefficient biomass cookstoves results in high pollutant concentrations that adversely affect the health of those exposed to indoor air pollution, the environment, and the climate. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature on aerosol and particle properties from biomass cookstoves of relevance to health, climate and the environment. We identified 187 articles reporting aerosol characterization (i.e. particulate mass or number concentrations, or particle size distributions). Of these, 82 presented detailed particle characterization (e.g. chemical composition), thus selected for further analysis. Articles were classified based on the reported particle properties and the study type and location, which allowed mapping research efforts to date and identifying major knowledge gaps. Most reviewed studies (39 articles) on particle properties reported particulate organic and elemental carbon composition. Despite considerable variability, the EC/TC ratio generally varied in the range of 0.1–0.4 for all cookstove technologies, indicating that organic carbon is the dominating PM fraction in biomass cookstove emissions. Findings from this systematic review highlight the need for further studies on particle properties from biomass cookstoves that use a multidimensional approach simultaneously combining several properties and different cookstove-fuel combinations. We also assessed the policy landscape, including the three main global policies concerning biomass cookstove emissions, and evaluated whether those policies included the state of the knowledge on particle properties and their adverse effects on human health, climate, and the environment. We finally identify key aspects that future policies should integrate, and critical knowledge gaps that must be filled to advance the overall development of the field. Notable was that field studies consistently report particle emission factors (PM2.5) higher than the ones determined under laboratory conditions, for example, an average of 8.9 g/kgfuel (field) compared to 5.2 g/kgfuel (lab) for traditional cookstoves and 4.0 g/kgfuel (field) compared to 1.3 g/kgfuel (lab) for advanced cookstoves. Cookstove manufacturers, practitioners, policymakers, and society in general will benefit from a solid knowledge base regarding particle properties from biomass cookstoves and their related adverse effects on human health, climate, and the environment."

Using an air-sea-wave coupled model, we evaluate changes due to sea spray effects in the simulated intensity and structure of Typhoons Lingling (2019) and Maysak (2020). Enabling sea spray effect enhances surface turbulent heat fluxes considerably around the typhoon centers (74% increase for Lingling, 92% for Maysak), leading to a better representation of typhoon intensification phases. Analysis of thermodynamic processes reveals that sea spray-induced warming emerges before rapid intensification, with enhanced temperature and moisture profiles throughout the troposphere supporting stronger secondary circulation. As a result, key aspects of typhoon prediction exhibit significant improvements: root-mean-squared errors decreased by 63% in minimum central pressure and 60% for maximum wind speed in the case of Maysak. The results demonstrate that sea spray effects are strongly modulated by sub-surface ocean conditions, with a greater surface heat flux enhancement for Maysak that moved along warmer Kuroshio and Tsushima currents than for Lingling which passed over Yellow Sea Bottom Cold Water.

However, gaps exist in our understanding of the responses and feedbacks of the Earth system to the deployment of CDR. In this study, we compare two complementary approaches that enhance the terrestrial and marine carbon sinks with afforestation and reforestation (A/R) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), respectively, under the high emission scenario SSP5-8.5. Eight CMIP6 Earth system models are utilized, enabling a quantification of both inter-model and internal variability. By mid-century, simulated large-scale deployment of A/R and OAE individually reduces atmospheric CO2 concentrations by up to 20 ppm. For both methods, while carbon removal from the atmosphere is robust, it is difficult to detect the effects on global mean temperature, posing challenges for monitoring, reporting and verification of mitigation efforts. To quantify the carbon cycle feedbacks, we define the carbon cycle feedback ratio of A/R (OAE) as the ratio of changes in the marine (terrestrial) sink to changes in the terrestrial (marine) sink. We show that the carbon cycle feedback ratios of A/R and OAE have similar magnitudes, which are −16% and −13%, respectively. Moreover, although inter-model differences of the simulated amounts of carbon removal due to A/R are large, the corresponding carbon cycle feedback ratios of A/R are similar."

As global demand for critical minerals accelerates in association with the energy transition, there is a growing imperative to secure mineral access while improving environmental and social outcomes. However, mining activities face significant resistance worldwide, posing major challenges to the justice and viability of the energy transition. Using an original dataset derived from the GDELT Project between 2015 and 2022, we provide the first systematic global mapping of conflict and cooperation in mining regions, spanning diverse socio-political contexts and offering novel insights into the economic, environmental, and justice-related drivers of these dynamics. Our findings reveal that resistance to mineral extraction is not confined to poorer, emerging economies but is instead widespread, occurring wherever mineral deposits are found, regardless of a country’s income level. This resistance frequently reaches high levels of polarisation, often leading to costly delays and project cancellations. Although cooperation sometimes accompanies conflict, high-commitment cooperative actions are limited and less frequent in highly polarised situations. These insights highlight the need to move beyond traditional Corporate Social Responsibility approaches and existing public participation efforts within Environmental Impact Assessments. A just, sustainable, and democratic transition requires a deeper democratisation of investment decisions through inclusive governance frameworks that tackle the several injustices associated with mineral resource extraction."

Regionally, the association between floods and their driving factors/descriptors is complex. This necessitates a deeper understanding of flood generation to enhance forecasting, modeling, and risk analyses—critical aspects of effective flood management. Thus, to better understand flood generation in India, we investigate the dominant flood-generating descriptors and their relationship with watershed characteristics across central and southern peninsular India using circular statistics. We find that flood generation is primarily influenced by soil moisture and precipitation excess, dominating 89% of the analyzed (231) watersheds. In particular, larger watersheds (>70000 km2) are predominantly influenced by soil moisture, while smaller ones (<16000 km2) are influenced by precipitation. Interestingly, watersheds covering similar areas produce higher flood flows if predominantly influenced by soil moisture. The explicit evaluation suggests a positive influence of antecedent soil moisture (ASM) on flood flows across all watersheds. An attempt to relate the morphological characteristics with flood descriptors reveals a positive (negative) influence of the topographic wetness index (TWI) on annual maximum flows for soil moisture-dominated (precipitation-dominated) watersheds. This indicates that ponding/accumulation is a driving (limiting) factor for soil moisture (precipitation) dominated watersheds. The relative importance of the ASM compared to precipitation decreases when the precipitation intensity (PI) increases, implying exchanges of influence at certain levels of PI. Further exploration could reveal insights into the interplay between ASM and precipitation, crucial for flood magnitude and hazard assessments. Given that flood behavior is significantly influenced by dominant descriptors, it is advisable to adopt a segregated approach in analyzing flood escalation under climate change. In addition, incorporation of dominant flood descriptors into cascade flood modeling is essential for enhancing flood hazard and risk modeling."

Under continued global warming, snow droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense, which likely increases the occurrence of succeeding streamflow droughts. However, we still know little about the rate at which snow droughts propagate to subsequent streamflow droughts, the spatial patterns of these concurrent events, the influence of snow drought characteristics on the occurrence, deficit, and duration of streamflow droughts, and temporal changes in snow drought propagation. To address these research gaps, we developed a novel dynamic bi-directional snow-to-streamflow drought propagation scheme, that resulted in a unique dataset of concurrent snow and streamflow droughts for 207 catchments in Switzerland and Austria. We found that in the period from 1961 to 2020, 18% of the snow droughts propagated to a streamflow drought, and that 21% of the spring/summer streamflow droughts were preceded by a snow drought. Snow-to-streamflow droughts are most common in catchments at high elevations without glaciers and among the snow droughts with the largest deficits and longest durations. In general, snow droughts lead to streamflow droughts with higher deficits, longer durations, and earlier occurrences. In the last six decades, the number of snow droughts has increased, which resulted in a doubling of snow-to-streamflow drought events in 1991–2020 compared to 1961–1990. As snow droughts are expected to further increase due to climate change, the propagation of snow-to-streamflow droughts will likely increase in medium to high elevation catchments and lead to more frequent and intense spring and summer droughts in the Alps."

The experimental results show that (1) SRNs can significantly improve correlation with real-time and calibrated radar observations over GRN; (2) an SRN consisting of 700 SRGs whose estimation accuracy is higher than 80% or 500 SRGs whose estimation is accuracy higher than 90% could achieve a comparable precision performance to that of GRN; (3) as the number of SRGs reaches 900 (the spatial density of SRGs is about 0.47 per km2), the performance of the SRNs tend to be stable. Although increasing the number of cameras helps alleviate the problem of insufficient accuracy of a single SRG during heavy/violent rainfall, excessive cameras may reduce the accuracy due to the inherent measurement errors of SRG. Therefore, developing a robust SRG filtering strategy to find the optimal number of SRGs is essential. Our research provides an important reference for researchers who are holding a sceptical view of the availability of surveillance camera rainfall networks while shedding light on building a new low-cost and high-resolution SRN based on the existing surveillance camera resources."

Ultimately, the structure evolved into the more familiar concentric eyewall (CE). Our findings indicate that the transition from an eccentric to a CE structure in Doksuri (2023) coincided with its preceding weakening stage and subsequent rapid intensification (RI) stage, facilitated by a favorable large-scale environmental context over the South China Sea. Unlike previous observations, this RI involved the simultaneous strengthening of both eyewalls rather than a typical eyewall replacement cycle. Simultaneously, the vortex centers in the upper, middle, and lower troposphere showed counterclockwise rotation and gradually aligned vertically, providing evidence of enhanced tropical cyclone (TC) vortex axisymmetry.

The socio-environmental impacts of resource extraction in the Global South to support the low-carbon energy transition in the Global North represent a significant blind-spot in mainstream North-centric climate mitigation frameworks and discourses of just transition. Scholarship on environmental justice (EJ) offers a conceptual entry into this terrain, helping to unpack the unequal spatial distribution of hazards created by the boom in critical minerals required for ‘clean energy’ initiatives. We first illustrate this problem using the concepts of distributive and procedural (in)justices and empirical work on Indonesia’s nickel extraction and processing sectors which are growing to feed a corresponding global rise in electric vehicles. Secondly, we draw on fieldwork with communities in Morowali and Weda Bay region of Indonesia to examine ways communities negotiate justice and adapt to live under extractivism. We propose a justice concept that is centred on the lived experiences of communities, that goes beyond the binary frameworks of ‘community resistance versus compliance’ in the EJ literature."

Despite fire being a known disturbance agent in this ecosystem, little is known about the frequency and trends in these high-elevation landscapes. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a novel burned area database, the Paramo Fire Atlas, spanning from 1985 to 2022 at 30 m resolution, quantifying the fire’s impacts on the Paramo ecosystem across Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. Using the complete Landsat archive, our database reveals that approximately 6370 km2 has been affected by fires over 37 years, representing 15% of the total paramo area. Comparing these findings with estimates from the widely used MODIS MCD64 burned area product, we found that MODIS detected only 989 km2 of burned area. This represents only one-fourth of the burned area detected by the Paramo Fire Atlas. This significant underestimation by MODIS underscores the limitations of existing data sources in assessing the fire impacts of this complex ecosystem. Contrary to the prevailing notion of increasing fire frequency, our analysis shows a significant decrease in burnt areas across the Colombia paramos, contrasting with heterogeneous trends observed in Ecuador and Peru and a recent peak in fire occurrence in Venezuela. While fires have largely disappeared from certain paramos, others exhibit varying degrees of change. These findings raise important questions about the role of fire disturbances in shaping the ecological functioning of the paramo and the future dynamics of fire in the paramo ecosystem under ongoing global climate change and socio-economical dynamics."

At the local scale, climate regulating functions are co-determined by land cover composition and configuration, i.e. the proportions and the spatial arrangement of land cover types. However, research on the relationship between LULCC and climate often focuses individually either on compositional or configurational aspects. As a result, there is a gap in our knowledge about the spatiotemporal distribution of land cover composition and configuration patterns influencing the local climate regulating functions. Here, we used a range of LULCC metrics between 1992 and 2015 and applied Self-Organizing Maps to characterize dominant land cover composition and configuration trajectories in Europe. We then tested the climate relevance of the five most dominant trajectories with a high-resolution regional climate model. Land cover composition and configuration simultaneously changed in more than 20% of the European landmass, with cropland transition to forest patches and bare soil representing the major trajectory. Climate model simulations predict a general increase in the topsoil temperature due to only changes in land cover composition and configuration. All trajectories showed increasing topsoil temperature variability during the crop growing season, with forest transition trajectories showing a greater increase. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of changes in both land cover composition and configuration for the local climate and warrant further empirical and model-based research with an explicit focus on quantifying the effects of simultaneous changes in both these LULCC dimensions."

The extent and spatial distribution of AR differ substantially between the CMIP6 models ranging from −197 to 363 Mha of tree cover change by 2100 in the low-emission scenario SSP1-2.6 that has the highest AR among all future scenarios. The variability in simulated tree cover distributions, in combination with different representations of the carbon cycle, causes a high uncertainty in future land carbon uptake. Here, we disentangle the input information used to represent AR by CMIP6 models and differences in the carbon uptake process to explain the variable simulated potential of carbon sequestration due to AR. We provide recommendations on how AR might be implemented more consistently in future model intercomparison studies, especially regarding more consistent tree cover input (e.g. aligning present-day tree cover, consistent transition between land use and land cover types), and carbon-cycle-related processes (e.g. nitrogen cycle and disturbances).

CB underwent significant photooxidation during 15 days of light irradiation, although phototransformation was generally completed by day 7. Algal growth inhibition induced by phototransformed CB (TCB) at 1 mg/L was 64.1% greater than that induced by parent CB. Mechanistically, 1) phototransformation triggered the release of highly toxic byproducts, which inhibited algal growth by 18.9%; 2) metabolomic results demonstrate that the suppression of carbon and nitrogen assimilation in algal cells induced by TCB was 13.2–53.7% greater than that induced by CB; 3) TCB exhibited reactive oxygen species production ability, which triggered more significant algal membrane damage. A full-factorial experiment (26+1 runs) showed that the combined effect of temperature and suspended mineral particles, as well as electrical conductivity, was the primary environmental factor that mediated CB and TCB toxicity, respectively.

However, recent studies reveal inhibitory effects, sparking debates about their overall impact. We hypothesized that the physical contact between bacteria and carbon is an overlooked yet critical factor in determining whether carbon promotes or inhibits microbial Fe(III) reduction. Using systems containing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, activated carbon, and ferrihydrite, we investigated how carbon–iron oxide aggregate structure affects Fe(III) reduction kinetics. At low activated carbon-to-iron oxide ratios (C/Fe = 5:7 by mass), ferrihydrite aggregated with carbon, forming carbon-encapsulated particles that suppressed Fe(III) reduction rates. Conversely, at higher ratios (C/Fe = 100:7), the ferrihydrite dispersed on the carbon surface, enhancing both the rate and extent of Fe(III) reduction. Tests with 11 different carbonaceous materials (activated carbon and biochar) all confirmed that the microstructure of iron oxides─whether encapsulating or dispersed─on carbon surfaces is critical for determining Fe(III) reduction rates.

An innovative strategy to selectively generate Fe(IV) using the Fe(VI)-initiated system was proposed, enabling an in-depth investigation of the interaction between Fe(IV) and pyrophosphate. The results reveal that pyrophosphate strongly inhibits Fe(V) oxidation, while it has minimal impact on the reactivity of Fe(VI) and Fe(IV). Based on ligand field theory, pyrophosphate complexation can induce iron 3d orbital resplitting, leading to spin electron rearrangement. Specifically, the hexa-coordinated Fe(V)-oxo complex ligated by pyrophosphate exhibits higher orbital energy, reducing its stability and effective collisions with contaminants, whereas, the potential Jahn–Teller distortion of the Fe(IV)-oxo complex could enhance its stability and preserve its significant reactivity. Given its selective inhibition of Fe(V) oxidation, pyrophosphate can emerge as a promising targeted quenching agent for Fe(V) species.

Consequently, measured changes in oxygen or Apparent Oxygen Utilization overestimate respiration by a factor of up to two, as do derived biogeochemical quantities such as remineralized carbon. Measured nitrate changes either overestimate or underestimate remineralization depending on surrounding concentrations. Mean true respiration rates in mode waters range from −0.1 to −0.4 μ ${\upmu }$mol kg−1yr−1 ${\text{kg}}^{-1}{\text{yr}}^{-1}$.

The associated severe snowfall can cause adverse effects on the social, economic, and ecological well‐being in the affected areas. Therefore, understanding the changes of JPCZ and its associated snowfall under warmer climate conditions is of high importance. In the present study, pseudo global warming (PGW) experiments, considering the 2050s under SSP5‐8.5 scenario, were carried out to evaluate these thermodynamic and dynamic changes. The amount of PGW experiment‐simulated snowfall in 13 historical cases during 2015–2024 were in good agreement with ground observations. Warmer climate conditions can potentially reduce the amount of heavy snowfall as statistically supported by the t test, though increase the rainfall mainly due to the shift in hydrometeors in the convective zone. On the other hand, total precipitation does not significantly change, likely due to almost no changes in the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes. Further, dynamic changes are not significant as the position of the convergence zone seems not to be different between PGW and historical climate, though local shifts in the convergence zone were simulated probably due to the changes in the geopotential fields and perturbed wind velocity in the lateral boundary. Our study shows that thermodynamic changes of the JPCZ can be significant, and it has the potential to change the ratio of snowfall within the total precipitation from 57.7% under historical condition to 34.7% under warmer climates."

The initial mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that seeded both disturbances formed near the Panama Bight and developed into EWs near the Papagayo jet exit region. In the MCS stage, both disturbances were characterized by top‐heavy vertical motions and midlevel vorticity near the maximum vorticity center. The deep convection caused strong latent heating and eddy available potential energy (EAPE) generation and conversion to eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the upper levels. When the disturbances moved to the south of the Papagayo jet, they interacted with the low‐level shear vorticity there, enhancing low‐level stretching and vorticity. Subsequently, the top‐heavy upward motion intensified and led to enhanced stretching and vorticity intensification at midlevels. The enhanced stretching on the southwest side also favored the formation of southwest‐northeast tilted vorticity at midlevels that characterizes EWs. After the EWs formed near the jet exit, the vertical motion weakened and became more bottom‐heavy, with the maximum vorticity shifting to lower levels. This change in the vertical motion profile near the jet exit region is likely modulated by the lower sea surface temperature, reduced moisture, and weaker convective instability. While EAPE‐to‐EKE conversion weakened during this period, the low‐level barotropic conversion of EKE in the jet exit served as the primary energy source for the EWs."

In this study, a deep analysis by using the original sigmoid generalized complementary equation and its modified version by introducing soil moisture content were applied on 24 eddy flux sites located in the Mediterranean climates. We found that (a) the performance of the generalized complementary relationship is inferior at most of the sites in the Mediterranean climates, which results in low accuracy on E estimation with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.06 ± 5.62 W m−2; (b) rescaling the complementary function with surface moisture information can substantially reduce the simulation biases with MAE decreases by 26%; and (c) the modification works well in most of the ecosystem types with the MAE decreases from 24% to 48% except in the forests. The results indicate that when precipitation and heat conditions are not synchronized (i.e., in the Mediterranean climate), the original complementarity principle cannot provide a reasonable explanation for the real world. It is necessary to introduce certain surface information into the complementary framework reasonably to improve the accuracy of evaporation simulation."

Here the authors report that autophagy is induced during grafting, promoting callus formation and contributing to tissue connectivity. 
 Grafting is an agricultural technique that joins tissues from different plants to obtain useful rootstock traits. However, cellular processes involved in joint tissue repair remain poorly understood. We analyzed Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) and Arabidopsis thaliana (At) interfamily heterografting as a high-stress model and At homografting as a low-stress model. Transmission electron micrographs reveal the formation of autophagic structures in cells near the graft boundary over a long period in Nb/At interfamily grafts and in a short period of a few days in At homografts. Using a GFP-ATG8 marker line, the autophagosomes were observed in the cells near the graft boundary, especially on the scion side, where nutrient depletion occurred. Grafting of At autophagy-defective mutants decreases grafting success rates and post-grafting growth. NbATG5 knockdown suppresses graft establishment in Nb/At interfamily heterografts. Moreover, At autophagy-defective mutants show reduced callus formation directed to wounds under the nutrient-deficient conditions. These results suggest that autophagy is induced during grafting, promoting callus formation and contributing to tissue connectivity.

 Complement component C3 mediates pathology in CNS neurodegenerative diseases. Here we use scRNAseq of sorted C3-reporter positive cells from mouse brain and optic nerve to characterize C3 producing glia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model in which peripheral immune cells infiltrate the CNS, causing reactive gliosis and neuro-axonal pathology. We find that C3 expression in the early inflammatory stage of EAE defines disease-associated glial subtypes characterized by increased expression of genes associated with mTOR activation and cell metabolism. This pro-inflammatory subtype is abrogated with genetic C3 depletion, a finding confirmed with proteomic analyses. In addition, early optic nerve axonal injury and retinal ganglion cell oxidative stress, but not loss of post-synaptic density protein 95, are ameliorated by selective deletion of C3 in myeloid cells. These data suggest that in addition to C3b opsonization of post synaptic proteins leading to neuronal demise, C3 activation is a contributor to reactive glia in the optic nerve.

Here an optimized current collector interphase enables unprecedented cyclability and energy density. 
 Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems. However, their widespread application is hindered by the low energy density and high cost of hard carbon anodes. Anode-free designs offer a potential solution but typically suffer from poor cycling performance due to uncontrolled Na plating and inefficient stripping. Here we report a hard-carbon-derived interphase on an aluminium current collector to construct an anode-less sodium battery (ALSB) that maintains high energy density, reduces costs and enhances cycling stability. Remarkably, the interphase layer with a low dielectric constant and strong Na interaction enables homogeneous Na nucleation, crack-free plating and efficient stripping, thereby minimizing active Na loss during cycling. As a result, our ALSB maintains good stability for up to 900 cycles and 2.3-Ah-level ALSBs show an energy density of 203 Wh kg−1. Our findings pave the way for more sustainable batteries with competitive energy density, extended cycle life and lower costs.

 Fluid-flux melting is increasingly recognised as a key mechanism for continental crust growth and recycling, but the abundance and sources of the external fluids involved in this process are typically uncertain. Here we use zircon and garnet oxygen isotope data, geochronology, and petrological analysis of mid- to lower-crustal rocks from the Georgetown Inlier, Australia, to explore the composition and origin of anatexis-triggering fluids. Tonalite veins and garnetite residues show higher zircon δ18O values (~6‰) than their amphibolite source (~2–3‰), whereas sediment-derived granites show lower values (6‰) than those of typical siliciclastic sources (10–20‰). Mass balance modelling suggests that these isotopic shifts result from the interaction with mantle-derived fluids. Asthenospheric mantle upwelling beneath the Georgetown crust during slab rollback or break-off provided heat and fluids, generating hydrous mafic underplates that exsolved mantle-derived water, promoting crustal anatexis. This process may have been key in shaping Earth’s early buoyant sodic continental crust.

 Remotely-sensed vegetation greenness exhibits obvious differences before and after the short-term heavy rainfall event. This short communication reports that residual water film on the canopy caused by precipitation directly affects the spectral signal of vegetation, which in turn biases observed vegetation greenness. We combined ground measurements, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measurements, three-dimensional radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations, and satellite observations to assess this phenomenon and investigate the impact of water film on vegetation indices (VIs) across different scales and vegetation types. Our findings demonstrate that precipitation exerts a quick and significant influence on the spectral characteristics of canopy components. The presence of water can lead to reflectance attenuation in soil and vegetation components across the entire visible and infrared spectrum, particularly in the near-infrared (NIR) band, with reductions of up to 0.12. The reduction in VI measures after precipitation can be explained by an imbalance in the magnitude of visible and NIR reflectance attenuation caused by the canopy water film. Taking the difference vegetation index (DVI) as an example, the decrease in NIR reflectance is more pronounced than that of red reflectance in the presence of water, resulting in DVI decreasing after a rainfall event. Satellite observations indicated that NDVI and EVI could decrease even exceeding 0.3 in some pixels after short-term rainfall. This work reveals the water film as a possible factor contributing to the bias between true and observed vegetation greenness. The spatial distribution of rainfall seasonality exhibits variation across different regions worldwide, and mitigating the impact of water film on vegetation greenness is essential for enhancing the precision and reliability of global vegetation dynamics monitoring."

Additionally, comparison of the latter with coinciding velocity fields from a Delft3D Flexible Mesh (FM) numerical model simulation shows good quantitative agreement in regions with high suspended sediment concentration.

 Under global warming, the Yellow River Basin (YRB), serving as an ecological barrier and climate-sensitive region in northern China, faces severe challenges such as frequent extreme droughts and floods, as well as intensifying water resource supply–demand conflicts. To systematically assess the evolution of droughts and floods in the YRB, this study utilizes observational data from 137 meteorological stations and CMIP6 scenario models, employing the dual-index system of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to quantitatively analyze historical drought and flood characteristics, and project future trends under different scenarios. The results indicate that both SPI and SPEI effectively identify drought and flood events, with SPEI demonstrating superior sensitivity to extreme droughts and floods due to its integration of evapotranspiration effects. From 1956 to 2020, the basin’s drought index increased at a rate of 0.003–0.025 per decade, while the flood index changed at a rate of −0.006–0.039 per decade. Droughts were frequent in the middle and upper reaches (30.61 % severe droughts), while flood risks were prominent in the lower reaches (6.25 % extreme floods). Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, drought-dominated patterns intensified (severe droughts reaching 62.92 %), and extreme floods showed an increasing trend in the middle and lower reaches. Therefore, the middle and upper reaches should prioritize building drought-resilience systems; the southern and lower reaches should enhance flood-defense infrastructure. Reservoir operations should be optimized using 1–6 months of drought and flood warnings and coupled with groundwater replenishment strategies for 12–24 months of drought cycles."

 Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an important hydrological variable for agricultural planning and water resources management. The Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 4 (SMAP L4) data demonstrates great value in RZSM estimation. Accurate sub-seasonal RZSM prediction based on SMAP L4 holds great significance for agricultural management and drought assessment. Current deep learning-based RZSM prediction models tend to accumulate error in long-term forecasting and the limited SMAP RZSM samples may result in insufficient model generalization. To address these issues, this study proposes a multi-head self-attention-based autoregressive transfer learning model based on long short-term memory (MAATL) model for sub-seasonal RZSM prediction. The proposed MAATL model is evaluated over the Continental United States (CONUS) for 1- to 60-day RZSM prediction and compared with some ablation and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The results showed that compared with LSTM, the skills of the MAATL model were significantly improved, with an average correlation coefficient increase of 18.26% and a root mean square error (RMSE) reduction of 42.55%. Furthermore, 118 in-situ soil moisture stations are used for predictive validation and the proposed MAATL model demonstrates higher accuracy compared to the Global Forecast System (GFS) and the LSTM model, with an average correlation skill improvement of 16.02% and 15.08% for MAATL over GFS and LSTM, respectively. These findings indicate superior performance for the proposed MAATL model in sub-seasonal RZSM prediction, which has great potential for agricultural drought preparations."

 High-resolution land cover (LC) data are essential for ecological monitoring and resource management, especially in heterogeneous landscapes containing diverse LC types. With the growing of available LC products, a comprehensive evaluation of their classification accuracy and spatial consistency is important for users’ selection and application. In this study, we compared eight widely used LC products in China, including ESA World Cover (ESA20), ESRI GLC10 (ESRI17, ESRI20), FROM-GLC10 (FROM-GLC17), CLCD (CLCD20), GlobeLand30 (GLB20), GLC_FCS30 (GLC_FCS20), and GLC_FCSD30 (GLC_FCSD20), to examine their performances at both national and regional scales. We employed pixel-wise overlay analysis, visually interpreted validation samples, and classical landscape metrics to assess overall consistency and classification accuracy. The results show that the 30m_combination (CLCD20, GLB20, GLC_FCS20, and GLC_FCSD20) exhibits higher overall consistency at the national scale, with perfect consistency exceeding 60 %. In contrast, the 10m_combination (ESA20, ESRI17, ESRI20, and FROM_GLC17) captures finer regional details but displays greater inconsistencies in central and western regions. ESA20 achieves the highest overall accuracy (OA) at 88.5 % (CI: 88.44 %–88.56 %), while FROM_GLC17 records the lowest at 82.79 % (CI: 82.73 %–82.85 %). Cropland, forest, water, and snow/ice demonstrate higher consistency and classification accuracy (F1-scores > 80 %), whereas wetland, grassland, impervious surfaces, and bare land underperform in fragmented regions. Furthermore, spatial consistency is strongly associated with landscape metrics such as the aggregation index (AI) and contagion (CONTAG), which enhance consistency in large, contiguous patches (e.g., Northeast China Plain). Conversely, edge density (ED) and patch density (PD) show negative associations with consistency, highlighting persistent mapping challenges in fragmented regions (e.g., Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau). These findings offer actionable insights for improving LC mapping in complex terrains and underscore the critical role of landscape metrics in advancing ecological monitoring and resource management."

 Reservoirs play a significant role in the mobilization of water resources in Burkina Faso, contributing to the management and availability of water for various purposes. Operational management of reservoirs requires accurate and timely water level information, which remote sensing can provide cost-effectively and with limited resources. In this study, the surface area of 20 reservoirs is first determined using a Random Forest classifier and Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2015 and 2022. The accuracy of the classified surface water areas is evaluated by calculating 5 accuracy assessment metrics. The classifications were validated using manually digitized water areas from high-resolution Google Earth images and compared to the Dynamic World (DW) land cover dataset. Afterward, the spatial variation in the areal extent of the reservoirs is analyzed over time. A linear relationship is established between the estimated surface area and the corresponding observed water level of the reservoirs. The results indicate that reservoir surface areas were accurately classified with Sentinel-2 images (Kappa above 90.35%) for all dates. Moreover, validation with high-resolution images provided an R2 of 0.99 and a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 3.53%. Smaller reservoirs exhibit significant variations in surface areas over time as compared to larger ones, which are more stable. The relationship between surface area and water level is satisfactory (R2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.97) for 14 of the 20 analyzed reservoirs. The remaining six reservoirs are affected by aquatic plant intrusion which leads to an underestimation of the surface area. The high accuracy and operational feasibility of the proposed approach demonstrate that Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning techniques can be recommended for reservoir mapping within the framework of water level monitoring in Burkina Faso."

 Deep learning based subway passenger flow prediction was widely employed to promote prediction accuracy, which is crucial for subway management and commercial infrastructure planning.

 Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for effective water resource management, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. Advancements in remote sensing technology have made ET models indispensable, offering high-resolution spatial and temporal assessments. Contextual models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) are particularly valuable for ET estimation. However, one major challenge for these models is the identification of endmembers representing the wet and dry extremes within the AOI. Furthermore, the influence of AOI size on endmember selection raises important considerations for model performance. This work examines how the size of the AOI and endmember selection impact heat flux estimation using the SEBAL model. The research was conducted in an olive orchard at the Agdal site in Marrakech, from May 2022 to April 2023, and at a rainfed wheat field at the Sidi Rehal site from August 2017 to March 2019, using Landsat imagery (L8 and L9) and ERA5 land reanalysis data. For that, SEBAL was applied to six different AOI, ranging from small and homogeneous areas to the full extent of the Landsat imagery. Based on comparisons of SEBAL estimates with eddy covariance data collected from the Agdal site, the analysis shows that difficulties in accurately identifying endmembers are influenced by the size of the AOI. For homogeneous areas, the model struggles to capture the full range of heat fluxes, leading to poor regression relationships. Conversely, applying a shapefile that covers the entire Landsat imagery led to a more uniform distribution of latent heat flux, especially in winter/spring (when the climatic demand is low), which reduced the model’s ability to capture spatial variability. The AOI, which includes a mix of agricultural areas, bare soil, water bodies, and small towns, and whose boundary is relatively close to the measurement station, yielded the best results. It achieved R2 values of 0.95 for H and 0.88 for LE, with RMSE values of 51.24 and 52.41 W/m2 for H and LE, respectively. At the regional scale, the larger AOI size produced the lowest results with greater dispersion at the rainfed wheat site, with RMSE values of 104.99 and 93.30 W/m2 for H and LE, respectively. In contrast, segmenting the region into optimal size of AOI produced more accurate results, achieving R2 values of 0.96 for H and 0.92 for LE, with corresponding RMSE values of 56.9 and 35.88 W/m2, respectively. These findings emphasize the critical role of AOI size and endmember identification in improving SEBAL model accuracy and enhancing ET estimation for the sustainable management of water resources at both local and regional levels."

 Timely monitoring of crop conditions is essential for optimizing and assessing agricultural management. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from remote sensing data can be useful for assessing crop conditions on a large spatial scale. Traditional crop condition assessments compare a VI in the current year to a baseline VI, averaged over multiple years. However, comparing VIs across years by calendar day may not capture the general crop condition at the same development stage due to interannual variability in planting date and weather. This study proposes a phenological alignment approach for assessing differences in corn and soybean crop condition at commensurate growth stages rather than by day of year. The analysis was conducted in central Iowa, U.S. from 2018 to 2023, which included periods of drought and excess rainfall, providing a high interannual variability in crop phenology and condition. Weekly crop condition and seasonal yield data reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were compared with aggregated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) anomalies to evaluate relationships both spatially and temporally. Three EVI2 anomaly time series were computed with temporal alignment based on: day of the year (DOY), days after emergence (DAE), and accumulated growing degree day (AGDD), with a scaled time axis aligned at the emergence date. For the DAE- and AGDD-aligned EVI2 time series, emergence date was determined using a within-season emergence detection approach based on remote sensing. Results showed that EVI2 anomalies perform well in crop condition assessment at 30-m resolution, and correlations improved with DAE and AGDD corrections to the EVI2 time series, reducing the effects of yearly differences in crop phenology. The proposed method has potential for improving within-season crop condition monitoring and yield prediction."

 The wave phenomena in SAR images are able to provide water depth information. SAR ocean images are often characterized by unclear wave texture and strong speckle noise, which will hinder the bathymetric inversion. Denoising and texture enhancement are two strategies to improve image quality. However, noise reduction may blur textures, while texture enhancement may amplify noise. To address this, we propose a wave texture enhancement method to balance noise reduction and texture preservation. First, an adaptive total variation bounded Hessian method removes noises from SAR ocean images while preserving texture. Next, an improved Frankle-McCann Retinex method enhances ocean wave features in the denoised image without adding noises. Finally, the resulting image is used for wave-based bathymetric inversion experiments conducted at Car Nicobar Island, Chowra Island, and Dongdao Island, covering depths up to 40 m. The proposed method improved bathymetric accuracy, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) by up to 4.69 m and mean relative error (MRE) by up to 18 %. In addition, the proposed method has a positive effect on the estimation of wavelength and period parameters. Experimental results show that blurred ocean surfaces in SAR images significantly affect bathymetric inversion. Thus, wave enhancement is an important step prior to performing bathymetric inversion."

 Precipitation is an essential component of the water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in cold seasons. Investigating the impacts of various terrain resolutions in simulations on the precipitation distribution and rain-snow phase transition on the TP helps to understand the sources of simulation error and contributes to assessment and improvement. In this study, three types of terrain resolutions were used to conduct simulation experiments (namely WRF30s, WRF2m and WRF5m) on a large-scale extreme precipitation process over the TP under the influence of a storm over the Bay of Bengal in October 2008 near the Himalayas and the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, which serve as representative regions influenced by northward moisture. The results indicate that the terrain resolutions affect the precipitation amount and phase distribution. On the north of the Himalayas, a snowfall-dominated “phase bias” based on “wet bias” is observed above 3 km, which strengthens as the terrain resolution reduces, relating to the stronger water vapor flux transport and larger cold bias resulting from the terrain smoothing. The Bomi station, which is located in the canyon, undergoing a snow-to-rain phase transition influenced by the storm received further attention. The study not only shows the cloud microphysical characteristics of the precipitation on the TP under the influence of storms, but further reveals the snow melting phase transition weakening, manifested as the increase of snowfall accompanied by the decrease of terrain resolution. Further detailed analysis of cloud microphysical process in Bomi shows that the latter is related to the decrease melting rates of snow and graupel caused by the compression of the melting layer when the terrain near canyon increases with terrain resolution decrease. Consequently, the distribution and phase transition of precipitation on the TP induced by terrain resolutions requires attention during the simulation."

After decades of studies, Rayleigh scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency,Γ∝ωd+1, became generally accepted. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. It is unclear how to define glass defects. Here, we use a particle level contribution to sound damping to determine areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas, which allows us to define defects. Over a range of stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultrastable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine forces that arise after macroscopic deformation. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses, one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a different paradigm of sound damping in glasses."

Here, we show that female sex is a risk factor for worsened outcomes in a model of retinal degeneration and that this susceptibility is caused by the presence of female-specific sex hormones. The adverse effect of female sex hormones was specific to diseased retinal neurons, and depletion of these hormones ameliorated this phenotypic effect, while reintroduction worsened rates of disease in females. Transcriptional analysis of retinas showed significant differences between genes involved in pyroptosis, inflammatory responses, and endoplasmic reticulum stress–induced apoptosis between males and females with retinal degeneration. These findings provide crucial insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and how sex hormones can affect disease severity.

Our results demonstrate that these plasmas spontaneously generate coherent linearly polarized radiation in a wide range of parameters via the electron cyclotron maser instability, with radiative losses altering the saturation mechanism. Thus, the plasma continuously amplify coherent radiation for substantially longer durations of time.

Leveraging integrated transcriptome-wide association study and single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factorZmbZIP89as an important regulator of LR elongation and mapped its spatial expression pattern in cortex/epidermis cell types. ZmbZIP89 can activate the expression ofZmPRX47to regulate the production of root reactive oxygen species homeostasis, contributing to increased lateral root length (LRL) and enhanced drought resistance. Natural variations in the 3′ untranslated region ofZmbZIP89enhance gene expression by increasing mRNA stability, leading to increases in LRL and drought tolerance. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LR development and provide potential gene targets for breeding stress-resilient crops."

We demonstrate this geometric understanding in an animal, the carrion crow. Crows were trained to detect a visually distinct intruder shape among six concurrent arbitrary shapes. The crows were able to immediately apply this intruder concept to quadrilaterals, identifying the one that exhibited differing geometric properties compared to the others in the set. The crows exhibited a geometric regularity effect, showing better performance with shapes featuring right angles, parallel lines, or symmetry over more irregular shapes. This performance advantage did not require learning. Our findings suggest that geometric intuitions are not specific to humans but are deeply rooted in biological evolution."

For validation, we performed permutation-based testing, Huber regression, and independent replication analysis. Simulation studies were used to illustrate the observed differences between data transformations. We demonstrate the advantages and limitations of popular analytic strategies used in mGWASs where especially low-frequency variants in combination with a skewed metabolite measurement distribution can lead to potentially false-positive metQTL findings.

Here, we systematically investigate the fatigue performance of ultrathin bismuth ferrite BiFeO3(BFO)–based FTJs integrated with various semiconductors. Notably, the BFO/gallium arsenide FTJ exhibits superior fatigue resistance characteristics (>108cycles), surpassing the BFO/silicon FTJ (>106cycles) and even approaching epitaxial oxide FTJs (>109cycles). The atomic-scale fatigue mechanism is revealed as lattice structure collapse caused by oxygen vacancy accumulation in BFO near semiconductors after repeated switching. The enhanced fatigue-resistant behavior in BFO/gallium arsenide FTJ is due to gallium arsenide’s weak oxygen affinity, resulting in fewer oxygen vacancies.

Using a combination of geomorphic mapping, radiocarbon and luminescence dating, and numerical simulations of meander dynamics, we identify well-conserved scaling laws that describe floodplain storage times. Our results reveal that, to first order, floodplain storage durations are set by the ratio of river width to migration rate. The fact that most rivers erode about 1% of their width per year leads to a typical floodplain storage duration of ~5 thousand years."

In existing stretchable battery designs, increasing the active material to yield higher capacity often leads to thicker and stiffer solid electrodes with poor mechanical properties. Here, we present a concept that transfers the physical property of a battery electrode from a conventional solid into a fluid state. The mechanical and electrochemical properties of the electrode rely on the viscosity of fluids rather than Young’s modulus of solids. Fluids conform easily into any shape with minimal force, making them intrinsically deformable. This decouples the electrochemical and mechanical property of the redox-active electrofluid, leading to higher capacities with more active material loading without stiffening the cell. The cell showed excellent capacity retention over 500 charge-discharge cycles and mechanical robustness up to 100% strain.

This study introduces a discrimination algorithm based on polarimetric radar networks only. Exploiting the unique opportunity to link fall velocities from Doppler spectra to polarimetric variables in an operational setting enables us to set up and evaluate a well-performing machine learning algorithm. 
 The distinction between riming and aggregation is of high relevance for model microphysics, data assimilation, and warnings of potential aircraft hazards due to the link between riming and updrafts as well as the presence of supercooled liquid water in the atmosphere. Even though the polarimetric fingerprints for aggregation and riming are qualitatively similar, we hypothesize that it is feasible to implement an area-wide discrimination algorithm based on national polarimetric weather radar networks only. Quasi-vertical profiles (QVPs) of reflectivity (ZH), differential reflectivity (ZDR), and estimated depolarization ratio (DR) are utilized to learn about the information content of each individual polarimetric variable and their combinations for riming detection. High-resolution Doppler spectra from the vertical (birdbath) scans of the C-band radar network of the German Meteorological Service serve as input and ground truth for algorithm development. Mean isolated spectra profiles (MISPs) of the Doppler velocity are used to infer regions with frozen hydrometeors falling faster than 1.5 m s−1 and accordingly associated with significant riming. Several machine learning methods have been tested to detect riming from the corresponding QVPs of polarimetric variables. The best-performing algorithm is a fine-tuned gradient-boosting model based on decision trees. The precipitation event on 14 July 2021, which led to catastrophic flooding in the Ahr valley in western Germany, was selected to validate the performance. Considering balanced accuracy, the algorithm is able to correctly predict 74 % of the observed riming features; thus, the feasibility of reliable riming detection with national radar networks has been successfully demonstrated."

This resulting reflectivity offset during the recent field campaign is compared favorably with the traditional disdrometer comparison near the rain onset, while it also demonstrates similar trends with respect to collocated and independently calibrated reference radars. 
 A relative calibration technique has been developed for the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility Ka-band ARM Zenith Radars (KAZRs). This method uses the signal attenuation caused by water on the radome to estimate reflectivity factor (Ze) offsets. The wet-radome attenuation (WRA) is assumed to follow a log-linear relationship with rainfall rate during light and moderate rain, as measured by a collocated surface disdrometer. The technique has an uncertainty of approximately 3 dB, due to factors such as disdrometer measurement error, rain variability between radar and disdrometer sample volumes, and the fitting function's uncertainty for the WRA behavior. A practical advantage of this WRA-based approach to shorter-wavelength radar monitoring is that, while it requires a reference disdrometer, it proves feasible for a wider range of collocated disdrometer measurements compared to traditional direct disdrometer comparison at the onset of light rain. This technique thus offers a cost-effective monitoring tool for remote or long-term radar deployments.This calibration technique was applied during the ARM Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) from October 2021 through September 2022. The estimated Ze offsets were compared against traditional radar calibration and monitoring methods using available datasets from this campaign. Results show that the WRA-based offsets align closely with mean offsets found between cloud radars and from direct disdrometer comparison near the onset of rain, while also reflecting similar offset and campaign-long trends when compared to collocated, independently calibrated radar wind profilers. Nevertheless, overall, the KAZR Ze offsets estimated during TRACER remained stable at approximately 2 dB lower than the disdrometer estimates from the campaign start until the end of June 2022; afterward, the offsets increased to around 7 dB by the campaign's end. This increase is linked to a drop of about 1 dB in transmitter power toward the end of the project."

MDG625 demonstrates superior continuity and consistency from both spatial and temporal perspectives.

It was collected at sea in the Bay of Biscay (France) and comprises audio recordings of echolocation clicks, whistles and other social sounds, as well as visual observations of dolphin behaviour. This dataset could be used to improve the comprehension of dolphin communication by scientists, which could assist in the development of conservation strategies, particularly with regard to by-catches. 
 Dolphins are highly vocal cetaceans with a complex acoustic repertoire. These marine mammals rely heavily on sound for critical activities: echolocation clicks for navigation and prey detection, whistles for social communication, and pulsed sounds for less well-documented purposes. Understanding their acoustic behaviour is essential for insights into their ecology, social structure, and responses to anthropogenic noise. However, to date, there is a lack of open-access datasets of acoustic recordings of wild free-ranging short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), coupled with observations data. Here, we present a dataset (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14637674, Lehnhoff (2025)) of high resolution acoustic recordings of (D. delphis) observed during various behavioural states, including foraging, travelling, socializing, milling, and attraction to the boat. The dataset was collected in the northern Bay of Biscay, France, from summers of 2020 to 2022 during surveys conducted as part of the DOLPHINFREE project. The dataset contains acoustic recordings of wild free-ranging short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) observed during various behavioural states, including foraging, travelling, socializing, milling, and attraction to the boat. Audio recordings were performed during opportunistic encounters using two devices: a single high-quality hydrophone (sampling rate: 512 kHz, bit-depth: 32 bits) and a compact array of four hydrophones (256 kHz to 512 kHz, 16 to 24 bits) for localization purposes. The dataset comprises over 400 minutes of unedited audio recordings of D. delphis accompanied by visual observations. In total, we identified about 68,000 echolocation clicks, 4,600 whistle contours, and more that 350 pulsed sounds. This comprehensive resource is valuable for detailed studies of the acoustic repertoire of common dolphins and their two-dimensional movements."

The sites reflect the diversity of depositional environments, studied over many years with the development of multi-proxy approaches and regional collaborations. The GeoEcoKorea online platform, developed alongside this dataset, aims to enhance data accessibility and promote FAIR data sharing among researchers. 
 Ecological insights beyond human-observable time scales are derived from geologically preserved records in lake and wetland sediments around the world. Nonetheless, significant regional data gaps persist in global syntheses of these records as regional open data practices are still emerging. South Korean Quaternary paleoecology data remain underrepresented in these global efforts, despite a growing body of the relevant research. Here, we organize an inventory of 328 paleoecological study sites (72 paleo-sites for sediment records and 256 surface sites for surface pollen samples) in South Korea, compiled from 66 research articles published between 2003 and 2023. We have structured three datasets related to this inventory: (1) Publication Metadata, which provides citation details of the 66 articles; (2) Site Inventory, which contains geospatial, depositional environments, chronological ranges, proxies, and indexed publications; and (3) Chron-Depth Collection, which includes chronological details (dating methods, age, and depth points) for each site. The sites span latitudes from 33.2508° N to 33.4808° N and longitudes from 126.1486° E to 129.2132° E, with elevations from -156 m to 1867.5 m. Sediment samples were collected by coring or trenching from six depositional environments: Open-coastal zone, Estuary, Lagoon, River, Volcanic cone, and Others. A total of 784 chronological controls (14C, OSL, and U-Th) were analyzed from 72 sediment records, and the majority based on radiocarbon dating. Pollen, diatoms, grain-size analysis, and geochemical markers have been extensively used as paleoenvironmental proxies, with multiproxy analyses becoming increasingly common in recent studies. To enhance accessibility, we have developed GeoEcoKorea, an online platform archiving raw data of the compiled studies or linking to it through our metadata, site inventory, and chron-depth datasets if the data is made available elsewhere. This initiative seeks to establish more data sharing agreements with domestic researchers by promoting the collaborative benefits of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data."

We find that tropical regions are mostly P-limited, while temperate and boreal areas face N limitations. Over time, P limitation increased, especially in the tropics, while N limitation decreased. These shifts are key to understanding global plant growth and carbon storage, highlighting the importance of including P dynamics in ecosystem models. 
 Phosphorus (P) is a critical macronutrient for plant growth, often limiting plant production in areas where plant demand is higher than soil supply. In contrast to nitrogen (N), P cannot be sourced from the atmosphere; therefore, where it is rare, it becomes a strong constraint on primary production. Due to this, most dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are incorporating a prognostic P cycle in addition to N, improving their ability to correctly predict stocks and fluxes of carbon and how climate change may impact N and/or P limitations to soil processes and plant productivity.We included the P cycle into an individual-based DGVM, Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS, v4.1, r10994), in order to improve model performance with regard to observations of vegetation and soil N and P stocks and fluxes in comparison to the N-only (LPJ-GUESS-CN) model version. The new model version (LPJ-GUESS-CNP v1.0) includes soil organic P dynamics, P limitation of organic matter decomposition, P deposition, temperature- and humidity-dependent P weathering, plant P demand and uptake, and P limitations to photosynthesis. Using the CNP version of LPJ-GUESS, we also estimated global spatial patterns of nutrient limitation to plant growth as well as the temporal change in plant N and P limitation during the 20th and early 21st century, evaluating the causes for these temporal shifts.We show that including the P cycle significantly reduces simulated global vegetation and soil C and N stocks and fluxes, in particular in tropical regions. The CNP model simulation improves the fit to global biomass observations in relation to the CN simulation. The CNP model predicts predominant P limitation of plant growth in the tropics, and N limitation in the temperate, boreal, and high-altitude tropical regions. The CNP model also correctly predicted the global magnitude (∼50 PgP) and the spatial pattern of total organic P stocks. P-limited regions cover less land surface area (46 %) than N-limited ones but are responsible for 57 % of the global gross primary productivity (GPP)  and 68 % of vegetation biomass, while N-limited regions store a larger portion of total carbon stocks (55.9 %). Finally, the model shows that globally, primary production limitation to N availability decreased and limitation to P increased from 1901 to 2018, with N being more responsive to temperature and P than CO2 changes. We conclude that including the P cycle in models like LPJ-GUESS is crucial for understanding global-scale spatial and temporal patterns in nutrient limitation and improving the simulated carbon stocks and fluxes."

Routine city-wide measurements of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), of concern for health and contributing to urban air pollution, are notably lacking. In this study, we use the highest spatially resolved (∼2 km) measurements of emissions and concentrations ever reported of HAPs while covering a whole megacity and combine observations with US Census information. We observe higher concentrations and emissions of 17 measured HAPs, such as benzene, naphthalene, and p-chlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF), in California-designated Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) and census tracts with low-income Hispanics and Asians. These groups share an unequal burden from traffic-related emissions, with benzene, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations up to 60% higher. However, in DACs and census tracts with large Hispanic populations (>50%), we observe toluene-to-benzene emission ratios above 3, pointing to inequalities in other HAPs primarily caused by non-traffic emission sources such as industry and solvents. In these communities, regulatory inventories also significantly underestimate emissions. We find that efforts to address HAP inequalities and environmental justice concerns in Los Angeles will need to consider contributions from volatile chemical products, which represent a growing source of emissions driving inequalities in impacted communities."

This knowledge is of critical value in the management and conservation of the coastal seafloor. We therefore aimed to determine the relationships between seafloor microbiota and macrofauna on a regional scale. We compared prokaryote, macrofauna, chemical, and geographical data from 1546 seafloor samples, which varied in their exposure to aquaculture activities along the Norwegian and Icelandic coasts. We found that the seafloor samples contained either a network centralized by a sulfur oxidizer (42.4% of samples, n = 656) or a network centralized by an archaeal ammonium oxidizer (44.0% of samples, n = 681). Very few samples contained neither network (9.8% of samples, n = 151) or both (3.8% of samples, n = 58). Samples with a sulfur oxidizer network had a 10-fold higher risk of macrofauna loss (odds ratios, 95% CI: 9.5 to 15.6), while those with an ammonium oxidizer network had a 10-fold lower risk (95% CI: 0.068 to 0.11). The sulfur oxidizer network was negatively correlated to distance from Norwegian aquaculture sites (Spearman rho = −0.42, p < 0.01) and was present in all Icelandic samples (n = 274). The ammonium oxidizer network was absent from Icelandic samples and positively correlated to distance from Norwegian aquaculture sites (Spearman rho = 0.67, p < 0.01). Based on 356 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we found that bicarbonate-dependent carbon fixation and low-affinity oxygen respiration were associated with the ammonium oxidizer network, while the sulfur oxidizer network was associated with ammonium retention, sulfur metabolism, and high-affinity oxygen respiration. In conclusion, our findings highlight the critical roles of microbial networks centralized by sulfur and ammonium oxidizers in mild macrofauna deterioration, which should be included as an essential part of seafloor surveillance."

Sensitivity analysis reveals that molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and organic carbon content are the most significant factors influencing sorption behavior, while charge density and mineral soil fraction have comparatively minor effects. The model demonstrates high predictive performance, with RPD values exceeding 3.16 across validation data sets, outperforming existing tools in accuracy and scope. Notably, PFAS chain length and functional group variability significantly influence Kd, with longer chain lengths and higher hydrophobicity positively correlating with Kd. By integrating location-specific soil repository data, the model enables the generation of spatial Kd maps for selected PFAS species. These capabilities are implemented in the online platform PFASorptionML, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource for conducting environmental risk assessments of PFAS contamination in soils."

The dynamic nature of these environments affects eDNA distribution relative to its source organisms, complicating the interpretation of eDNA observations and challenging the field sampling design.

Based on the predicted particle densities, over 70% of the preselected stations detected the target eDNA. Despite potential variations in source strength and patchy distributions, the model explained approximately 40% of the observed variation in eDNA abundance; by comparison, eDNA concentration was uncorrelated with straight-line distance from the source or with a simplified oceanographic model. Our study revealed the extent of advective transport in shaping eDNA distribution and abundance and demonstrated the utility of ocean models and particle tracking in integrating marine eDNA observations with degradation, transport, and dilution processes; thus, it suggests broader applications to enhance understanding of eDNA signals and dispersal and optimize sampling strategies in other estuarine or marine environments."

Flow-through experiments were conducted in unsaturated quartz and goethite-coated quartz sands equilibrated with different background electrolyte concentrations to distinguish between air–water and goethite–water interfacial adsorption contributions to PFOS retardation. Measurements of PFOS breakthrough curves at column outlets allowed tracking the differences in spatio-temporal evolution of the PFOS plumes between the two porous media.

Although these functions have been extensively studied in conventional boundary layers, such as convective and sheared types, their application to tropical cyclone boundary layers (TCBLs) remains both challenging and relatively unexamined. Through large‐eddy simulations, this study assessed how scale‐dependent functions vary between TC and conventional boundary layers. The results demonstrate that the TCBL exhibits substantially different scale‐aware similarity functions compared to conventional boundary layers, with significantly higher proportions of subgrid‐scale turbulent kinetic energy at equivalent scaled resolutions in the gray zone. The differences noted above are mainly attributable to the variations in the intensity and scale of turbulence between the TCBL and conventional boundary layer in different directions. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of TCBL and may offer valuable insights for scale‐aware boundary layer parameterization in TC models."

Posselt,Lifecycle‐Type Matters for Extratropical Cyclone Precipitation Production,"In the midlatitudes, extratropical cyclones produce the majority of winter precipitation. Precipitation rates and accumulation depend strongly on both the cyclone intensity and the environmental moisture amount. Using 5 years of the Integrated Multi‐satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) product, cyclone‐centered composites of surface precipitation rates are compared between cyclones that occlude and those that do not. Occluding cyclones produce greater surface precipitation because they tend to be more intense. When the non‐occluding cyclones are selected such that they collectively have similar intensity and moisture amount distributions as the occluding cyclones, precipitation rates at peak intensity are still larger for occluding cyclones. This is because a particular type of forced, frontal‐scale, ascent in the occluded thermal ridge, unique to occluded cyclones by virtue of their thermal structure, favors more precipitation. The results demonstrate that life‐cycle type (i.e., achieving occlusion vs. not) matters for precipitation production in extratropical cyclones."

 Accurately predicting species’ responses to anthropogenic climate change is hampered by limited knowledge of their spatiotemporal ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We combine landscape genomics, demographic reconstructions, and species distribution models to assess the eco-evolutionary responses to past climate fluctuations and to future climate of an Afro-Palaearctic migratory raptor, the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). We uncover two evolutionarily and ecologically distinct lineages (European and Asian), whose demographic history, evolutionary divergence, and historical distribution range were profoundly shaped by past climatic fluctuations. Using future climate projections, we find that the Asian lineage is at higher risk of range contraction, increased migration distance, climate maladaptation, and consequently greater extinction risk than the European lineage. Our results emphasise the importance of providing historical context as a baseline for understanding species’ responses to contemporary climate change, and illustrate how incorporating intraspecific genetic variation improves the ecological realism of climate change vulnerability assessments.

 Developing ruthenium-based oxide catalysts capable of suppressing lattice oxygen participation in the catalytic reaction process is crucial for maintaining stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions. Herein, we delicately construct a RuO2 nanoparticle-anchored LiCoO2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (RuO2/LiCoO2), achieving dynamic optimization of RuO2 during the reaction process and improving catalytic stability. Benefiting from the unique electrochemical delithiation characteristics of the LiCoO2 support, the covalency of the Ru-O bond is effectively regulated during the OER process. The weakened Ru-O covalent bond inhibits the participation of lattice oxygen in the catalytic reaction and ensures the continuous operation of the Ru active sites. Moreover, the extended Ru-O bond in the optimized RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst reduces the formation energy barrier of the *OOH intermediates, accelerating the progress of the OER. As a result, the RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst requires only an overpotential of 150 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and operates stably for 2000 h at 1 A cm−2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

Here, the authors explore evolutionary rescue in an obligate mutualism between crossfeeding E. coli strains, finding that stress can lead to mutualism breakdown through the reversion to autonomy of one partner. 
 Populations facing lethal environmental change can escape extinction through rapid genetic adaptation, a process known as evolutionary rescue. Despite extensive study, evolutionary rescue is largely unexplored in mutualistic communities, where it is likely constrained by the less adaptable partner. Here, we explored empirically the likelihood, population dynamics, and genetic mechanisms underpinning evolutionary rescue in an obligate mutualism involving cross-feeding of amino acids between auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains. We found that over 80% of populations overcame a severe decline when exposed to two distinct types of abrupt, lethal stress. Of note, in all cases only one of the strains survived by metabolically bypassing the auxotrophy. Crucially, the mutualistic consortium exhibited greater sensitivity to both stressors than a prototrophic control strain, such that reversion to autonomy was sufficient to alleviate stress below lethal levels. This sensitivity was common across other stresses, suggesting it may be a general feature of amino acid–dependent obligate mutualisms. Our results reveal that evolutionary rescue may depend critically on the specific genetic and physiological details of the interacting partners, adding rich layers of complexity to the endeavor of predicting the fate of microbial communities facing intense environmental deterioration. Rapid genetic adaptation to environmental change, or evolutionary rescue, can be constrained by a less adaptable mutualistic partner. Here, the authors explore evolutionary rescue in an obligate mutualism between crossfeeding E. coli strains, finding that stress can lead to mutualism breakdown through the reversion to autonomy of one partner."

 The exploration of stable and functional linkages by multicomponent reactions to enrich the stability and diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and to broaden their potential applications is of fundamental significance to the development of COFs. Herein, we report the facile construction of a set of benzo[f]quinoline-linked COFs (B[f]QCOFs) via one-pot three-component [4 + 2] cyclic condensation of aldehydes and aromatic amines with easy-to-handle triethylamine as the vinyl source. These B[f]QCOFs possess high crystallinity, good physico-chemical stability as well as significant light absorption ability. More importantly, the obtained B[f]QCOF-1 exhibits a superior H2O2 production rate of 9025 μmol g-1 h-1 in pure water without any sacrificial agent under visible-light irradiation, surpassing most of the previously reported COF-based photocatalysts under comparable conditions. This work not only provides a general synthetic route for the preparation of fully conjugated COFs, but also helps the rational design of COF-based photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.

Here, authors develop a metal-organic-framework liquid-infusion technique to create a rigid glass layer on the oxide particles, improving both Li+ diffusion and battery stability. 
 The rapid evolution of portable electronics and electric vehicles necessitates batteries with high energy density, robust cycling stability, and fast charging capabilities. High-voltage cathodes, like LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM-811), promise enhanced energy density but are hampered by poor stability and sluggish lithium-ion diffusion in conventional electrolytes. We introduce a metal-organic framework (MOF) liquid-infusion technique to fully integrate MOF liquid into the grain boundaries of NCM-811, creating a thoroughly coated cathode with a thin, rigid MOF Glass layer. The surface electrically non-conductive MOF Glass layer with 2.9 Å pore windows facilitating Li-ion pre-desolvation and enabling highly aggregative electrolyte formation inside the Glass channels, suppressing solvated Li-ion co-insertion and solvent decomposition. While the inner Glass layer composes of Li-ion conducting components and enhancing fast Li-ion diffusion. This functional structure effectively shields the cathode from particle cracking, CEI rupture, oxygen loss, and transition metal migration. As a result, Li | |Glass@NCM-811 cells demonstrate good rate capability and cycling stability even under high-charge rates and elevated voltages. Furthermore, we also achieve a 385 Wh kg-1 pouch-cell (19.579 g, for pouch-cell), showcasing the practical potential of this method.

 The gut microbiota is a key modulator of human health and the status of major diseases including cancer, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. Central to microbiota survival is the ability to metabolise complex dietary and host-derived glycans, including intestinal mucins. The prominent human gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) is a versatile and highly efficient complex glycan degrader thanks to the expansion of gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilisation loci (PULs). While the mechanism of action for several singular dietary glycan-induced PULs have been elucidated, studies on the unusually high number of mucin-inducible PULs in B. theta significantly lag behind. Here we show that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50 encodes activities consistent with the processing and metabolism of mucin O-glycoproteins and their core sugar N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). PUL BT4240-50 was also shown to be important for competitive growth on mucins in vitro, encoding a kinase (BT4240) critical for GalNAc metabolism. Additionally, BT4240-kinase was shown to be essential for glycosaminoglycan metabolism, extending the PULs function beyond mucins. These data advance our understanding of glycoprotein metabolism at mucosal surfaces, highlighting GalNAc as a key metabolite for competitive microbial survival in the human gut.

Here Elliott et al. show that conformational rigidity determines agonistic activity of antibodies targeting CD40 and 4-1BB and demonstrate further enhancement of agonism through disulfide engineering. 
 A promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy is activation of immune signalling pathways through antibodies that target co-stimulatory receptors. hIgG2, one of four human antibody isotypes, is known to deliver strong agonistic activity, and modification of hIgG2 hinge disulfides can influence immune-stimulating activity. This was shown for antibodies directed against the hCD40 receptor, where cysteine-to-serine exchange mutations caused changes in antibody conformational flexibility. Here we demonstrate that the principles of increasing agonism by restricting antibody conformation through disulfide modification can be translated to the co-stimulatory receptor h4-1BB, another member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Furthermore, we explore structure-guided design of the anti-hCD40 antibody ChiLob7/4 and show that engineering additional disulfides between opposing F(ab’) arms can elicit conformational restriction, concomitant with enhanced agonism. These results support a mode where subtle increases in rigidity can deliver significant improvements in immunostimulatory activity, thus providing a strategy for the rational design of more powerful antibody therapeutics.

 Marine anoxia is widely proposed as a kill mechanism for the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary mass extinction commonly linked to the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis (~359.3 Ma), but the exact connections between primary drivers, marine redox conditions, and biotic turnover are not well constrained. Mercury concentrations and isotopes from multiple sections in South China and western Canada show no significant signature of enhanced volcanism during the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis. Rather, the distinct negative shifts of Δ199Hg coupled with positive shifts of δ202Hg across the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis provide compelling evidence for development of photic zone euxinia, as supported by covariant pyrite framboid data and Ce/Ce* values of carbonate. The photic zone euxinia was likely driven by increased nutrient delivery given its coincidence with carbon isotopic perturbations and enhanced weathering immediately before the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis. Our data highlight the possibility that photic zone euxinia played a pivotal role in the extinction of marine biota during the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis by limiting the habitable space and by increased hydrogen sulfide toxicity, especially for organisms living in shallow water.

 Self-secondaries are secondary craters formed in cogenetic ejecta deposits. Bearing important information on cratering mechanics and the applicability of remote age-determination technique using crater statistics, the spatial distribution of self-secondaries on Mars and their potential effect on martian crater chronology remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that self-secondaries are scarce on Mars, possessing minor effect on crater chronology. Recognized self-secondaries primarily occur on rim deposits and are largely absent on layered ejecta deposits, suggesting that the emplacement of self-secondaries and layered ejecta deposits occurred in a narrow time window. Comparison with model-predicted distributions of self-secondaries suggests that fragments forming self-secondaries did not uniformly have near-vertical ejection angles and may have slightly larger angles than those of normal excavation flows, explaining their common occurrence on airless planetary bodies. The double-layered ejecta of Steinheim ceased emplacement earlier than single- and multiple-layered ejecta, possibly due to the higher volatile content in pre-impact target materials.

 Caused by an unprecedented East Asian high-pressure, the Yangtze River Valley (YRV) in China suffered an extreme heat dome with record-breaking heatwaves and droughts in August 2022. Concurrently, extra-tropical oceans recorded unprecedented warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, the combined influence of these warm SSTs on the YRV's extreme heatwaves remains unclear. By using observational data, simulations from the Community Earth System Model-Large Ensemble project, and numerical sensitivity experiments, we highlight the joint contributions of intensified air-sea interaction in the North Pacific and North Atlantic to the YRV's extreme heatwave. Further analysis indicates that the East Asian high-pressure exhibits a non-linear response to the intensity of SSTs in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, with a significant response only to the extreme warm SSTs. In addition, the uncertainty within the simulation of August high-pressure is explored, and the result indicates that the uncertainty could be physically rooted in the model's inability to initiatively simulate the coupled air-sea situation over the North Atlantic in July. To improve the simulation for the influence of mid-latitude SSTs, a coordinated coupled air-sea initial condition should be used to constrain the simulation. Moreover, such warm SSTs and the associated air-sea interaction can cause extreme high-pressures over Europe and western North America, offering an explanation for the compound extreme heatwaves over these two regions and China in 2022."

Distinguishing their nature (interstitial- or vacancy-type) is a long-standing challenge with great implications for understanding radiation damage.

The polygonal shape is attributed to the dissociation of ana0/3<111> dislocation into ana0/6<112> Shockley partial and ana0/6<110> stair-rod dislocation. The dissociation of vacancy loops is energetically favorable, whereas interstitial loops require external stimuli to promote dislocation propagation.

We report the role of astrocyte-specific, ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived astrocytes, neurons and cocultures and exposed them to small soluble alpha-synuclein aggregates. Oligomeric alpha-synuclein triggered an inflammatory glial state associated with Toll-like receptor activation, viral responses, and cytokine secretion. This reactive state resulted in loss of neurosupportive functions and the induction of neuronal toxicity. Notably, interferon response pathways were activated leading to up-regulation and isoform switching of the RNA deaminase enzyme, ADAR1. ADAR1 mediates A-to-I RNA editing, and increases in RNA editing were observed in inflammatory pathways in cells, as well as in postmortem human PD brain.

Here, we report two separate types of transmission sites, termed silenceable and idle-able, each participating distinctly in evoked or miniature transmission in the mouse visual cortex. Both sites operated with a postsynaptic binary mode with different unitary sizes and mechanisms. During postnatal development, silenceable sites were unsilenced by associative plasticity with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-receptor incorporation, increasing evoked transmission.

In simulations with multiple glycine molecules, surface-bound glycine enhances further adsorption, leading to the formation of long chains connected by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl and amine groups of glycine molecules. We find that the likelihood of observing chains longer than 10 glycine units increases by at least five orders of magnitude at the surface compared to the bulk. This surface-driven assembly is primarily due to local high density and alignment with the alumina surface pattern.

How cells balance dynamic mitochondrial processes to achieve homeostasis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that ARMC1 partitioning between distinct mitochondrial protein complexes is a key determinant of mitochondrial distribution. In one complex, the mitochondrial trafficking adaptor MIRO recruits ARMC1, which mediates the assembly of a mitochondrial fission regulator (MTFR). MTFR stability depends on ARMC1, and MIRO-MTFR complexes specifically antagonize retrograde mitochondrial movement. In another complex, DNAJC11 facilitates ARMC1 release from mitochondria. Disrupting MIRO-MTFR assembly fails to rescue aberrant mitochondrial distributions clustered in the perinuclear area observed with ARMC1 deletion, while disrupting ARMC1 interaction with DNAJC11 leads to excessive mitochondrially localized ARMC1 and distinct mitochondrial defects. Thus, the abundance and trafficking impact of MIRO-MTFR complexes require ARMC1, whose mito-cytoplasmic shuttling balanced by DNAJC11 tunes steady-state mitochondrial distributions."

Long‐term TPW is typically inferred from large polar shifts in paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths or computed directly by rotating them in a mantle reference frame. However, most apparent polar wander paths do not incorporate uncertainties in paleomagnetic data, which may bias estimates of TPW. Here, we provide new quantitative estimates of TPW since 320 Ma by placing a recent global apparent polar wander path corrected for age bias and with improved uncertainty quantification in existing mantle reference frames. We find large amplitude (>10°) but slow TPW rotations that predominantly occurred about two equatorial axes that are approximately orthogonal. During the Triassic and Jurassic, a ∼24° TPW oscillation occurred about an axis at ∼15°W, close to the present‐day TPW axis at ∼10°E. In contrast, the TPW axis was located at ∼85°E during a smaller oscillation (∼6–10°) over the past ∼80 Ma, as well as between 260 and 320 Ma. We propose that these varying TPW axes reflect changes in the distribution and flux of subduction in the Tethyan and Pacific realms. We find no evidence for previously postulated fast (>1°/Ma) TPW oscillations in the Cretaceous and Late Jurassic. Finally, we propose that calibrating mantle convection models against reconstructed TPW will improve our understanding of mantle dynamics and the drivers of TPW itself."

Connectivity is dynamic and modulated by climate variability, but its evaluation with traditional tools remains elusive over spatio‐temporal scales of climate interest. Here machine learning helps exploring large‐scale connectivity in the WCR over nearly three decades.

Williams,The Seasonal Variation of the Direct Current Global Electric Circuit: 2. Further Analysis Based on Simulations,"Both simulations and measurements indicate the existence of stable annual behavior of the global electric circuit (GEC) intensity, but the exact pattern of variation is very difficult to reliably determine. Here we present further analysis of this problem using the results of ionospheric potential (IP) simulations with two different models of atmospheric dynamics. From a theoretical perspective, the annual variation of the GEC is eventually determined by seasonal changes in the distribution of convection, associated with the annual cycle of insolation. Simulations clearly demonstrate that the contribution to the IP from the vicinity of the equator has two maxima following the equinoxes, whereas the contribution of nonequatorial latitudes in each hemisphere has one maximum during the local summer. The resulting seasonal variation of the GEC, being the sum of three clear patterns offsetting each other, is rather subtle, and its prediction in simulations may vary depending on the model and IP parameterization. It is likely that the actual seasonal variation of the diurnal mean GEC intensity has one pronounced maximum during the Northern Hemisphere summer and one pronounced minimum during the Northern Hemisphere winter, in agreement with potential gradient measurements in Antarctica and in agreement with the larger portion of the Northern Hemisphere occupied by land. Physical parameters characterizing convection do not provide a very good measure of contributions to the IP, notably overestimating the role of equatorial latitudes; by including surface air temperature in the IP parameterization, one can achieve a better agreement between simulations and observations."

Here, we comprehensively evaluate tropical mesoscale convective system (MCS) characteristics in the DYAMOND (DYnamics of the atmospheric general circulation modeled on non‐hydrostatic domains) simulations for both summer and winter phases. Using 10 different feature trackers applied to simulations and satellite observations, we assess MCS frequency, precipitation, and other key characteristics. Substantial differences (a factor of 2–3) arise among trackers in observed MCS frequency and their precipitation contribution, but model‐observation differences in MCS statistics are more consistent across trackers. DYAMOND models are generally skillful in simulating tropical mean MCS frequency, with multi‐model mean biases ranging from −2%–8% over land and −8%–8% over ocean (summer vs. winter). However, most DYAMOND models underestimate MCS precipitation amount (23%) and their contribution to total precipitation (17%). Biases in precipitation contributions are generally smaller over land (13%) than over ocean (21%), with moderate inter‐model variability. While models better simulate MCS diurnal cycles and cloud shield characteristics, they overestimate MCS precipitation intensity and underestimate stratiform rain contributions (up to a factor of 2), particularly over land, albeit observational uncertainties exist. Additionally, models exhibit a wide range of precipitable water in the tropics compared to reanalysis and satellite observations, with many models showing exaggerated sensitivity of MCS precipitation intensity to precipitable water.

This study investigates how the SPV prolongs the persistence of the NAM on the subseasonal timescales during winter. Our results suggest that the quasi‐geostrophic refractive index (RI) at the high latitudes of mid‐to‐upper troposphere (HL‐MTUT) may serve as a critical mediator in this process. Specifically, the preestablished SPV anomaly can persistently alter the RI at HL‐MTUT through directly modifying the vertical curvature of zonal wind in this region. The RI anomaly at HL‐MTUT, which reflects changes in the waveguide properties of zonal flow, can affect the meridional propagation of tropospheric eddies and is a key factor in the eddy‐zonal flow interactions associated with the NAM. Acting as a mediator, the HL‐MTUT RI will transmit the persistent anomalous signal of the SPV, which has a longer timescale compared to tropospheric variability, into the intrinsic dynamic processes of NAM. Consequently, the SPV will prolong the persistence of NAM. The above mechanism is further supported by a comparison of active‐SPV and inactive‐SPV years: In active‐SPV years, a greater persistence of the NAM is accompanied by a correspondingly greater persistence in both the vertical curvature of zonal wind and the RI at HL‐MTUT."

Compelling evidences have shown that N2O emissions are temperature dependent, offering insights into their intrinsic temperature sensitivity. However, when extrapolating from laboratory‐controlled to field‐ambient conditions, it remains unclear how this temperature sensitivity varied across cropland fields subject to diverse environmental and anthropogenic constraints. We performed a comprehensive meta‐analysis of 144 field‐warming observations worldwide, aiming to address the magnitude, heterogeneity, and drivers of such apparent temperature sensitivity. The results showed that mean growing‐season field‐scale N2O emissions were not strongly temperature dependent with low averaged activation energy (0.32 eV) compared with that of laboratory‐scale observations (0.62 eV). At site levels, the spatial variation in such temperature sensitivity was primarily driven by the interactions of nitrogen fertilization, edaphic, and climatic variables. This analysis also identified a crucial yet frequently overlooked role of soil pH in nonlinearly modulating such temperature sensitivity. Our findings provide evidence for understanding nitrogen and climate feedback by capturing the soil‐climate‐management constrained warming response and highlight the importance of incorporating these constraints into models to improve prediction accuracy."

 The excellent impermeability makes graphene film an ideal candidate for thin film encapsulation technology. However, current chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene-based barrier films can not provide sufficient moisture barrier performance, suggesting a lack of understanding in mechanism that dominates water diffusion in/through graphene stacks. Herein, we fabricate large-area graphene barrier films with a record-low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 5 × 10−5 g/(m2·day), two orders of magnitude lower than previous works, in which two stacked Janus graphene films are intercalated by toluidine blue O (TBO) sub-monolayer: one side of graphene is decorated with fluorine- and oxygen-containing groups to allow crack-free transfer, while the other side is functionalized with hydroxyl groups to trap water. The intercalated TBO further blocks water transport due to a strong water-TBO interaction.

 Accurate snow cover parameter assessment and mapping at a fine resolution can have profound implications for our understanding of the planet’s water balance and energy dynamics. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing is among the most effective methods for snow depth (SD) retrieval. However, significant uncertainties persist in SD retrieval and mapping due to snow characteristic variations, forest canopy interference, and low spatial resolution of PMW. To overcome these limitations, a novel method considering multiple influencing factors was proposed by integration a radiation transfer model with a machine learning model for SD retrieval, and a 500 m resolution SD dataset (NCSD) was generated for 1980 − 2020 in Northeast China by combining downscaling model. The validation against independent ground observations revealed that the MAE, RMSE, and R values for NCSD were 4.39 cm, 6.65 cm and 0.77, respectively. Compared to existing SD products, NCSD data effectively avoid mixed pixel issues, improved SD retrieval performance, and reveal more refined snow cover spatiotemporal patterns. Additionally, the NCSD results indicated that the annual average SD in Northeast China exhibited an increasing trend from 1980 to 2020 (0.26 cm/10a, p > 0.05). However, a notable inflection point occurred in 2000, and a subsequent decreasing trend occurred from 2000 to 2020 (0.49 cm/10a, p > 0.05). Overall, the creation of NCSD effectively filled the gap related to high-resolution SD data, and facilitated the development of hydrological studies and climate change at the basin scale."

 Gross primary productivity (GPP) plays a crucial role in the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Eddy covariance (EC) method can obtain accurate GPP at the site level, but the sparse distribution limits representativeness. Satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serves as emerging data of large-scale GPP, yet there are still limitations in its conversion to GPP and spatiotemporal coverage. This study proposes a transfer learning (SIFEC-TL) method to estimate long-term global GPP with high accuracy by combining constraints from SIF and EC data. SIF data are taken as the source domain that provides the spatial information for pre-training, and EC GPP in the target domain provides precise GPP for the machine learning model fine-tuning. To verify the performance of SIFEC-TL, the results are compared with those from machine learning models that use only SIF or EC GPP alone (SIFML and ECML). The results indicate that the SIFEC-TL model demonstrates stronger spatial scalability compared to the SIFML and ECML models, with R2 increasing by 0.132 and 0.036. The SIFEC-TL more effectively captures inter-annual GPP dynamics with underestimation/overestimation over high/low values in the SIFML and ECML models being well corrected. Furthermore, three different SIF-based GPP are also used as source domains, and the results showed that they only affect pre-training but the final accuracy after fine-tuning remains similar, which indicates SIFEC-TL can obtain stable GPP estimation accuracy regardless of the spatiotemporal coverage of SIF data and its conversion to GPP."

 Spatial association reveals the interconnected nature of geographical phenomena, describing the interactions and influences of environmental variables across geographic space. Path analysis can explore complex causal relationships between variables by analyzing path coefficients. However, in large-scale studies, path analysis methods are often affected by local effects, which can influence the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Results indicate that the LPA model effectively reveals the spatial variation characteristics of local path coefficients between geographic variables, avoiding the underestimation or overestimation of global path coefficients in traditional path coefficient studies.

 Terrace agriculture plays a vital role in mountainous regions by preventing soil erosion, optimizing land use, and supporting local ecosystems.

 Knowledge graphs (KGs) can describe the nature and relationships of geographic entities and are an essential knowledge base for realizing geospatial digital twins (GDTs). However, existing KGs make it challenging to describe dynamic geographic entities under geographic spatiotemporal evolution accurately. Furthermore, they are constrained by the professional backgrounds of their users, which hinders updates and communication. Therefore, the research constructed an “event-object-state” three-domain associated GDT-oriented KG, proposed a large language model (LLM) −driven KG dynamic update algorithm, and established a KG intelligent Q&A method integrating LLM. We developed a prototype system and selected an earthquake disaster as a typical geographic event for experimental analysis. The results showed that the proposed method can reflect the space, time, state, evolution process, and interrelationships of geographic entities in a more comprehensive way, support users to build, update, and query KGs using natural language, with an updating efficiency of less than 1 min, and an updating quality comparable to that of manual updating by experts. Compared with the traditional KGs, our method can represent virtual geographic entities and has significant advantages in intelligence and automation, which effectively breaks down professional barriers and supports the construction of GDTs with the need for rapid updating of knowledge."

 The chemical and bioreactivity properties of photooxidation products emitted during high radical exposure conditions were characterized. The purpose was to simultaneously investigate the influences of the toxicity of photooxidation products from common anthropogenic and biogenic precursors (toluene, m-xylene and isoprene). The major ring-opening compounds were identified as pyruvic acid (C3H4O3), glyceric acid (C3H6O4), succinic acid (C4H6O4), malic acid (C4H6O5), tartaric acid (C4H6O6), 2,3-dihydroxy-glutaric acid (C5H8O6), glycolic acid (C2H4O3) and oxalic acid (C2H2O4) originated from the toluene and xylene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) products in the analysis. The average LDH level from isoprene-derived SOA (0.77 μg/ml) was higher than the control (0.75 μg/ml) and the DCFH level from isoprene-derived SOA (228.73 RFU) was also higher than the control (215.18 RFU). In addition, the average LDH level from toluene-derived SOA (0.86 μg/ml) was higher than the isoprene (0.77 μg/ml). The IL-6 level from toluene-derived SOA (182.82 pg/ml) was higher than the xylene-derived SOA (173.00 pg/ml). These suggested enhanced cytotoxicity and cell membrane damage under toluene-derived SOA exposure. The isoprene-derived SOA induced higher DCFH levels of (228.73 RFU), implying the potential effects of particulate matter from SOA on the oxidative potential and rising cellular oxidant burden. The overall results suggest that the oxidation products can potentially cause various cytotoxic effects.

 Soil moisture plays a crucial role in fog formation and duration, yet its impact has not been sufficiently assessed in fog numerical simulations. This study evaluates the impact of soil moisture constraints (SMC) on fog simulation over East China using the WRF-Chem model, incorporating a series of soil moisture observation data from the China Meteorological Administration and reanalysis products. Additionally, the study assesses the improvements achieved through the meteorological observation nudging (MON) assimilation scheme. Results indicate that the MON scheme significantly improves the simulation accuracy of fog coverage, with the threat score (TS) improving from 65.1 % to 71.2 %, alongside better simulation of key meteorological variables. When combined with MON, SMC derived from observational data further enhances accuracy of fog area simulation, achieving a TS of 72.3 %. Notably, SMC derived from observational soil moisture (Obs-SMC) data outperforms SMC from reanalysis products (ERA5-SMC and FNL-SMC) in overall fog simulation. For RH, MON raised the average index of agreement (IOA) from 0.67 to 0.69 and reduced the normalized mean error (NME) from 24.4 % to 21.7 %. With Obs-SMC, the IOA further increased to 0.83, and the NME dropped to 14.3 %, demonstrating notable improvements in simulation performance. Process analysis suggests that the Obs-SMC further enhances surface evaporation, facilitating near-surface fog condensation and increasing the regional mean liquid water content (LWC) by approximately 0.01 g/kg. Our findings highlight the critical role of accurate soil moisture data in improving fog simulation, implicating a valuable approach for enhancing fog forecasting accuracy."

 The simulation of tropical cyclone (TC) genesis in the North Atlantic (NA) has long posed a challenge for coupled models, showing significant inter-model spread of TC numbers in the NA main development region and its ratio to the Northern Hemisphere total. This ratio is referred to as relative tropical cyclone genesis frequency (RTCGF). By explicitly detecting TCs from the historical simulations of 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, we found that the RTCGF ranges from 0.2 % to 18.9 %, compared to 14.8 % in the observations. This diversity in RTCGF across models is mainly affected by large-scale conditions and African easterly waves, whereas the impact from model resolution is limited. The differences in large-scale conditions originate from the relative sea surface temperature (SST) in the NA compared to the tropics. A higher relative SST triggers the convergence of westerly from the Pacific Ocean and easterly from Africa toward the NA, which enhances low-troposphere vorticity, mid-troposphere ascending motion, and moist convection, creating more favorable large-scale conditions for TC genesis. However, vertical wind shear is less affected by relative SST and has a minor role in the inter-model spread of TC genesis. Further analysis demonstrates that the horizontal resolution is not the key for accurately simulating relative SST and the activity of African easterly waves in the current coupled models. Our findings suggest that model physics may be more relevant to TC activity in coupled models with a resolution of approximately 1–2°."

 Previous research on the effects of Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) on tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific (WNP) has primarily focused on the tropical Atlantic region. This study investigates the relationship between the extra-equatorial North Atlantic tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) pattern and landfalling TCs in the WNP. The findings reveal a significant positive lead-lag correlation between the negative–positive–negative NAT SSTA pattern and the genesis of landfalling TCs in the WNP. In high NAT years, more TCs form in the WNP and recurve northeastward to make landfall over the Korean Peninsula and Japan, while fewer TCs move westward or northwestward. The NAT tropical cold SSTA transmits signals to the WNP and modulates TC genesis via two ways: the eastward pathway through the North Indian Ocean and the westward pathway through the eastern North Pacific. This enhances cyclonic vorticity in the WNP monsoon trough region, facilitating increased TC genesis frequency in the region and thereby increasing the genesis frequency of landfalling TCs. Furthermore, the NAT SSTA influences the tracks of these landfalling TCs. The NAT SSTA pattern persists into summer, triggering a mid-high latitude teleconnection wave train that propagates downstream. This induces an anomalous anticyclone over Northeast Asia and an accompanying cyclonic circulation to its west. This circulation leads to the recurving of TC tracks rather than a northwestward or westward direction. The results suggest that the NAT SSTA is a potential predictor of TC formations and track patterns in the WNP."

 Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a crucial indicator of atmospheric dryness and humidity, influencing the land-atmosphere water exchange process. However, the mechanisms underlying VPD decadal abrupt change (DAC) and their impacts remain unclear. Here, we investigate the DACs of summer VPD in Northeast Asia during the late 20th century and explore the driving mechanisms. Our analysis reveals a significant increase of 20–30 % in summer VPD around 1998. Random forest modeling identifies surface temperature as the primary contributor, driven by atmospheric circulation shifts altering radiation patterns. The DAC of summer VPD in Northeast Asia coincided with abrupt sea surface temperature (SST) changes in both the tropical central Pacific and the Mediterranean Sea. AGCM simulations shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving the increasing DAC of summer VPD in Northeast Asia. These analyses reveal that a rapid decline in tropical central Pacific SST weakened the westerly jet stream. This weakening, in turn, led to a latitudinally uniform distribution of geopotential height and wind fields, ultimately triggering the formation of a high-pressure system over Northeast Asia. Additionally, a potential wave-like teleconnection pattern from the rapidly warming Mediterranean Sea may have further intensified this high-pressure system, exacerbating atmospheric dryness in the region. These findings highlight the role of synergistic SST anomalies in different regions driving atmospheric circulation changes, ultimately impacting regional VPD and dryness in Northeast Asia."

 Dry, hot, and windy conditions are meteorological factors that can affect vegetation variability. Moreover, the combination of them, as represented by concurrences of low relative humidity, high temperature, and high wind speed, can lead to even higher impacts on agricultural production or wildfires, which is still under-assessed. Here we investigate spatial pattern of and changes in the compound dry-hot-windy (DHW) events in historical periods (1951–2014) and future periods (2037–2100) across global areas (including crop regions and burned areas) based on the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) and climate model simulations from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6). An increase in the likelihood (or frequency) of compound DHW events is observed in historical periods and can be even higher in the future across global land areas. Specifically, the projected frequency of compound DHW events in the future period under the SSP585 scenario is around 2.5 times the value in historical periods. Moreover, an increase in compound DHW events is also projected in ten main wheat exporters, in particular for Europe, Argentina, Turkey, and Brazil. Over global burned areas, the higher risk of compound DHW events during fire seasons is also projected in the future.

We found that large-scale irrigation practices reduce summertime surface ozone while raising secondary inorganic aerosol concentration via complicated physical and chemical processes. Our results emphasize the importance of making a tradeoff between air pollution controls and sustainable agricultural development. 
 Intensive irrigation is known to alleviate crop water stress and alter regional climate, which can in turn influence air quality, with ramifications for human health and food security. However, the interplay between irrigation, climate and air pollution especially in the simultaneously intensively irrigated and heavily polluted regions in China has rarely been studied. Here we incorporated a dynamic irrigation scheme into a regional climate–air quality coupled model to examine the potential impacts of irrigation on ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in China. Results show that irrigation increases PM2.5 by 12 µg m−3 (28 %) but reduces O3 concentration by 3–4 ppb (6 %–8 %). Among PM2.5, nitrate and ammonium aerosols rise by 70 % and 40 %, respectively, upon introducing irrigation, with secondary formation contributing to ∼ 60 % and 10 %–30 %, respectively. High humidity and low temperature promote the formation of ammonium nitrate aerosols. To mitigate these adverse effects on PM2.5 air quality, we found that a 20 % reduction in NH3 and NOx emissions is more effective compared with individual emission reductions, while the enhancement in O3 due to the NOx reduction can be completely offset by irrigation itself. Our study highlights the potential benefits of irrigation regarding O3 pollution but potential problems regarding PM2.5 pollution under currently prevalent irrigation modes and anthropogenic emission scenarios, emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to balance water conservation, air pollution, climate change mitigation and food security in the face of development needs."

 Ground-level ozone (O3) has emerged as a significant air pollutant in China, attracting increasing attention from both the scientific community and policymakers. Chemical transport models (CTMs) serve as crucial tools in addressing O3 pollution, with frequent applications in predicting O3 concentrations, identifying source contributions, and formulating effective control strategies. The accuracy and reliability of the simulated O3 concentrations are typically assessed through model performance evaluation (MPE). However, the wide array of CTMs available, variations in input data, model setups, and other factors result in a broad range of differences between simulated and observed O3 concentrations, highlighting the necessity of standardized benchmarks in O3 evaluation.Building upon our previous work, this study conducted a thorough literature review of CTM applications simulating O3 in China from 2006 to 2021. A total of 216 relevant articles out of a total of 667 reviewed were identified to extract quantitative MPE results and key model configurations. From our analysis, two sets of benchmark values for six commonly used MPE metrics are proposed for CTM applications in China, categorized into “goal” benchmarks representing optimal model performance and “criteria” benchmarks representing achievable model performance across a majority of studies. It is recommended that the normalized mean bias (NMB) for hourly O3 and daily 8 h maximum O3 concentrations should ideally fall within ±15 % and ±10 %, respectively, to meet the goal benchmark. If the criteria benchmarks are to be met, the NMB should be within ±30 % and ±20 %, respectively. Moreover, uncertainties in O3 predictions due to uncertainties in various model inputs were quantified using the decoupled direct method (DDM) in a commonly used CTM. For the simulation period of June 2021, the total uncertainty of simulated O3 ranged from 4 to 25 µg m−3, with anthropogenic volatile organic compound (AVOC) emissions contributing most to the uncertainty regarding O3 in coastal regions and with O3 boundary conditions playing a dominant role in the northwestern region. The proposed benchmarks for assessing simulated O3 concentrations, in conjunction with our previous studies on PM2.5 and other criteria air pollutants, represent a comprehensive and systematic effort to establish a model performance framework for CTM applications in China. These benchmarks aim to support the growing modeling community in China by offering a robust set of evaluation metrics and establishing a consistent evaluation methodology relative to the body of prior research, thereby helping to establish the credibility and reliability of CTM applications. These statistical benchmarks need to be periodically updated as models advance and as better inputs become available in the future."

The dataset is especially relevant for developing data-driven and hybrid physically informed modeling frameworks. 
 Large samples of hydrometeorological time series and catchment attributes are critical for improving the understanding of complex hydrological processes, hydrological model development, and performance benchmarking. CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets have been developed in several countries and regions around the world, providing valuable data sources and test beds for hydrological analysis and new frontiers in data-driven hydrological modeling. Regarding the lack of samples from lowland, groundwater-dominated, small-sized catchments, we develop an extensive repository of a CAMELS-style dataset for Denmark (CAMELS-DK). This CAMELS addition is the first containing both gauged and ungauged catchments as well as detailed groundwater information. The dataset provides dynamic and static variables for 3330 catchments covering all of Denmark from various hydrogeological datasets, meteorological observations, and a well-established national-scale hydrological model. For 304 of those catchments, streamflow observations are provided, whereas simulated streamflow is provided for all 3330 catchments. The dataset contains time series spanning 30 years (1989–2019) with a daily time step, and the data will be updated once new observations and model simulations become available. The dense and full spatial coverage for all 3330 catchments, instead of only gauged catchments, together with the addition of various simulation data from a distributed, process-based model, enhances the applicability of such CAMELS data, for example, for the development of data-driven and hybrid physically informed modeling frameworks or other cases where consistent full spatial coverage is required.

Here, we compiled reference soil data on these FRNs from the literature to build a comprehensive database. Using this database, we determined the distribution and sources of 137Cs and 239+240Pu. We also demonstrated how the database can be used to identify the environmental factors that influence their distribution using a machine learning algorithm. 
 Past nuclear weapons testing (NWT) and nuclear power plant (NPP) accidents have resulted in the ubiquitous deposition of radionuclides in the environment. These fallout radionuclides (FRNs) are considered the privileged markers (“golden spikes”) of the Anthropocene stratigraphic layers. Their deposition in the 1950s coincided with the “Great Acceleration”, which is characterized by large-scale shifts in the Earth's systems, including increased land-use change and soil degradation. Among the FRNs deposited globally, 137Cs has been the most commonly used to assess soil erosion and/or the chronology of sediment deposition, while 239+240Pu is an alternative soil erosion tracer and chronological marker that has been increasingly used due to a number of advantages.We compiled 137Cs and 239+240Pu data published from undisturbed (so-called “reference”) soils in the equatorial and Southern Hemisphere regions to build a database within the framework of the AVATAR (A reVised dATing framework for quantifying geomorphological processes during the Anthropocene) project. Using this database, named the AVATAR-Soils Database, we determined the distribution of 137Cs and 239+240Pu inventories in equatorial and Southern Hemisphere soils, along with the relative contributions of different fallout nuclear weapon sources by analyzing their isotopic ratios. Additionally, we demonstrated how the database can be used to identify the environmental factors that influence the distribution of 137Cs and 239+240Pu in reference soils by applying a machine learning algorithm.Our meta-analysis revealed that high 137Cs and 239+240Pu inventories were recorded near the Equator and within the 20–40° S latitudinal bands, which coincide with the location of multiple NWT locations. The 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratios suggest that sources other than the global fallout (primarily from US and USSR weapon testing with a 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of ∼ 0.18) contributed to the reference inventories in the Southern Hemisphere. These additional sources have been relatively neglected so far. Based on the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratios, we have estimated that the French fallout contributed ∼ 20 % to the reference soil 239+240Pu inventories in South America and up to 70 % in French Polynesia. In contrast, the British fallout contributed ∼ 27 % to the reference soil 239+240Pu inventories in the rest of Oceania. Our machine learning algorithm identified the precipitation of the coldest quarter, longitude, and latitude as the strongest predictors of the 137Cs inventory. For the 239+240Pu inventory, the mean diurnal temperature range, the annual temperature range, and the precipitation of the driest quarter were the strongest predictors. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the potential of the AVATAR-Soils Database as a resource for improving our understanding of the distribution and sources of 137Cs and 239+240Pu in equatorial and Southern Hemisphere soils and refining their application as tools in various Earth science research.

By combining ground measurements, satellite observations, and weather data with a machine learning method, we accurately captured the spatial and temporal variations of soil temperature at different depths. The dataset offers a scientific basis for agricultural management and ecological research. 
 Soil temperature (Ts) is critical in regulating agricultural production, ecosystem functions, hydrological cycling and climate dynamics. However, the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil thermal regimes constitutes a persistent challenge in obtaining high-resolution, continuous gridded Ts datasets along vertical profiles. To address this issue, we propose a spatially adaptive layer-cascading Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to generate daily multi-layer Ts data (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 cm) at a spatial resolution of 1 km in China from 2010 to 2020. The methodology dynamically partitions non-uniformly distributed measuring sites (2,093 sites across the country) to quadtrees and incorporates thermal coupling effects propagated between neighbor soil layers. Multi-source data, including satellite retrievals of land surface temperature and vegetation index, and ERA5 reanalysis climate variables were used as inputs. Independent tests demonstrated high robustness and accuracy of our model, with depth-specific values of coefficients of determination (R²) being 0.94~0.98 and root mean square errors (RMSE) values ranging 1.75~2.21K. It is noted the model’s performance was lower in summers and winters than in springs and autumns. Compared to existing global or regional Ts products, the dataset developed here is characterized by its fine spatio-temporal patterns and high reliability, enabling it to provide supports for precision agriculture, ecosystem modeling and understanding climate-land feedback.

 Measurements of stable water isotopes in the atmospheric water vapour can be used to better understand the physical processes of the atmospheric water cycle. In polar regions, it is a key parameter to understand the link between the precipitation and snow isotopic compositions and interpret isotope climate records from ice cores. In this study we present a novel 2.5-month record of the atmospheric water vapour isotopic composition during the austral summer 2023–2024 at Concordia Station (East Antarctica), from two independently calibrated laser spectrometers (CRDS and OF-CEAS measurement techniques) which are optimised to measure in low humidity environments. We show that both instruments accurately measure the summertime diurnal variability in the water vapour 𝛿18O, 𝛿D, and d-excess when the water vapour mixing ratio is higher than 200 ppmv. We compare these measurements to the outputs of the isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ6-iso and show that the model exhibits biases in both the mean water vapour isotopic composition and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, consistent with previous studies. Hence, this study provides a novel dataset of the atmospheric water vapour isotopic composition on the Antarctic Plateau, which can be used to evaluate isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation models.

LM4-SHARC (soil–hillslope aquifer–river continuum) describes the hillslope groundwater using its emergent properties, yielding noticeable improvements in soil moisture/temperature and groundwater discharge predictions. The implications of groundwater-mediated hydrologic interactions between hillslopes and streams need further exploration in the Earth system modeling community. 
 Catchment-scale representation of the groundwater and its interaction with other parts of the hydrologic cycle is crucial for accurately depicting the land water–energy balance in Earth system models (ESMs). Despite existing efforts to describe the groundwater in the land component of ESMs, most ESMs still need a prognostic framework for describing catchment-scale groundwater based on its emergent properties to understand the implications for the broader Earth system. To fill this gap, we developed a new parameterization scheme to resolve the groundwater and its two-way interactions with the unsaturated soil and stream at the catchment scale. We implemented this new parameterization scheme (SHARC, or the soil–hillslope aquifer–river continuum) in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model (i.e., LM4-SHARC) and evaluated its performance. By bridging the gap between hydraulic groundwater theory and ESM land hydrology, the new LM4-SHARC provides a path to learning groundwater emergent properties from available streamflow data (i.e., recession analysis), enhancing the representation of subgrid variability in water–energy states induced by the groundwater.  LM4-SHARC has been applied to the Providence headwater catchment at Southern Sierra, NV, and tested against in situ observations. We found that LM4-SHARC leads to noticeable improvements in the representation of key hydrologic variables such as streamflow, near-surface soil moisture, and soil temperature. In addition to enhancing the representation of the water and energy balance, our analysis showed that accounting for groundwater convergence can induce a more significant hydrologic contrast, with higher sensitivity of soil water storage to groundwater properties in the riparian zone. Our findings indicate the feasibility of incorporating two-way interactions among groundwater, unsaturated soil, and streams into the hydrological components of ESMs and show a further need to explore the implications of these interactions in the context of Earth system dynamics."

However, the vast area of the ocean and budgetary constraints make conducting comprehensive surveys to assess MP pollution impractical. Interpretable machine learning (ML) offers an effective solution. Herein, we used four ML algorithms based on MP data calibrated to the size range of 20–5000 μm and considered various factors to construct a robust predictive ML model of marine MP distribution. Interpretation of the ML model indicated that biogeochemical and anthropogenic factors substantially influence global marine MP pollution, while atmospheric and physical factors exert lesser effects. However, the extent of the influence of each factor may vary within specific marine regions and their underlying mechanisms may differ across regions. The predicted results indicated that the global marine MP concentrations ranged from 0.176 to 27.055 particles/m3 and that MPs in the 20–5000-μm size range did not pose a potential ecological risk. The interpretable ML framework developed in this study covered MP data preprocessing, MP distribution prediction, and interpretation of the influencing factors of MPs, providing an essential reference for marine MP pollution management and decision making."

In this study, peracetic acid (PAA) was employed in combination with natural protocatechuic acid (PCA) to remove sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) from water. More than 95% removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and other SAs was observed in the PCA/PAA system, and neutral pH conditions (5.0–8.0) were more conducive to the removal of SMX. The PCA/PAA system exhibited a great anti-interference ability against complex water matrices. ortho-Quinone, generated from the oxidation of PCA by PAA, played a dominant role in the SMX removal. Electrons tended to transfer from SMX to the generated ortho-quinones and form covalent bonds, resulting in the production of less toxic oligomers via the overlooked polymerization pathway. A reduction in the toxicity of the SMX solution was found following treatment with the PCA/PAA system. More interestingly, several polyphenols structurally related to PCA could also facilitate SMX removal using PAA as the oxidant. Overall, this study proposes a novel strategy for developing reactive quinones dominated AOPs with robust anti-interference performance, as well as enhances the understanding of contaminant removal via an overlooked polymerization pathway in natural polyphenol-related AOPs."

PAHs are toxic to microorganisms and pose ecological risks. Bacteria encode enzymes for PAH degradation through specific genes, thereby mitigating PAH pollution. However, due to PAHs’ complexity, information on the global degradation potential, diversity, and associated risks of PAH-degrading microbes in soils is lacking. In this study, we analyzed 121 PAH-degrading genes and selected 33 as marker genes to predict the degradation potential within the soil microbiome. By constructing a Hidden Markov Model, we identified 4990 species carrying PAH-degrading genes in 40,039 soil metagenomic assembly genomes, with Burkholderiaceae and Stellaceae emerging as high-potential degraders. We demonstrated that the candidate PAH degraders predominantly emerged in artificial soil and farmland, with significantly fewer present in extreme environments, driven by factors such as average annual rainfall, organic carbon, and human modification of terrestrial systems. Furthermore, we comprehensively quantified the potential risks of each potential host in future practical applications using three indicators (antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, and pathogenic bacteria). We found that the degrader Stellaceae has significant application prospects. Our research will help determine the biosynthetic potential of PAH-degrading enzymes globally and further identify potential PAH-degrading bacteria at lower risk."

In this Perspective, we summarize these discrepancies and prior explanations provided for their occurrence. Through modeling using two linear free energy relationships (i.e., the Swain–Scott and the Bro̷nsted relationships), we propose a simple but overlooked alternative explanation─namely, that hydrolysis reactions are often much more sensitive to constituents in laboratory buffers than often assumed. We suggest that buffers employed in standard practices (e.g., at 50 mM or higher concentrations recommended by regulatory guidelines) are expected to significantly catalyze many hydrolysis reactions by acting as nucleophiles or bases. Finally, we recommend strategies to successfully measure hydrolysis rates for more accurate predictions of contaminant transformation in environmental systems."

In this study, we explored the gut and liver toxicity caused by the overflow of Cu(I) at low doses of Cu exposure. Here, we first elucidated the digestive and metabolic systems as the main toxic target sites by a systematic epidemiological analysis. Then, ICP-MS analysis verified that the gut and liver were the top two Cu-high-accumulated organs in zebrafish exposed to 10 and 100 μg/L waterborne Cu for 72 h. In-situ Cu(I) and Cu(II) imaging techniques demonstrated that exogenous Cu(II) was converted to Cu(I) in the zebrafish gut. Furthermore, transcriptomic sequencing revealed that the high overflow of Cu(I) induced gut toxicity by cell cycle arrest in the G phase. However, the substantial accumulation of Cu(I) disrupted the metabolism of energy source nutrients and energy supply, leading to hepatic toxicity.

 The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTreg5–7, their definition remains incomplete, and the APC responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we identify an APC subset required for differentiation of both food- and microbiota-specific pTreg cells and for establishment of oral tolerance. Development and function of these APCs require expression of the transcription factors Prdm16 and RORγt, as well as a unique Rorc(t) cis-regulatory element. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and surface marker analysis establish the pTreg-inducing APCs as myeloid in origin, distinct from ILC3, and sharing epigenetic profiles with classical dendritic cells (cDC), and designate them Prdm16+ RORγt+ tolerizing DC (tolDC). Upon genetic perturbation of tolDC, we observe a substantial increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTreg, leading to compromised tolerance in mouse models of asthma and food allergy. Single-cell analyses of freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, as well as multiple specimens of human intestine and tonsil, reveal candidate tolDC with co-expression of PRDM16 and RORC and an extensive transcriptome shared with mice, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved role across species.

Here, authors design a redox-active polymeric network to boost the direct conversion of captured CO2 to multicarbon products with CO2-free gas product stream. 
 Reactive capture – the integration of CO2 capture with electrochemical upgrade – offers the prospect of improving overall energy efficiency in captured-CO2-to-fuels by eliminating the gas-phase CO2 desorption step, and by further offering a CO2-free gas product stream. Two related challenges limit the potential impact of electrified reactive capture today: its propensity to produce lower-value C1 products (carbon products containing one carbon atom per molecule); and its failure to retain performance when fed dilute streams (e.g. ~1-10% CO2). We posit that these could be addressed using catalysts that locally concentrate and activate in-situ generated CO2: we integrate a redox-active polymeric network whose polymer fragments undergo reversible reduction during the electrochemical conversion process, enabling electron transfer to CO2 molecules generated in-situ from carbonate capture liquid. We report as a result a 55 ± 5% C2+ (carbon products containing two or more carbon atoms per molecule) Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 300 mA/cm2 in an electrochemical reactive capture system in which the electrolysis stage is fed with 1 M K2CO3. We obtain 56 ± 4 wt% C2H4 in the product gas stream. When we use a dilute stream consisting of 1% CO2 in N2 at the KOH capture stage, we retain the C2+ FE to within 85% (relative) of its value achieved in the case of pure CO2.

Implications in neutrophil activity, inflammatory protein levels (e.g., IL1RL1), and biological pathways of immune functions are also explored. 
 Infants with severe bronchiolitis (i.e., bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization) face increased risks of respiratory diseases in childhood. We conduct epigenome-wide association studies in a multi-ethnic cohort of these infants. We identify 61 differentially methylated regions in infant blood (<1 year of age) associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 (170 cases, 318 non-cases) and/or asthma by age 6 (112 cases, 394 non-cases). These differentially methylated regions are enriched in the enhancers of peripheral blood neutrophils. Several differentially methylated regions exhibit interaction with rhinovirus infection and/or specific blood cell types. In the same blood samples, circulating levels of 104 proteins correlate with the differentially methylated regions, and many proteins show phenotypic association with asthma. Through Mendelian randomization, we find causal evidence supporting a protective role of higher plasma ST2 (also known as IL1RL1) protein against asthma. DNA methylation is also associated with ST2 protein level in infant blood. Taken together, our findings suggest the contribution of DNA methylation to asthma development through regulating early-life systemic immune responses.

 Van der Waals moiré heterostructure have been found to exhibits a robust interfacial ferroelectricity down to atomic thickness, and discovering and understanding the complex polarization state in moiré systems is of fundamental interest to condensed-matter research. In this study, we examine the moiré ferroelectricity in twisted h-BN heterostructure by piezoresponse force microscopy. Due to atomic reconstruction, triangular moiré patterns are detected, and we directly observe sliding ferroelectricity in the center of triangular moiré patterns as well as robust in-plane polarization topology emerging at the boundary of adjacent triangles, which we call edge polarization. The edge polarization possesses non-trivial and robust vortex polarization topology. Our calculations trace the origin of this phenomenon to joined piezoelectric effects with sliding ferroelectricity. This work provides intuitive insights to explore the unique moiré ferroelectricity in non-polar background matrix, and the inherent stability of the topological structures ensures reliable and durable performance of electronic devices.

 Dysregulated protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway can induce numerous disease phenotypes, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. While small molecule-based targeted protein degradation (TPD) and targeted protein stabilization (TPS) platforms can address this dysregulation, they rely on structured and stable binding pockets, which do not exist to classically “undruggable” targets. Here, we expand the TPS target space by engineering “deubiquibodies” (duAbs) via fusion of computationally-designed peptide binders to the catalytic domain of the potent OTUB1 deubiquitinase. In human cells, duAbs effectively stabilize exogenous and endogenous proteins in a DUB-dependent manner. Using protein language models to generate target-binding peptides, we engineer duAbs to conformationally diverse target proteins, including key tumor suppressor proteins p53 and WEE1, and heavily-disordered fusion oncoproteins, such as PAX3::FOXO1. We further encapsulate p53-targeting duAbs as mRNA in lipid nanoparticles and demonstrate effective intracellular delivery, p53 stabilization, and apoptosis activation, motivating further in vivo translation.

Here, the authors show that MGAT1 modulation of CD73 glycosylation and function regulates tumor immune response in triple-negative breast cancer. 
 Despite the widespread application of immunotherapy, treating immune-cold tumors remains a significant challenge in cancer therapy. Using multiomic spatial analyses and experimental validation, we identify MGAT1, a glycosyltransferase, as a pivotal factor governing tumor immune response. Overexpression of MGAT1 leads to immune evasion due to aberrant elevation of CD73 membrane translocation, which suppresses CD8+ T cell function, especially in immune-cold triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistically, addition of N-acetylglucosamine to CD73 by MGAT1 enables the CD73 dimerization necessary for CD73 loading onto VAMP3, ensuring membrane fusion. We further show that THBS1 is an upstream etiological factor orchestrating the MGAT1-CD73-VAMP3-adenosine axis in suppressing CD8+ T cell antitumor activity. Spatial transcriptomic profiling reveals spatially resolved features of interacting malignant and immune cells pertaining to expression levels of MGAT1 and CD73. In preclinical models of TNBC, W-GTF01, an inhibitor specifically blocked the MGAT1-catalyzed CD73 glycosylation, sensitizing refractory tumors to anti-PD-L1 therapy via restoring capacity to elicit a CD8+ IFNγ-producing T cell response. Collectively, our findings uncover a strategy for targeting the immunosuppressive molecule CD73 by inhibiting MGAT1.

 Ferroptosis, a form of cell death instigated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation reactions (LPO), is emerging as a promising therapeutic target for cancer. While the mechanisms governing LPO induction and suppression have gradually been unveiled, questions persist regarding the specific cellular location of LPO and the utilization of iron in driving cell death. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects holds significant potential for advancing therapeutic applications in disease management. Here, we show lysosomal LPO in the initiation of ferroptosis, leveraging the hidden abilities of fluorescent detection probes. Intra-lysosomal LPO triggers iron leakage, fostering cell-wide LPO by augmenting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Conversely, cell lines with low susceptibility to ferroptosis do not exhibit LMP. This deficiency is rectified by the concurrent administration of chloroquine, leading to LMP induction and subsequent cell death. These findings underscore enhancing LMP induction efficacy as a strategic approach to surmount resistance to therapies in cancer. The early events in ferroptosis are not clear.

 High-temperature exposure has important implications for mental and behavioural disorders (MBDs), which could lead to increased risks under climate change.

 The sea ice variabilities in West Antarctica, crucial for both local and global climate systems, are profoundly affected by the sea surface temperature anomalies over the tropical Atlantic. Analyses based on observational data and numerical model experiments demonstrate that the two recently identified Atlantic Niño types, central and eastern Atlantic Niño (CAN and EAN), have distinct impacts on the sea ice concentration in West Antarctica. The CAN stimulates two atmospheric Rossby wave trains in the Southern Hemisphere through both direct and indirect pathways, collectively strengthening the Amundsen Sea Low. In contrast, the EAN only excites one atmospheric wave train over the South Pacific through an indirect pathway, due to its associated weaker local Hadley circulation, which fails to establish a significant Rossby wave source in the subtropical South Atlantic. Consequently, compared to the EAN, the atmospheric circulation and the associated sea ice concentration anomalies in West Antarctica during the CAN are stronger and more extensive. Therefore, distinguishing between the two Atlantic Niño types could potentially enhance the seasonal prediction capabilities for sea ice concentration in West Antarctica."

Here, we establish that the seasonal prediction of ERE frequency during Indian monsoon is associated with the global El Niño-Southern Oscillation (G-ENSO) in a manner similar to the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR). We develop a deep learning model trained on the physical relationship between seasonal frequency of ERE and G-ENSO from an ensemble of Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for skillful seasonal forecast of ERE frequency at one-month lead. Integrating such seasonal forecasts of ERE frequency with ISMR seasonal forecast system is likely to be critical in disaster preparedness and loss minimization against increasing threat of ERE frequency damages in coming decades."

 Despite advancements in understanding the rupture processes and surface deformations of the 2023 Türkiye earthquake doublet, their seismogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed a joint tomographic method utilizing 215,906 P- and S-wave arrival time pairs to determine the fine-scale seismic and porosity structures in the rupture zones. We find that the first Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred in a brittle or near-brittle structure zone with low porosity and fluid saturation, offering a potential condition for brittle failure with supershear rupture. By contrast, the second Mw 7.6 quake initiated in a ductile belt characterized by high porosity and fluid saturation, explaining the observed sub-shear rupture behaviors. The former induces large decreasing normal stress, thus opening the Çardak fault, accelerating the migration of saturated fluids towards the fault zone through intra-crustal faults and extended cracks, increasing pore pressure, and delaying triggering a second earthquake. Our findings reveal the diverse seismogenic mechanisms of the Türkiye earthquake doublet, suggesting that fluid intrusion may have played a crucial role in triggering the second Mw 7.6 quake.

 Satellite altimetry has become an indispensable technique for large-scale monitoring of inland water levels, which is fundamental to understanding the hydrologic dynamics of surface water and informed water resource management in the scenario of changing climate. Yet the capacity of inland altimetry can be further improved regarding the accuracy and the spatial-temporal coverage of water level estimates. This study presents a new Multiple Persistent Peaks (MPP) retracker to improve the retrieval of inland water levels from satellite radar altimetry. Focusing on the long-term Jason-2/3 observations, we demonstrate how the MPP retracker works in the case of complex and multipeaked waveforms commonly encountered in inland radar altimetry. The MPP retracker determines surface elevations of the target water body by grouping and multi-objective analysis of multiple along-track height profiles corresponding to persistent peaks in the aligned averaged waveform. We evaluated the results globally at 41 gauge stations and 6 crossovers with various climate, terrain, and hydrologic settings. The root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the altimetry-derived water levels with in situ measurements is between 0.19 m and 0.78 m (median value of 0.38 m) and within the range of 0.25–0.49 m at crossovers. The validations show that the new automated method outperforms classical retrackers in terms of accuracy and robustness and is applicable to both pulse-limited and SAR altimetry. Our approach successfully retrieved good quality water level time series at river reaches with highly heterogeneous landscapes where most retrackers exhibit errors of several meters. Based on the MPP retracker, we provided an efficient tool for sophisticated outliers filtering and correction in the final time series, which is desirable for expert evaluation and improving the quality of altimetry-derived water level products. The new automated retracker and the tool we provided is a critical step toward improved monitoring of inland water levels from satellite altimetry on a global and long-term scale."

 The Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) is a visible-to-shortwave infrared imaging spectrometer currently aboard the International Space Station. Derivations of fractional cover from spectral unmixing algorithms have provided insights into various ecosystem functions. In the case of EMIT, they will be used by multiple global Earth systems models to constrain the sign of dust-related radiative forcing. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of different approaches for estimating fractional cover and quantifying the corresponding uncertainty, and serves as a model to encapsulate the true error budget for EMIT. We simulated surface reflectance from a spectral library compiled from various drylands to generate millions of candidate spectra made up of different random fractions of nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green vegetation (GV), and soil. Simulated spectra were used as-is but we also tested the impact of atmospheric conditions/surface reflectance retrieval by using them to calculate top-of-atmosphere radiance then using the current EMIT surface reflectance retrieval algorithm to estimate apparent surface reflectance. We tested approaches to unmixing these simulated spectra using multiple strategies for dealing with spectrum brightness, within-class spectral variability, and library selection.

 Recent advancements in data storage and computing, particularly cloud-based processing, enable mapping global land cover and change relatively quickly and easily. Multiple versions of a map could be produced within a matter of days with various adjustments of selected parameters of machine learning models. Sample-based validation is then required to establish correspondence between these map prototypes and the real world, thus turning them from algorithm data outputs into sources of information with quantified errors. Implementing global probability sampling of geographic data for the purposes of area estimation and map accuracy assessment presents multiple challenges, primarily linked to the way these geographic data are stored (coordinate systems and projections) and the objectives of the specific project. Here we summarize various approaches to global sampling aimed at assessing accuracy of global land cover and change maps and producing unbiased estimators of area along with the standard errors associated with these estimates for the target land cover classes. We provide a unified set of estimators that accommodate a variety of sampling designs by explicitly accounting for the area of each sample unit, as well as code and technical details necessary to implement the presented methods. While we do not compare relative precision of the presented sampling design options, our aim is to help practitioners select an appropriate sampling design and estimators for their specific data format and project objectives, and to facilitate the correct implementation and increased reproducibility of global sampling methods within the land cover mapping community."

 Up-to-date mapping of built-up areas is of paramount importance for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in employing supervised machine learning and deep learning methods to map built-up areas using satellite SAR and optical data. However, the laborious and expensive task of gathering and maintaining a vast array of diverse training data poses a challenge to the widespread adoption of these methods for large-scale built-up area mapping. This paper presents a two-step framework enabling an automated extraction of built-up areas using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Initially, training data for built-up and non-built-up classes are automatically sampled and labeled from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for a given area of interest. Subsequently, a cross-fusion neural network is trained using the samples from the first step to produce a built-up map for the entire study area. To enhance the network’s resilience to label noise, a contextual virtual adversarial training (CVAT) regularization is introduced within the mean-teacher architecture. Our proposed framework was tested on 48 different study areas across the world. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness for large-scale built-up area extraction. The versatility of our framework in generating accurate and up-to-date built-up information, which is essential for monitoring urban environments and assessing economic losses resulting from natural disasters, is highlighted through comparisons with four state-of-the-art global built-up products: Global Human Settlement Built-up map based on 2018 Sentinel-2 composites (GHS-BUILT-S2), World Settlement Footprint 2019 (WSF 2019), ESA World Cover, and Dynamic World."

 Investigations into the characteristics and phase-partitioning behavior of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (alkyl-PAHs) during coal combustion process remain notably limited. This study aims to analyze the source characteristics, distribution patterns, and partitioning mechanisms of parent and alkyl-PAHs in gas and particle phase emissions from coal combustion. The results show that 30.77 %–49.37 % of parent PAHs from coking, gas, lean and fat coal combustion emissions are distributed in gas phases, while it accounts for 78.59 % in lignite coal combustion emission. In terms of alkyl-PAHs, 79.05 %–89.45 % of coking, gas and lean coal combustion emissions are presented in particle phases, and 62.66 %–69.32 % of lignite and fat coal combustion emissions are presented in gas phases. Moreover, the PAH p-values from coal combustion emissions are in the range of −1.00 to −0.68, and the alkylated ones range from −0.80 to −0.54. Interestingly, alkylated phenanthrenes maintain a high degree of uniformity in the distribution patterns of combustion emissions, and their bell-shape distribution pattern performs to be a potential indicator of coal combustion. Furthermore, by employing partitioning models, it can be proven that absorption and adsorption are governing PAH partitioning mechanisms, and alkyl-PAHs can reach equilibrium more rapidly than parent PAHs. These findings offer detailed data into source analysis and the fate of alkyl-PAHs from coal combustion, which is expected to be helpful for environmental behavior investigation and better pollution control of coal combustion."

However, conserving peatlands in many tropical areas is challenging due to limited knowledge of their distribution. To address this, we surveyed soils and plant communities in Colombia’s eastern lowlands, where few peatlands have previously been described. We documented peat soils >40 cm thick at 51 of more than 100 surveyed wetlands. We use our data to update a regional peatland classification, which includes a new and possibly widespread peatland type, ‘the white-sand peatland,’ as well as two distinctive open-canopy sub-types. Analysis of peat bulk density and organic matter content from 39 intact peat cores indicates that the average per-area carbon densities of these sites (490–1230 Mg C ha−1, depending on type) is 4–10 times the typical carbon stock of a (non-peatland) Amazonian forest. We used remote sensing to upscale our observations, generating the first data-driven peatland map for the region. The total estimated carbon stock of these peatlands of 1.91 petagrams (Pg C) (2-sigma confidence interval, 0.60–4.22) approaches that of South America’s largest known peatland complex in the northern Peruvian Amazon, indicating that substantial peat carbon stores on the continent have yet to be documented. These observations indicate that tropical peatlands may be far more diverse in form and structure and broadly distributed than is widely understood, which could have important implications for tropical peatland conservation strategies."

However, little is known about the extent to which LC and drainage density interact to alter fire occurrence. Here, we assess the relationship between these variables in the peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia, spanning a five-year period of inter-annual climatic variability. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite imagery was used to map active fire hotspots. Drained peatlands experienced up to 13 times greater annual mean hotspot density (number of fire hotspots per km2) when compared to peatlands without canals. The greatest difference in fire hotspot density between drained and undrained peatlands occurred in forested peatlands (by a factor of 2.6–13.3), followed by shrublands (1.1–7.6), crop lands (1.4–5.0) and plantations (1.2–2.6), where largest differences were found in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral years. We found a curvilinear relationship between hotspot density and canal density, with the relationship depending on LC and ENSO status. At low to moderate drainage density, hotspot density increased with drainage density in all LC types in 2013–2017. Heavily drained plantations experienced a lower hotspot density than moderately drained plantations possibly due to factors such as management practices or impacts of previous fire history. The relationship with drainage density was strongest in 2013, an ENSO-neutral year, and weakest in the strong El Niño of 2015. Our findings support the critical need for fire management in drained tropical peat areas. Peat fire management planning and peatland restoration should be tailored to the differing responses of fire to climate variability, drainage density and LC types."

This systematic literature review examines the latest developments in Climate Risk Assessment (CRA), focusing on how climate risks are framed and assessed. It explores advancements, ongoing challenges, and emerging opportunities to guide future generations of CRAs. Key findings highlight a more nuanced risk framework that incorporates climate responses, modulating the three risk determinants (exposure, vulnerability, and hazards), as outlined in the latest IPCC assessment. The state-of-the-art concentrates on the temporal and spatial characteristics of hazards, while exposure and vulnerability are increasingly understood as dynamic concepts influenced by socioeconomic changes. Recent developments, such as multi-hazard approaches, risk tolerance integration, and the concept of Climatic Impact-Drivers (CID), provide new perspectives on assessing climate risks. However, managing complexity and uncertainty remain the main operational challenges, underscoring the need for improved CRA methodologies and models, as well as consistent, interoperable datasets. The paper discusses avenues to advance CRA, emphasizing the importance of bridging the gap between academic advancements and practical implementation. Conceptual recommendations include adopting a systemic approach to, for example, better account for the cascading and compounding risks, hazard thresholds, adaptation limits, and risk amplifiers, as well as using storylines to improve CRA communication. Technical recommendations include leveraging emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning methods and big data analytics to improve real-time risk prediction and modeling. To enhance the CRA practice, the study advocates for greater stakeholder involvement and inclusive governance to ensure that CRAs remain context-specific and relevant. These recommendations, together with strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge-sharing, are expected to pave the way for more effective climate risk management, adaptation, and resilience-building strategies."

The survey provides valuable information regarding landcover, land use, and environmental parameters across European Union countries on a three-year basis since 2006. Recently, the survey has been used to monitor grazing in semi-natural habitats such as livestock agroforestry. However, in recent years LUCAS has become more reliant on photo-interpretation in the second phase of the survey. We identified an underreporting (p < 0.001) of grazing in points surveyed using photo-interpretation and statistically corrected for this systematic bias. We analysed the extents of grazing under woody and wetland landcovers in the United Kingdom over time, comparing extents estimated from the raw LUCAS data, statistically corrected data, and data from only field surveyed points. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first estimation of the extent of grazing under wetland habitats in the United Kingdom, which we estimated to be approximately 72 000 hectares in 2018. This paper updated the extent of livestock agroforestry in the United Kingdom, estimating that over 300 000 hectares of woody landcovers were grazed in 2018, which would have been underestimated by almost 100 000 hectares if statistical corrections had not been applied.

Biases in the IAGOS water vapour dataset are adjusted, based on the more accurate IAGOS-CARIBIC data. The resulting highly resolved H2O climatologies will contribute to a better understanding of the H2O variability in the UT/LS and its connection to various transport and mixing processes. 
 This study presents a new methodology to derive adjusted water vapour (H2O) climatologies for the extra-tropical upper troposphere  and lowermost stratosphere (UT/LMS) from regular measurements on board passenger aircraft between 1994 and 2022 within the IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System) research infrastructure. A synthesis of mean H2O is performed by sampling air mass bins of similar origin and thermodynamic conditions relative to the tropopause between a dataset from 60 000 flights employing the IAGOS-MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone by AIRBUS In-Service Aircraft) and IAGOS-CORE capacitive hygrometer (ICH) and a dataset of 500 flights using the more sophisticated IAGOS-CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) hygrometer. The analysis is, in combination with ECMWF ERA5 meteorological data, accomplished for the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere, where the datasets have the largest common coverage. We find very good agreement in the UT but a systematic positive humidity bias in the ICH measurements for the LMS. To account for this bias, mean H2O of the ICH is adjusted to the IAGOS-CARIBIC measurements based on a new mapping and adjustment approach. After applying this new method, the LMS H2O measurements are in good agreement between all investigated platforms. The extensive H2O dataset from the compact IAGOS sensor can now be used to produce highly resolved H2O climatologies for the climatically sensitive LMS region."

Our result reveals that the global radiative forcing (RF) induced by LUC driving surface albedo change is −0.12 W m−2, 20 % lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and vegetation changes play a key role in RF evolution, which provides an important reference for the assessment of earth energy balance. 
 Land-use change (LUC) is ranked as the second anthropogenic source of climate change after fossil fuel burning and yields negative albedo-induced radiative forcing (ARF). This cooling effect has been assessed using low spatiotemporally resolved LUC datasets derived from historical statistical data with large uncertainties. Herein, we implement a satellite-remote-sensing-derived highly resolved LUC dataset into a compact earth system model and reassess the global and regional surface ARF by LUC from 1983–2010 relative to 1750. We find that the magnitude of the negative ARF obtained from the present study is lower than that estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by 20 %, implying a weaker cooling effect.  The result reveals that the global LUC-induced surface albedo change may not significantly slow down global warming as was previously anticipated.  Sub-Saharan Africa made the largest net contribution to the magnitude of the global ARF (39.2 %), due to substantial land-use conversions, typically the conversion from forest to other vegetation lands, which are accompanied by higher surface albedos. The most remarkable land cover changes occurred in East and Southeast Asia, which dominated the changes in the global ARF in recent decades. Based on major land cover types in these two regions, we infer that vegetation lands exert the most vital effect on global ARF variation."

Our dataset meticulously documents 38 attributes of DFBDs, and we have utilized Google Earth for validation. Additionally, we discussed the applicability of landslide dam stability and peak-discharge models to DFBDs. This dataset offers a rich foundation of data for future studies on DFBDs. 
 Debris flows, as a special kind of landslide, often block rivers to form barrier dams and trigger a series of disasters such as upstream aggradation and outburst floods. The understanding of debris flow barrier dams (DFBDs) is poor, mostly due to existing studies focusing on individual events and a lack of summarization of multiple DFBD events. The existing global or regional datasets of landslide barrier dams (LDs) contain only a few cases of DFBDs and ignore the differences between DFBDs and other landslide barrier dams (LDs), such as the dams of rock slides, debris avalanches, or earth slides. To fill this gap, we reviewed 2519 high-quality literature and media reports. Focusing on identified debris flow damming events, a rigorous data review and validation process was conducted using Google Earth. A systematic approach was employed to prioritize conflicting information from various data sources. Consequently, a global dataset was compiled, encompassing 555 historical DFBDs from 1800 to 2023.This pioneering global dataset includes 6 categories and 38 attributes, detailing DFBDs. It captures basic information (location, the date of formation, etc.), dam characteristics (height, length, volume, etc.), lake characteristics (area, capacity, length), debris flow characteristics (velocity, discharge, volume, etc.), failure characteristics (peak discharge, loss of life, etc.), and climate characteristics (precipitation and temperature). Our dataset elucidates that DFBDs exhibit key features of instability, complete blockage, and overtopping failure. The number of such dams has notably increased, especially in China. A total of 15 % of channels showed recurrent debris flows, resulting in DFBDs that make up 35 % of all DFBDs. Further analysis suggests that the Ls (AHV) model should be used for priority use, followed by the DBI model, in the stability assessment of DFBDs. Compared to other barrier dam datasets, our dataset is more targeted places greater emphasis on the review of raw data, and stresses the unification of terminology and concepts (i.e., blockage modes and stability), ensuring the consistency and accuracy of the data.

The potential for DBPs to exacerbate cellular senescence, thereby linking exposure to health impacts, remains underexplored. In this study, MRC-5 cells were exposed to HAMs at concentrations of 2, 5, and 8 μg/L for 30 days to simulate long-term exposure to levels found in drinking water. All six tested HAMs significantly increased the cellular senescence degree and enriched the cellular senescence pathway at the proteomic-wide level. Specifically, HAMs upregulated microRNA-24 expression, which increased p16 mRNA levels and decreased p16 protein levels, thereby activating oncogene-induced senescence pathways. Additionally, HAMs were found to covalently bind to TNRC6A, activating the p53/p21 pathway. Principal component analysis highlighted the critical role of functional groups in activating senescence, and the interaction between HAMs and TNRC6A could extend to at least 27 other amide-containing DBPs. Prolonged exposure to HAMs at environmentally relevant levels notably exacerbates cellular senescence, shedding light on a commonly overlooked phenomenon. Given the widespread presence of DBPs in drinking water and their continuous exposure in humans, their role in cellular senescence represents an ongoing public health concern."

Estimating human exposure to phthalates via biomonitoring is challenging due to their complex metabolic pathways, resulting in a mass-balance gap between internal and external exposure. The relative contributions of the GIT and liver to phthalate metabolism remain underexplored. This study investigated the metabolism of three representative phthalate diesters─dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) in GIT. We first incubated these diesters in simulated stomach and small intestine fluids to identify the primary enzyme responsible for their hydrolysis. The kinetics were further investigated under varying pH conditions (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 or 7.5) to mimic the small intestine environment. Next, using a refined human physiologically based toxicokinetic model, we quantified the relative contributions of preabsorption intestinal versus postabsorption hepatic biotransformation to the body burden of phthalates. Our results suggested that DBP and DEHP were extensively metabolized (>90%) in the GIT by lipase, with comparatively lower hepatic involvement, while DEP underwent minimal preadsorption metabolism (13%) in the GIT, highlighting the influence of structure-dependent differences on metabolic rates. This study emphasized the importance of incorporating both intestinal and hepatic metabolism into toxicokinetic analyses. The findings demonstrate the GIT’s critical role in limiting phthalate bioavailability, underscoring the need to account for the intestinal first-pass effect in toxicokinetic models to enhance predictions of phthalate pharmacokinetics and health impacts."

Once IONSIV is loaded with radioactive species, it is considered waste and requires treatment by incorporation into a stable wasteform to prevent radionuclide release during disposal. This work presents a promising, novel candidate glass-ceramic wasteform based on pollucite for the immobilization of cesium-loaded IONSIV. The tailored glass-ceramic provides chemical and processing flexibility through the addition of small amounts of glass formers, with cesium partitioned predominantly to the more chemically durable ceramic phase. A high waste loading of ∼70–80 wt % was achieved, along with a consistent phase assemblage of pollucite, srilankite, rutile, and glass. The chemical durability of the candidate wasteform was assessed using the ASTM C1285 standard method, with the results indicating high chemical durability relative to other candidate materials for cesium immobilization. A single preferred pollucite glass-ceramic design with a 70 wt % waste loading was selected and validated using unloaded and Cs-loaded IONSIV. Importantly, the design ensures consistent phase formation irrespective of Cs-loading on IONSIV, demonstrating tolerance to accommodate compositional variations in the waste."

A key step in this process is the selective separation and recovery of high-grade metals from waste leachates containing complex metal mixtures; however, current strategies are limited by high chemical, energy, and resource consumption, substantial financial costs, and the production of hazardous byproducts. Herein, we report the pioneering use of ferritin─self-assembling protein nanocages with porous, hollow structures and supercharged inner surfaces─as a high-efficiency biosorbent for eco-friendly, selective metal recovery from mixtures. Ferritin nanocages adsorbed cobalt (Co2+), nickel (Ni2+), and lithium (Li+) primarily through electrostatic interactions, localizing the adsorbed metal cations within their cavities. Adsorption isotherms indicated significantly more effective adsorption of Co2+ and Ni2+ compared to Li+, enabling efficient Co2+/Ni2+ separation from Li+. Leveraging ferritin’s ability to concentrate adsorbed metal cations within cavities enabled selective recovery of Co2+ as nearly 95% pure solid carbonate salts from Co2+/Li+ mixtures through single-step precipitation under mild conditions, while Li+ remained in solution.

We observed enhancements of needle activity that were associated with the occurrence of M‐components identified by channel luminosity enhancements both at cloud altitudes and near the ground. Full‐fledged M‐components enhance needle activity via injection of negative charge into the bottom of grounded channel and reversing the direction of the radial electric field at the channel core, similar to +CG return strokes. Attempted M‐components, identified by channel luminosity enhancements at the cloud but not near the ground, did not enhance needle activity because of the absence of significant reflection from the ground, which causes electric field reversal at the core."

Seeding TCs using aerosols can be a promising method to reduce cyclone intensity, supported by theoretical understanding of the microphysical effects of aerosols on TC clouds. The ideal time to intervene effectively in TCs is likely during their initial stage, before TC wind speeds reach their peak. However, studies exploring potential aerosol effects on TC formation remain scarce. This study investigates how a TC embryo responds to the addition of aerosols of varying sizes using the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a spectral‐bin microphysics model. We found that aerosols of different sizes and concentrations distinctively affect the pre‐TC vortex's microstructure and dynamics. Fine and ultrafine aerosols enhance the latent heat of condensation, freezing, deposition, and riming, initially intensifying the vortex. However, this results in enhancement of the cold pool, thereby reducing inflow and surface fluxes, subsequently weakening the vortex. Coarse aerosols produce the opposite effect to that of fine and ultrafine aerosols. Coarse aerosols lead to a slower initial acceleration owing to enhanced warm rain. However, the resulting weaker cold pool is insufficient to effectively reduce the strength of the vortex at the later stage. This study provides critical insights into how aerosols of varying sizes and concentrations modulate the energy cascade and impact the evolution of a TC embryo, laying the groundwork for further research on TC risk management through aerosol intervention."
10.1029/2024JD043016,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇研究论文主要关注的是澳大利亚北部降雨量的年际变化，以及影响这种变化的各种因素。研究发现，厄尔尼诺-南方涛动（ENSO）和局部海面温度（SST）是影响降雨量变化的关键因素，特别是在10月和11月。随着澳大利亚夏季风的到来，海面温度的影响减弱，风-蒸发反馈成为影响降雨量变化的主要因素。虽然东北部地区在整个季风季节仍受到遥远气候驱动因素的影响，但西北部地区的降雨量变化主要受季风系统内部变化的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系，因为它主要关注气候模式和降雨量变化。,"['rainfall variability', 'El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)', 'sea surface temperatures (SSTs)', 'Australian monsoon', 'wind-evaporation feedback']",Hanna Heidemann;Sugata Narsey;Josephine Brown,What Drives Interannual Rainfall Variability Over Northern Australia?,"The interannual variability of northern Australian (NA) rainfall is caused by local processes as well as remote teleconnections, many of them being interrelated. Their influence evolves throughout the wet season, from October through April. Using a stepwise linear regression and examining individual months, we identify the key drivers for rainfall variability over northwest and northeast Australia. Our research shows that the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), followed by local sea surface temperatures (SSTs), are the key sources of rainfall variability in October and November. More specifically, the Arafura and Coral Sea SSTs contribute to rainfall variability over northwest Australia, while the Coral Sea SSTs strongly impact on northeast Australian rainfall during these months. The combined ENSO and local SST indices explain up to 50% of variance in observed NA spring monthly mean rainfall. However, the SST influence from both seas breaks down with the onset of the Australian summer monsoon in late December, and by January, SST indices explain zero variance in rainfall. Instead, December to March rainfall variability is associated with a wind‐evaporation feedback, which is particularly strong over northwest Australia. The evaporation index is the only predictor that we investigated that can explain any variance in northwest Australian rainfall in January. While the more purely monsoonal northwest of Australia is dominated by variability internal to the monsoon system, rainfall variability in the northeast retains some influence from remote climate drivers throughout the monsoon season. Further research is needed to clarify the processes and timescale involved in the wind‐evaporation feedback."

Here high‐resolution numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the multi‐layer urban canopy model (WRF/BEP, Building Effect Parameterization) are conducted to address this issue with the case of landfalling Typhoon Lekima (2019) over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration. Results show that the WRF/BEP reproduces the typhoon track and intensity reasonably well and the YRD urban agglomeration only slightly influences the typhoon track and intensity. The BEP significantly improves the overestimation and probability distribution of the 10 m wind speed attributed to the explicit representation of building surface drag effect. Urbanization enhances boundary layer vertical ascending and descending motions, aligning with cross‐sectional analyses along urban clusters. During the typhoon primarily influenced period, the attenuation rate of the daytime wind speed due to urbanization at the lowest level reaches 56.6%, which is about 15.5% larger than that during pre‐typhoon or post‐typhoon periods, leading to a more pronounced vertical gradient in near‐surface wind speeds. This is attributed to the almost vanished urban heat island (UHI) effect during the typhoon influenced period, which stabilizes the daytime boundary layer conditions. As a result, the vertical mixing is reduced and consequently the vertical downward transport of momentum to the surface is weakened. This study provides new insights into the importance of the urban land surface processes on regulating the wind structures under tropical cyclone backgrounds."

Existing studies acknowledge that several environmental, hydroclimatic, socioeconomic, policy, and institutional factors control urban growth, yet key information about its detailed spatial and temporal dynamics is still missing. The ability to reproduce observed patterns of urban expansion is essential for projecting reliable scenarios for the near future. Here we develop a spatially explicit probabilistic modeling framework to describe observed urban expansion dynamics at a regional scale. As a proof of concept, we test our methodology in North‐East China, as it experienced a rapid and sizable urbanization in the last 30 years. We infer the rate of urbanization from urban data and consider 128 different model combinations, aimed at exploring the role played by geomorphic and hydroclimatic drivers, together with the proximity to existing urban areas, in controlling spatial dynamics of urban expansion. Our results show that elevation, terrain slope, distance from rivers and from the sea are the most relevant factors in the considered study area. The fractal size distribution of urban clusters is satisfactorily reproduced by our model, which further confirms its validity. We discuss how our methodology could be a key contribution for analyzing and predicting the spatial dynamics of urban expansion in different regions of the globe. Valuable information on where human settlements will be located and how urban expansion will evolve can effectively support future planning strategies toward a more sustainable development."

However, the implementable potential of mCDR and mCS depends, apart from technology readiness, also on site‐specific conditions. In this work, we explore different options for mCDR and mCS, using the German context as a case study. We challenge each option to remove 10 Mt CO2 yr−1, accounting for 8%–22% of projected hard‐to‐abate and residual emissions of Germany in 2045. We focus on the environmental, resource, and infrastructure requirements of individual mCDR and mCS options at specific sites, within the German jurisdiction when possible. This serves as an entry point to discuss main uncertainty factors and research needs beyond technology readiness, and, where possible, cost estimates, expected environmental effects, and monitoring approaches. In total, we describe 10 mCDR and mCS options; four aim at enhancing the chemical carbon uptake of the ocean through alkalinity enhancement, four aim at enhancing blue carbon ecosystems' sink capacity, and two employ geological off‐shore storage. Our results indicate that five out of 10 options would potentially be implementable within German jurisdiction, and three of them could potentially meet the challenge. Our exercise serves as an example on how the creation of more tangible and site‐specific CDR options can provide a basis for the assessment of socio‐economic, ethical, political, and legal aspects for such implementations. The approach presented here can easily be applied to other regional or national CDR capacity considerations."

However, the relative importance of different exposure pathways leading to health risks remains unclear. For 9 US states during 2016–2018, ED visit records for heat exhaustion and heat stroke (HEAT), fluid and electrolyte imbalance (FEI), volume depletion (VD), and acute kidney injury (AKI) were identified via diagnosis codes. Co‐diagnosed Y92 subcodes (Y codes) were used to categorize the patient's location at the time of injury or condition. Logistic regressions were used to estimate nonlinear associations between same‐day temperature and Y codes for 11 non‐residential versus residential locations among heat‐related ED visits, including stratified analyses by patient age, race, and ethnicity. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated between the 95th versus 50th percentile of temperature. Overall, higher temperature was associated with increased risks of ED visits with Y codes for non‐residential locations. HEAT ED visits were more likely to have Y codes for streets compared to residential locations (OR:1.68, 95% CI: 1.12–2.51). Similarly, VD visits were more likely to have Y codes for industrial area (OR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.98–3.63), farms (OR:7.66, 95% CI: 4.05–14.50), recreation areas (OR:2.25, 95% CI: 1.78–2.84), and streets (OR:1.54, 95% CI: 1.39–1.70), but were less likely to have Y codes for public places (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.94). Similar associations were observed for FEI and AKI ED visits. Locations associated with higher heat risks may be due to exposure outdoor temperature and activities, supporting the need to develop strategies and interventions that minimize heat exposure in these areas."

Here, the authors demonstrate that amorphous nanoparticles, introduced via additive manufacturing, enhance both the tensile strength and fatigue resistance of metallic materials. 
 Nanoparticles or precipitates are long used to block dislocations to strengthen metals. However, this strengthening mechanism unavoidably adds stress concentrations at the obstacles, instigating crack initiation that hampers ductility. Here, we demonstrate a strategy that replaces the traditional crystalline dispersions with dense amorphous nanoparticles, which is made possible via laser powder bed fusion. Porosity-free copper-based nanocomposites are demonstrated as a prototype, consisting of densely and uniformly distributed amorphous boron–carbide nanoparticles (~47 nm in average diameter, up to 12% volume fraction) via an in situ nanofragmentation and melt-quench process. The amorphous nanoparticles act as dislocation sinks, thereby alleviating local stress concentration. They also self-harden along with tensile deformation, promoting strain hardening and therefore homogeneous plastic flow. The as-built composite achieves a tensile strength of more than one gigapascal and a total elongation of approximately 10%, more than twice that of its crystalline dispersion counterpart. Defect accumulation is also suppressed upon cyclic deformation of the as-built bulk nanocomposites, delivering a fatigue strength limit (at > 107 cycles) of more than 70% of the tensile strength. Our results demonstrate an effective strategy for additive manufacturing of metallic materials with superior properties. Crystalline dispersoids are commonly used to strengthen metals by obstructing dislocation movement, but this often comes at the cost of ductility.

 Efficient upcycling of uranyl from uranyl–containing radioactive organic wastewater is of utmost importance for the sustainable development of nuclear energy. In this work, an indirect electrochemical method to upcycle uranyl from radioactive organic wastewater is proposed. A cost-efficient self-standing polyarylether-based covalent organic framework electrode (PAE-COF-AO@CC) not only acts as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but also provides chelating sites for uranyl ions and nucleation center for the following growth of studtite originating from the reaction between H2O2 and chelated uranyl. It’s clarified that the up-take studtite on PAE-COF-AO@CC electrode could transform to high-pure U3O8 after calcinating the permanently used PAE-COF-AO@CC electrode. The ultra-long lifespan of longer than 450 h and the excellent uranyl capacity of 9238.9 mg/g from the continuous accumulation of studtite make the self-standing PAE-COF-AO@CC electrode as promising materials for the uranyl resource upcycling from the complicated organic waste water matrix.

 Advanced geospatial analyses have underscored the effectiveness of Indigenous territories in avoiding deforestation, particularly across the tropics. However, the factors that shape such avoidance and their social-ecological contexts are still poorly understood. By using matching methods coupled with community-based and ethnographic approaches, we offer a contextual measure and understanding of deforestation avoidance of Indigenous territories in Southwestern Amazonia. Our counterfactual analysis of 19 Apurinã territories in Brazil over a 20-year period (2001–2021) in different municipalities showed that, even if Indigenous territories are by no means immune to forest loss, they have avoided significant levels of deforestation. Their effectiveness in mitigating deforestation is largely associated with distinct land-based governance, resilient leadership, as well as temporal perspectives and socio-bioeconomies inclusive to more-than-human beings.

 Climate change threatens the lifeways of Indigenous Peoples, impacting their rights to self-determination and sovereignty. In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, Indigenous communities have experienced harvest declines of wild rice (Ojibwemowin: Manoomin; Dakodiapi: Psiŋ; Latin: Zizania palustris), a sacred aquatic plant central to their culture. Here we analyzed 1985–2020 wild rice density and harvest data in relation to key climate variables. Our results indicate that wild rice stem density in the fall is higher in years that have (1) lower early-summer water levels due to decreased precipitation, and (2) longer lake-ice duration due to colder winter temperatures. Overall, wild rice available for tribal harvest off-reservation has declined regionally by ~5–7% annually—declines that are likely to continue due to anthropogenic climate change, specifically increased early-summer precipitation and warmer winters. This decline has infringed on Indigenous lifeways by reducing off-reservation tribal harvest, a right guaranteed by treaties with the U.S. government.

 The terrestrial carbon cycle responds to human activity, ecosystem dynamics, and weather and climate variability including extreme events. Satellite remote sensing has transformed our ability to estimate ecosystem carbon dioxide uptake, the gross primary productivity (GPP), with increasing accuracy and spatial resolution. Many aspects of terrestrial carbon cycling happen quickly on sub-daily or daily scales. These dynamics may not be captured at the temporal scales of typical remote sensing products from polar orbiting satellites – often multiple days or longer. Imagers onboard geostationary satellites measure the Earth system at “hypertemporal” time scales of minutes or less and often have the spectral capabilities to estimate GPP and other surface-atmosphere fluxes using established approaches. Here, we use observations and data products from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellite – R Series (GOES-R) to create ALIVEGPP (Advanced Baseline Imager Live Imaging of Vegetated Ecosystems), a GPP product that provides open data on the native five-minute basis of GOES-R CONUS scenes with latency under one day. Our machine learning model, trained on GPP estimates from 111 eddy covariance flux towers with 276 site-years of data spanning tropical to boreal ecosystems, captures up to 70 % of the observed variability when 20 % of tower sites are withheld, with R2 values of 0.78 (0.82) when aggregating to daily (weekly) periods. We compared ALIVEGPP predictions against eight-day MODIS MOD17A2 GPP estimates and daily GPP estimates from the Breathing Earth System Simulator v2 (BESSv2) and demonstrate how ALIVEGPP simulates the impacts of phenological transitions, flash drought, and hurricanes. Advancements to geostationary satellite imagery, machine learning, and cloud computing make it possible to estimate carbon flux in near real-time and provide new ways to understand the ever-changing carbon cycle and the processes that define it."

 Remote sensing of hyperspectral vegetation reflectance and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is essential for evaluating crop functionality and photosynthetic performance. While primarily applied in monocultures, these tools show promise in diverse cropping systems, enhancing ecological intensification. Plant-plant interactions in such systems can influence key physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, making SIF a valuable tool for evaluating how crop diversity affects photosynthetic function and productivity. However, detecting SIF in diverse stands remains challenging due to uncertainties in light re-absorption and scattering. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid model inversion framework that combines canopy observations with physical modeling to derive leaf biochemical, canopy structural variables, and SIF spectra at leaf and photosystem levels. This approach employs a machine learning retrieval algorithm (MLRA), trained on synthetic spectra from radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations, to quantify re-absorption and scattering effects. Using the SpecFit retrieval algorithm, the temporal evolution of full-spectrum SIF at the canopy level can be derived. To downscale SIF to the photosystem level and retrieve its quantum yield, we corrected the canopy SIF spectrum for re-absorption and scattering effects calculated from TOC reflectance. Spectral measurements were gathered from field experiments conducted over three years, covering various growth stages of cereal and legume monocrops and their mixture. Our method accurately predicts important leaf biochemical and canopy structural variables, such as leaf area (LAI, R2 = 0.75) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, R2 = 0.91), and shows a general high retrieval performance for light absorption (fAPARChl, R2 = 0.99 for the internal model validation). We confirmed the reliability of our method in modeling re-absorption and scattering processes by comparing canopy SIF downscaled to the leaf level with independent leaf-level SIF measurements. While the results show a good prediction accuracy in terms of fluorescence magnitude at the leaf level, we did not find a strong agreement of corresponding leaf and canopy measurements at the single plot level."

 Drought, a widely recognised and far-reaching natural hazard, has a profound impact on the global economy and the environment. This complex phenomenon, characterised by its severity, duration and spatial extent, is central to understanding its multifaceted impacts. Drought indices are an important tool for characterising and monitoring drought conditions. They provide a simplified way to understand the myriad climate factors that play a role. They also provide quantifiable measures for assessing the severity, duration and frequency of climate anomalies. In the Baltic Region, the relationships between meteorological (using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)) and hydrological drought (using the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI)) were analysed and the possibility of using the RDI instead of the SPI was investigated. For each index, accumulation periods of 6, 9 and 12 months were used, analysing data from the period 1961–2020. Our study attempts to investigate the relationships between the SPI, RDI and SDI indices using data from specific hydrometeorological stations across the Baltic Region, highlighting differences between four delineated sub-regions. For most accumulation periods in the northern sub-regions, SDI showed a better relationship to SPI than RDI. However, in the southwestern sub-region for late summer and early autumn and in the southeastern sub-region for long accumulation periods, RDI showed a better relationship with SDI. This pattern reveals the limitation of the RDI index in cold climate zones and its threshold could be defined as the northern boundary of the southern sub-regions. The study shows that the drought indices in the Baltic Region serve as valuable tools to characterise drought conditions and facilitate the assessment of the spatial and temporal characteristics and severity of drought."

The blue-water dependence index (BDI), which reflects the fraction of blue water in total crop water demand of a certain location, is a crucial indicator for managing freshwater resources effectively, ensuring sustainable food production systems and adapting agricultural practices to climate change. The knowledge of BDI for SA croplands at fine spatial scales is limited. Here we present a comprehensive modeling framework for fine-scale BDI assessment using an evapotranspiration-based approach to calculate crop water demand. A novel hierarchical decision tree approach was employed to identify major crop rotation systems, forming the basis for estimating regional crop water demand. We produced annual crop rotation maps at 250 m spatial resolution for 18 years (2003–2020) with an overall accuracy of 78.60%. Our results based on the national-scale analysis reveal that croplands in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have an averaged BDI value of 0.32, 0.65, and 0.39, respectively. Notably, cotton and sugarcane crops have the highest BDI (⩾0.42) in SA. Future climate data under different scenarios indicate that the BDI in tropical croplands is expected to decrease, while arid to semi-arid croplands will require more irrigation water to support optimal crop growth. In light of the future variability of BDI, our research further implies a few candidate strategies for climate change mitigation in SA that include enhancing water management infrastructures, developing climate-resistant crop varieties, and relocating crop cultivation areas with transboundary cooperation."

Buffer capacity, stemming from conjugate acid–base pairs, can resist pH changes in aerosol multiphase systems under external perturbations. However, the regulating role of multiphase buffering in pH-dependent aqueous sulfate formation mechanisms remains unexplored. Here, we propose that multiphase buffering can stabilize aerosol pH and further regulate dominant sulfate formation pathways. In this work, we delve into the instantaneous buffer capacity β and sulfate formation pathways based on field observation and theoretical calculation and further introduce the total buffer capacity α in the aerosol multiphase system to quantify the buffer-constrained pH change after the external acid/base variation during the entire buffering process. The NH4+/NH3 agent (average β 30.8 mol kg–1) shows a superior buffering effect in stabilizing aerosol pH and regulating sulfate formation pathway transition compared with the HNO3/NO3– agent (average β 15.1 mol kg–1). Geos-Chem simulation and machine learning results also validate the buffer capacity as a pivotal factor in sulfate formation. In addition to reactants, the buffer agents and acid/base can also be factors of concern for the sulfate formation mechanism.

Contaminant degradation by electron transfer from PC is influenced by its electron conductivity and storage capacity, and atom transfer reactions involving atomic hydrogen, but resolving their contributions is difficult. In this study, we developed a method to modify working electrodes with agarose-stabilized thin films of PCs and used them to characterize PC reactivity using 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) as a model contaminant and several electrochemical methods. Chronoamperometry showed that TNT reduction rates increase with increasing PC temperature, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that this is because the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants (k0) are inversely correlated to resistivity (Rp) of the PC films. As a result, PCs like biochars, which have higher charge transfer resistance (Rct), give lower TNT reduction rates, whereas lower Rct PCs like activated carbons give faster TNT reduction. Current from reduction of H2O/H+ to H2 (HER) was significant only for low Rp PC-films on Pt working electrodes.

Among urban stressors, pesticide-driven chemical pollution represents a critical, yet under-recognized, global threat. Quantifying the causes and consequences of pesticides on biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation is vital for ecological risk assessment and management, offering insights to promote sustainable societal development. This study evaluated anthropogenic stressors and macroinvertebrate communities at 42 sites across two major drainages in Beijing using chemical analysis and environmental DNA (eDNA), focusing on macroinvertebrate responses to pesticide exposure in the context of multiple anthropogenic stressors. Pesticides significantly impacted the α- and β-functional diversity of macroinvertebrates, accounting for 18.46 and 14.6% of the total observed variation, respectively, underscoring the role of functional groups in pesticide risk assessment. Land use and flow quantity directly influenced pesticide levels, which in turn affected macroinvertebrate functional diversity, while basic water quality had a less pronounced effect. These results provide empirical evidence of pesticide pollution’s impact on macroinvertebrate functional diversity at the watershed scale under field conditions in a highly urbanized area. The findings highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors and sensitive taxa in pesticide risk assessment and management for urban aquatic ecosystems."

However, the associated exposure risk linked to tea consumption remains unclear. This study analyzed 10 PAEs and 10 NPPs in six types of tea collected from 18 provinces in China. Both PAEs and NPPs were detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 309 to 8150 ng/g for PAEs and 42.2 to 899 ng/g for NPPs, respectively. Source apportionment analysis indicates that packaging materials are important sources of plasticizer contamination in tea. The concentrations of di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), benzyl-butyl phthalate (BzBP), and trioctyl trimellitate (TOTM) in tea exhibited a significant correlation with those found in packaging materials (r: 0.414–0.465, p < 0.01). Five transformation products (TPs) of plasticizers were identified in brewed tea samples through suspect screening analysis, raising concerns about their potential health effects. Comparisons suggest that cold brewing may result in higher plasticizer exposure than hot brewing after a single brew. However, as the brewing times for hot brewed tea increased, the risk of human exposure rose, ultimately exceeded that of cold brewed tea.

This study investigated the abundance, composition, sources, driving mechanisms, and health risks associated with pathogens and AMR originating from WCFs in a major city, using culture-based analysis, high-throughput sequencing, and health risk modeling, respectively. The atmospheric escape rates of culturable bacteria (43.4%), fungi (71.7%), and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) (43.7%) were estimated based on the concentration differences between the interior and exterior of the WCFs by using SourceTracker2 analysis. Health risk assessments showed that annual infection risks for waste-handling workers ranged from 0.194 to 0.489, far exceeding the World Health Organization’s acceptable limit of 10–4. Community exposure risks were notable up to 220 m downwind from WCFs, marking the maximum extent of pathogen dispersion. Our analysis suggests that approximately 6.3% of the megacity’s area (equivalent to 400 km2) is within potential risk zones influenced by WCF emissions.

In view of the basic requirement on the presence of parent (MS1) and daughter (MS2) ions at environmentally relevant concentrations for chemical identification, a binary classification model of artificial neural networks was developed based on the measured mass spectrum data of 1255 unique chemical substances. It was used to estimate the percentage of compounds amenable to LC-HRMS analysis from a broad range of candidates in chemical inventories. Molecular descriptors related to molecular size, branching, electronic states of atoms, and molecular charge distributions showed significant impacts on the sensitivity of the model.

Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is powerful in source attribution of primary OA (POA); however, it often struggles to differentiate sources of oxygenated OA (OOA) due to their similar chemical profiles. In this study, a support vector regression machine learning (ML) model was developed to enhance the OOA source apportionment in Dublin from 2016 to 2023. Rolling PMF analysis identified four POA factors and differentiated OOA into less- and more-oxidized  (LO-OOA and MO-OOA), highlighting the significant role of the OOA (47–74% of total OA). The ML model further distinguished locally produced OOA (LO-OOAlocal and MO-OOAlocal) from transboundary transport OOA and exhibited robust performance across different pollution scenarios. The relative importance analysis revealed that LO-OOAlocal was more impacted by fossil fuel emissions like hydrocarbon-like OA (20%) and coal (14%), whereas MO-OOAlocal was most influenced by LO-OOA (17%), providing insights into their sources and formation mechanisms. During a mixed pollution episode, the results show that despite the significant contribution of transboundary transport, local heating emissions were more critical sources of OA, with local OA accounting for 68% of total OA and reaching 78% during heating hours. These findings highlight the ongoing need to reduce local emissions to achieve cleaner air in Dublin. The ML model’s ability to quantitatively separate local and transboundary OOA offers invaluable insights for future air quality regulations."

The wave Poynting flux measurements and linear instability analysis suggest that banded hiss can be generated in the equatorial plume region. The ray tracing simulations further show that the plume structure enables banded hiss to propagate along the plasma density crest to higher latitudes, followed by the penetration into the plasmasphere.

 Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century1,2. Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world3. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then4–7. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato ‘Russet Burbank’) using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.

 Clonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses1–4. Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot1–3,5–7. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3AR882H/+, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration8, reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs generated by prime editing.

 Wurtzite ferroelectrics have transformative potential for next-generation microelectronics. A comprehensive understanding of their ferroelectric properties and domain energetics is crucial for tailoring their ferroelectric characteristics and exploiting their functional properties in practical devices. Despite burgeoning interest, the exact configurations and electronic structures of domain walls in wurtzite ferroelectrics remain elusive. Here we explain the atomic configurations and electronic properties of electric-field-induced domain walls in ferroelectric ScGaN. By combining transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculations, a charged domain wall with a buckled two-dimensional hexagonal phase is revealed. Density functional theory calculations confirm that such domain-wall structures further give rise to unprecedented mid-gap states within the forbidden band. Quantitative analysis unveils a universal charge-compensation mechanism stabilizing antipolar domain walls in ferroelectric materials, in which the polarization discontinuity at the 180° domain wall is compensated by the unbonded valence electrons. Furthermore, the reconfigurable conductivity of these domain walls is experimentally demonstrated, showcasing their potential for ultrascaled device applications.

 Distinct hepatocyte subpopulations are spatially segregated along the portal–central axis and are critical to understanding metabolic homeostasis and injury in the liver1. Although several bioactive molecules, including ascorbate and bilirubin, have been described as having a role in directing zonal fates, zonal liver architecture has not yet been replicated in vitro2,3. Here, to evaluate hepatic zonal polarity, we developed a self-assembling zone-specific liver organoid by co-culturing ascorbate- and bilirubin-enriched hepatic progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We found that preconditioned hepatocyte-like cells exhibited zone-specific functions associated with the urea cycle, glutathione synthesis and glutamate synthesis. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of these zonally patterned organoids identifies a hepatoblast differentiation trajectory that dictates periportal, interzonal and pericentral human hepatocytes. Epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis showed that zonal identity is orchestrated by ascorbate- or bilirubin-dependent binding of EP300 to TET1 or HIF1α. Transplantation of the self-assembled zonally patterned human organoids improved survival of immunodeficient rats who underwent bile duct ligation by ameliorating the hyperammonaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Overall, this multi-zonal organoid system serves as an in vitro human model to better recapitulate hepatic architecture relevant to liver development and disease.

 Oryza rufipogon, the wild progenitor of Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa, is an important resource for rice breeding1. Here we present a wild–cultivated rice pangenome based on 145 chromosome-level assemblies, comprising 129 genetically diverse O. rufipogon accessions and 16 diverse varieties of O. sativa. This pangenome contains 3.87 Gb of sequences that are absent from the O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare reference genome. We captured alternate assemblies that include heterozygous information missing in the primary assemblies, and identified a total of 69,531 pan-genes, with 28,907 core genes and 13,728 wild-rice-specific genes. We observed a higher abundance and a significantly greater diversity of resistance-gene analogues in wild rice than in cultivars. Our analysis indicates that two cultivated subpopulations, intro-indica and basmati, were generated through gene flows among cultivars in South Asia. We also provide strong evidence to support the theory that the initial domestication of all Asian cultivated rice occurred only once. Furthermore, we captured 855,122 differentiated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 13,853 differentiated presence–absence variations between indica and japonica, which could be traced to the divergence of their respective ancestors and the existence of a larger genetic bottleneck in japonica. This study provides reference resources for enhancing rice breeding, and enriches our understanding of the origins and domestication process of rice.

 Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the enzyme responsible for nearly all biologically generated methane1. Its active site comprises coenzyme F430, a porphyrin-based cofactor with a central nickel ion that is active exclusively in the Ni(I) state2,3. How methanogenic archaea perform the reductive activation of F430 represents a major gap in our understanding of one of the most ancient bioenergetic systems in nature. Here we purified and characterized the MCR activation complex from Methanococcus maripaludis. McrC, a small subunit encoded in the mcr operon, co-purifies with the methanogenic marker proteins Mmp7, Mmp17, Mmp3 and the A2 component. We demonstrated that this complex can activate MCR in vitro in a strictly ATP-dependent manner, enabling the formation of methane. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the MCR activation complex exhibiting different functional states with local resolutions reaching 1.8–2.1 Å. Our data revealed three complex iron–sulfur clusters that formed an electron transfer pathway towards F430. Topology and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses indicate that these clusters are similar to the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster, a maturation intermediate of the catalytic cofactor in nitrogenase. Altogether, our findings offer insights into the activation mechanism of MCR and prospects on the early evolution of nitrogenase.

 Sensitive methods for detection of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) could facilitate non-invasive gene expression profiling and monitoring of diseases1–6. Here we describe RARE-seq (random priming and affinity capture of cfRNA fragments for enrichment analysis by sequencing), a method optimized for cfRNA analysis. We demonstrate that platelet contamination can substantially confound cfRNA analyses and develop an approach to overcome it. In analytical validations, we find RARE-seq to be approximately 50-fold more sensitive for detecting tumour-derived cfRNA than whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with a limit of detection of 0.05%. To explore clinical utility, we profiled 437 plasma samples from 369 individuals with cancer or non-malignant conditions and controls. Detection of non-small-cell lung cancer expression signatures in cfRNA increased with stage (6 out of 20 (30%) in stage I; 5 out of 8 (63%) in stage II; 10 out of 15 (67%) in stage III; 80 out of 96 (83% sensitivity) in stage IV at 95% specificity) and RARE-seq was more sensitive than tumour-naive circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis. In patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer who developed resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we detected both histological transformation and mutation-based resistance mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of RARE-seq for determination of tissue of origin, assessing benign pulmonary conditions and tracking response to mRNA vaccines. These results highlight the potential value of ultrasensitive cfRNA analysis and provide proof of concept for diverse clinical applications.

 The axion is a hypothetical fundamental particle that is conjectured to correspond to the coherent oscillation of the θ field in quantum chromodynamics1,2. Its existence would solve multiple fundamental questions, including the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics and dark matter, but the axion has never been detected. Electrodynamics of condensed-matter systems can also give rise to a similar θ, so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize the topology of materials3–5. Coherent oscillation of θ in condensed matter has been proposed to lead to physics directly analogous to the high-energy axion particle—the dynamical axion quasiparticle (DAQ)6–23. Here we report the observation of the DAQ in MnBi2Te4. By combining a two-dimensional electronic device with ultrafast pump–probe optics, we observe a coherent oscillation of θ at about 44 gigahertz, which is uniquely induced by its out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. This represents direct evidence for the presence of the DAQ, which in two-dimensional MnBi2Te4 is found to arise from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of the Berry curvature. The DAQ also has implications in light–matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics24, as it might lead to axion polaritons and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization6,15–20. Finally, the DAQ could be used to detect axion particles21–23. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the millielectronvolt regime, which has so far been poorly explored.

 The pursuit of non-volatile memory with program speeds below one nanosecond, beyond the capabilities of non-volatile flash and high-speed volatile static random-access memory, remains a longstanding challenge in the field of memory technology1. Utilizing fundamental physics innovation enabled by advanced materials, series of emerging memories2–5 are being developed to overcome the speed bottleneck of non-volatile memory. As the most extensively applied non-volatile memory, the speed of flash is limited by the low efficiency of the electric-field-assisted program, with reported speeds6–10 much slower than sub-one nanosecond. Here we report a two-dimensional Dirac graphene-channel flash memory based on a two-dimensional-enhanced hot-carrier-injection mechanism, supporting both electron and hole injection. The Dirac channel flash shows a program speed of 400 picoseconds, non-volatile storage and robust endurance over 5.5 × 106 cycles. Our results confirm that the thin-body channel can optimize the horizontal electric-field (Ey) distribution, and the improved Ey-assisted program efficiency increases the injection current to 60.4 pA μm−1 at |VDS| = 3.7 V. We also find that the two-dimensional semiconductor tungsten diselenide has two-dimensional-enhanced hot-hole injection, but with different injection behaviour. This work demonstrates that the speed of non-volatile flash memory can exceed that of the fastest volatile static random-access memory with the same channel length.

 The stability of hazardous volcanic systems is strongly influenced by the uppermost magma storage depth and volatile exsolution1–3. Despite abundant evidence for an upper crustal magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera4–7, its depth and the properties at its top have not been well constrained. New controlled-source seismic imaging illuminates a sharp reflective cap of the magma reservoir approximately 3.8 km beneath the northeastern caldera. Magma ascent to such low pressure is expected to drive volatile exsolution and potentially localized accumulation of bubbles near the top of the reservoir8,9, but this process typically remains hidden in contemporary volcanic systems. P-wave and P-to-S-wave reflections from the sharp top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir indicate that a mixture of supercritical fluid and magma fills the pore space at the cap of the approximately 3–8-km-deep low-shear-velocity layer imaged by seismic tomography6,7. The results are consistent with partial retention of bubbles exsolved from an upper crustal reservoir with ongoing magma supply from a volatile-enriched mantle source. Bubble accumulation can eventually lead to reservoir instability2,8, but the bubble volume fraction seismically estimated at the top of the reservoir today is lower than typical estimates of pre-eruptive conditions for rhyolites1,10,11, and measurements of the hydrothermal system document high fluxes of magmatic volatiles escaping to the surface12–15. We infer that the magma reservoir is in a stable state of efficient bubble ascent into the hydrothermal system on the basis of estimates that it is a crystal-rich (less than 30% porosity) reservoir for which dynamic modelling favours channelized bubble escape that prevents instability8.

 Despite the continuing progress in integrated optical frequency comb technology1, compact sources of short, bright pulses in the mid-infrared wavelength range from 3 to 12 μm so far remain beyond reach. The state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse emitters in the mid-infrared are complex, bulky and inefficient systems based on the downconversion of near-infrared or visible pulsed laser sources. Here we show a purely DC-driven semiconductor laser chip that generates 1-ps solitons at the centre wavelength of 8.3 μm at GHz repetition rates. The soliton generation scheme is akin to that of passive nonlinear Kerr resonators2. It relies on a fast bistability in active nonlinear laser resonators, unlike traditional passive mode-locking, which relies on saturable absorbers3, or active mode-locking by gain modulation in semiconductor lasers4. Monolithic integration of all components—drive laser, active ring resonator, coupler and pump filter—enables turnkey generation of bright solitons that remain robust for hours of continuous operation without active stabilization. Such devices can be readily produced at industrial laser foundries using standard fabrication protocols.

 Parkinson’s disease is caused by the loss of dopamine neurons, causing motor symptoms. Initial cell therapies using fetal tissues showed promise but had complications and ethical concerns1–5. Pluripotent stem (PS) cells emerged as a promising alternative for developing safe and effective treatments6. In this phase I/II trial at Kyoto University Hospital, seven patients (ages 50–69) received bilateral transplantation of dopaminergic progenitors derived from induced PS (iPS) cells. Primary outcomes focused on safety and adverse events, while secondary outcomes assessed motor symptom changes and dopamine production for 24 months. There were no serious adverse events, with 73 mild to moderate events. Patients’ anti-parkinsonian medication doses were maintained unless therapeutic adjustments were required, resulting in increased dyskinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no graft overgrowth. Among six patients subjected to efficacy evaluation, four showed improvements in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III OFF score, and five showed improvements in the ON scores.

 During classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) encapsulates free DNA ends, forming a recruitment platform for downstream end-joining factors including ligase 4 (LIG4)1. DNA-PK can also bind telomeres and regulate their resection2–4, but does not initiate cNHEJ at this position. How the end-joining process is regulated in this context-specific manner is currently unclear. Here we show that the shelterin components TRF2 and RAP1 form a complex with DNA-PK that directly represses its end-joining function at telomeres. Biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that when bound to TRF2, RAP1 establishes a network of interactions with KU and DNA that prevents DNA-PK from recruiting LIG4. In mouse and human cells, RAP1 is redundant with the Apollo nuclease in repressing cNHEJ at chromosome ends, demonstrating that the inhibition of DNA-PK prevents telomere fusions in parallel with overhang-dependent mechanisms. Our experiments show that the end-joining function of DNA-PK is directly and specifically repressed at telomeres, establishing a molecular mechanism for how individual linear chromosomes are maintained in mammalian cells. Biochemical, structural and genetic analysis of the shelterin complex reveal that by recruiting RAP1 to DNA, TRF2 directly inhibits DNA-dependent protein kinase to regulate classical non-homologous end joining at telomeres."

The rich and complex antiferromagnetic spin dynamics in MnBi2Te4 is expected to generate new quantum anomalous Hall phenomena that are absent in conventional ferromagnetic topological insulators, but experimental observations are still unknown. Here we fabricate a device of 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with an AlOx capping layer, which enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces. By tuning the gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, we uncover a cascade of quantum phase transitions that can be attributed to the influence of complex spin configurations on edge state transport. Furthermore, we find that an in-plane magnetic field enhances both the coercive field and the exchange gap of the surface state, in contrast to that in the ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall state. Combined with numerical simulations, we propose that these peculiar features arise from the spin flip and flop transitions that are inherent to a van der Waals antiferromagnet. The versatile tunability of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in MnBi2Te4 paves the way for potential applications in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics9,10.

 Impaired differentiation is a hallmark of myeloid malignancies1,2. Therapies that enable cells to circumvent the differentiation block, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), are by and large curative in acute promyelocytic leukaemia3, but whether ‘differentiation therapy’ is a generalizable therapeutic approach for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and beyond remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of the histone demethylase LSD1 (LSD1i) and the WNT pathway antagonist GSK3 kinase4 (GSK3i) robustly promotes therapeutic differentiation of established AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, as well as reducing tumour burden and significantly extending survival in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, this combination promotes differentiation by activating genes in the type I interferon pathway via inducing expression of transcription factors such as IRF7 (LSD1i) and the co-activator β-catenin (GSK3i), and their selective co-occupancy at targets such as STAT1, which is necessary for combination-induced differentiation. Combination treatment also suppresses the canonical, pro-oncogenic WNT pathway and cell cycle genes. Analysis of datasets from patients with AML suggests a correlation between the combination-induced transcription signature and better prognosis, highlighting clinical potential of this strategy. Collectively, this combination strategy rewires transcriptional programs to suppress stemness and to promote differentiation, which may have important therapeutic implications for AML and WNT-driven cancers beyond AML.

 The formation of accessible chromatin around DNA double-strand breaks is essential for their efficient repair1. Although the linker histone H1 is known to facilitate higher-order chromatin compaction2,3, the mechanisms by which H1 modifications regulate chromatin relaxation in response to DNA damage are unclear. Here we show that CTP synthase 1 (CTPS1)-catalysed deamidation of H1 asparagine residues 76 and 77 triggers the sequential acetylation of lysine 75 following DNA damage, and this dual modification of H1 is associated with chromatin opening. Mechanistically, the histone acetyltransferase p300 showed a preference for deamidated H1 as a substrate, establishing H1 deamidation as a prerequisite for subsequent acetylation. Moreover, high expression of CTPS1 was associated with resistance to cancer radiotherapy, in both mouse xenograft models and clinical cohorts. These findings provide new insights into how linker histones regulate dynamic chromatin alterations in the DNA damage response.

 Despite the widespread use of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, little is known about the metabolism of therapeutic RNAs. Here we use nanopore sequencing1–3 to analyse individual therapeutic mRNA molecules, focusing on their poly(A) tails. We show that the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine4 has a poly(A) tail of around 100 nucleotides, followed by an mΨCmΨAG sequence. In cell lines, mRNA-1273 undergoes rapid degradation initiated by mΨCmΨAG removal, followed by CCR4–NOT-mediated deadenylation. However, in medically relevant preclinical models, particularly in macrophages, mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails are extended to up to 200 nucleotides by the TENT5A poly(A) polymerase5–7, which is induced by the vaccine. Re-adenylation, which stabilizes target mRNAs, is consistently observed in synthetic mRNAs that encode proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, such as ovalbumin or antigens from Zika virus8 or the malaria parasite9. The extent of re-adenylation varies: the BioNTech–Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine10 shows less potent re-adenylation than mRNA-1273, which correlates with a smaller proportion of membrane-associated BNT162b2. This highlights the crucial role of spatial accessibility to ER-resident TENT5A in determining re-adenylation efficiency. In vivo, TENT5A is expressed in immune cells that take up mRNA vaccine, and TENT5A deficiency reduces specific immunoglobulin production for mRNA vaccines after immunization in mice. Overall, our findings reveal a principle for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic mRNAs, paving the way for improvement.

 Proliferating hepatocytes often undergo ductal metaplasia to balance the energy trade-off between cellular functions and replication, hindering the expansion of human adult hepatocytes with functional competency1. Here we demonstrate that the combined activation of Wnt and STAT3 signalling enables long-term self-renewal of human adult hepatocyte organoids. YAP activation facilitates hepatocyte proliferation but commits it towards the biliary duct lineage. By contrast, STAT3 activation by oncostatin M induces hepatocyte proliferation while counteracting ductal metaplasia and maintaining the hepatic identity. Xenotransplanted hepatocyte organoids repopulate the recipient mouse liver and reconstitute the metabolic zonation structure. Upon niche factor removal and hormone supplementation, hepatocyte organoids form cord-like structures with bile canalicular networks and exhibit major liver metabolic functions comparable to those of in vivo hepatocytes. Hepatocyte organoids are amenable to gene editing, prompting functional modelling of inherent metabolic liver diseases. The new culture system offers a promising avenue for developing therapeutic strategies against human liver diseases.

 Protein misfolding diseases, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), pose substantial health challenges, with their cellular progression still poorly understood1–3. We use spatial proteomics by mass spectrometry and machine learning to map AATD in human liver tissue. Combining Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) with single-cell analysis4,5, we probe intact patient biopsies to resolve molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across fibrosis stages. We achieve proteome depth of up to 4,300 proteins from one-third of a single cell in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This dataset reveals a potentially clinically actionable peroxisomal upregulation that precedes the canonical unfolded protein response. Our single-cell proteomics data show α1-antitrypsin accumulation is largely cell-intrinsic, with minimal stress propagation between hepatocytes. We integrated proteomic data with artificial intelligence-guided image-based phenotyping across several disease stages, revealing a late-stage hepatocyte phenotype characterized by globular protein aggregates and distinct proteomic signatures, notably including elevated TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL) amounts. This phenotype may represent a critical disease progression stage. Our study offers new insights into AATD pathogenesis and introduces a powerful methodology for high-resolution, in situ proteomic analysis of complex tissues. This approach holds potential to unravel molecular mechanisms in various protein misfolding disorders, setting a new standard for understanding disease progression at the single-cell level in human tissue.

 DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) modulate transcription and chromatin architecture, acting from regulatory sites in enhancers and promoters of eukaryotic genes1,2. How multiple TFs cooperate to regulate individual genes is still unclear. In yeast, most TFs are thought to regulate transcription via binding to upstream activating sequences, which are situated within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the regulated gene3. Although this model has been validated for individual TFs and specific genes, it has not been tested in a systematic way. Here we integrated information on the binding and expression targets for the near-complete set of yeast TFs and show that, contrary to expectations, there are few TFs with dedicated activator or repressor roles, and that most TFs have a dual function. Although nearly all protein-coding genes are regulated by one or more TFs, our analysis revealed limited overlap between TF binding and gene regulation. Rapid depletion of many TFs also revealed many regulatory targets that were distant from detectable TF binding sites, suggesting unexpected regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a comprehensive survey of TF functions and offers insights into interactions between the set of TFs expressed in a single cell type and how they contribute to the complex programme of gene regulation.

 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with a considerable health and economic burden1. It is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a diminished response to symptomatic medical or surgical therapy as the disease progresses2. Cell therapy aims to replenish lost dopaminergic neurons and their striatal projections by intrastriatal grafting. Here, we report the results of an open-label phase I clinical trial (NCT04802733) of an investigational cryopreserved, off-the-shelf dopaminergic neuron progenitor cell product (bemdaneprocel) derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and grafted bilaterally into the putamen of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

 Structural disorder within materials gives rise to fascinating phenomena, attributed to the intricate interplay of their thermodynamic and electrochemical properties1,2. Oxygen-redox (OR) electrochemistry offers a breakthrough in capacity limits, while inducing structural disorder with reduced electrochemical reversibility3–5. The conventional explanation for the thermal expansion of solids relies on the Grüneisen relationship, linking the expansion coefficient to the anharmonicity of the crystal lattice6. However, this paradigm may not be applicable to OR materials due to the unexplored dynamic disorder–order transition in such systems7,8. Here we reveal the presence of negative thermal expansion with a large coefficient value of −14.4(2) × 10−6 °C−1 in OR active materials, attributing this to thermally driven disorder–order transitions. The modulation of OR behaviour not only enables precise control over the thermal expansion coefficient of materials, but also establishes a pragmatic framework for the design of functional materials with zero thermal expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reinstatement of structural disorder within the material can also be accomplished through the electrochemical driving force. By adjusting the cut-off voltages, evaluation of the discharge voltage change indicates a potential for nearly 100% structure recovery. This finding offers a pathway for restoring OR active materials to their pristine state through operando electrochemical processes, presenting a new mitigation strategy to address the persistent challenge of voltage decay.

 A growing body of evidence suggests that molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in some shallow marine environments beneath the effectively anoxic Archaean atmosphere 4.0 to 2.5 billion years (Ga) ago. Yet, the temporal and spatial distribution of these oxygen oases is not well known. Here we use thallium (Tl) isotope ratios, which are sensitive to manganese oxide burial, to place constraints on the timing and tempo of marine oxygen oases between about 2.65 Ga and 2.50 Ga. Lower-than-crustal authigenic 205Tl/203Tl ratios are common in shales from the approximately 2.65 Ga Jeerinah Formation (Western Australia) and the 2.50 Ga Klein Naute Formation (South Africa). Particularly low 205Tl/203Tl ratios are found at 2.50 Ga, coincident with a pronounced ‘whiff’ of O2. These data can be explained by widespread seafloor manganese oxide burial, a scenario that requires persistent O2 penetration into marine sediments beneath regionally extensive marine oxygen oases. By contrast, 205Tl/203Tl ratios from the 2.60–2.52 Ga Nauga Formation (South Africa) do not deviate from crustal values, suggesting an intervening period of muted seafloor Mn oxide burial. Our data suggest that O2 accumulated over greater spatial extents and to greater depths than previously thought at about 2.65 Ga and that marine oxygenation was spatially and temporally dynamic well before the Great Oxidation Event began at about 2.4 Ga. Oxygenated bottom water existed transiently on continental shelves with O2 penetrating into underlying marine sediments by about 2.65 billion years ago, according to a study of thallium isotopes in Archaean shales."

 Earth’s first rise in atmospheric oxygen between about 2.43 billion and 2.1 billion years ago fundamentally transformed the atmosphere and oceans, setting the foundation for the evolution of complex life. However, geochemical evidence reveals intermittent oceanic oxygen oases before the rise of atmospheric oxygen, although the mechanisms that drove the production and accumulation of oxygen remain poorly constrained. Here we present redox-sensitive trace metal and iron speciation data, and phosphorus phase partitioning results, for a 2.93-billion-year-old drill core from the Red Lake area, Canada, to reconstruct oceanic phosphorus cycling and links to oxygen production in the dominantly anoxic, iron-rich Archaean ocean. Our data document one of the earliest known intervals of surface water oxygen accumulation, predating the first accumulation of atmospheric oxygen by about 500 Ma. These intervals were preceded by ferruginous intervals and intervals of enhanced sulfide availability, which led to pulsed increases in oceanic phosphorus bioavailability via anoxic recycling from sediments. Enhanced phosphorus bioavailability would have helped stimulate photosynthetic primary productivity and organic carbon burial, probably exerting a major control on the episodic development of oxygen oases in the late Archaean ocean. This, in turn, led to a critical transitional phase in the development of an oxygenated surface environment. Periods with enhanced iron and sulfide availability that promoted recycling of bioavailable phosphorus from sediments contributed to episodic development of oxygen oases in the Archaean ocean, according to analysis of trace metals, phosphorus and iron from 2.9-billion-year-old sediments."

 In diverse Phytophthora-plant pathosystems, Phytophthora secretes XLP1 (PsXEG1-Like Protein), a non-enzymatic paralog that functions as a decoy to protect XEG1 (Xyloglucan-specific Endoglucanase) from host inhibitors. Here, we show that the genus-specific selection pressures on the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair are crucial for host adaptation and are closely linked to Phytophthora host range. Our findings reveal that the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair originated within Phytophthora and subsequently evolved into genus-specific genes, undergoing functional divergence driven by preferential selection. Positive selection sites within the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair in Phytophthora contribute to this functional divergence and are associated with the host range variability of Phytophthora as evidenced by multivariate statistical analyses. Furthermore, mutations at key selection sites in Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora capsici significantly impair their pathogenicity, with P. capsici exhibiting almost no colonization expansion on tobacco and pea. Notably, natural Phytophthora populations harbor mutations at the positive selection sites, indicating ongoing evolutionary pressures on the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair.

 Biogenesis of mitoribosomes requires dedicated chaperones, RNA-modifying enzymes, and GTPases, and defects in mitoribosome assembly lead to severe mitochondriopathies in humans. Here, we characterize late-step assembly states of the small mitoribosomal subunit (mtSSU) by combining genetic perturbation and mutagenesis analysis with biochemical and structural approaches. Isolation of native mtSSU biogenesis intermediates via a FLAG-tagged variant of the GTPase MTG3 reveals three distinct assembly states, which show how factors cooperate to mature the 12S rRNA. In addition, we observe four distinct primed initiation mtSSU states with an incompletely matured rRNA, suggesting that biogenesis and translation initiation are not mutually exclusive processes but can occur simultaneously. Together, these results provide insights into mtSSU biogenesis and suggest a functional coupling between ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation in human mitochondria.

Here authors found that a neural circuit from the medial preoptic area to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray mediates context-dependent pain hypersensitivity in male, but not female, mice, which requires activation of testosterone signaling. 
 The neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific pain, in which males and females exhibit distinct responses to pain, remain poorly understood. Here we show that in a mouse model of male-specific pain hypersensitivity response to pain conditioning environments (contextual pain hypersensitivity model), elevated free-testosterone leads to hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons in the medial preoptic area (GlumPOA) through activation of androgen receptor signaling, which in turn induces contextual pain hypersensitivity in male mice. Although not observed in naïve female mice, this pain phenotype could be induced in females via chronic administration of testosterone propionate. In addition, GlumPOA neurons send excitatory inputs to GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (GABAvlPAG) that are required for contextual pain hypersensitivity. Our study thus demonstrates that testosterone/androgen receptor signaling enhances GlumPOA → GABAvlPAG pathway activity, which drives a male-specific contextual pain hypersensitivity, providing insight into the basis of sexually dimorphic pain response. Neural mechanisms underlying sex-dependent conditioned pain hypersensitivity are not fully understood.

 The discovery of the kagome metal CsV3Sb5 has generated significant interest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting behavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we performed low-temperature, high-pressure 121/123Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in CsV3Sb5. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a kink at T ~ 0.4 Tc within the superconducting state and follows a T3 variation as temperature further decreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line nodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond Pc ~ 1.85 GPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/T1 shows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below Tc, and decreases rapidly, even faster than T5, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures above Pc. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field Hc2 breaks the C6 rotational symmetry. We propose the s + id pairing at P > Pc which explains both the 1/T1 and Hc2 behaviors. Our findings indicate that CsV3Sb5 is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state is even more exotic at high pressures. The authors study CsV3Sb5 by nuclear quadrupole resonance.

Here the authors show that PGSL1, an Arabidopsis heat-stable actin binding protein stabilizes actin filaments under high temperatures, preventing denaturation and maintaining F-actin dynamics. 
 Global warming intensifies extreme heat events, threatening crop reproduction by impairing pollen development, germination, and tube growth. However, the mechanisms underlying pollen heat responses remain elusive. The actin cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins (ABPs) are crucial in these processes, yet their roles under heat stress are poorly understood. Here, we identify a mutant, pollen germination sensitive to LatB (pgsl1), via forward genetic screening. PGSL1 encodes a heat-stable, plant-specific ABP that binds and stabilizes actin filaments (F-actin), preventing heat-induced denaturation. High temperatures reduce F-actin content but promote bundling in pollen tubes. Notably, pgsl1 mutants exhibit decreased F-actin abundance and bundling under heat stress compared to wild-type plants. These findings highlight PGSL1 as a key regulator of actin dynamics, essential for pollen heat tolerance, offering potential strategies to enhance crop resilience in a warming climate.

 The structure-performance relationship for single atom catalysts has remained unclear due to the averaged coordination information obtained from most single-atom catalysts. Periodic array of single atoms may provide a platform to tackle this inaccuracy. Here, we develop a data-driven approach by incorporating high-throughput density functional theory computations and machine learning to screen candidates based on a library of 1248 sites from single atoms array anchored on biaxial-strained transition metal dichalcogenides. Our screening results in Au atom anchored on biaxial-strained MoSe2 surface via Au-Se3 bonds. Machine learning analysis identifies four key structural features by classifying the ΔGH* data. We show that the average band center of the adsorption sites can be a predictor for hydrogen adsorption energy. This prediction is validated by experiments which show single-atom Au array anchored on biaxial-strained MoSe2 archives 1000 hour-stability at 800 mA cm-2 towards acidic hydrogen evolution.

By tuning interactions via continuous dialysis, researchers uncovered new crystal types, including a previously unknown open-framework structure. 
 Crystallization stands as a prime example of self-assembly. Elementary building blocks converge, seemingly adhering to an intricate blueprint, orchestrating order from chaos. While classical theories describe crystallization as a monomer-by-monomer addition, non-classical pathways introduce complexity. Using microscopic charged particles as monomers, we uncover the mechanisms governing the formation of ionic colloidal crystals. Our findings reveal a two-step process, wherein metastable amorphous blobs condense from the gas phase, before evolving into small binary crystals. These small crystals then grow into large faceted structures via three simultaneous processes: addition of free monomers from bulk, capture and absorption of surrounding blobs, and oriented attachment of other crystals. These complex crystallization pathways occur both in bulk and on surfaces across a range of particle sizes and interaction strengths, resulting in a diverse array of crystal types and morphologies. Harnessing our ability to tune the interaction potential through small changes in salt concentration, we developed a continuous dialysis approach that allows fine control over the interaction strength in both time and space. This method enables us to discover and characterize various crystal structures in a single experiment, including a previously unreported low-density hollow structure and the heteroepitaxial formation of composite crystal structures.

 This study investigates the mechanisms and predictability of multi-year La Niña events, focusing on the 1998–2001 and 2020–2023 triple-dip events, using a physically based statistical ENSO prediction model (EPM). The results highlight distinct driving mechanisms behind these two events. The 1998–2001 event was primarily initiated by substantial negative heat content anomalies in the equatorial Pacific, which resulted from the preceding strong El Niño. These negative heat content anomalies played a crucial role in sustaining cold sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) into the third year. In contrast, the 2020–2023 event, which lacked significant negative heat content anomalies, was characterized by persistent equatorial easterly wind anomalies induced by extratropical forcing from the Southern Hemisphere. The EPM successfully captures these differences, with tropical ocean-atmosphere coupling being the dominant factor in predictability for 1998–2001, especially during the second year, whereas extratropical forcing played a key role in improving forecasts for 2020–2023. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating extratropical influences to enhance the prediction skill of multi-year La Niña events, especially those with atypical tropical precursors."

 Hot–wet compound events, the sequential occurrence of humid hot days followed by extreme rainfall, can cause catastrophic consequences, often exceeding the impacts of the isolated occurrence of each event. The urban-coastal microclimate is confounded by complex interactions of land–sea breeze circulations, urban effects of convection and rainfall, and horizontal advection of moisture, which can favor the hot–wet compound occurrence. We present the first observational assessment (1951–2022) of summertime hot–wet compound events across global coastal megacities. We find a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the frequency of hot–wet compound events in both hemispheres: on average, ~3 events in the 1950s to 43 events in the 2020s. Cities with upward trends in the frequency of hot–wet compound events are situated < 30 km from coasts, with cities in the southern hemisphere showing faster hot-to-wet transition times (<3 days) than cities in the northern hemisphere. Further, 26 out of 29 sites show increased extreme precipitation, reaching 153%, when humid heat amplitude rises from the 50th to 90th percentiles.

 Individuals experience varying levels of social vulnerability to power grid outages caused by disasters. Neglecting social vulnerability in energy resilience strategies can lead to uneven recovery, which has become a major concern in the U.S. However, few studies consider environmental and infrastructural factors in their social vulnerability analysis. Here we introduce a conceptual Power Outage-Risk integrated Social Vulnerability Index (PO-RSVI) to assess vulnerability of small residential communities to prolonged outages. The proposed index comprises dimensions of prolonged outage susceptibility, community coping capacity, and community accessibility, each with indicators evaluating social hardship during power outages. Additionally, an extensive analysis investigates the relationship between PO-RSVI and willingness to pay for emergency power supplies during such event. Through an extensive analysis of three Texas communities using survey and online datasets, PO-RSVI effectively highlights disparities missed by conventional assessments and provides valuable insights for policymakers and energy resilience planners.

 The year 2023 shattered numerous heat records both globally and regionally. We here focus on the drivers of the unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which started in the North Atlantic Ocean in early summer and persisted later on. Evidence is provided that 2023 should be interpreted as an extreme event in a warmer world because of superimposed internal variability on top of human forcing, which altogether, made the 2023 event all-time high due to extreme air-sea surface fluxes in the subtropics and eastern basin. The effect of internal variability has been considerably boosted by the long-term ocean stratification increase due to combined anthropogenically-driven ocean warming and multidecadal variability. The 2023 event would have been impossible to occur without anthropogenically-driven climate change but at the current warmer background climate state, it is assessed as a decadal-type event when considering the full North Atlantic ocean and a centennial event in the subtropics and eastern basin.

 Inorganic mercury (iHg) is an anthropogenic pollutant that forms monomethylmercury, a neurotoxicant affecting human health through seafood consumption. Despite iHg emissions reductions, the impact on oceanic concentrations remains unclear due to limited long-term data. Here, we present a four-year weekly time series of oceanic iHg concentrations at Scripps Pier in La Jolla, California, capturing interannual and seasonal variability. Interannual variability is driven by wet season precipitation, with wet years exhibiting sevenfold higher iHg concentration variance than dry years, potentially linking to El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Seasonally, precipitation and wave dynamics influence iHg inputs, with wet seasons driven by precipitation and runoff and dry seasons by upwelling. These parameters informed a model built to reconstruct a 20-year record of iHg concentrations, suggesting a long-term decline of 0.005 pM yr−1 due to climate-driven effects alone. This study highlights challenges in detecting long-term trends and emphasizes the need for sustained monitoring of oceanic iHg.

Here, we explored the possibility of yield gap reduction through efficient agronomic practices. A 3-year field experiment was conducted at 22 different sites in major wheat-producing regions in China, combined with modeling approaches to perform a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of wheat productivity.

 Landslides stand as a prevalent geological risk in mountainous areas, presenting substantial danger to human habitation. The slip surface (SSF), volume, type and evolution of landslides constitute crucial information from which to understand landslide mechanisms and assess landslide risk. However, current methods for obtaining this information, relying primarily on field surveys, are usually time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly, and are more applicable to individual landslides than large-scale landslide groups. To tackle these challenges, we present a novel method utilizing multi-orbit Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to deduce the SSF, volume and type of active landslides. In this method, the SSF of landslides over a wide area is determined from three-dimensional deformation fields by assuming that the most authentic direction of the landslide movement aligns parallel to the SSF, on the basis of which the volume and type of active landslides can also be inferred. This approach was utilized with landslide groups in Gongjue County (LGGC), situated in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, which pose grave peril to community members and critical construction along the upstream/downstream of the Jinsha River. Firstly, SAR images were gathered and interferometrically processed from four separate platforms, spanning the period from July 2007 to August 2022. Then, three-dimensional displacement time series were inverted based on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations and a topography-constrained model, from which the SSF, volume and type were determined using our proposed method. Finally, the Tikhonov regularization method was applied to reconstruct 15-year displacement time series along the sliding surface, and potential driving factors of landslide motion were identified. Results indicate that 53 landslides were detected in the LGGC region, of which ∼70 % were active and complex landslides with maximum cumulative displacement along the sliding surface reaching 1.5 m over the past ∼15 years. In addition, the deepest SSF of these landslides was found to reach 114 m, with volumes ranging from 1.66 × 105 m3 to 1.72 × 108 m3. Independent in-situ measurements validate the reliability of the SSF obtained in this study. More particularly, we found that the 2018 failure of the Baige landslide (approximately 50 km from LGCC) had caused persistent acceleration to those wading landslides, highlighting the prolonged impact of external factors on landslide evolution. These insights provide a deeper understanding of landslide dynamics and mechanisms, which is crucial when implementing early warning systems and forecasting future failure events."

 Precision management of soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for regulating the global carbon cycle and ensuring food security. Currently, SOC prediction remains challenging due to unresolved moisture disturbances, underutilized multimodal remote sensing data, and uncertain model transferability. To address these challenges, a new paradigm integrating moisture elimination with advanced hybrid deep learning has been developed. Firstly, this research employs optimal cluster analysis based on soil moisture spatial characteristics, followed by the application of the Kubelka-Munk radiative transfer model to construct a moisture elimination strategy (MES). Next, a hybrid deep learning model, Multimodal Transformer Mechanism-Convolutional Neural Network-Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (MT-CNN-ConvLSTM, MCCL), is constructed to enhance predictive accuracy and generalizability. The MCCL model was compared to other machine learning and deep learning models, including LSTM, Random Forest (RF), CNN, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Results indicate that (1) the proposed paradigm achieves optimal SOC content prediction accuracy in humid regions, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.58 g kg−1, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76, a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.26, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.73 g kg−1. The model shows better performance in semi-humid regions, yielding an RMSE of 3.12 g kg−1, R2 of 0.77, RPIQ of 2.27, and MAE of 4.71 g kg−1, indicating significant spatial transferability. (2) Under MES, multiple models showed improved R2 using PLSR as the baseline: e.g., MCCL (41.4 %), LSTM (28.3 %), RF (17.2 %), CNN (14.1 %), ANN (8.1 %), and SVM (7.1 %). (3) The MES approach reduces RMSE by 1.06 g kg−1 and MAE by 1.58 g kg−1, while increasing R2 by 18.75 %, and RPIQ by 0.82. Using the KM radiative transfer model without cluster partitioning decreases RMSE and MAE by 0.58 g kg−1 and 0.23 g kg−1, while increasing R2 and RPIQ by 7.1 % and 0.3, respectively. Specifying the soil moisture gradient in the spectral correction process is crucial. The novel MES-MCCL paradigm proposed in this study is robust and provides promising insights into soil moisture masking’s spectral characterization and the potential of multimodal remote sensing for SOC monitoring."

A notable missing OH reactivity was found during the rush hours in the morning and evening at the urban site, whereas the measured OHR agreed well with the calculated OHR at the regional site. Our analysis revealed that the oxidation products of VOCs significantly contributed to the OHR in highly-oxidizing atmospheres. After adding oxygenated VOCs, a negative correlation between missing OH reactivity and OH exposure was obtained. Finally, we determined the mean kOH values for unknown VOCs to be 9.0 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at the urban site, respectively.

During all haze episodes, IVOCUCM was the main component of IVOCs, but the second dominant components varied among the cities. IVOCn-alkanes was the dominant component in ZB, While IVOCPAHs in HEB, and IVOCb-alkanes in ZK. IVOCs exhibited a statistically significant inverse correlation with PM2.5 and SOAOC/EC (R = −0.48). It was found that IVOCPAHs exhibited the highest reactivity among the four categories and might contribute more significantly to SOA. For some n-alkanes and PAHs, Dodecane (n-C12), Heptadecane (n-C17), and Acenaphthene (ACE) were more reactive species. Using the PMF model and accounting for the photochemical loss of IVOCs, four sources of IVOCs were identified: gasoline exhaust, biomass/coal combustion, diesel-related emissions, and other sources (industrial sources and fireworks emissions). Biomass/coal combustion dominated (54.6 % and 58.1 %, observed and initial) in HEB, while industrial sources were predominant in ZB (63 % and 62.7 %), and fireworks were the main source in ZK (67.5 % and 68.2 %). Our results highlight that biomass/coal combustion, industrial sources and vehicle emissions remain the primary control objects. We also suggest that there is a need to strengthen the emission control strategy for PAHs in IVOCs."

 This study evaluates personal exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 50 workers from small-scale dry-cleaning facilities using optimized ePTFE passive samplers, analyzing 13 VOCs. At mean exposure levels, significant non-carcinogenic risks were identified for trichloroethylene (TCE), while carcinogenic risks were confirmed for five compounds: styrene, benzene, ethylbenzene, dichloroethene (DCE), and perchloroethylene (PCE). Workers most frequently reported health changes (48 %), followed by specific symptoms such as dry skin (24 %), fatigue (22 %), skin irritation (20 %), and eye fatigue (20 %), all of which were associated with exposure to different VOCs in the workplace. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and guidelines regarding working hours, particularly in small-scale workplaces. The VOC emissions from dry-cleaning facilities not only pose direct health risks to workers but also contribute to environmental pollution, highlighting the importance of proactive management and control measures in these businesses."

 Challenges persist in accurately predicting tropical cyclone (TC) intensification and intensity change, owing to restricted understanding of the mechanisms involved. Here the relationship between TC asymmetry (TCA) of outer-core wind field and intensification over the North Atlantic is investigated using best-track and satellite-based wind analysis data from 2000 to 2021. The results suggest a negative correlation between TCA and the upper limit of intensification rate (IR), except in nearly symmetric TCs. TC records are categorized into groups of low, medium, and high asymmetry based on the distribution of TCA. The 24-h evolution of TCA and its variation preceding intensification onset reveal significant differences between TCs with low-to-medium and high asymmetry. TCs with low-to-medium asymmetry tend to exhibit axisymmetrization of the wind field under smaller vertical wind shear (VWS). In contrast, highly asymmetric TCs display sharp increases in wind speed on the downshear-left side of greater-magnitude VWS vector, which can reduce vortex tilt and fortifies TC's resilience against VWS. Furthermore, TCs with higher TCA encounter greater challenges during their intensification stage, especially those with lower lifetime maximum intensity (LMI). TCA reflects the worsening disorganization of convection or the expansion of the inner-core wind field, rendering weaker TCs more susceptible to the effects of VWS. These findings underscore the nuanced relationship between TCA and TC intensification, demonstrating that TCA can serve as an additional indicator to improve the accuracy of TC intensity predictions, while also providing novel insights into the mechanisms driving TC intensification."

 South China is one of the most active regions for thunderstorms in China, yet, research on the charge structure of thunderstorms in this area remains limited. This study utilized lightning data from the Guangdong Lightning Mapping Array and radar observations to examine the charge structure of a thunderstorm that occurred in South China on June 16, 2021. The thunderstorm's charge structure underwent transitions from a dipole in the early stage, a tripole during its mature stage, and back to a dipole in the dissipation period. The heights of the two charge regions in the initial dipolar charge structure increased rapidly. Throughout the storm, the lower positive charge region in the tripolar charge structure was involved in 11.8% of the total 1075 recorded flashes. The average distances between the high-density charge cores of the three charge regions were 2.8 km and 2.6 km from top to bottom. As the storm entered its dissipation stage, the upper positive charge region descended significantly more slowly than the larger particles, as indicated by the continuous decrease in radar reflectivity in this region. The dominant hydrometeors in the upper positive, middle negative, and lower positive charge regions were dry aggregated snow, graupel, and larger-size graupel, respectively, occupying approximately 81%, 67%, and 70% of the total volume in each region. Over the course of the three stages—when the lower positive charge region was initially uninvolved in discharges, became involved, and then ceased participation—the primary microphysical processes in the precipitation beneath the convective core were collisional breakup, size sorting, and collision-coalescence, respectively."

 Obtaining accurate grid precipitation data on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has always been a challenge. Previous studies have shown that reanalysis data or corrected remote sensing precipitation products are important means of obtaining regional precipitation. Extensive evaluation studies have been conducted on the performance of these products on the TP based on observational data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). However, these gridded precipitation products incorporate a significant amount of CMA observational data during their production process, which undermines the objectivity of evaluation results when using the same data. In this study, 47 stations outside the CMA network were selected to evaluate the performance of two newly developed reanalysis precipitation datasets, the meteorological forcing dataset for the Third Pole region (TPMFD) and the CMA global land surface reanalysis product (CRA/Land), on the TP. Their performance was also compared with that of the IMERG Final Run V07, which has been corrected with rain gauge data. The results obtained showed that: (1) The spatial patterns of annual precipitation on the TP revealed by CRA/Land and GPM IMERG were consistent during 2001–2020. However, the TPMFD recorded higher annual precipitation, resulting in a spatial pattern that differed from both CRA/Land and IMERG. All three gridded precipitation products indicate an increasing trend in precipitation on the TP during the 2001–2020. (2) The evaluation results indicate that at the annual scale and cold season, TPMFD overestimates precipitation, while IMERG underestimates precipitation, with the CRA/Land precipitation data showing the highest accuracy. During the warm season, TPMFD also overestimated precipitation, while the accuracy of CRA/Land and IMERG is comparable. Overall, among these three datasets, the CRA/Land precipitation data demonstrates the highest accuracy on the TP. (3) TPMFD incorporates a substantial amount of observational data and applies a daily-scale correction scheme to address the precipitation observation errors. However, previous evaluation results have shown that the precipitation corrected by this scheme tend to be higher than the “true values”, which is a possible reason for the overestimation of precipitation by the TPMFD on the TP."

 The late summer (July and August) extreme high-temperature days (EHTDs) in Eastern China (24°–32°N, 115°–123°E) exhibit a significant increase around 1999/2000. Further investigation indicates that this shift aligns with the transition of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) from a cold phase to a warm phase in the late 1990s. Before 1999, the relationship between the AMV and EHTDs is relatively weak and not significant. However, after 1999, this connection strengthens: During 2000–2022, warm sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the North Atlantic could induce an anomalous atmospheric wave train that propagates across the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in a quasi-barotropic anticyclone and subsidence anomalies over Eastern China. This, in turn, leads to reduced cloud cover, allowing more downward net short-wave radiation (SWR) to reach the surface, warming Eastern China. Simultaneously, enhanced net long-wave radiation (LWR) and net sensible heat flux (SHF) further heat the overlying atmosphere. These processes trigger multiple years of increased EHTDs, raise the overall EHTDs average during the period, and lead to their decadal increase. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) Atlantic pacemaker experiments confirm that the warm North Atlantic forces anomalous high-pressure and anticyclonic circulation over Eastern China. Additionally, a case study from 2022 further supports the critical role of North Atlantic SSTA in driving the variation of EHTDs in Eastern China."

 Satellite precipitation products (SPPs) provide valuable information for hydrological modelling. This paper presents an evaluation of the hydrological utility of in total six Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products. Specifically, as to the IMERG V06 and V07, both the near-real-time products, i.e., Early and Late, and the post-real-time product, i.e., Final, are evaluated at the daily timescale. Based on the GR4J hydrological model, three numerical experiments respectively focusing on the accuracy of precipitation estimation, the usefulness in streamflow simulation and the effectiveness in flood simulation are devised. Through a case study of 20 catchments across 5 climate zones in Australia from 2000 to 2021, the results highlight that the IMERG V07 products generally outperform the IMERG V06 products in the hydrological utility. For the accuracy of precipitation estimation, the relative bias (rBias) at the point scale of the IMERG V07 products tends to be lower than that of the IMERG V06 products. The median rBias is respectively −31.17% and −16.61% for the IMERG V06 and V07 Early products, is respectively −29.11% and −12.77% for the IMERG V06 and V07 Late products and is respectively −7.83% and −7.46% for the IMERG V06 and V07 Final products. There are evident improvements in streamflow simulation from the IMERG V06 products to the IMERG V07 products, with the median Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) increasing from 0.32 to 0.40 under the Early products, from 0.33 to 0.41 under the Late products and from 0.59 to 0.61 under the Final products. Regarding flood simulation, the percent bias in the flow duration curve high-segment volume (FHV) is reduced from the IMERG V06 products to the IMERG V07 products, with the median FHV increasing from −61.52% to −39.29% for the Early products, from −59.28% to −35.18% for the Late products and from −38.85% to −30.64% for the Final products.

Upon radiation, YTHDF1 is phosphorylated at serine-182 in an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related–dependent manner.

To investigate the efficacy of targeting either methionine metabolism or the TDP for healthspan improvement in advanced age, we initiated dietary MetR or TDP inhibition in 18-month-old C57BL/6J mice. MetR significantly improved neuromuscular function, metabolic health, lung function, and frailty. In addition, we confirmed improved neuromuscular function from dietary MetR in 5XFAD mice, whose weight was not affected by MetR. We did not observe benefits with TDP inhibition. Single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing of muscle revealed cell type–specific responses to MetR, although MetR did not significantly affect mouse aging epigenetic clock markers. Similarly, an 8-week MetR intervention in a human trial (NCT04701346) showed no significant impact on epigenetic clocks. The observed benefits from late-life MetR provide translational rationale to develop MetR mimetics as an antiaging intervention."

This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, initiating a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, resulting in abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we show that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Last, we demonstrate that APOBEC3B-induced PARP1 trapping and DNA double-strand breaks drive cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating a context of synthetic lethality when coupled with PARP inhibitors."

Analysis of 73 clinical samples revealed heightened proliferation in H3-SCDMG versus wild-type tumors, suggesting therapeutic vulnerabilities. Drug screening identified cytarabine (Ara-C) as highly effective in inhibiting proliferation in H3 K27M cell models, recently established patient-derived cells, and patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, Ara-C can suppress tumor growth through DNA damage, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. An investigator-initiated clinical trial involving four patients showed benefits in three cases. In addition, a subset of cells exhibited senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype post–Ara-C treatment, accompanied by several immune checkpoint ligands’ up-regulation and more immune cell infiltration. Combining Ara-C with dual Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and TIGIT blockade emerged as a promising strategy to disrupt immune evasion by senescent cells, enhancing antitumor responses.

With a transform-limited excitation pulse in 25 femtoseconds, we observed the excited-state wave packet dynamics in ET reactions with a dephasing time within 1 ps. By modulating the phase of the excitation pulses, the ultrafast ET dynamics was found to change from 100 to 300 fs due to the different wave packets prepared by chirped pulses. We further found that the coherent control through the modulated wave packets can propagate into the subsequent back ET reactions resulting in the dynamics varying from 500 to 800 fs. This successful demonstration of coherent controlled ET reactions paves the way to control a variety of complex ET processes in chemical and biological systems."

We show that obese mice maintained under hypoxia exhibit a delayed but distinct decrease in blood glucose with improved insulin sensitivity, which is independent of changes in body weight. This effect of hypoxia is mediated by erythropoiesis and is a direct result of the rising hematocrit, which could be due to erythrocytes acting as carriers of glucose units in the blood. Glucose lowering by the red cell mass is evidenced by a prompt decrease in glycemia in mice receiving a blood transfusion. Furthermore, life under hypoxia as well as treatment with erythropoietin reduce glycemia also in mice expressing the erythropoietin receptor exclusively in hematopoietic cells, which contrasts with previous assumptions attributing metabolic actions of erythropoietin to direct action on nonhematopoietic tissues. Our results provide a rationale for associations between hematocrit and blood glucose in humans under anti-anemic therapy, polycythemia, smoking, and high-altitude exposure."

Strategies to disrupt XPO1 nuclear export activity fully restore ETV6 P214L protein nuclear localization and transcription regulation activity, establishing XPO1-dependent mislocalization as a critical mechanism underscoring ETV6 P214L dysfunction. Mechanistic insight inspired the design of “humanized” ETV6 mice in which the germline P214L mutation is sufficient to elicit severe defects in thrombopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and survival in animals.

While neonates receive maternal protection, they can also independently combat pathogens, although the mechanisms remain unknown. Using the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) as a model, we investigated immunological defense strategies of marsupial neonates. Cathelicidins—a family of antimicrobial peptides expanded in the genomes of marsupials—are highly expressed in developing neutrophils. Sugar glider cathelicidins reside in two genomic clusters, and their coordinated expression is achieved by enhancer sharing within clusters and long-range physical interactions between clusters. Functionally, cathelicidins modulate immune responses and have potent antibacterial effects, sufficient to provide protection in a mouse model of sepsis. Evolutionarily, cathelicidins have a complex history, with marsupials and monotremes uniquely retaining both clusters among tetrapods. Thus, cathelicidins are critical mediators of marsupial immunity, and their evolution may reflect the life history–specific immunological needs of these animals."

Here, we propose a method for the simultaneous determination of mobility and lifetime using only one technique: transient photoluminescence spectroscopy. By measuring and simulating the decay of the photoluminescence intensity and the redshift of the photoluminescence peak as a function of time after the laser pulse, we extract the mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length of halide perovskite films.

During this year, each donor received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Notwithstanding these vaccinations, the concentrations of the most abundant IgG1 clones remained constant. Given the 2- to 3-week half-life of IgG1 molecules in blood, our data suggest that these clones are associated with long-term immunity and do not undergo somatic hypermutation which would imply short-lived plasma cells.

To address this outstanding problem, we developed a technique to map the crystal orientations of these sulfates in situ at two stratigraphically similar locations in the Shenandoah formation, allowing us to constrain the burial depth and paleoenvironment at the time of their precipitation. Our crystal orientation mapping results and outcrop-scale fracture analyses reveal two different generations of Ca-sulfates: one likely precipitated in the shallow subsurface and a second one that formed at a burial depth below 80 meters.

By contrast, CASPR2-reactive memory B cells were exclusive to patients, and their B cell receptors demonstrated affinity-enhancing somatic mutations with pathogenic effects in neuronal cultures and mice. The unmutated, precursor memory B cell receptors showed a distinctive balance between strong CASPR2 reactivity and very limited binding across the remaining human proteome.

A structural switch comprising the Thr-Val-Gly- Gly (TVGG) motif either assumes a disordered coil or a 310helix conformation to regulate hexamer or pentamer assembly, respectively. The cellular polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) binds to a positively charged pore of CA capsomers rich in arginine and lysine residues mediated by electrostatic interactions. Both IP6binding and TVGG coil-to-helix transition are essential for pentamer formation. However, the connection between IP6binding and TVGG conformational switch remains unclear. Using extensive atomistic simulations, we show that IP6imparts structural order at the central ring, which results in multiple kinetically controlled events leading to the coil-to-helix conformational change of the TVGG motif.

We recently identified reduced nuclear TDP-43 in capillary endothelial cells (ECs) of donors with ALS-FTD. Because blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability increases in ALS-FTD, we postulated that reduced nuclear TDP-43 in ECs might contribute. Here, we show that nuclear TDP-43 is reduced in ECs of mice with an ALS-FTD–associated mutation in TDP-43 (TardbpG348C) and that this leads to cell-autonomous loss of junctional complexes and BBB integrity. Targeted excision of TDP-43 in brain ECs recapitulates BBB defects and loss of junctional complexes and ultimately leads to fibrin deposition, gliosis, phospho-Tau accumulation, and impaired memory and social interaction. Transcriptional changes in TDP-43–deficient ECs resemble diseased brain ECs. These data show that nuclear loss of TDP-43 in brain ECs disrupts the BBB and causes hallmarks of FTD."

A mutation that electrically silences the AVK interneurons uncouples egg laying from detection of environmental food cues. We find that AVK activity inhibits egg laying, and AVKs themselves are inhibited by dopamine released from food-sensing neurons. AVKs express a large number of structurally and functionally diverse neuropeptides. Coordination of food-sensing and reproductive behavior requires a subset of AVK neuropeptides that converge on a small ensemble of premotor neurons that coexpress their cognate receptors. Modulation ofC. elegansreproductive behavior, therefore, requires a cascade of neuromodulatory signals that uses disinhibition and combinatorial neuropeptide signals to activate reproductive behavior when food is sensed."

Even though ice temperature is a defining characteristic of any glacier, such measurements have been conducted on less than 1 ‰ of all glaciers globally. Our database permits us, for the first time, to investigate glacier temperature distributions at global or regional scales. 
 Measurements of englacial temperatures have been collected since the earliest years of glaciology, with the first measurements dating back to the mid-19th century. Although temperature is a defining characteristic of any glacier – and is notoriously laborious to collect –  no effort had been made yet to gather all existing measurements. In an attempt to make existing ice temperature data more accessible, we present glenglat, the global englacial temperature database compiled from 316 literature sources and 12 data submissions and composed of 1 931 831 measurements of depth and temperature from 788 boreholes located on 213 glaciers outside the ice sheets. Alongside recent compilations for the ice sheets (Løkkegaard et al., 2023; Vandecrux et al., 2023), most published englacial temperature measurements are now readily available to the research community.Here, we review the variety of glacier thermal regimes that have been measured and summarize the spatial, temporal, and climatic coverage of measurements relative to the global glacierized area. Measurements of cold and polythermal glacier ice greatly outnumber those of temperate ice. Overall, temperature has been measured in fewer than 1 ‰ of all glaciers, and only 27 % of boreholes have been measured more than once, highlighting the great potential to investigate changing temperature conditions by repeating past measurements. The database is developed on GitHub (https://github.com/mjacqu/glenglat, last access: 7 April 2024) and published to Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11516611, Welty et al., 2025). It consists of four relational tables and detailed machine-actionable and human-readable metadata. The GitHub repository also provides submission instructions (including a spreadsheet template and validation tools), in the hope that investigators will help us keep glenglat complete and current going forward. We hope that glenglat will improve our understanding of glacier thermal regimes, refine glacier thermodynamic models, and give insight into hazardous glacier instabilities in a warming world."

Here, we conducted a 70-day incubation experiment to investigate how aerobic straw humification influenced the repartitioning of arsenic (As) associated with ferrihydrite in paddy soil. Results showed that the humification was characterized by rapid OM degradation (1–14 days) and subsequent slow maturation (14–70 days). During the degradation stage, considerable As (13.1 mg·L–1) was released into the aqueous phase, which was reimmobilized to the solid phase in the maturation stage. Meanwhile, the low-crystalline structural As/Fe was converted to a more stable species, with a subtle crystalline phase transformation. The generated highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and enriched Enterobacter and Sphingomonas induced ferrihydrite (∼3.1%) and As(V) reduction, leading to As release during the degradation stage. In the maturation stage, carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules facilitated the aqueous As reimmobilization. Throughout the humification process, organo-mineral complexes formed between OM and ferrihydrite via C–O–Fe bond contributed to the solid-phase As/Fe stabilization.

The isolation and recovery of DOM, however, remain formidable challenges. Herein, we report a simple yet efficient coordination polymer packaging (CPP) strategy for DOM isolation and recovery in water samples. This method relies on a DOM-triggered coordination polymer deposition principle, akin to natural biomineralization, transforming hard-to-separate DOM to undissolving precipitate within 1 min. The DOM-encased coordination polymer is acid-sensitive, facilitating the DOM recovery by simply acidifying the solution to pH 6. This CPP approach achieves ∼90% isolation and ∼80% recovery efficiency across a wide range of DOM concentrations and exhibits excellent stability under diverse environmental conditions, with an estimated cost of $4.1 per gram of DOM isolated per ton of water, which is 3 orders of magnitude cheaper than existing methods. The feasibility of the CPP approach was demonstrated with real water samples, including surface water, wastewater, and landfill leachate. We believe this straightforward, facile, time-saving, and cost-effective approach holds significant potential to refine the hydrospheric carbon recycle by simplifying DOM management and thereby contributing to mitigating the adverse global climate changes."

The two biofertilizers were tested for their impacts on plant growth and potential microbial risks. The results show significant growth of oats stimulated by biofertiliser use. Both’St’ and’StM’ increased plant biomass, while with the latter, the crude protein content (+5.1%) and root biomass were also higher. Reduced abundances of resistome genes (30%) and pathogens (25%) were observed during the oat growth. Further, metagenomics analysis also indicated a reduction in antibiotic-resistance genes by −20% in soils with oats treated by’St’ and −46% in’StM’ biofertilizer treatment. The’StM’ had a three-fold stronger inhibitory effect on oat rhizosphere soil pathogens than’St’. Moreover, compared to’St’,’StM’ suppressed pathogens in seeds and stems, with specific beneficial biomarker microbes in different plant parts.

Biological age indexes were calculated using the Klemera–Doubal method (KDM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD). The DDS was calculated based on the consumption frequency of 13 food groups over the past 12 months. Most PFASs showed positive associations with KDM-age acceleration (KDM-AA), while no statistically significant associations were observed with MD. The dose–response relationships of PFASs with KDM-AA and MD were steeper at low concentrations of PFASs, and then the slope appeared flat at higher concentrations. The weighted quantile sum revealed positive mixture effects of PFASs on biological aging. PFHpS and PFNA were both major contributors to KDM-AA and MD. DDS appeared to potentially modify the association between PFASs and biological aging. Our findings demonstrate that PFASs were significantly associated with accelerated biological aging, whereas higher DDS mitigates these adverse effects, highlighting the importance of this preventive measure."

The unique catalyst is comprised of a graphitic layer bottom-wrapped Fe@Fe3C encapsulated inside nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. The Fe3C shell facilitates selective formation of surface-bound FeIV═O with up to 96.0% selectivity, and the applied electric field could switch ROS generation toward free 1O2 with 90.5% selectivity, as enabled by C atoms adjacent to graphite N.

This study provides the first evidence of NPs intercellular transfer in the hemocytes of green mussels (Perna viridis), which subsequently activated the immunomodulation process. NPs were predominantly internalized by granulocytes, with a portion being translocated and deposited in lysosomes, whereas those retained in endosomes were subsequently transferred to new hemocytes (mainly granulocytes). The transfer direction was driven by the intracellular NP concentration gradients. Transfer kinetics was size-dependent, with smaller-sized NPs exhibiting greater potential but a lower rate, primarily due to their specific extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer pathway. Tunneling nanotubes provided the most efficient pathway for the intercellular transfer of NPs, as their continuous membrane structure allowed direct substance exchange. Crucially, NP redistribution was accompanied by a gradient-driven transfer of mitochondria to injured hemocytes. This process alleviated stress on the overburdened hemocytes and regulated reactive oxygen species production, subsequently enhancing phagocytic activity and promoting immune responses.

This potential mercury–selenium interaction is under-studied in aquatic macroinvertebrates, particularly in relation to complex life histories. We examined the proposed effect of selenium on methylmercury accumulation between four life stages for a parthenogenetic mayfly (Neocloeon triangulifer). We exposed diatoms to elevated methylmercury concentrations and fed them to mayflies exposed to elevated aqueous selenomethionine. We found some support for the mercury–selenium antagonism hypothesis, but it was context-specific. Selenium reduced methylmercury accumulation in high but not low methylmercury environments. Though terrestrial adult life stages had higher mercury concentrations compared to aquatic larval life stages, cumulative life history transfer factor (LHTF; ratio of methylmercury in adult imago to late instar larvae) differed by treatment. LHTF was constant for all aqueous selenium exposure levels at high dietary methylmercury (selenium impacts on methylmercury uptake and loss) but increased with aqueous selenium exposures at low dietary methylmercury (selenium impacts on methylmercury uptake only), suggesting a synergistic enhancement of MeHg transfer between life stages with increased aqueous Se exposure levels. These results suggest that animals eating adult aquatic insects are exposed to higher concentrations of methylmercury than those feeding on larval insects across selenium and methylmercury levels, but interference of selenium on methylmercury accumulation is only present at high methylmercury environments."

The inventory of 237Np and 239+240Pu in sediment cores shows a consistent decreasing trend from shallow to deep sea. Simulation analysis of core samples using the ADE model found that Np migrates faster than Pu, which may be related to their differences in solubility. The S-ADE model was employed to simulate the concentration of Np and Pu in seawater. The distribution of these two nuclides in seawater follows a similar trend to that in sediments, but there are significant differences in vertical distribution.

This emission is generated by highly charged ions colliding with neutrals in Earth's exosphere. Accurate SWCX models require data on exospheric neutral densities, as well as solar wind flux and composition. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) Solar Wind Ionic Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) provided the needed solar wind composition data from 1998 until an instrument anomaly in 2011 limited its outputs. To address this, we developed empirical functions using ion ratios (O7+/O6+,O8+/O6+,C6+/C5+ ${\mathrm{O}}^{7+}/{\mathrm{O}}^{6+},{\mathrm{O}}^{8+}/{\mathrm{O}}^{6+},{\mathrm{C}}^{6+}/{\mathrm{C}}^{5+}$) still available from ACE, partially compensating for missing composition data.

Yet, the effects of stress oscillations on fault friction under realistic subsurface conditions are not fully clear. We conducted normal stress oscillations experiments using simulated fault gouges derived from the major reservoirs and caprocks of the Changning shale gas field under in situ conditions. Our experimental results reveal that most gouges are velocity‐strengthening under quasi‐static loading. Interestingly, after applying normal stress oscillation, they show similar shear stress evolution with different oscillation amplitudes, frequencies and load‐point velocity, suggesting a negligible effect of the rock composition and the applied P‐T conditions. We successfully reproduce our experimental results using an extended CNS (Chen‐Niemeijer‐Spiers) model and the model proposed by Linker and Dieterich (1992, https://doi.org/10.1029/92jb00017).

An empirical width‐discharge equation derived from 5,740 United States Geological Survey gauging stations further improves accuracy (R2 = 0.82). For best results, branch widths should be measured within one channel width of the bifurcation. The method is ineffective in cases influenced by tributaries, avulsion, or multiple branches.

The method models the near‐field CSID in about 60 s of simulation time, that is, before the waves are detected in the ionospheric TEC measurements.

The event was likely caused by a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) due to freshwater drainage into the North Atlantic. It was associated with a global‐scale climate change but is recorded in very few high‐resolution paleoclimatic time series from the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In this study, we investigate the 8.2 ka event in the SH, particularly the Australian climate response to a weakened AMOC. Five North Atlantic meltwater experiments are conducted with the Australian Earth System Model, ACCESS‐ESM1.5, to evaluate the sensitivity of AMOC responses to freshwater perturbations under early Holocene conditions as well as their climate impact. Our results suggest a 100 year freshwater pulse reproduces a global climate change that best matches existing proxy records for the 8.2 ka event. Australian surface air temperatures show significant cooler conditions in the northern half of the continent but warmer anomalies in the south in response to a weakened AMOC. Australian hydroclimate displays a more complex response at 8.2 ka. Northern Australian precipitation is influenced by a southward shift in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and a strengthened Indo‐Australian summer monsoon, while the southern part of the continent is more sensitive to weakening of the winter westerly winds. These results highlight the importance of understanding the Australian climate response to a weakened AMOC under different background climate in order to better predict potential future impacts."

An ensemble of artificial neural networks is trained to predict anomalous, low‐pass filtered 500 mb height at 7–8 weeks lead using SST. We then use self‐organizing maps (SOMs) constructed from 9 regions within the SST domain to detect state‐dependent prediction skill. SOMs are built using the entire SST time series, and we assess which SOM units feature confident neural network predictions. Four regimes are identified that provide skillful seasonal predictions of 500 mb height.

However, the specific role of the former in modulating Asian climate responses to the latter remains inadequately understood, hindering our comprehension of the Asian climate evolution. To tackle this issue, we simulated the Asian climate by using the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.2 for two key periods: the late Eocene‐early Oligocene and the late Oligocene‐early Miocene. The simulations show that the TP uplift not only strengthened the Asian monsoon (AM), resulting in more annual and summer precipitation due to its elevated heating but also significantly amplified eccentricity‐precession forcing and minorly weakened obliquity forcing on the Asian climate. Given a relatively lower and smaller TP during the late Eocene‐early Oligocene, the northern East Asian precipitation is little influenced by eccentricity‐precession cycles, in contrast to previous reconstruction records. This implied a relatively higher and/or larger TP might have existed at that time. As the TP continued to rise in the late Oligocene‐early Miocene, East AM precipitation became more sensitive to rising summer insolation, with precipitation increasing in the southern region while decreasing in the northern region. These findings emphasize the significance of taking the TP uplift into account when examining the influence of orbital forcing on the Asian climate during the Cenozoic."

 Although previous studies have shown that transposable elements (TEs) are conservatively activated to play key roles during early embryonic development, the details of zygotic TE activation (ZTA) remain poorly understood. Here, we employ long-read sequencing to precisely identify that only a small subset of TE loci are activated among numerous copies, allowing us to map their hierarchical transcriptional cascades at the single-locus and single-transcript level. Despite the heterogeneity of ZTA across family, subfamily, locus, and transcript levels, our findings reveal that ZTA follows a markedly different pattern from conventional zygotic gene activation (ZGA): ZTA occurs significantly later than ZGA and shows a pronounced bias for nuclear localization of TE transcripts. This study advances our understanding of TE activation by providing a high-resolution view of TE copies and creating a comprehensive catalog of thousands of previously unannotated transcripts and genes that are activated during early zebrafish embryogenesis. Among these genes, we highlight two that are essential for zebrafish development.

Here, the authors find that center-specific models improved IVF live birth predictions over a US registry model, and draw conclusions for improving IVF access, affordability and patient-centric counseling. 
 Expanding in vitro fertilization (IVF) access requires improved patient counseling and affordability via cost-success transparency. Clinicians ask how two types of live birth prediction (LBP) models perform: machine learning, center-specific (MLCS) models and the multicenter, US national registry-based model produced by Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART). In a retrospective model validation study, we tested whether MLCS performs better than SART using 4635 patients’ first-IVF cycle data from 6 centers. MLCS significantly improved minimization of false positives and negatives overall (precision recall area-under-the-curve) and at the 50% LBP threshold (F1 score) compared to SART (p < 0.05). To contextualize, MLCS more appropriately assigned 23% and 11% of all patients to LBP ≥ 50% and LBP ≥ 75% whereas SART gave lower LBPs. Here, we show MLCS improves model metrics relevant for clinical utility – personalizing prognostic counseling and cost-success transparency – and is externally validated. We recommend evaluating MLCS in a larger sample of fertility centers. Machine learning is increasingly used to support IVF pretreatment prognostic counseling. Here, the authors find that center-specific models improved IVF live birth predictions over a US registry model, and draw conclusions for improving IVF access, affordability and patient-centric counseling."

This study leverages US tide gauge data from 1950–2020 to show that likelihood estimates of storm surge extremes have been underpredicted at 85% of gauge sites and finds regional likely changes in their frequency over that historical monitoring period. 
 Understanding extreme storm surge events that threaten low-lying coastal communities is key to effective flood mitigation/adaptation measures. However, observational estimates are sparse and highly uncertain along most coastal regions with a lack of observational evidence about long-term underlying trends and their contribution to overall extreme sea-level changes. Here, using a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical framework, we analyse US tide gauge record for 1950–2020 and find that observational estimates have underestimated likelihoods of storm surge extremes at 85% of tide gauge sites nationwide. Additionally, and contrary to prevailing beliefs, storm surge extremes show spatially coherent trends along many widespread coastal areas, providing evidence of changing coastal storm intensity in the historical monitoring period. Several hotspots exist with regionally significant storm surge trends that are comparable to trends in mean sea-level rise and its key components. Our findings challenge traditional coastal design/planning practices that rely on estimates from discrete observations and assume stationarity in surge extremes.

 At subduction zones, downgoing topographic features exert first-order structural and hydrologic effect on the plate boundary and the upper plate. Such process has been rarely documented by clear observations, especially at great depths, and it remains elusive how the altered structural and physical characteristics of the upper plate control seismogenic behavior and tectonic evolution of margins. Here, we present a reprocessed multichannel seismic (MCS) profile together with bathymetry and earthquake data in the central Lesser Antilles. A reflector imaged at 15-18 km depth ahead of the Tiburon ridge delimits the base of inner forearc crust with pervasive reflective anomalies. It is interpreted to represent a shallow fluid-rich decollement warped over the rough topography, where the underlying materials consist largely of oceanic sediments identical to those accreted at the Barbados prism and basement fragments from basal erosion. Our results suggest that fluids are expelled upward from the band of subducted sediments, leading to a NW-SE elongated zone of hydrofractured and weakened crust above a serpentinized mantle corner coinciding with a prominent aseismic corridor. The high interplate seismic activity offshore Martinique at ~30–65 km depths may correspond to deeply subducted indurated sediments that act as a strong asperity on the plate interface.

 The biogenic methane contributes obviously to global warming, and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) driven CO2 reductive methanogenesis is one of the important methanogenic pathways. Here we report DIET-driven methylotrophic methanogenesis in paddy soil and the prevalent Methanomassiliicoccus. M. luminyensis CZDD1 exhibited a 1.9-fold higher methanol-derived methanogenic rate when cocultured with Clostridium malenominatum than its H2-dependent monoculture. Coculturing with Geobacter metallireducens, a known extracellular electron producer, CZDD1 showed the same efficient methanol-derived methane production, thus identified DIET-based methylotrophic methanogenesis. Chronoamperometry detected efficient methane production by M. luminyensis CZDD1 and two paddy soils from methanol and dimethylarsenate in accompany with current consumption. Differential transcriptomics predicted a membrane-bound Fpo-like complex of CZDD1 for uptake of extracellular electrons. Co-occurrence of Methanomassiliicoccaceae with Geobacteraceae and Clostridiaceae was found in five Chinese paddy soils, and Methanomassiliicoccus is ubiquitously distributed among various anoxic environments.

 Mangroves are a critical habitat that provide a suite of ecosystem services and support livelihoods. Here we undertook a global analysis to model the density and abundance of 37 commercially important juvenile fish and juvenile and resident invertebrates that are known to extensively use mangroves, by fitting expert-identified drivers of density to fish and invertebrate density data from published field studies. The numerical model predicted high densities throughout parts of Southeast and South Asia, the northern coast of South America, the Red Sea, and the Caribbean and Central America. Application of our model globally estimates that mangroves support an annual abundance of over 700 billion juvenile fish and invertebrates. While abundance at the early life-history stage does not directly equate to potential economic or biomass gains, this estimate indicates the critical role of mangroves globally in supporting fish and fisheries, and further builds the case for their conservation and restoration.

 Facing climate change risks of water shortages and crop yield losses, it is unclear in China that whether and how irrigated area expansion and technological yield improvement can increase production with less water. Here we used 2000–2018 as the baseline and simulated the grid responses of total crop water use, production, unit water footprint by cropping modes in 2030s–2090 s in 75 scenarios with considering each 5 levels of two adaptation measures under 3 climate change pathways. Compared with climate change alone, further irrigation expansion has limited effects on increasing production (below 20.8%) and decreasing water footprint (below 3.6%). Combined two adaptation measures magnifies their respective effects, with technological yield improvement dominating contributions to production (37.0–99.6%) and water footprint (90.4–102.3%). In comprehensive optimal scenario, water footprint will reduce with increased production. No water is saved with reduced green water (1.6–1.7%) and increased blue water (6.6–21.6%).

 River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75th percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.

 Component temperature and emissivity are crucial for understanding plant physiology and urban thermal dynamics. However, existing thermal infrared unmixing methods face challenges in simultaneous retrieval and multi-component analysis. We propose Thermal Remote sensing Unmixing for Subpixel Temperature and emissivity with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer model (TRUST-DART), a gradient-based multi-pixel physical method that simultaneously separates component temperature and emissivity from non-isothermal mixed pixels over urban areas. TRUST-DART utilizes the DART model and requires inputs including at-surface radiance imagery, downwelling sky irradiance, a 3D mock-up with component classification, and standard DART parameters (e.g., spatial resolution and skylight ratio). This method produces maps of component emissivity and temperature. The accuracy of TRUST-DART is evaluated using both vegetation and urban scenes, employing Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images and DART-simulated pseudo-ASTER images. Results show a residual radiance error is approximately 0.05 W/(m2·sr). In absence of the co-registration and sensor noise errors, the median residual error of emissivity is approximately 0.02, and the median residual error of temperature is within 1 K. This novel approach significantly advances our ability to analyze thermal properties of urban areas, offering potential breakthroughs in urban environmental monitoring and planning. The source code of TRUST-DART is distributed together with DART (https://dart.omp.eu)."

 The Jack Rabbit II (JR-II) Mock Urban Environment field test was reproduced in a 1:50 scale physical model in the wind tunnel at the Chemical Hazards Research Center of the University of Arkansas. The agreement of the approaching wind characteristics between field test and model was verified using 3D Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). 2D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) tests were conducted in the model to obtain velocity measurements in the MUE. Velocity measurements taken before and during a simulated chlorine release were compared. PIV results show the general flow complexity in the last rows of the MUE and the impact of the release in two different wind conditions from JR-II. Simulations of neutrally buoyant releases conducted in one set of wind conditions showed that the impact on the release was mostly a result of the added density of the chlorine simulant and not from the added velocity of the gas release. Changes in the dividing streamline at CONEX 11.4 and in the vorticity around the model building were also observed, especially for lower atmospheric wind speed (momentum). PIV results show the impact of the release in two different perspectives, from the side and from above the MUE. Physical (wind tunnel) modeling can supplement the information available from field tests to provide validation data sets for computational models, and such exercises can even be more valuable for computational model validation because the initial conditions in wind tunnel tests are generally better understood than in field tests."

 It is presently unclear how lightning channel forms inside a thundercloud, where maximal electric field strengths are about an order of magnitude lower than the dielectric strength of air. Recently, a hypothesis has been formulated, according to which a lightning leader forms inside a hierarchical network of plasma channels that fills an area of increased intracloud electric field. The study proposes a numerical model that is used to simulate the transition from separate streamer systems to complex plasma structures which segments are characterized by a wide spread of electrical parameters. Those clusters, which are sufficiently extended along an intracloud electric field vector, can be considered as lightning seeds. It is shown that their formation is a fairly collective process that can occur in electric fields lower than positive streamers propagation threshold. Depending on considered conditions, the required spatiotemporal frequencies of streamer systems appearance are shown to be less than or of the order of those of hydrometeors collisions (or nearly collisions) in a thundercloud. The altitudes of 6 and 9 km, which are the most typical for lightning genesis, are considered to analyze how the factor of air density influences the features of a lightning seed formation process."

We found that color pattern in populations of stick insects on two mountains is associated with translocations that have also been inverted. These translocations differ in size and origin on each mountain, but they overlap partially and involve some of the same gene regions. Moreover, this structural variation is subject to divergent selection and arose without introgression between species. Our results show how the origin of structural variation provides a mechanism for repeated bouts of adaptation."

Nucleolin, a major MycG4-binding protein, exhibits greater affinity for MycG4 than for nucleolin recognition element (NRE) RNA. Nucleolin’s four RNA binding domains (RBDs) are essential for high-affinity MycG4 binding. We present the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of the nucleolin-MycG4 complex, revealing a folded parallel three-tetrad G-quadruplex with two coordinating potassium ions (K+), interacting with RBD1, RBD2, and Linker12 through its 6–nucleotide (nt) central loop and 5′ flanking region. RBD3 and RBD4 bind MycG4’s 1-nt loops as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing confirmed nucleolin’s binding to MycG4 in cells.

Leveraging population genetics principles, we fine-mapped about 22,000 chromatin accessibility–associated genetic variants with widespread cell type–specific effects. Variants in TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR–binding sites were the most prevalent determinants of chromatin accessibility.

This approach efficiently produces highly enantioenriched α-chiral alkyl amines and facilitates the enantioselective formal synthesis of a series of important drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that bulky peripheral modifications on the ligands help create a truncated cone-shaped chiral pocket, enabling precise enantiodiscrimination through steric hindrance and noncovalent interactions.

Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without affecting apical plasticity. Thus, individual neurons use multiple activity-dependent plasticity rules in a compartment-specific manner in vivo during learning."

This transition requires a high purity regenerant for pure product recovery (e.g., ammonium recovery from urine) because the long-lasting direct contact regeneration directly mixes the eluted target ions with the regenerant. Direct contact regeneration prevents using impure regenerants such as electrochemically produced acid (containing electrolyte salts) from making a pure product, hindering the advancement of electrified ammonium recovery via ion exchange. We demonstrated a new concept of indirect contact regeneration leveraging the “proton leakage” from an anion exchange membrane to achieve tandem proton separation and resin regeneration, which enabled the recovery of pure ammonium  by an impure acid. A weak acid cation exchange resin enabled multicycles over 80% regeneration efficiency by the limited proton leakage from mild acids with pH 2–3.

However, the lack of cascading risk modeling techniques makes it challenging to determine how disruptions in one economic sector propagate to others through the supply chain. In this study, we construct a national multilayer cascading risk model using 2017 multiregional input–output data from China and simulate shock propagation. Our results show that the originating sector and geographic location of a shock are critical in determining the collapse’s effects. The probability of a large avalanche (>1000 collapsed nodes) varies from 2 to 80% across provinces and from 1 to 96% across layers. Food production and processing, chemical smelting, and energy supply are critical layers that amplify the cascade effects of shocks. Grain regions like Henan and Hunan, manufacturing hubs such as Guangdong, and water and energy suppliers like Sichuan and Hubei face high cascading risks. Our scenario analyses show that reducing output dependence on nodes decreases the system’s avalanche size by 20–40% while improving water production efficiency reduces it by 10–22%. These results highlight the importance of diversifying supply sources and optimizing water use efficiency to enhance network resilience."

While a substantial portion of MPs in the environment arises from the degradation of plastic litter and the wear of polymer-containing materials (secondary MPs), deliberate incorporation of MPs in certain products (primary MPs) also represents a considerable source, and targeted measures can be implemented to minimize human exposure and environmental releases. Improved policies for managing macroplastic waste help mitigate secondary MPs, but addressing primary MPs requires distinct strategies. Globally, various approaches, such as bans or restrictions on primary MPs, have been proposed, including the recent EU regulation under REACH, which groups intentionally added MPs together based on their diverse uses and properties. However, applying the Essential Use Concept (EUC) provides a more refined regulatory approach; balancing environmental health, technical feasibility, and innovation. This perspective explores the potential, challenges, and limitations of implementing the EUC for primary MPs. By examining four use cases─controlled-release medicines, agricultural seed coatings, personal care products, and artificial turf infill─we highlight how the EUC can prioritize essential and beneficial applications while phasing out nonessential uses."

Synthetic solutions containing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), other PFAS, and inorganic constituents (phosphate, ammonium, chloride, carbonate, and acetate salts) found in centrate were studied to assess their impact on the oxidation process. PFOA removal decreased from 95% in a stable electrolyte (NaClO4) to 81% in a Na2HPO4 electrolyte and 30% in a solution mimicking concentrated centrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy detected phosphate and nitrogen species on the electrode surface. At potentials required to oxidize PFAS (>3.0 V/SHE), phosphate and ammonium were oxidized to radicals that blocked electrode sites, inhibiting PFAS removal and shifting PFOA oxidation from first-order kinetics. The kinetics were accurately modeled using a Langmuir–Hinshelwood approach with a transient inhibition term. Results suggested that phosphate, ammonium, and bicarbonate ions reduced hydroxyl radical availability, thereby limiting PFOA defluorination. In concentrated centrate, 95% of the chemical oxygen demand and 93% of total PFAS were removed after 233 s of electrolysis at 30 mA cm–2. However, partial degradation of perfluorohexanoic acid and accumulation of perfluoroheptanoic acid, attributed to inorganic electrode fouling, suggested the need for a multistage reactor system for more complete PFAS mineralization."

Traditionally, the presence of coexisting nitrate in water has always been regarded as a major inhibitory factor for PFASs defluorination. However, this study observed an unexpected promotive effect of nitrate on defluorination, challenging the previous phenomenon. Notably, the addition of 100 μM nitrate resulted in a remarkable 54% enhancement in PFOA defluorination. A novel mechanism was discovered that nitrate-derived reactive nitrogen species (RNS) activated the decarboxylation–hydroxylation–elimination–hydrolysis (DHEH) process, an important degradation pathway for PFASs in UV/sulfite ARP. Induced by eaq–, the PFAS molecule first became a perfluorinated radical and then was transformed into unstable perfluorinated alcohol by reacting with water. Due to the high reactivity driven by unpaired electrons of RNS, water molecules were destabilized with the H–O bond stretched from 0.98 to 1.04 Å. This effectively enhanced the spontaneity of the reaction between perfluorinated radical and water molecules and consequently made the whole DHEH process more thermodynamic favorable (ΔG, −23.53 → −376.28 kJ/mol). Such a process breaks through the view that the nitrate directly reacts with eaq– to affect PFASs defluorination in ARP systems. This finding offers an innovative perspective for optimizing PFAS defluorination by strategically regulating nitrate levels in water bodies."

The aim of this study was to investigate the emissions of fine particles, coarse particles, and CO2 under realistic driving conditions. Passenger car brake control was reproduced in an indoor experiment using the Los Angeles City Transit (LACT) cycle as the test cycle. The experiments were performed in a laboratory with a brake dynamometer under realistic braking temperature conditions using one front brake of a midsize passenger car. The preliminary results indicated that particle emission factors were higher than CO2 emissions, with a driving distance-based CO2 emission factor per brake axle of 1.7 ± 0.15 mg/km/brake and a particulate matter of 10 μm or less (PM10) emission factor of 10.1 ± 2.3 mg/km/brake. Although CO2 emissions were less than PM10, the results of this study showed that CO2 emissions and nucleation-mode particles (<20 nm in diameter) are formed even at final braking temperatures of 40–90 °C, which are considerably lower than the commonly accepted critical braking temperature.

Quantifying NFW carbon stores and dynamics represents a substantive global carbon‐budget gap. We analyze conterminous‐US (CONUS) field‐based data collected from nearly 2000 wetland sites sampled by the National Wetlands Condition Assessment (NWCA) representing ∼38 Mha CONUS wetlands, asking: What is the mean soil organic carbon density and total carbon storage in different hydrogeomorphically classified wetland types? To what extent does soil organic carbon density and total carbon in NFWs differ from other wetland types? How does NFW soil organic carbon density and total carbon vary between altered and intact NFWs? We find that relative to other wetland types, NFWs are carbon‐storing powerhouses, containing approximately 1.5x soil organic carbon per ha than other wetland types sampled. CONUS‐wide, NFWs store more total carbon across every depth increment: ∼2.0x than other wetland types. Further, wetland condition affects carbon dynamics: least impaired NFWs had 1.6x the soil organic carbon density found in intermediately disturbed wetlands and 1.8x the density of most‐disturbed NFWs. These NWCA data, plus waning societal protections, suggests that carbon releases from NFW destruction across CONUS landscapes are likely to increase—perhaps markedly—in the coming years (e.g., through altered hydrology affecting atmospheric release of NFW‐stored carbon as well as dissolved carbon export)."

These RF models enable projections of renewable energy generation from both existing and newly built power plants under the Representative Concentration Pathways and the Shared Social‐Economic Pathways (RCP‐SSP) scenarios, as well as deployment strategies. Our analysis reveals that renewable energy generation from existing plants is projected to decrease significantly by 6%–8% (57–72 TWh) in 2045–2060 compared to the period 2002–2017. The impact of climate change on renewable energy generation varies spatially, suggesting optimizing the deployment of newly built power plants could mitigate adverse effects. Compared to the strategy maintaining the original deployment, national renewable energy generation can be increased by 24%–28% through optimized deployment tailored to future climate. The optimized deployment can lead to synergistic reductions in carbon emissions by 25%–28% and air pollutants by 42%–97%.

 The subduction of pelagic sediments and altered oceanic crust modulates the global cycle of volatile elements. Sulfate and carbonate fluids released when one plate descends beneath another modify the redox state of the mantle, and generate the return of water and reactive gases to the atmosphere and hydrosphere via arc volcanism, affecting planetary habitability over geologic timescales. However, the timing of the onset of subduction remains uncertain, hindering our understanding of how deep geochemical cycles operated on the early Earth. Here we measure sulfur and neodymium isotope data on Eoarchaean mantle-derived rocks of the Innuksuac Complex in northern Québec, Canada, with petrological characteristics of arc magmas. These rocks exhibit anomalous sulfur isotopic compositions originally produced by photochemical reactions in the atmosphere more than 3.8 Gyr ago. Combined sulfur and neodymium isotope data suggest that these signatures were transferred to the Innuksuac mantle through devolatilization and partial melting of terrigenous sediments derived from a Hadean (4.3–4.4 Gyr ago) continental source, providing a record of an early continental margin subduction environment. This result pushes back direct evidence of a subduction-driven volatile cycle to the onset of the terrestrial rock record, approximately 1 Gyr earlier than previously inferred from diamond inclusions.

 Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling.

We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway.

 Climate change is widely recognized as one of the main threats to biodiversity1 and predicting its consequences is critical to conservation efforts. A wide range of studies have evaluated the effects of future climate using taxon-based metrics3,4, but few studies to date have applied a phylogenetic approach to forecast these impacts. Here, we show that future climate change is expected to significantly modify not only species richness, but also phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism of Neotropical frogs.

Here the authors show that, in experimental models of cell competition, hemocytes are recruited independently of cell death and in fact participate directly in cell killing. 
 In epithelial tissues, juxtaposition of cells of different phenotypes can trigger cell competition, a process whereby one type of cell drives death and extrusion of another. During growth and homeostasis, cell competition is thought to serve a quality control function, eliminating cells that are “less fit”. Tissues may also attack and eliminate newly arising tumor cells, exploiting mechanisms shared with other instances of cell competition, but that differ, reportedly, in the involvement of the immune system. Whereas immune cells have been shown to play a direct role in killing tumor cells, this has not been observed in other cases of cell competition, suggesting that tissues recognize and handle cancer cells differently. Here, we challenge this view, showing that, in the fruit fly Drosophila, innate immune cells play similar roles in cell killing during classical cell competition as in eliminating tumors. These findings suggest that immune suppression of cancer may exploit the same mechanisms as are involved in promoting phenotypic uniformity among epithelial cells.

Here the authors show that, in experimental models of cell competition, hemocytes are recruited independently of cell death and in fact participate directly in cell killing."

Here, the authors introduce a syngas-induced dispersion method to anchor ZnO species onto ZnCr2O4, forming monodispersed ZnOx active sites that enhance catalytic performance in direct syngas conversion to light olefins. 
 ZnCrOx oxides coupled with zeolites (OXZEO) allow direct conversion of syngas into light olefins, while active sites in the composite oxides remain elusive. Herein, we find that ZnO particles physically mixed with ZnCr2O4 spinel particles can be well dispersed onto the spinel surfaces by treatment in syngas and through a reduction-evaporation-anchoring mechanism, forming monodispersed ZnOx species with uniform thickness or dimension on ZnCr2O4 up to a dispersion threshold ZnO loading of 16.0 wt% (ZnCr2O4@ZnOx). A linear correlation between CO conversion and surface ZnO loading clearly confirms that the ZnOx overlayer on ZnCr2O4 acts as the active structure for the syngas conversion, which can efficiently activate both H2 and CO. The obtained ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst combined with SAPO-34 zeolite achieves excellent catalytic performance with 64% CO conversion and 75% light olefins selectivity among all hydrocarbons. Moreover, the ZnOx overlayer is effectively anchored on the ZnCr2O4 spinel, which inhibits Zn loss during the reaction and demonstrates high stability over 100 hours. Thus, a significant interface confinement effect is present between the spinel surface and the ZnOx overlayer, which helps to stabilize ZnOx active structure and enhance the catalytic performance. Identifying active sites on oxide catalysts is often challenging. Here, the authors introduce a syngas-induced dispersion method to anchor ZnO species onto ZnCr2O4, forming monodispersed ZnOx active sites that enhance catalytic performance in direct syngas conversion to light olefins."

Here, the authors use cryo-EM to visualize the transient state where resistance protein FusB mediates rescue by inducing large-scale conformational changes of EF-G. 
 The antibiotic resistance protein FusB rescues protein synthesis from inhibition by fusidic acid (FA), which locks elongation factor G (EF-G) to the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. Here, we present time-resolved single–particle cryo-EM structures explaining the mechanism of FusB-mediated rescue. FusB binds to the FA-trapped EF-G on the ribosome, causing large-scale conformational changes of EF-G that break interactions with the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. This leads to dissociation of EF-G from the ribosome, followed by FA release. We also observe two independent binding sites of FusB on the classical-state ribosome, overlapping with the binding site of EF-G to each of the ribosomal subunits, yet not inhibiting tRNA delivery. The affinity of FusB to the ribosome and the concentration of FusB in S. aureus during FusB-mediated resistance support that direct binding of FusB to ribosomes could occur in the cell. Our results reveal an intricate resistance mechanism involving specific interactions of FusB with both EF-G and the ribosome, and a non-canonical release pathway of EF-G.

This reveals a non-genetic mechanism for floral asymmetry. 
 Many animals and plants show left-right (LR) asymmetry. The LR asymmetry of mirror-image flowers has clear functional significance, with the reciprocal placement of male and female organs in left- versus right-handed flowers promoting cross-pollination. Here, we study how handedness of mirror-image flowers is determined and elaborated during development in the South African geophyte Cyanella alba. Inflorescences of C. alba produce flowers with a largely consistent handedness. However, this handedness has no simple genetic basis and individual plants can switch their predominant handedness between years. Rather, it is the direction of the phyllotactic spiral that predicts floral handedness. Style deflection is driven by increased cell expansion in the adaxial carpel facing the next oldest flower compared to the other adaxial carpel. The more expanding carpel shows transcriptional signatures of increased auxin signaling and auxin application can reverse the orientation of style deflection. We propose that a recently described inherent LR auxin asymmetry in the initiating organs of spiral phyllotaxis determines handedness in C. alba, creating a stable yet non-genetic floral polymorphism. This mechanism links chirality across different levels of plant development and exploits a developmental constraint in a core patterning process to produce morphological variation of ecological relevance. Here it is shown that the handedness of mirror-image flowers in Cyanella alba is not genetically determined but linked to the spiral arrangement of leaves and asymmetric auxin activity.

 Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a versatile three-dimensional (3D) material platform to explore quantum phenomena and functionalities that emerge from an intricate interplay among magnetism, band structure, and electronic correlations. Here, we report the observation of a nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior and collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM) in V1/3NbS2. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements identify a commensurate, collinear AFM order formed by intercalated V moments. In the magnetically ordered state, the spontaneous AHE is tenfold greater than expected from empirical scaling with magnetization, and this strongly enhanced AHE arises in the NFL regime that violates the quasiparticle picture. V1/3NbS2 challenges the existing single-particle framework for understanding AHEs based on one-body Berry curvature and highlights the potential of magnetically intercalated TMDs to unveil new electronic functionalities where many-body correlations play a critical role.

 Spin-valley magnetic ordering is restricted to layered van der Waals type transition-metal dichalcogenides with ordering temperatures below 55 K. Recent theoretical studies on non-van der Waals structures have predicted spin-valley polarization induced semiconducting ferromagnetic ground states, but experimental validation is missing. We report high-Curie temperature (TC ~ 225 K) metallic ferromagnetism with spontaneous spin-valley polarization in monolayer Cr2Se3 on graphene. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals systematic temperature-dependent energy shifts and splitting of localized Cr 3 d↑-t2g bands, accompanied by occupancy of the itinerant Cr 3d-eg valleys. The t2g-eg spin-valley coupling at the K/K’ points of hexagonal Brillouin zone leads to ferromagnetic ordering. Circular dichroism in ARPES shows clear evidence of spin-valley polarized states. Comparison with bilayer and trilayer Cr2Se3 reveals the crucial role of valley carrier density in enhancing TC and provides a guiding principle to realize 2D ferromagnetism at higher temperatures in non-van der Waals materials.

 The current study, leveraging large ensemble high-resolution atmospheric model simulations (d4PDF) with three warming scenarios, uncovers potential shifts in tropical cyclone (TC) tracks within the western North Pacific (WNP) under future warming. Both northward and eastward migrations are detected in projected TC tracks. TC tracks north of 40°N are projected to surge by 25% and 65%, respectively, under the future 2 K and 4 K warming scenarios. Meantime, TC tracks south of 40°N and east of 160°E are projected to increase by 15% and 36%, respectively, under the two warming scenarios. These changes in TC tracks are intimately linked to shifts in TC genesis locations and alterations in large-scale steering flows. Specifically, the increase in TC tracks north of 40°N is attributed to a slowdown of the TC movement due to slow-down of westerly steering flows. The increase in TC tracks east of 160°E is closely associated with the rise in TC genesis east of 160°E due to an anomalous cyclone. Additionally, there is a decrease in projected TC landfalling along the East Asian coast, predominantly attributable to the reduced TC genesis west of 160°E. Our findings emphasize the heightened vulnerability of high-latitude regions in China and Japan to TC hazards under future warming conditions."

 Heatwaves are causing catastrophic consequences on natural and socioeconomic systems yet they remain under-investigated in permafrost regions. Using simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we present a comprehensive assessment of recent and future heatwaves across the permafrost regions of the Northern Hemisphere (PRNH). Our focus is on the characteristics of summer and winter heatwaves as well as their potential implications for infrastructure stability. Results show that the PRNH has experienced increasing heatwaves over the past decades and is projected to face more frequent and intense heatwaves, especially under higher warming levels. Globally, summer heatwaves occur more frequently, whereas winter heatwaves exhibit higher intensity, with distinct regional behaviors. Both summer and winter heatwaves in the Arctic and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) occur more frequently than that in mid-latitude regions. The mid-latitudes present the strongest summer heatwaves, while the Arctic endures the most severe winter heatwaves. Historically, the Arctic and the QTP have been more affected by winter heatwaves due to their longer heatwave days and stronger intensity compared to summer heatwaves. Under warming scenarios, the Arctic is projected to continue facing greater winter heatwave pressure on account of the quick-enhancing intensity. Conversely, the QTP will be more affected by summer heatwaves due to their longer and rapidly growing heatwave days. Further analyses indicate that permafrost regions with high geohazard potential (GP) will come under greater summer heatwave stress, particularly in the Arctic and QTP, associated with longer heatwave days. The high-GP regions in Eurasia, however, are expected to bear more severe winter heatwaves driven by higher intensity. These findings deepen our understandings of heatwaves in PRNH and highlights the potential impacts of heatwaves on geohazards in permafrost regions."

 Evidence has emerged that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) may be predictable on decadal timescales, which may greatly benefit society given the significant climate impacts that accompany the NAO. However, the mechanisms behind the apparent decadal predictability of the NAO, including the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions, have not yet been pinned down. In this study, the decadal prediction skill for the NAO and the interactions with the underlying ocean are assessed in retrospective forecasts spanning 1960–2020 using eight different decadal prediction systems (DPSs) and observation-based data. We find considerable spread in NAO skill across the DPSs and critically, that this is linked to differences in the representation of ocean-NAO interactions between the systems. Evidence is shown that NAO skill is related to positive feedback between subpolar SSTs and the NAO, which varies in strength between DPSs yet may still be too weak even in the most skillful systems compared to an observational estimate. We also report evidence that the positive feedback is opposed by a delayed negative feedback between the NAO and the ocean circulation, which is used to further explain the disparities in NAO skill across systems. Our findings, therefore, suggest that North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere interactions are central to NAO decadal predictability."

 Triple junctions, where three tectonic plates meet, play a critical role in geodynamics. The Azores Triple Junction is critical in the study of triple junctions, challenging traditional models of triple junction stability.

Our state-of-the-art 3-D thermo-mechanical simulations reveal critical similarities between model and nature in terms of timing, transient grabens distribution, rift and triple junction jump, diffuse plate boundary, depth of the main rift, and rift shoulder uplift, and indicate that the Azores Triple Junction became unstable because of the sigmoidal shape of the precursor Azores-Gibraltar fault zone and how Nubia has moved relative to Eurasia in the last 3 millions of years. A northward jump of the rift transferred the Azores block from Eurasia to Nubia, without forming a distinct Azores microplate.

 Ocean remote sensing data is crucial in understanding the global climate system. Due to satellite orbital coverage gaps and cloud cover, satellite ocean remote sensing products have significant data gaps. This paper introduces a Generalized Data Completion Model (GDCM) based on deep learning to reconstruct gap-free and cloud-free key oceanic variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, water vapor, cloud liquid water, and precipitation rate derived from polar-orbiting satellite sensors including Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms, the GDCM model effectively leverages spatio-temporal information within remote sensing data to fill in missing regions accurately. We use reanalysis data to simulate various data missing scenarios during model training for model development. We tested the model with the US East Coast region's global-coverage AMSR2/SSMI and local-coverage MODIS datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the GDCM model successfully and precisely completes the data for different satellites and types of missing data. To enable the model to capture enough data for the dynamical change patterns, we used seven consecutive days of observation data as inputs to improve the model's data-completion ability, significantly enhancing the handling of MODIS SST missing data due to cloud cover. When the input data's duration increased from one day to seven days, the model's R2 value improved from 0.062 to 0.93, and the Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) decreased from 6.58 to 0.92. Besides the model framework design, we implemented the incremental learning training strategy to enhance the model's data completion capability for different types of missing data, especially for SST data from AMSR2 satellites. The model's completed SST data R2 value improved from 0.93 to 0.99, and the RMSD decreased from 2.64 °C to 0.50 °C. The Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) of water vapor data decreased from 0.88 kg/m2 to 0.76 kg/m2, and the RMSD decreased from 1.39 kg/m2 to 1.27 kg/m2.

This research seeks to overcome the challenges of fusing POI data with remote sensing imagery and improve subpixel ISA estimation. To form an integrated sample dataset for subpixel ISA estimation, POI data were processed using kernel density analysis and transformed into continuous raster layers compatible with remote sensing imageries. The proposed method was tested in two study areas with distinctly different urban land patterns: Shenzhen, China, and Chicago, USA. Two widely used machine learning models, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were developed based on the integrated sample dataset.

In this study, we conditionally ablated the classical progesterone receptor (Pgr) in oviductal epithelial cells, called thePgrd/dmouse model. We found that 40% of embryos collected fromPgrd/dfemales were nonviable or developmentally delayed, indicating that epithelial PGR expression is crucial for embryonic development. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed up-regulation of proinflammatory genes, including interleukin-22 (IL-22), in the epithelial cells ofPgrd/dfemales. Pharmacological inhibition of inflammation using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs significantly reduced IL-22 levels in the oviducts and rescued embryonic developmental rates inPgrd/dfemales. Coculture of wild-type zygotes with IL-22 significantly decreased the number of expanded blastocysts.

In most eukaryotes, mitochondria harbor their own genome, and all steps of mitochondrial gene expression co-occur within a single compartment—the matrix. Here, we report that processed mitochondrial RNAs are consolidated into micrometer-scale translation hubs distal to mitochondrial DNA transcription and RNA processing sites in human cells. We find that, during stress, mitochondrial messenger and ribosomal RNA are sequestered in mesoscale bodies containing mitoribosome components, concurrent with suppression of active translation. Stress bodies are triggered by proteotoxic stress downstream of double-stranded RNA accumulation in cells lacking unwinding activity of the highly conserved helicase SUPV3L1/SUV3. We propose that the spatial organization of nascent polypeptide synthesis into discrete domains serves to throttle the flow of genetic information to support recovery of mitochondrial quality control."

However, the mechanisms behind ABC generation and maintenance remain poorly understood. We show that continuous B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for ABC development from anergic B cells in aged and autoimmune mice. ABCs exhibit constitutive BCR activation, with surface BCRs being internalized. Notably, anergic B cells, but not nonautoreactive B cells, contributed to ABC formation in these models. Anergic B cells also showed a greater propensity for in vitro differentiation into ABCs, which was inhibited by the expression of the transcription factor Nr4a1. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), a key BCR signaling component, was constitutively activated in ABCs from aged and autoimmune mice as well as patients with lupus. Inhibiting Btk reduced ABC numbers and ameliorated the pathogenicity of lupus mice.

Metabolomic analyses of synchronized cells revealed that DHAP levels change more than any other metabolite between dark- and light-grown cells and that the addition of the DHAP precursor, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), was sufficient to activate TOR in the dark. We also demonstrated that TOR was insensitive to light or inorganic carbon but not to exogenous DHA in aChlamydomonasmutant defective in the export of DHAP from the chloroplast. Our results provide a metabolic basis for the mode of TOR control by light and inorganic carbon and indicate that cytoplasmic DHAP is an important metabolic regulator of TOR."

Patients with mtRC dysfunction often present reduced skeletal growth as a sign of premature cartilage degeneration and aging, but how metabolic adaptations contribute to this phenotype is poorly understood. Here we show that, in mice with impaired mtRC in cartilage, reductive/reverse TCA cycle segments are activated to produce metabolite-derived amino acids and stimulate biosynthesis processes by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation during a period of massive skeletal growth and biomass production. However, chronic hyperactivation of mTORC1 suppresses autophagy-mediated organelle recycling and disturbs extracellular matrix secretion to trigger chondrocytes death, which is ameliorated by targeting the reductive metabolism. These findings explain how a primarily beneficial metabolic adaptation response required to counterbalance the loss of mtRC function, eventually translates into profound cell death and cartilage tissue degeneration. The knowledge of these dysregulated key nutrient signaling pathways can be used to target skeletal aging in mitochondrial disease."

We show that the Sindbis virus (SINV) opal codon outperforms other stop codons in primate cells at 37°C due to optimal translational readthrough. However, increased readthrough of all stop codons reduces opal preference at 28°C in primate and mosquito cells. Opal also outperforms all sense codons because opal-to-sense substitutions lead to excess polyprotein production at 37°C, disrupting orderly polyprotein processing and production of viral genomic RNAs (gRNAs) required for virus production. Increased readthrough at 28°C dampens the fitness advantages of opal codons. Unexpectedly, we find that a naturally occurring SINV mutation restores sense-codon fitness by further delaying polyprotein processing, allowing adequate time to produce gRNAs. Similar temperature-dependent mechanisms occur in the distantly related dual-host alphavirus, Ross River virus. Our work highlights sophisticated strategies dual-host alphaviruses use to optimize replication in divergent temperatures through a single codon."

In rodents, degradation of the hippocampal perineuronal net (PNN) replicates this overactivity, but uncertainty over rodent/human prefrontal homology limits translation to humans. Here, we test the hypothesis that aHipp PNN degradation in a species with a human-like prefrontal cortex, the marmoset, alters aHipp-striatal and aHipp-OFC circuitry. Microdialysis and [18F]-fluoro-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography identified increased dopamine synthesis in the associative striatum, but not the nucleus accumbens, as is seen in schizophrenia, and elevated dopamine and noradrenaline in the OFC. Behaviorally, activity was elevated in a marmoset version of the amphetamine-induced activity test, and impaired probabilistic discrimination learning was seen in an OFC/striatum-dependent task that computational modeling suggests was due to loss of goal-directed behavior. Together, these findings demonstrate that a loss of primate aHipp PNNs is sufficient to induce striatal and prefrontal dysfunction consistent with that observed in humans with schizophrenia."

Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers many applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a mechanism for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically nontrivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this leads to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking reciprocity. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect."

Here, geometry-inspired strategies along with programmable DNA interactions are combined to achieve structural control of colloidal cocrystal assemblies. Coassembling polyhedral and spherical NPs with complementary DNA yields two classes of cocrystals: one where both components order, and another where polyhedral NPs form a periodic lattice, while spherical NPs remain disordered but spatially correlated with polyhedral edges and corners. The size ratio of the building blocks can be used to control the ordering of spherical NPs—smaller octahedral-to-sphere size ratios favor fully ordered cocrystals. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidate the role of NP shapes and dimensions in the structural outcome of the cocrystal.

But which enzyme in this pathway is better to serve as an antitumor target remains unclear. Here, we revealed that targeting GFAT1, the rate-limiting enzyme in hexosamine synthesis, exhibits limited inhibitory effects on glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal brain tumor. This outcome is due to the compensation of NAGK-mediated hexosamine salvage pathway. Unexpectedly, inhibiting PGM3, which controls the flux of both de novo hexosamine synthesis and salvage pathways, down-regulates the expression of other enzymes in this pathway and suppresses SREBP-1, a critical lipogenic transcription factor, effectively inhibiting GBM growth. Unexpectedly, SREBP-1 transcriptionally up-regulates the expression of hexosamine synthesis enzymes, while inhibition of these enzymes in turn down-regulates SREBP-1 activation via reducing N-glycosylation of its transporter, SCAP. Our study identified PGM3 as a promising target for treating GBM. Its inhibition disrupts the SREBP-1 activation-hexosamine synthesis positive feedback regulation to effectively eliminate GBM cells."

We used engineered isoprene-emitting (IE) and non-emitting (NE) control tobacco plants to interpret isoprene-mediated defense against herbivory in plants. Hornworm larvae raised on IE plants exhibited stunted growth compared to those raised on NE plants. Worms preferred to feed on NE rather than IE leaves, indicating deterrent effects of isoprene on insect feeding. Worm feeding induced a greater increase in jasmonic acid (JA), a crucial hormone for insect resistance, in IE leaves compared to that in NE leaves. Assimilation rates were stably maintained in IE plants, suggesting a protective role of isoprene in preserving photosynthetic efficiency during insect herbivory. Wound-induced increase in isoprene emission correlated with the elevation of key metabolites of the isoprene biosynthesis pathway.

Here, we report that pyrite, a widespread and highly stable iron sulfide mineral in anoxic, low-temperature environments, can support the growth and metabolic activity of anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria by serving as the sole iron source under iron-depleted conditions. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that pyrite addition substantially up-regulated genes and protein expression involved in photosynthesis, sulfur metabolism, and biosynthesis of organics. Anoxic microbial oxidation of pyritic sulfur and consequent destabilization of the pyrite structure were postulated to facilitate microbial iron acquisition. These findings advance our understanding of the survival strategies of anaerobes in iron-depleted environments and are important for revealing the previously underappreciated bioavailability of pyritic iron in anoxic environments and anoxic weathering of pyrite."

By comparing these three elements—drivers, uncertainty, and sensitivity—across four distinct tropical cyclone models, we derive findings generalizable beyond individual model setups. We find that average tropical cyclone risk will increase 1 to 5% by 2050 globally, with maximum increases ranging from 10 to 400% by 2100, depending on tropical cyclone model choice, region, and risk model inputs, while the dominant source of uncertainty shifts with modeling choices.

In this study, we identified that OV6+tumor cells exhibit stem-like characteristics and are notably enriched in patients with non–major pathological response, closely associated with resistance to combination therapies. Hypoxia and HIF1α were found to drive the formation of OV6+CSCs. METTL3, a methyltransferase, was revealed as a critical regulator of OV6+CSCs by stabilizing NFE2L3 messenger RNA via anN6-methyladenosine–dependent manner, thereby up-regulating NFE2L3 and activating the intrinsic WNT signaling pathway essential for maintaining stemness. OV6+tumor cells promoted M2 macrophage infiltration and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

Theoretically, novel colors are possible through bypassing the constraints set by the cone spectral sensitivities and activating M cone cells exclusively. In practice, we confirm a partial expansion of colorspace toward that theoretical ideal. Attempting to activate M cones exclusively is shown to elicit a color beyond the natural human gamut, formally measured with color matching by human subjects. They describe the color as blue-green of unprecedented saturation. Further experiments show that subjects perceive Oz colors in image and video form. The prototype targets laser microdoses to thousands of spectrally classified cones under fixational eye motion. These results are proof-of-principle for programmable control over individual photoreceptors at population scale."

This study explores the evolution of surface functionalities of novel polyesters Poly(Butylene Xylose) (PBX) and Poly(Alkyl Xylose Amide) (PAXA) under artificial degradation conditions. Employing a Knudsen Flow Reactor (KFR) and a gas-titration approach, we systematically analyze the chemical transformations occurring at the polymer’s solid–gas interface. Both polymers are derived from the same functionalized lignocellulosic sugar building block, Diglyoxylic Acid Xylose (DGAX). Virgin (V), long-term UV (UV), and short-term Ozone (O3) exposures induce specific but differing alterations in molecular integrity and surface reactivity, resulting in notable shifts in material properties and polymer structure. Contrary to the assumption that degradation increases specific surface area (SSA) and reactivity, our results reveal cases where the SSA decreases, with reactivity either increasing or decreasing based on the reactive groups available at the interface. Both polymers exhibited increased water affinity, acidification, and ozone reactivity following UV exposure. Interfacial reactivity, assessed with trifluoroacetic acid, hydroxylamine, and nitrogen dioxide, increased for PBXUV but decreased for PAXAUV. Surface hydroxyl groups in PAXA reduced 5-fold under short-term ozone and long-term UV exposure, while bulk transport kinetics of hydroxylamine altered with long-term degradation, though ozone exposure left transport mechanisms unaffected. This combined interfacial and bulk analysis approach advances our understanding of (bio)plastic degradation. It examines the role of degraded polymers as potentially more or less reactive vectors for chemicals and organisms upon environmental release while also demonstrating that polymer degradation initiates significantly earlier than previously assumed."

As magma approaches the surface it is highly likely it will have a non‐Newtonian shear‐thinning rheology (apparent viscosity decreases as shear rate increases), yet most dike models assume magma is a simple Newtonian fluid. Here we use laser light and particle image velocimetry to image flow within a scaled experimental dike hosting a shear‐thinning fluid. The results show that the internal flow dynamics of shear‐thinning magma in dikes are very different to Newtonian dikes. The velocity of shear‐thinning flow radiates out toward the dike margin at similar magnitude across the dike plane; this is very different to the jet flow and recirculation characteristic of the Newtonian dike model at the same conditions. A linear relationship between tip velocity and inlet Reynolds number Rein ${\text{Re}}_{\text{in}}$ in the viscous regime (Rein≲0.4 ${\text{Re}}_{\text{in}}\mathit{\lesssim }0.4$) is confirmed to also apply to shear‐thinning fluids, and transitional flow (0.4≲Rein≲100 $0.4\mathit{\lesssim }{\text{Re}}_{\text{in}}\mathit{\lesssim }100$) is generated experimentally for the first time. These findings suggest that magma rheology (Newtonian or shear‐thinning) cannot be recognized from external factors, such as the dike tip velocity.

We explored combining finely ground metabasaltic rock with other soil CDR technologies (compost and biochar amendments) to stimulate carbon (C) sequestration. The combined ground rock (GR), compost, and biochar amendment had the greatest increases in soil C stocks over 3 years (15.3 ± 4.8 Mg C ha−1). All other treatments slowed or reversed background C losses, with GR‐only treatments reducing rates of soil C loss relative to the control but still losing soil C over time.

With a backward Lagrangian particle‐tracking experiment in a data‐assimilative model of the Southern Ocean (B‐SOSE), we address the long‐standing question of the extent to which SAMWs originate from densification of southward‐flowing subtropical waters versus lightening of northward‐flowing Antarctic waters sourced by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) upwelling. Our analysis evidences the co‐occurrence of both sources in all SAMW formation areas, and strong inter‐basin contrasts in their relative contributions. Subtropical waters are the main precursor of Indian Ocean SAMWs (70%–75% of particles) but contribute a smaller amount (< ${< } $40% of particles) to Pacific SAMWs, which are mainly sourced from the upwelled CDW. By tracking property changes along particle trajectories, we show that SAMW formation from northern and southern sources involves contrasting drivers: subtropical source waters are cooled and densified by surface heat fluxes, and freshened by ocean mixing. Southern source waters are warmed and lightened by surface heat and freshwater fluxes, and they are made either saltier by mixing in the case of Indian SAMWs, or fresher by surface fluxes in the case of Pacific SAMWs. Our results underscore the distinct climatic impact of Indian and Pacific SAMWs formation, involving net release of atmospheric heat and uptake of atmospheric freshwater, respectively; a role that is conferred by the relative contributions of subtropical and Antarctic sources to their formation."

Such distinctive features of the tropical waves before and after SCSSM onset are attributable to the adjustments in atmospheric mean flow.

However, these asymmetric structures are often not well represented in the initialization of most operational forecasting models. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial vortex inner‐core asymmetries on TC intensification by conducting a series of idealized numerical experiments. We find that initial wavenumber‐1 asymmetries, which are closely linked to the vertical tilt of TC vortices, play a critical role in determining the timing of intensification onset. Specifically, TC intensification occurs only when the wavenumber‐1 asymmetries reach a specific configuration relative to the axisymmetric circulation. When the initial vortex lacks or inaccurately represents wavenumber‐1 asymmetries, additional time is required for adjustment of the vertical structure of TC vortices. This study suggests that better representation of wavenumber‐1 asymmetry in the initial structure of TC vortices could help improve TC intensity forecasts in numerical models."

These data are interpreted to record periods when interior meltwaters are exported to the ice sheet margins as a result of ice acceleration and thinning. An assessment of coincidence between 234U‐230Th dates, ranging from 16 to 256 ka, and peaks in Southern Ocean temperature yields a statistically significant correlation. Additional comparison of precipitate dates and climate data finds that calcite formation and ice acceleration cluster within periods of enhanced millennial scale climate variability as well as high global ice volume.

 Adult zebrafish robustly regenerate injured hearts through a complex orchestration of molecular and cellular activities. However, this remarkable process, which is largely non-existent in humans, remains incompletely understood. Here, we utilize integrated spatial transcriptomics (Stereo-seq) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a spatially-resolved molecular and cellular atlas of regenerating zebrafish heart across eight stages.

Moreover, we uncover the activation of ifrd1 and atp6ap2 genes as a unique feature of regenerative hearts.

Here authors show in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa murine infection model that an alginate-itaconate metabolic interplay, creating metabolic synchrony between the host and the pathogen plays a role in mitigating harmful inflammation. 
 Disease tolerance mitigates organ damage from non-resolving inflammation during persistent infections, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show, in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia mouse model, that disease tolerance depends on the mitochondrial metabolite itaconate, which mediates cooperative host-pathogen interactions. In P. aeruginosa, itaconate modifies key cysteine residues in TCA cycle enzymes critical for succinate metabolism, inducing bioenergetic stress and promoting the formation biofilms that are less immunostimulatory and allow the bacteria to integrate into the local microbiome. Itaconate incorporates into the central metabolism of the biofilm, driving exopolysaccharide production—particularly alginate—which amplifies airway itaconate signaling. This itaconate-alginate interplay limits host immunopathology by enabling pulmonary glutamine assimilation, activating glutaminolysis, and thereby restrain detrimental inflammation caused by the inflammasome. Clinical sample analysis reveals that P. aeruginosa adapts to this metabolic environment through compensatory mutations in the anti-sigma-factor mucA, which restore the succinate-driven bioenergetics and disrupt the metabolic synchrony essential for sustaining disease tolerance.

 Climate-driven warming affects the reproduction of oviparous ectotherms. However, whether oviparous ectotherms possess a protection mechanism against heat stress for oocyte development, which is essential for maintaining the continuity of animal populations, is largely unknown. Under high temperatures, female mud crabs (Scylla paramamosain) typically have well-formed ovaries, while a few crabs were found to experience oocyte development failure. To investigate the heat stress protection mechanism of oocyte development in mud crabs, we construct a chromosome-level genome of this species and identify an enhancer of the vitellogenin receptor (VtgR) that stimulates its expression under high temperatures. Lacking this enhancer due to an intronic deletion leads to low VtgR expression in abnormal crabs, resulting in abnormal vitellogenic oocyte formation in these individuals when exposed to high temperatures. Furthermore, we identify a similar heat stress protection mechanism in zebrafish. Disruption of Lrp13, a VtgR-like protein in zebrafish, results in impaired vitellogenin absorption and ovarian degeneration in zebrafish exposed to high temperatures.

 The polar regions are biologically productive and play a critical role in regional and global biogeochemical cycling. A key nutrient is dissolved silicon, required for the growth of siliceous phytoplankton, diatoms, which form an important component of polar ecosystems. Glacial weathering is thought to be an important dissolved silicon source to coastal waters, especially critical in regions experiencing seasonal silicon limitation of diatom growth. However, complex physical and biogeochemical interactions in fjords and coastal regions modulate the downstream supply of dissolved and particulate nutrients, including silicon. Here, we review the biogeochemical complexities of glaciated margins and the insights into this system that silicon isotope geochemistry offer. We show that stable and radioisotopic measurements and biogeochemical numerical modelling provide a quantitative mechanistic understanding of subglacial silica mobilisation and its cycling across the land-ocean continuum. Subglacial weathering produces isotopically light amorphous silica, which dissolves in seawater to release dissolved silicon. Our findings show that isotopically light, detrital silica, likely containing glacial material, reaches the ocean and there could support a substantial proportion of diatom productivity, especially in the Arctic. Outstanding questions about silicon cycling in these crucial environments will be addressed through novel and cross-discipline approaches that overcome traditionally viewed ecosystem boundaries.

 Moisture plays a key role in the energetics of hurricanes. Using a convolutional autoencoder, a state-of-the-art deep learning approach to spatial pattern classification, with k-means we identified four representative clusters of total column water vapor (TCWV) patterns around North Atlantic hurricanes. These four clusters exhibit distinct spatial distributions of TCWV in terms of amount, symmetry, and areal extent. Cluster 1 has a compact, symmetric, and moderate moisture pattern which we refer to as medium moisture symmetrical. Cluster 2 is high moisture symmetrical as these hurricanes have an abundance of moisture with a widespread and symmetric pattern. Cluster 3 is low moisture asymmetrical as it represents the driest conditions especially in the northwest. Cluster 4 has high moisture near the center but exhibits a pattern with the strongest contrast between dryness in the northwest and wetness in the southeast, thus we label it high moisture asymmetrical. Each cluster has distinct geographical and temporal distributions, indicating differences in dynamic and thermodynamic environmental conditions associated with each cluster's moisture pattern. Additionally, hurricane intensity, size, and precipitation features vary among the four clusters, characteristics which are closely associated with the moisture and environmental conditions of each cluster.

This implies that melt aggregation during migration through the upper mantle and lower crust is inefficient, even at magmatically productive spreading ridges; efficient melt mixing likely occurs in the overlying axial melt lens. Local isotopic heterogeneity of Hess Deep gabbros indicates incomplete mixing of primary melts produced from variably depleted peridotites and oceanic crust recycled at least 1.5 billion years ago.

Here, we show the density of initially responding naïve CD4+T cells is instructive in T follicular helper (TFH) cell fate decisions and declines with age. A lower number of initially responding cells did not affect TFH differentiation at peak responses after immunization but accounted for an increased contraction phase manifesting as a larger loss of CXCR5 expression. Mechanistically, cells activated at a lower initial density had more sustained mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activities that impair CXCR5 maintenance. YAP-dependent regulation of SLC7A5 involved in the cell density–dependent regulation of mTORC1 activities and TFH loss. Old mice fed with a leucine-restricted diet after peak responses showed smaller TFH loss and improved humoral immune responses.

Results showed that these variations were controlled by the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) seasonality. Compared to El Niño winters, the ISPNA exhibits a stronger early‐to‐late winter enhancement during La Niña winters. Furthermore, the MJO and the ISPNA exhibit a phase‐locked relationship, which is more pronounced and reliable in late winter. The Rossby wave activity associated with the MJO that propagates northward from the tropics toward the subtropical action center of the ISPNA indicates that increased MJO activity contributes to greater ISPNA intensity.

Recently the inclusion of anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor into similarity theory of near‐surface turbulence has been proposed. Anisotropy is quantified through the eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor, which can be visualized by geometric shapes. We conduct a systematic investigation of velocity variances and covariances conditional to this geometric shape with the purpose of identifying common patterns. We discuss the influence of eigenvectors' directions on turbulent transport in relation to the streamline coordinates defined along the mean wind vector. Eigenvectors' direction identifies the orientation of anisotropic shapes, and this geometric approach is meant to investigate if physical constraints on orientation exist, as these could inform turbulence parameterizations. Two data sets are used for the analyses, one from a relatively flat terrain and one from a glacier site. Results show that it is not possible to identify a unique orientation for each anisotropy. Geometric shapes span a broad range of inclinations in the vertical, not strongly constrained by height or atmospheric stability. However, anisotropic turbulence is shown to have shallower inclination than isotropic turbulence. One‐component states, ubiquitous under stable stratification, are well described by the orientation of the dominant eigenvector in the horizontal, characterized by large horizontal covariance, or large variance which aligns anisotropy in the streamwise/spanwise direction. Results highlight that the geometric orientation of turbulence may depend on the site and future investigations will include geometric parameters characterizing the orography in the analyses."

A Perspective From Social Media,"Global climate change has led to frequent and widespread flood disasters in China. Traditional flood disaster investigations mainly focus on major flood events, and small‐scale flood events are often overlooked. This study utilized the Sina Weibo social media platform to detect flood events in 370 cities in China from 2012 to 2023. We downloaded 73.52 million Weibo posts and developed a two‐step flood detection algorithm. In the first step, the algorithm initially identifies 956 flood events based on changes in posting frequency. In the second step, an LDA topic model is used to detect topics for these flood events and automatically filter out false events, resulting in 729 flood events. Verification of these events confirmed that 629 of the 729 were real flood events, achieving a detection accuracy of 86.28%. In the end, after excluding all false flood events and reinstating the mistakenly removed real ones, we obtained a total of 674 verified flood events. Among these 370 cities, 194 cities experienced flood disasters, accounting for 52.43% of the total. Additionally, we compared our findings with online news reports, as well as the flood data sets from the GDACS and EM‐DAT. We found that our study had a high detection rate for urban waterlogging events. However, there were cases of missed detection for flash floods and small watershed flood disasters. Nevertheless, this study represents the most comprehensive publicly available detection of flood events in China to date, which is of great significance for the government's flood management and decision‐making."

 Bacterial chromosomes are spatiotemporally organized and sensitive to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying chromosome configuration and reorganization are not fully understood. Here, we use single-molecule localization microscopy and live-cell imaging to show that the Escherichia coli nucleoid adopts a condensed, membrane-proximal configuration during rapid growth. Drug treatment induces a rapid collapse of the nucleoid from an apparently membrane-bound state within 10 min of halting transcription and translation. This hints toward an active role of transertion (coupled transcription, translation, and membrane insertion) in nucleoid organization, while cell wall synthesis inhibitors only affect nucleoid organization during morphological changes. Further, we provide evidence that the nucleoid spatially correlates with elongasomes in unperturbed cells, suggesting that large membrane-bound complexes might be hotspots for transertion. The observed correlation diminishes in cells with changed cell geometry or upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Replication inhibition experiments, as well as multi-drug treatments highlight the role of entropic effects and transcription in nucleoid condensation and positioning. Thus, our results indicate that transcription and translation, possibly in the context of transertion, act as a principal organizer of the bacterial nucleoid, and show that an altered metabolic state and antibiotic treatment lead to major changes in the spatial organization of the nucleoid.

 People routinely choose between options varying on multiple attributes – homes to rent, movies to watch, and so on. Here, we test how much awareness people have of the mental processes underlying these choices. We develop a method to quantify awareness of value-based multi-attribute choice processes that accounts for diverse choice strategies. Across five studies, participants make choices and then report how they believe they made them. We use computational modeling to identify the process revealed in their choices, and compare it to their self-reports to quantify individuals’ accuracy about their choice process. While we observe substantial variation in accuracy, participants are often highly accurate about their choice process – more accurate than predicted by a sample of decision scientists – and more accurate than informed third-party observers, suggesting evidence for introspection.

 Advances in Artificial Intelligence envision a promising future, where the personalized Internet of Things can be revolutionized with the ability to continuously improve system efficiency and service quality. However, with the introduction of laws and regulations about data security and privacy protection, centralized solutions, which require data to be collected and processed directly on a central server, become impractical for personalized Internet of Things to train Artificial Intelligence models for a variety of domain-specific scenarios. Motivated by this, this paper introduces Cedar, a secure, cost-efficient and domain-adaptive framework to train personalized models in a crowdsourcing-based and privacy-preserving manner. In essentials, Cedar integrates federated learning and meta-learning to enable a safeguarded knowledge transfer within personalized Internet of Things for models with high generalizability that can be rapidly adapted by individuals. Through evaluation using standard datasets from various domains, Cedar is seen to achieve significant improvements in saving, elevating, accelerating and enhancing the learning cost, efficiency, speed, and security, respectively.

 Breast and cervical cancers are important causes of disability and premature death among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Previous research has linked girls’ education to cancer service access. Here, we examine the causal effect of girls’ educational attainment on cancer screening practices by means of a natural experiment in Lesotho. In particular, we exploit variation in educational attainment among women that was introduced by an educational policy (a school-entry age cut-off).

Each additional year of schooling caused by the education policy increases awareness of breast cancer by 4.7 percentage points (p = 0.014, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.0, 8.5), awareness of Pap smear by 5.9 percentage points (p = 0.001, 95% CI: 2.3, 9.5), and engagement in Pap smear by 3.5 percentage points (p = 0.004, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.8).

 Calorie restriction (CR) provides anti-aging benefits through diverse processes, such as reduced metabolism and growth and increased mitochondrial activity. Although controversy still exists regarding CR-mediated lifespan effects, many researchers are seeking interventions that mimic the effects of CR. Yeast has proven to be a useful model system for aging studies, including CR effects. We report here that yeast adapted through in vitro evolution to the severe cellular stress caused by loss of the Ulp2 SUMO-specific protease exhibit both enhanced growth rates and replicative lifespan, and they have altered gene expression profiles similar to those observed in CR. Notably, in certain evolved ulp2Δ lines, an increase in the auto-sumoylation of Ubc9 E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme results in altered regulation of multiple targets involved in energy metabolism and translation at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. This increase is essential for the survival of aged cells and CR-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, we suggest that high Ubc9 auto-sumoylation exerts potent anti-aging effects by promoting efficient energy metabolism-driven improvements in cell replication abilities.

 This study introduces a flood index-enhanced deep learning model for coastal inundation mapping leveraging dual-polarization and bitemporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The proposed model, FIE-Net, introduces two key innovations to improve flood mapping accuracy. First, it integrates the Ratio Image (RI), a primary flood index derived from bitemporal SAR data, which provides a reliable reference for precise inundation area delineation. The index offers a clear, flood-specific signal that enhances segmentation precision. Second, the model employs a dual-branch U-Net framework, augmented with specialized modules to enhance feature extraction and better integrate diverse data sources. This combination enables the model to handle complex flood scenarios more effectively, thereby boosting overall performance. Using data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, 16 pairs of representative SAR images from Madagascar’s Tropical Cyclones 2018 AVA and 2023 Cheneso were collected under various terrain conditions. After semi-automatic labeling and cropping, 4350 sample pairs were processed, with 2784/696/870 used for model training/validation/testing. The proposed model achieved the highest Intersection over Union (IOU) of 79.44%, outperforming the state-of-the-art models across all evaluation metrics.

 Heatwaves are becoming more intense, frequent, and prolonged due to global warming, posing significant risks to ecosystems and human societies. Despite their profound impact, detailed regional assessments of extreme heat events remain limited, particularly in India. This study addresses the gap by systematically investigating the 2024 extreme heat event in India. We evaluated the performance of various land surface schemes in simulating heat extremes using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and also assessed the accuracy of Global Forecast System (GFS) forecasts. Our analysis reveals a strong co-occurrence of drought and heat stress during the extreme heat event. This combination results in increased fire risk and negative impacts on vegetation productivity in regions affected by both drought and heat stress highlighting the severe consequences of this compound event. We compare different land surface models (RUC, Noah, Noah-MP, Noah-MP with dynamic vegetation, CLM) against India Meteorological Department (IMD) observations. We observe that Noah is optimal for reducing bias and RMSE, while Noah-MP with dynamic vegetation is most accurate for simulating extreme heat, with the highest hit rate and threat score for the 90th percentile threshold.

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and snowfall over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are key factors influencing interannual climate variability, and the relationship between ENSO and TP snowfall exhibits interdecadal variability. However, the types of El Niño events have undergone changes around 2000s, and it remains unclear whether these changes in El Niño event types influence the relationship with snowfall. In this study, we examine the relationship between El Niño events and winter snowfall over the TP using HadISST, and ERA5 reanalysis datasets as well as numerical experiments. Our results show the eastern Pacific El Niño (EPE) events are typically linked to positive winter snowfall anomalies over the TP, while the mixed-type El Niño (MPE) events are associated with negative anomalies, whereas the response of winter snowfall during the central Pacific El Niño (CPE) events exhibits considerable uncertainty. EPE events are associated with an anomalous deepening of the East Asian winter trough, while MPE events typically induce an anomalous atmospheric circulation wave pattern from the North Pacific to the TP, thereby altering the winter temperature structure and winter snowfall over the TP. This study highlights the impact of EPE and MPE events on TP snowfall and provides insights into the underlying atmospheric processes, offering a foundation for future research on their broader climatic implications."

Culture experiments have revealed that anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) can produce BC, but their impact on the marine BC cycle has not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined the geochemical properties of BC preserved in seep carbonates from the South China Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. δ13CBC values as low as −45.2‰ were observed in seep carbonates, representing the first documented case of ANME-derived BC in natural settings. With the observed range of BC isotope compositions and further calculations with a Bayesian mixing model, microbially produced BC may account for 2–33% of the total BC enclosed in the studied seep carbonates. By integrating data from various empirical studies, the analyses of radiocarbon (Δ14C) compositions suggests that BC in the deep sea is generally older than the associated organic carbon. Given that the organic carbon found at seeps is typically older than the organic carbon in the surrounding sediment not affected by seepage, BC originating from seeps could serve as a plausible source of aged dissolved BC in the deep sea."

While liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) nontargeted analysis (NTA) has emerged as an essential tool for the comprehensive study of such samples, the identification of individual constituents remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the vast number of detected features in each sample. To address this, prioritization strategies are frequently employed to narrow the focus to the most relevant features for further analysis. In this study, we developed a novel prioritization strategy that directly links fragmentation and chromatographic data to aquatic toxicity categories, bypassing the need for identification of individual compounds. Given that features are not always well-characterized through fragmentation, we created two models: (1) a Random Forest Classification (RFC) model, which classifies fish toxicity categories based on MS1, retention, and fragmentation data─expressed as cumulative neutral losses (CNLs)─when fragmentation information is available, and (2) a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) model that relies solely on retention time and MS1 data when fragmentation is absent. Both models demonstrated accuracy comparable to that of structure-based prediction methods. We further tested the models on a pesticide mixture in a tea extract measured by LC-HRMS, where the CNL-based RFC model achieved 0.76 accuracy and the KDE model reached 0.61, showcasing their robust performance in real-world applications."

Here, we present the first evidence of a direct link between the local coordination environments of Ni and Zn and the redox properties of their host phase goethite (α-FeOOH), the most abundant Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide at Earth’s surface. We used aqueous redox measurements to show that the redox potential EH0, and hence the mineral’s stability, follows the order: pure goethite ≥ Zn-goethite > Ni-goethite. Parallel X-ray absorption and scattering measurements demonstrate, using quantum-informed analysis, that the local coordination environment of the smaller impurity, Ni, causes more bulk strain energy than Zn, which nearly accounts for the difference in EH0 between Ni- and Zn-goethite. Our theory-informed, experimental study reveals how two common impurities affect the stability of goethite with implications for the biogeochemical reactivity of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide in mediating elemental and electron fluxes in the environment."

However, the presence of eco-corona may change MNP physicochemical properties, thereby impacting their biological effects. This study investigated how eco-corona influenced the visual toxicity and potential mechanisms of MNPs in marine medaka. The results showed that MNPs, with or without eco-corona, can cause eye malformation, retinal damage, eye cell apoptosis, and suppression of visual-related gene expression. Although MNPs caused visual impairments, they did not lead to abnormal behavior during light-dark alternation. Moreover, while 5 μm polystyrene microplastics (MP5) caused eye swelling, 50 nm polystyrene microplastics (NP50) resulted in more severe retinal damage. Regardless of eco-corona, NP50 induced greater activity during dark periods compared with MP5. Notably, eco-corona exacerbated retinal damage and cell apoptosis caused by MNPs, leading to increased activity. The analysis of visual-related genes revealed that eco-corona aggravated the visual toxicity of MNPs, and NP50 exhibited greater visual toxicity than MP5, regardless of eco-corona. Overall, smaller MNPs may pose higher risks to the visual system in real marine environments. This study provides novel insights into the effects of eco-corona in MNP-induced visual toxicity and highlights the importance of considering biomolecules in marine environments."

The theory is radically simpler than published alternatives, dependent only on precipitation and surface net radiation with no free parameters. Minor variations improve its performance. The theory answers two basic questions: (a) Why does soil moisture exhibit a W‐shaped latitudinal profile, even though precipitation over land does not? Poleward declines in net radiation resolve this discrepancy. (b) Why does soil moisture decrease with warming in some regions where precipitation increases? The theory predicts this phenomenon where fractional increases in net radiation exceed those in precipitation. Common alternative mechanisms, which invoke changes in vapor pressure deficit or plant responses to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$, are inessential to explaining first‐order changes in soil moisture with warming."

Here, the authors use photocurrent spectroscopy to show signatures of an excitonic insulator and its superfluidity in few layer black phosphorus. 
 Excitonic condensation refers to the spontaneous formation of correlated electron-hole pairs. These collective states, also known as excitonic insulator, are expected to lead to intriguing many-body physics such as Bose-Einstein-condensates and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer crossover. While the occurrence of excitonic insulator has been confirmed by measuring charge gaps, related macro-quantum phenomenon are less often observed. Here we report the signature of exciton insulator and its superfluidity in dual-gate few layer black phosphorus. Using Fourier transform infrared photo-current spectroscopy, we characterize the behavior of electron-hole pairs in black phosphorus. When shrinking the bandgap of photo-excited black phosphorus by electric displacement, we observe excitonic insulator formation featured by a sharp change of infrared photo-current spectrum and charge compressibility. This condensation presents a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer -like temperature dependence with a critical temperature of ~17 K. We observe that the intrinsic black phosphorus photocurrent simultaneously vanishes with the formation of excitonic condensation. This vanished photocurrent is resilient against reasonable in-plane electric fields, indicating robust electron-hole pair binding state and providing evidence for the potential superfluidity of the exciton bosons. Our work not only reveals the exotic quantum phases and unusual orderings in excitonic insulator, but also provides a perspective for the study of composite Fermions.

 Identifying cell types and states remains a time-consuming, error-prone challenge for spatial biology. While deep learning increasingly plays a role, it is difficult to generalize due to variability at the level of cells, neighborhoods, and niches in health and disease. To address this, we develop TACIT, an unsupervised algorithm for cell annotation using predefined signatures that operates without training data. TACIT uses unbiased thresholding to distinguish positive cells from background, focusing on relevant markers to identify ambiguous cells in multiomic assays. Using five datasets (5,000,000 cells; 51 cell types) from three niches (brain, intestine, gland), TACIT outperforms existing unsupervised methods in accuracy and scalability. Integrating TACIT-identified cell types reveals new phenotypes in two inflammatory gland diseases.

 Most new cancer diagnoses occur in patients over the age of 65. The composition and function of the immune system changes with age, but how the aged immune system affects responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cancer therapies remains incompletely understood. Here, using multiplex cytokine assay and high-parameter mass cytometry, we analyze prospectively collected blood samples from 104 cancer patients receiving ICIs. We find aged patients ( ≥ 65-years-old; n = 54) derive similar clinical outcomes as younger patients (n = 50). However, aged, compared to young, patients have divergent immune phenotypes at baseline that persist during ICI therapy, including diminished cytokine responses, reduced pools of naïve T cells with increased relative expression of immune checkpoint molecules, and more robust effector T cell expansion in responders compared to non-responders.

 Ferromagnetic order-induced insulator-to-metal transitions via the double exchange mechanism have been studied widely. In contrast, ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic spontaneous magnetization induced metal-to-insulator transitions (MITs), especially occurring above room temperature, remain extremely limited, although such magnetoelectric materials hold great potential for low-loss multifunctional electronic and spintronic devices. Here, a novel 3d/5d hybridized quadruple perovskite oxide, CaCu3Ni2Os2O12, was synthesized. It undergoes long-range Cu2+(↑)–Ni2+(↑)–Os6+(↓) ferrimagnetic order with a high Curie temperature of 393 K, maintaining a saturated magnetization of 2.15 μB/f.u. at 300 K. Intriguingly, an MIT is found to occur concurrently at the Curie temperature. Theoretical analyses reveal that the ferrimagnetic spontaneous order significantly renormalizes the electronic band structure, which can be further modified by electronic correlation and spin–orbit coupling effects, leading to the MIT via the Lifshitz-type mechanism. This work thus provides a paradigm material to realize ferrimagnetic spontaneous magnetization induced MIT at a high critical temperature toward advanced applications. Insulator-to-metal transitions induced by spontaneous magnetization above room temperature have rarely been observed. Here, the authors show that this transition, along with concurrent high-temperature ferrimagnetic order, is realized in the novel 3d/5d hybridized quadruple perovskite oxide CaCu3Ni2Os2O12."

 It is known that the urban heat island (UHI) effect could increase mortality in hot seasons, yet its potential health benefits during cold spells are often overlooked. Here we assess the beneficial and detrimental impacts of the UHI effect and associated cooling strategies on temperature-related mortality in more than 3,000 cities worldwide by integrating multi-source datasets.

Both geomorphology and operational characteristics play key roles, with geomorphology affecting subgrade stability indirectly. Bare land influences settlement and uplift deformation, while frost damage and mud pumping are driven by freezing days and rainfall.

Furthermore, we identify two severe lake drought events in the Southern United States (2012–2014) and Southeast Australia (2007–2010), posing dramatic threats to water supplies, biodiversity, and ecological health.

 Qarhan Salt Lake, China’s largest brine-type potassium-lithium deposit, holds substantial economic value. However, the timing of lithium-rich brine formation, its origin, and the role of climate in its development remain unclear. This highlights the need for a deeper understanding of salt lake evolution, particularly regarding ore-forming brine composition and the palaeoclimate. Therefore, we conducted 230Th dating on halite deposits from borehole ZK6-7 (7.5–46.7 metres) in the northern Bieletan, revealing halite deposition at 237.79–30.29 thousand years before 2000 A.D. The maximum homogenisation temperature of fluid inclusions was 23.9–41.7 °C, indicating frequent palaeobrine temperature fluctuations, corresponding to palaeoclimatic events in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and Qaidam Basin. Lithium, potassium, magnesium, boron, and bromine concentrations were inversely correlated with the maximum homogenisation temperature. Lithium-rich brine formation in the Bieletan was a long-term process driven by interglacial-glacial cycles, where warm periods increased river flow and material supply, while dry-cold periods intensified evaporation, promoting mineral enrichment.

 Around the margins of Antarctica, dense waters formed on the continental shelf are exported to oceanic depths. This overflow of dense waters to the abyss ventilates the ocean, and is vital to the global overturning circulation. Accurately quantifying the variability in the transport of dense waters exported from the Antarctic continental shelf poses substantial challenges, due to the reliance on costly, carbon-emitting, and sparse observations or on models that do not capture complete dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that Antarctic dense water overflows can be monitored from space, using year-round sea surface height observations from satellite altimetry. We employ high-resolution simulations to characterize the sea surface height signature of the dense waters crossing the Ross Sea continental shelf break. This allows us to find a sea surface height proxy that captures the dense water transport variability, even when model outputs are subsampled to the sparse satellite observation coverage. When applied to the existing satellite record, this proxy reveals interannual variability that aligns with changes in dense water properties measured from hydrographic surveys. Our findings suggest that satellite-based monitoring can effectively complement and enhance existing in situ observing systems, by providing long-term and extensive spatial coverage of Antarctic dense water transports.

 Suspended sediments are vital indicators of water quality, so understanding the dynamic processes and influence factors of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is crucial in estuaries or coastal waters. This study presents a comprehensive strategy for coupling several methods of remote sensing, field observation, and numerical simulation to systematically study spatio-temporal variability of suspended sediment in the Liao River Estuary (LRE) and Daliao River Estuary (DLRE), and then driving forces are analyzed. The SSC retrieval algorithm is suitable to interpret the dynamic SSC changes in shallow and turbid waters of the LRE and the DLRE. The results indicated that the SSC is higher during the muximum period of flood and ebb tide velocities but lower near the periods of flood and ebb slacks. SSC of the LRE and the DLRE is higher in spring tide cycle than that in neap tide under similar wind conditions. Wind conditions and waves caused by wind markedly influenced the SSC distribution in the LRE and the DLRE. Specifically, continuous turbidity zones are often formed due to sediment resuspension caused by larger bed shear stress under the action of strong southwest winds. The effect of river discharge on SSC in dry season is almost negligible in these study regions, and the river discharge during wet season leads to an increase of SSC. These results provide a fresh perspective on the complex sedimentary processes in estuary waters."

 Trend and attribution analysis of vegetation greenness is crucial to explain and predict ecosystem responses to climate change. The common practice to detect and explain greenness pattern from remote sensing time series is mostly based on pixel-by-pixel analysis, which often fails to account for spatial autocorrelation and may lead to spurious patterns. Here we applied the Partitioned Autoregressive Time Series (PARTS) method to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation (NDVI3g) data and multiple climate datasets, and examined the climate effects on greenness trend in China. This method considers temporal and spatial autocorrelation structure, and aggregates pixel information to rigorously test the hypotheses about regional patterns. The results showed that greenness trends were strongly impacted by climate change, environmental background and their interactions. In regions with lower greenness, higher temperature, more precipitation and soil moisture, and lower vapor pressure deficit (VPD), the greening rate tends to be higher. For the whole China, long-term trends of temperature (P < 0.05) and soil moisture (P < 0.05) made significantly negative effects on greenness trend, while trend of precipitation (P < 0.05) and VPD (P < 0.001) made significantly positive impacts. But their effects strongly interacted with environmental background. The overall positive VPD impact was significantly enhanced with an increase in VPD level (P < 0.001), which was also supported by the significantly positive VPD impact in the northwestern arid regions (high VPD) and the significantly negative impact in the tropical and subtropical areas (low VPD). In the cold ecosystems, the change in soil moisture made significantly negative effect on greenness trend. This study provides new insights into the driving mechanisms of greenness change, which is useful to inform ecosystem modeling to make accurate predictions. Moreover, the analysis framework with PARTS method could be effectively applied to other regions or to analyzing other ecosystem responses to climate change."

In this paper, we analyze new temperature data illustrating the complex interplay of climate warming and anthropogenically enhanced groundwater flow on subsurface thermal regimes from two sites in different hydrogeological settings.

While climate and housing growth are commonly linked to rising fire activity, the role of specific ignition sources—particularly human-caused—remains understudied. Analyzing a 79-year dataset (1940–2019) from U.S. Forest Service regions across the continental United States, we found that different ignition sources in different regions have been a major driver of wildfire trends, accounting for 60%–80% of the interannual variation in fire frequency and approximately 20% in area burned across most U.S. regions. Lightning and campfires were the dominant sources in western regions, while arson drove fire activity east of the Mississippi River. Trends also varied significantly by region and over time, with housing growth explaining more in terms of fire frequency and climate primarily influencing area burned. Importantly, frequent fires often originated from different sources than those causing the largest areas burned. Prevention of human-caused ignitions, such as campfires and arson, could offer efficient and effective strategies to mitigate wildfire impacts on human and natural systems under changing climate and land-use conditions."

Applying this approach to model the yields of six Canadian crops, we find yield penalties to cold-temperature exposure mirror those from extreme heat. While average yields under low- and high-emission scenarios increase significantly when warmer days mitigate cold damage, these gains are too small to offset additional extreme-heat damage, and the net effect remains broadly negative. For barley, canola, oats and wheat, damages are severely negative (−28.4% to −57.8% loss). For maize and soybean, outcomes range from no distinguishable change to moderate losses (−5.2%).

MATSL reached its highest elevations in 2019 (155 m above the long-term average) for Alaska (Region 1) and in 2023 (148 m) for Western Canada and USA (Region 2). The rate of MATSL rise accelerated fourfold, increasing from 2.1 ± 0.8 m a−1 in 1984–2010 (r2 = 0.1, p < 0.01) to 8.9 ± 1.7 m a−1 in 2010–2024 (r2 = 0.5, p < 0.01). In 2019, 91 glaciers exceeded the 95th percentile MATSL elevation, a threshold indicative of complete loss of the accumulation area, in Region 1. In Region 2, 149 glaciers exceeded this threshold in 2023. Year-to-year variability in MATSL was strongly influenced by mean summer air temperature with sensitivities of +46 m °C−1 (r2 = 0.54) and +23 m °C−1 (r2 = 0.30) for Regions 1 and 2, respectively. Mean spring snow water equivalent also played an important role with sensitivities of −351 mm w.e.−1 (r2 = 0.48) and −155 mm w.e.−1 (r2 = 0.37), respectively. Per-glacier analysis revealed that south-facing slopes experienced the largest MATSL increases. Terrain attributes, including slope, aspect, hypsometry, and elevation, enhanced MATSL prediction models compared to those using only climate variables. The pronounced rise in MATSL underscores a critical glacier melt feedback mechanism, warranting further investigation.

Here, we estimated the relative contribution of progressive active layer thickness (ALT) increases to vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) in the northern permafrost region during the 21st century. Our results revealed that ALT changes accounted for 40% of the GPP increase in the permafrost region during 2000–2021, with amplified effects observed in late growing season (September–October) (43.2%–45.4%) and was especially notable in tundra ecosystems (51%–52.6%). However, projections indicated that this contribution could decrease considerably in the coming decades. Model simulations suggest that once ALT increments (relative to the 2001–2021 baseline) reach approximately 90 cm between 2035 and 2045, the promoting effect of ALT increase on vegetation growth may disappear.

In Denmark, our results indicate a similar use of organic (manure) and synthetic N fertilizers (230 and 213 kt N y−1, 83 and 77 kg N ha−1 y−1); in contrast, Sweden used more synthetic (162 kt N y−1, 54 kg N ha−1 y−1) than organic N (108 kt N y−1, 36 kg N ha−1 y−1), with subnational variation in manure use as determined by livestock population. Livestock feed N intake was twice as large in Denmark (384 kt N y−1) as in Sweden (176 kt N y−1), reflecting Denmark’s larger livestock population. Denmark’s national crop NUE was lower (0.51) than Sweden’s (0.72), likely due to a lower proportion of grass–clover leys, higher N input rates, and more intensive production systems. However, considerable subnational variation existed in both countries. The livestock NUE was 0.29 in Denmark and 0.25 in Sweden; these differences are mainly due to a higher proportion of ruminants in Sweden with lower N feed use efficiency than pigs. Sweden emitted less N2O and NH3 per unit area (∼56% for both gases) and in total (∼52% for both gases) than Denmark due to lower use of N inputs and less intensive farming systems. West Denmark and South Sweden were identified as emission hotspots.

Here, we employ an integrated human-Earth system model, incorporating an expanded set of ten income groups in the residential energy sector, to examine the distributional impacts of long-term decarbonization scenarios on residential energy security at the state level through 2050. We use multiple metrics of energy security, including energy burden, energy satiation gap, and the distribution of energy service across income groups. Our findings show that the net-zero decarbonization scenarios affect residential energy security differently across income groups, with low-to-mid-income groups experiencing larger negative impacts on the dimensions studied here. Comparatively, climate change impact on residential energy security is minor through 2050 based on our model outcomes. Specifically, the net-zero decarbonization scenarios lead to increased energy burden across all income groups and states in 2050, where the lowest (highest) income group in each state shows an average of 0.6 (0.2) percentage point increase in energy burden, relative to the business-as-usual in 2050. The distribution of energy service consumption across income groups is also slightly more skewed under these scenarios. As incomes grow across all deciles in the future, residential energy security generally improves through 2050. Targeted interventions could mitigate the disproportionate impacts that some groups could incur under a transition to a net-zero economy."

A thorough understanding of these impacts is essential for scientifically planning wind farms (WFs) in the future. While previous studies have evaluated the influences of WFs on vegetation and climate indicators, analyses of the underlying mechanisms remain limited. Here, we focused on 169 cropland WFs in eastern China to investigate the impacts of this prevalent type of WF. Specifically, we developed an analytical framework that first evaluated the impacts of cropland WFs on ecological and environmental factors. Ridge regression was then applied to identify differences in the environmental variables inside and outside the WFs that affect gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Finally, structural equation modeling was used to delineate the pathways by which WFs influence GPP and ET. The results show that WFs reduce daytime land surface temperature by 0.186 °C, significantly increase soil moisture (0.003 m3 m−3), and decrease the vapor pressure deficit by 0.095 hPa. These environmental changes subsequently contributed to a significant rise in GPP (25.181 gC m−2) and ET (3.785 mm). By elucidating the complex ecological impacts of WFs from a pathway perspective, this study reveals the interactions among factors influenced by the local scale temperature effects of WFs, providing a deeper understanding of their ecological impacts and valuable insights for future research."

Rickard,The importance of burning conditions on the composition of domestic biomass-burning organic aerosol and the impact of atmospheric ageing,"The chemical composition of organic aerosol derived from wood-burning emissions under different burning conditions was characterised. Fresh emissions from flaming and smouldering were largely aromatic in nature, whereas upon aging the aromatic content decreased. This decrease was greater for smouldering due to the loss of toxic polyaromatic species, whereas under flaming conditions highly toxic polyaromatic species were produced. These differences present an important challenge for future policy. 
 Domestic biomass burning is a significant source of organic aerosol (OA) to the atmosphere; however, the understanding of OA composition under different burning conditions and after oxidation is largely unknown. Compositional analysis of OA is often limited by the lack of analytical standards available for quantification; however, semi-quantitative non-target analysis (NTA) can overcome these limitations by enabling the detection of thousands of compounds and quantification via surrogate standards. A series of controlled-burn experiments were conducted at the Manchester Aerosol Chamber to investigate domestic biomass-burning OA (BBOA) under different burning conditions and the impact of atmospheric ageing. Insights into the chemical composition of fresh and aged OA from flaming-dominated and smouldering-dominated combustion were obtained via a newly developed semi-quantitative NTA approach using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. Aerosol from smouldering-dominated burns contained significant organic carbon content, whereas under flaming-dominated conditions it was primarily black carbon. The detectable OA mass from both conditions was dominated by oxygenated compounds (CHO) (≈ 90 %) with smaller contributions from organonitrogen species. Primary OA (POA) had a high concentration of C8–C17CHO compounds, with both burns exhibiting a peak between C8–C11. However, flaming-dominated POA exhibited a greater contribution of C13–C17 CHO species. More than 50 % of the CHO mass in POA was determined as aromatic by the aromaticity index, largely in the form of functionalised monoaromatic compounds. After ageing, the aromatic contribution to the total CHO mass decreased with a greater loss for smouldering (−53 %) than flaming (−16 %) due to the increased reduction of polyaromatic compounds under smouldering conditions. The O:C ratios of the aged OA from flaming and smouldering were consistent with those from the oxidation of aromatic compounds (0.57–1.00), suggesting that compositional changes upon ageing were driven by the oxidation of aromatic compounds and the loss of aromaticity. However, there was a greater probability of O:C ratios ≥ 0.8 in aged smouldering OA, indicating the presence of more oxidised species. This study presents the first reported quantitative non-target compositional analysis of domestic BBOA using retention window scaling and demonstrates that compositional changes between burn phase and after ageing may have important consequences for exposure to such emissions in residential settings."

In this study, both the electrochemical properties and molecular compositions of DOM in high As groundwater were quantified in the Hetao Basin, China. We found that, along the flow path, the average electron-transferring capacity (ETC) of DOM, including the capacities of electron-accepting and electron-donating, continuously increased from 2.85 to 3.59 mmole-/gC along with As concentrations. The increasing ETC reflected an increase in electron shuttle ability of DOM. Furthermore, the increasing electron shuttle ability was mainly attributed to the recalcitrant compounds in DOM, especially CHOS and CHONS formulas in highly unsaturated structures with high oxygen (HUSHO) and CHO and CHON formulas in aromatic structures (AS). The significantly positive correlation between As concentration and ETC indicated that recalcitrant DOM promoted groundwater As enrichment through electron shuttling for inducing the reductive dissolution of As-containing Fe(III) oxide minerals, which was further supported by our culture experiments showing that goethite was more reduced [133 μM Fe(II)] in the presence of DOM with a higher ETC (3.35 mmole-/gC) as electron shuttling than that [65.2 μM Fe(II)] with a relatively lower ETC (2.41 mmole-/gC).

Based on the VOx/TiO2 catalyst, a hydrolysis-oxidation strategy (CeOx and WOx doping) was built for desirable low-temperature catalytic activity, product selectivity, H2O tolerance, and chlorine desorption. The in situ and ex situ experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations revealed that hydrolysis sites favored molecular adsorption, C–Cl cleavage, and HCl formation; meanwhile, oxidation sites enhanced the activation of reactive oxygen species and improved oxygen mobility and redox properties. The enhanced oxygen storage/release capacity (33–53 fold) and extended redox cycle (e.g., from V5+↔V4+ to V5+↔V4+↔V3+) favored the deep oxidation. The introduction of H2O triggered the hydrolysis–oxidation process that promoted the catalytic activity and chlorine desorption due to the elevated generation of ·O2– and higher-activity ·OH. Furthermore, the water resistance of the VOx/TiO2-based catalyst was enhanced after the application of the hydrolysis–oxidation strategy. The V–Ce–W/Ti catalyst exhibited remarkable removal efficiency of dioxins (96.7–98.2%), which was reduced from 0.34–0.48 ng I-TEQ Nm–3 to 0.006–0.016 ng I-TEQ Nm–3 during pilot tests at 160–180 °C, achieving ultralow emissions.

A turbulent surface mixed layer grew thicker with nightly cooling and thinner with daily warming. However, both day and night, turbulence was inhibited in a stratified layer that separated the surface mixed layer from the deeper pond. Nightly cooling, likely intensified in shallow regions of the pond, generated 10‐cm‐thick cold layers, which flowed down the sloping bed to renew bottom waters.

We develop a novel framework based on moist static energy to understand the circulation response, targeting in particular the bulk circulation metric of ascent fraction. Warming concentrated in regions of ascent leads to a strong “upped‐ante” effect and spatial contraction of the ascending region. Our framework reveals substantial contributions to tropical‐mean CRE changes not only from traditional “pattern effect” regimes, but also from the intensification of convection in ascent regions as well as a smaller contribution from cloud changes in convective margins."

This motivates the need for explicit internal representations of fairness. To that end, we draw on methods for enforcing physical constraints in emulators and propose a custom loss function which punishes predictions of unequal quality across any prespecified regions or category, here defined using Human Development Index. This loss function weighs a standard error metric against another which captures inequity between groups, allowing us to adjust the priority of each. Our results show that emulators trained with our loss function provide more equitable predictions. We empirically demonstrate that an appropriate selection of an equity priority can minimize loss of performance, mitigating the tradeoff between accuracy and equity."

 Free radicals were first discovered over 120 years ago by Gomberg1 and the first radical cross-couplings demonstrated by Kochi in the 1970’s.2 In contrast to widely employed polar cross-coupling chemistry to forge C(sp2)–C(sp2) bonds (Suzuki, Negishi, Kumada, etc.), radical cross-coupling is advantageous when applied to the coupling of saturated systems due to the mild conditions employed and enhanced chemoselectivity associated with single electron chemistry. Indeed, the ability to employ ubiquitous carbon-based fragments (carboxylic acids, alcohols, amines, olefins, etc.) in cross-coupling has dramatically simplified access to a variety of complex molecules.3-9 Despite these advantages, enantiospecific coupling reactions involving free radicals are unknown and generally believed to be challenging due to their near-instantaneous racemization (picosecond timescale).10 As a result, controlling the stereochemical outcome of radical cross-coupling can only be achieved on a case-by-case basis using bespoke chiral ligands11 or in a diastereoselective fashion guided by nearby stereocenters.12 Here we show how readily accessible enantioenriched sulfonylhydrazides and low loadings of an inexpensive achiral Ni-catalyst can be enlisted to solve this vexing challenge for the first time thereby enabling enantiospecific, stereoretentive radical cross-coupling between enantioenriched alkyl fragments and (hetero)aryl halides without exogenous redox chemistry or chiral ligands. Calculations support the intermediacy of a unique Ni-bound diazene-containing transition state with C–C bond formation driven by loss of N2."

 Poxviruses cause severe diseases including smallpox and mpox, which pose major threats to human health. The poxvirus core protease (CorePro) is essential for viral maturation and highly conserved in poxviruses, making it an attractive antiviral target1. However, the structure of CorePro remains unknown, hampering antiviral development. Here, we determined the structures of mpox virus (MPXV) apo-CorePro and its complex with an inhibitor aloxistatin, which is a drug candidate for muscular dystrophy2. These structures show that CorePro forms a homodimer featuring a unique “dancing-couple” fold. The catalytic intermediate state of CorePro was characterized by an aldehyde derivative from a natural substrate (I-G18). This derivative covalently binds to the catalytic cysteine 328 (Cys328), making the active site of viral protease shift from a closed conformation in the apo-form to a favorable open conformation upon substrate binding. Based on the CorePro-I-G18 complex, we then designed a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors with a nitrile warhead, which could covalently anchor with the catalytic Cys328. These compounds inhibit the CorePro with IC50 values of 44.9-100.3 nM, exhibiting potent and broad anti-poxvirus activity as well. Our studies provide the basis for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against poxvirus infections."

 Engineering and characterizing proteins can be time-consuming and cumbersome, motivating the development of generalist CRISPR-Cas enzymes1–4 to enable diverse genome editing applications. However, such enzymes have caveats such as an increased risk of off-target editing3,5,6. To enable scalable reprogramming of Cas9 enzymes, here we combined high-throughput protein engineering with machine learning (ML) to derive bespoke editors more uniquely suited to specific targets. Via structure/function-informed saturation mutagenesis and bacterial selections, we obtained nearly 1,000 engineered SpCas9 enzymes and characterized their protospacer-adjacent motif7 (PAM) requirements to train a neural network that relates amino acid sequence to PAM specificity. By utilizing the resulting PAM ML algorithm (PAMmla) to predict the PAMs of 64 million SpCas9 enzymes, we identified efficacious and specific enzymes that outperform evolution-based and engineered SpCas9 enzymes as nucleases and base editors in human cells while reducing off-targets. An in silico directed evolution method enables user-directed Cas9 enzyme design, including for allele-selective targeting of the RHO P23H allele in human cells and mice. Together, PAMmla integrates ML and protein engineering to curate a catalog of SpCas9 enzymes with distinct PAM requirements, and motivates the use of efficient and safe bespoke Cas9 enzymes instead of generalist enzymes for various applications."

Here, the authors developed make-or-break Prime Editing, a precise method for genetic modification in Streptococcus pneumoniae that enables high-throughput and scalable genome editing. 
 CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering by allowing precise introductions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is indirectly provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE is RecA-independent and can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner. The mbPE system and pegRNA design guidelines described here will ameliorate future bacterial genome editing endeavors. Genome engineering in bacteria remains a complex multistep process.

 Advances in proteomics and mass spectrometry enable the study of limited cell populations, where high-mass accuracy instruments are typically required. While triple quadrupoles offer fast and sensitive low-mass specificity measurements, these instruments are effectively restricted to targeted proteomics. Linear ion traps (LITs) offer a versatile, cost-effective alternative capable of both targeted and global proteomics. Here, we describe a workflow using a hybrid quadrupole-LIT instrument that rapidly develops targeted proteomics assays from global data-independent acquisition (DIA) measurements without high-mass accuracy. Using an automated software approach for scheduling parallel reaction monitoring assays (PRM), we show consistent quantification across three orders of magnitude in a matched-matrix background. We demonstrate measuring low-level proteins such as transcription factors and cytokines with quantitative linearity below two orders of magnitude in a 1 ng background proteome without requiring stable isotope-labeled standards. From a 1 ng sample, we found clear consistency between proteins in subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells measured using high dimensional flow cytometry and LIT-based proteomics. Based on these results, we believe hybrid quadrupole-LIT instruments represent a valuable solution to expanding mass spectrometry in a wide variety of laboratory settings.

 Patagonian glaciers have been rapidly losing mass in the last two decades, but the driving processes remain poorly known. Here we use two state-of-the-art regional climate models to reconstruct long-term (1940-2023) glacier surface mass balance (SMB), i.e., the difference between precipitation accumulation, surface runoff and sublimation, at about 5 km spatial resolution, further statistically downscaled to 500 m. High-resolution SMB agrees well with in-situ observations and, combined with solid ice discharge estimates, captures recent GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite mass change. Glacier mass loss coincides with a long-term SMB decline (−0.35 Gt yr−2), primarily driven by enhanced surface runoff (+0.47 Gt yr−2) and steady precipitation. We link these trends to a poleward shift of the subtropical highs favouring warm northwesterly air advections towards Patagonia (+0.14°C dec−1 at 850 hPa). Since the 1940s, Patagonian glaciers have lost 1350  ± 449 Gt of ice, equivalent to 3.7  ± 1.2 mm of global mean sea-level rise.

 The moiré superlattice, created by stacking van der Waals layered materials with rotational misalignments, exhibits a multitude of emergent correlated phenomena ranging from superconductivity to Mott insulating states. In addition to exotic electronic states, the intricate networks of incommensurate lattices may give rise to polymer-like viscoelasticity, which combines the properties of both elastic solids and viscous fluids. This phenomenon may enrich the dynamics of nanomechanical resonators, in which viscoelasticity has not played a role thus far. Here, we report on a controllable hysteretic response of the nanomechanical vibrations in twisted bilayer graphene membranes, which we attribute to viscoelasticity. Accompanying this hysteretic response, we measure unusually large mechanical quality factors Q reaching a remarkably high value of  ~1900 at room temperature. We interpret the enhancement of Q as a signature of dissipation dilution, a phenomenon of considerable interest that has recently been harnessed in quantum optomechanical systems. Viscoelasticity features a “lossless” potential that overcomes the corrugation registry and reinforces such a dissipation dilution. Our work introduces the moiré superlattice as a promising system for viscoelasticity engineering through rotating angles and for observing emergent nanoelectromechanical couplings.

Here, the authors report on a bottom-up assembly process for producing highly porous hydrogel structures where structure dictates bulk properties. 
 While hierarchical ordering is a distinctive feature of natural tissues and is directly responsible for their diverse and unique properties, efforts to synthesize biomaterials have primarily focused on using molecular-based approaches with little emphasis on multiscale structure. Here, we report a bottom-up self-assembly process to produce highly porous hydrogel fibers that resemble extracellular matrices both structurally and mechanically. Physically crosslinked nanostructured micelles form the walls of micrometer-sized water-rich pores with preferred orientation along the fiber direction. Low elastic moduli (<1 kPa), high elasticity (extending by more than 12 times the initial length), non-linear elasticity (e.g., hyperelasticity), and completely reversible extension are derived from unevenly distributed strain between the micrometer-sized pores and the polymer chains, which is reminiscent of cellular solids. Control of the material microstructure and orientation over many orders of magnitude (e.g., nm–μm), while holding the nanostructure constant, reveals how the multiscale structure directly impacts mechanical properties.

Here, the authors reveal that hybridization between the lower Hubbard band and the chalcogen band stabilizes the Mott state through bandwidth tuning in the 1T-MX2 (M = Nb, Ta; X = S, Se) family. 
 Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.

This study evaluates how and to what extent systems analysis tools are used in research on plastic pollution to support policy design. 
 Over the last decades, plastic pollution has predominantly been considered a downstream issue, focusing on marine litter and waste management challenges. However, this limited focus is insufficient in responding to the urgency, complexity and scale of the problem. Therefore, the scientific community increasingly calls for a systemic focus on plastic pollution, especially with respect to designing effective policy interventions. Extant literature has documented examples of science-based policy, showing that systems tools have successfully informed policies targeting plastic pollution. With a potentially first, global plastics treaty currently under negotiations, we analyse the way in which systems-based techniques are used in literature to generate evidence regarding plastic pollution and to inform policy processes. We systematically select 324 publications from the systems-based plastic pollution literature and analyse trends, patterns and context in which systems analysis tools are used. We find that the application of these tools is limited and still highly focused on the downstream impacts of plastics. Thus, we make two key recommendations for harnessing systems analysis techniques to strengthen the efforts at developing an ambitious, science-based treaty: the employment of an emitter perspective and supporting a just transition through systems literature.

 The Atlantic Niño exerts profound impacts on regional and global atmospheric circulation and climate, and on equatorial Atlantic biogeochemistry and ecosystems. However, the mode’s prediction remains a challenge which has been partly attributed to weak atmosphere-ocean coupling in the region. Here we introduce a framework that enhances the detection of the coupling between meridional migrations of atmospheric deep convection and zonal thermocline feedback. This approach reveals high predictive skill in a 196-member seasonal prediction ensemble, demonstrating robust predictability at 1–5-month forecast initialization lead times. The coupled mode is strongly correlated with land-precipitation variability across the tropics. The predictive skill largely originates in the Atlantic Ocean and is uncorrelated with El Niño Southern Oscillation in the Pacific, the leading mode of interannual climate variability globally. These skillful predictions raise hopes for enabled action in advance to avoid the most severe societal impacts in the affected countries."

 Dietary changes can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Great Britain. Guidelines recommend reducing meat and dairy consumption while increasing plant-based foods, but household purchasing habits achieving these shifts are not well understood. Here we analysed food purchase data from ~30,000 British households (2012–2019), identifying 709 households that reduced their dietary greenhouse gas emissions by 34%. Using latent class analysis, we identified two distinct clusters among these households: plant-based adopters who reduced meat and dairy, adopting healthier diets; and households replacing meat with dairy and convenience foods, showing less healthy dietary changes. Plant-based adopters typically had higher education, higher incomes, were older (45+ years), and smaller in size. Households shifting toward dairy and convenience foods were older and smaller. Supporting healthy and sustainable diets requires targeted policies to enhance affordability, availability, and convenience of nutritious plant-based foods.

 Ensuring habitat representativeness is fundamental to area-based conservation, yet the effectiveness and efficiency of individual protected areas in meeting this goal remain underexamined, potentially impeding targeted strategies. Here we assessed habitat representativeness, representativeness contribution and representativeness density across China’s protected areas to evaluate their performance in meeting species conservation needs, using refined species distribution data. The overall network’s habitat representativeness was 62.39%, fully meeting conservation needs for 28.33% of species. Among them, 175 protected areas contributed over half of existing achievement for 751 species, including 148 fully dependent on one site, revealing uneven conservation efforts and species-site dependencies. While protected area size correlated with habitat representativeness and contribution, species richness also correlated with contribution and density, showing size alone may not determine efficiency. We then classified protected areas into four efficiency-based categories and proposed tailored strategies.

 Personal laser scanning has evolved into a cutting-edge technology for obtaining fast and accurate biometric measurements of individual trees in a forest. However, recent studies assessing tree species labels on single tree point clouds have been insufficiently accurate in complex forest ecosystems; moreover, explainability of machine-learning methods used in published studies has been insufficient. Whether the predictions of black-box models suffer from over-fitting or whether they are based on characteristic species traits often remains unclear. To solve this problem, we present a simple classifier combining random forest models with decision rules, trained on 9 common tree species in Central Europe. Explainable elements are a soft classifier on classification probabilities and detailed analysis of variable importance and minimal variable depth. The overall classification accuracy was 89.8% for nine species, with greater values for the four major species (spruce, pine, oak, and beech). Intensity measures in the upper tree section and tree geometry ratios were the most important predictors. The method proposed in this study can potentially be used to analyze forest ecosystems in more spatial detail by addressing species-specific research questions to an unprecedented degree."

Samset,Surface temperature effects of recent reductions in shipping SO2 emissions are within internal variability,"In 2020, regulations by the International Maritime Organization aimed to reduce aerosol emissions from ships. These aerosols previously had a cooling effect, which the regulations might reduce, revealing more greenhouse gas warming. Here we find that, while there is regional warming, the global 2020–2040 temperature rise is only +0.03 °C. This small change is difficult to distinguish from natural climate variability, indicating the regulations have had a limited effect on observed warming to date. 
 In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented strict new regulations on the emissions of sulfate aerosol from the world's shipping fleet. This can be expected to lead to a reduction in aerosol-driven cooling, unmasking a portion of greenhouse gas warming. The magnitude of the effect is uncertain, however, due to the large remaining uncertainties in the climate response to aerosols. Here, we investigate this question using an 18-member ensemble of fully coupled climate simulations evenly sampling key modes of climate variability with the NCAR model, the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We show that, while there is a clear physical response of the climate system to the IMO regulations, including a surface temperature increase, we do not find global mean temperature influence that is significantly different from zero. The 20-year average global mean warming for 2020–2040 is +0.03 °C, with a 5 %–95 % confidence range of [-0.09,0.19], reflecting the weakness of the perturbation relative to internal variability. We do, however, find a robust, non-zero regional temperature response in part of the North Atlantic. We also find that the maximum annual mean and ensemble mean warming occurs around 1 decade after the perturbation in 2029, which means that the IMO regulations have likely had very limited influence on observed global warming to date. We further discuss our results in light of other, recent publications that have reached different conclusions. Overall, while the IMO regulations may contribute up to 0.16 °C [-0.17,0.52] to the global mean surface temperature in individual years during this decade, consistent with some early studies, such a response is unlikely to have been discernible above internal variability by the end of 2023 and is in fact consistent with zero throughout the 2020–2040 period."

These variations affect many processes in the Earth system, from photosynthesis and chemistry to cloud formation itself. The exact way in which cloud particles interact with sunlight is complex and expensive to calculate. We demonstrate a simplified framework which explains how sunlight changes for potentially any cloud field. 
 Surface solar irradiance variability is present under all broken clouds, but the patterns, magnitude of variability, and driving mechanisms vary greatly with cloud type. In this study, we performed numerical experiments to understand which main mechanisms drive surface solar irradiance (SSI) variations across a diverse set of observation-based cloud conditions. The results show that four mechanisms capture the essence. We find that for optically thin (τ<6) clouds, scattering in the forward direction (forward escape) dominates. In cloud fields with enough optically thin area, such as altocumulus, forward escape alone can drive areas of irradiance enhancement of over 50 % of clear-sky irradiance. For flat, optically thick clouds (τ>6), irradiance is instead scattered diffusely downward (downward escape), and (extreme) enhancements are thus found directly below the cloud. For vertically structured clouds, side escape dominates the domain-averaged diffuse irradiance enhancement  until the sides become shaded by anvil clouds. Lastly, under optically thick cloud cover, surface albedo enhances radiative fluxes due to multiple scatterings between surface and cloud. This brightens shadows and contributes 10 % to 60 % of the total irradiance enhancement for low (0.2) to high (0.8) albedo. With these four mechanisms, we provide a framework for understanding the vast diversity and complexity found in surface solar irradiance and cloudiness. A next step is to apply this analysis to multi-layered cloud fields and non-isolated deep convective clouds."

It then compares three different ensemble analysis methods that combine radar-based precipitation estimates with forecasts from an ensemble numerical weather prediction model. 
 Reliable estimation of precipitation fields at high resolution is a key issue for snow cover modelling in mountainous areas, where the density of precipitation networks is far too low to capture the complex variability of these fields with topography. Adequate quantification of the remaining uncertainty in precipitation estimates is also necessary for further assimilation of complementary snow observations in snow models. Radar observations provide spatialised estimates of precipitation with high spatial and temporal resolution and are often combined with rain gauge observations to improve the accuracy of the estimate. However, radar measurements suffer from significant shortcomings in mountainous areas (in particular, unrealistic spatial patterns due to ground clutter, leading to local systematic biases). Precipitation fields simulated by high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models provide an alternative estimate but suffer from widespread systematic biases and positioning errors. Even though these uncertainties can be partially described by ensemble NWP systems and systematic errors can be reduced by statistical post-processing, NWP precipitation estimates are still not reliable enough for the requirements of high-resolution snow cover modelling.In this study, better precipitation estimates are obtained through a specific analysis based on a combination of all these available products. First, a pre-processing step is proposed to mitigate the main deficiencies of precipitation estimates by radar and gauges, focusing on reducing unrealistic spatial patterns. This method also provides a spatialised estimate of the associated error in mountainous areas, based on a climatological analysis of both radar and NWP-estimated precipitation. Three ensemble daily precipitation analysis methods are then proposed, first using only the modified precipitation estimates and associated errors, then combining them with ensemble NWP simulations based on the particle filter and ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation algorithms. The performance of the different precipitation analysis methods is evaluated at a local scale using independent ski-resort precipitation observations. The evaluation of the pre-processing step shows its ability to remove the main spatial artefacts coming from the radar measurements and to improve the precipitation estimates at the local scale. The local-scale evaluations of the ensemble analyses do not demonstrate an additional benefit of ensemble NWP forecasts, but their contrasted spatial patterns are challenging to evaluate with the available data."

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an essential biochemical parameter reflecting vegetation's photosynthetic activity. In the past five years, some global LCC remote sensing products have been generated, and play an important role in vegetation growth monitoring and terrestrial carbon cycle modeling. However, the resolution of current global LCC products ranges from 300 m to 500 m, and the existing 30m-resolution product, Multi-source data Synergized Quantitative remote sensing production system LCC (MuSyQ LCC), is only available in China, resulting in a lack of global high-resolution LCC products. This study used an empirical relationship method based on the chlorophyll sensitive index (CSI) to produce a 10 m resolution global LCC product (MuSyQ Global LCC) with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. A web application was developed, allowing users to independently select regions of interest, time ranges, and spatial-temporal resolutions. The validation results show the MuSyQ Global LCC consists well with the current global MODIS LCC, and MuSyQ Global LCC’s (RMSE = 14.16 μg/cm2, bias = 1.68 μg/cm2) accuracy is slightly higher than that of MODIS LCC (RMSE = 14.74 μg/cm2, bias = -2.65 μg/cm2).

 The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is a valuable tool for monitoring global soil freeze-thaw dynamics, particularly in high-latitude environments where these processes are important for understanding ecosystem and carbon cycle dynamics. This paper introduces the updated SMOS Level-3 (L3) Soil Freeze-Thaw (FT) product and details its threshold-based classification algorithm, which utilizes L band passive microwave measurements to detect soil freeze-thaw transitions; this is possible due to the difference in dielectric properties between frozen and thawed soils at this frequency band. The algorithm applies gridded brightness temperature data from the SMOS satellite, augmented with ancillary datasets of air temperature and snow cover, to generate global estimates of freeze-thaw state. A recent update to the algorithm includes improved noise reduction through temporal filtering. Validation results against in-situ soil moisture and temperature measurements and comparisons to ERA5 Land reanalysis data demonstrate the ability of the product to detect the day of first freezing, an important metric for better understanding greenhouse gas fluxes and ecosystem dynamics, with improved accuracy. How- ever, limitations remain, particularly in regions affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) and during spring melt periods when wet snow hinders soil thaw detection.

The diagrams were co-produced between a graphics designer and 16 modeling teams, based on extensive discussions and pragmatic decision-making that balanced the need for accuracy and detail against the need for effective visualization. The model diagrams are based on a standardized ISIMIP2b-complete global water model that represents what is theoretically possible to represent in the current generation of state-of-the-art global water models participating in ISIMIP2b. Model-specific diagrams are then copies of the ISIMIP2b-complete model, with individual processes either included or grayed out. An open-source tool has been developed and published jointly with the diagrams, which allows someone to generate a diagram for their own global water model by adapting the diagrams presented here. As well as serving an educational purpose, we envisage that the diagrams will help researchers in and outside of the global water model community to select suitable model(s) for specific applications, stimulate a community learning process, and identify missing components to help direct future model developments."

 The ensemble consistency test (ECT) and its ultrafast variant (UF-ECT) have become powerful tools in the development community for the identification of unwanted changes in the Community Earth  System Model (CESM). By characterizing the distribution of an accepted ensemble of perturbed ultrafast model runs, the UF-ECT is able to identify changes exceeding internal variability in expensive chaotic numerical models with reasonable computational costs. However, up until now this approach has not seen adoption by other communities, in part because the process of adapting the UF-ECT procedure to other models was not clear. In this work we develop a generalized setup framework for applying the UF-ECT to different models and show how our specification of UF-ECT parameters allows us to balance important goals like test sensitivity and computational cost. Finally, we walk through the setup framework in detail and demonstrate the performance of the UF-ECT with our new determined parameters for the Model Across Prediction Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A), the substantially updated CESM atmospheric model, and realistic development scenarios."

In this study, the transport and retention of Shewanella oneidensis cells in saturated porous media was investigated under different levels of ciprofloxacin (CIP) stress. Exposing to lethal CIP stress caused significant viability loss and stimulated cell transport due to increasing hydrophilicity and decreasing surface roughness. While exposure to sublethal CIP stress did not affect MR-1’s viability, elongation of cells promoted their retention in sand columns via straining and orientation effects. The elongated cells likely adopted an end-on configuration to minimize repulsive interaction energy when approaching sand surfaces and deposited in a side-on position due to local surface roughness and charge heterogeneity of sands. The more diminished breakthrough of MR-1 cells in redox-active media was ascribed to their improving extracellular electron transfer and energy taxis activities under sublethal CIP stress. Moreover, the retention of elongated cells in porous media facilitated the de novo emergence of a resistant gyrase mutant, whose remobilization might exacerbate the AMR dissemination."

Methane from seafloor seeps, whether naturally occurring or in relation to petroleum infrastructure, has been suggested to be a significant contribution to greenhouse gas releases. Here, we consider the fate of methane from seeps on the Norwegian continental shelf by means of models for dissolution of methane from rising bubbles, mixing and biodegradation of dissolved methane, and mass transfer to the atmosphere. Laboratory experiments with tritium-labeled methane have been conducted to help determine the biodegradation rate of methane in natural seawater, and the results, together with literature data, have been used to guide the modeling. From the modeling study, we present results as a function of biodegradation half-life, treating this as a free parameter to reflect the considerable span in values reported in the literature. Considering three different locations on the Norwegian continental shelf, we find that if the biodegradation half-life of methane is in the range of a 9 to 16 days, as suggested by our experiments, then about 57–68% of the released methane will biodegrade in the water column from a seep at 65 m depth.

In contrast, the lower-bound for emissions and releases (SSP1-2.6; 0.7 Tg) is substantially smaller than the historical total. Observational constraints on global modeling suggest that most Hg released to land and water prior to 2010 remains sequestered at contaminated sites. Substantial oceanic enrichment by anthropogenic Hg (270% ca. 2010) has been driven mainly by atmospheric emissions. Cumulative future releases to land and water are projected to be approximately six-times greater than primary anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. This Hg is mainly sequestered in legacy Hg waste pools and is unlikely to impact Hg pollution in the global ocean unless it is mobilized by climate change. Modeling results suggest that by 2100 atmospheric Hg concentrations may be similar to present levels if society follows SSP5-8.5.

Pro-thrombotic biomarkers and whole blood transcriptome data were measured repeatedly. Bayesian kernel machine regression revealed that higher serum thromboxane (Tx)B2 levels were associated with increasing levels of joint exposure to air pollutants over 1 week when ozone rather than other pollutants contributed most to the overall effect. Causal mediation analyses found 715 transcripts associated with an increase in TxB2 following ozone exposure, which were enriched in pathways, including ribosome, thermogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and pathways of neurodegeneration. As the temperature increased, we observed a stronger association between ozone exposure and TxB2 increase.

However, the strong competitive adsorption of NO2– over H2 on Ir sites, leading to H* deficiency at high NO2– concentrations, would hinder its real application. Here, we proposed an effective strategy to solve this problem by constructing dual active site Ir–Pt/TiO2 composite catalysts with physical mixing (Ir+Pt/TiO2) and co-impregnation (IrPt/TiO2) methods. On such catalysts, the hydrogen spillover effect on Pt sites could alleviate H* insufficiency on Ir sites, thereby accelerating the NRA reaction. Specifically, the optimal dry-mixed Ir+Pt/TiO2 catalyst exhibited an NRA rate constant of 12.4 L·gIr+Pt–1·min–1, approximately twice that of the Ir/TiO2 sample. Moreover, Ir+Pt/TiO2 catalysts showed first-order reaction kinetics rather than competitive reaction kinetics, confirming the alleviation of the H* deficiency limitation. Various characterization methods revealed that H* derived from H2 dissociated adsorption on Pt sites could migrate through the TiO2 support to Ir sites.

Using silicone-based equilibrium sampling, we quantified the effect of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics on the fugacity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and two polymer additives in dietary and fecal samples of a zoo-housed polar bear. Although PVC microplastics at concentrations well above current observations reduced the fugacities of spiked isotopically labeled PCBs in the polar bear diet and feces slightly, but significantly, leaching from these microplastics greatly elevated fugacities of the additives UV-328 and octabenzone in these samples. The impact of microplastics in the diet on the biological uptake of environmental hydrophobic organic contaminants is likely to be negligible. Microplastics have the potential to be effective vectors for the dietary uptake of polymer additives."

Intracellular ARGs (iARGs) blt, mecA, and ampC, within vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, were treated on PTFE and/or stainless-steel surfaces or in aqueous phosphate buffer (PB; H2O2 only), to simulate potential healthcare and personal care cleaning applications under representative disinfectant exposure conditions. No chemical disinfectant yielded more than limited (≤1.9log10) iARG degradation/deactivation under the conditions investigated, even when ARB cells were extensively inactivated (at levels from 3.1log10 to ≥6log10). In contrast, UV irradiation yielded up to ∼2.8–3.2log10 iARG degradation/deactivation at corresponding ARB inactivation levels up to ∼4log10 in the case of the blt gene within B. subtilis cells on PTFE surfaces, though levels of iARG degradation/deactivation and ARB inactivation were generally lower than expected based on prior aqueous-phase results, likely due to light-shielding effects at the typical ∼108–109 CFU/mL cell inoculum densities used for surface disinfection tests. During exposure to H2O2 in PB, iARG deactivation and ARB inactivation reached up to 1.7log10 and >3.5log10, respectively, while iARG degradation was minimal (≤0.2log10); this appears to be driven by DNA-strand fragmentation (as observed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis) likely resulting from reaction with endogenous HO• (or Fe(IV)) generated via intracellular iron-catalyzed H2O2 decomposition. While all investigated disinfectants were able to effectively inactivate ARB cells themselves, these results demonstrate that most are ineffective in simultaneously degrading and deactivating iARGs, highlighting the potential benefits of employing disinfectants such as 254 nm UV light, that selectively target bacterial DNA, to improve mitigation of antibiotic resistance dissemination."

The order for individual HAN cytotoxicity from most to least toxic was ICH2CN > BrCH2CN ≫ ClCH2CN with the inhibitory concentration that reduced the cell viability by 50% of the untreated cells (IC50) of 2.52 ± 0.19, 7.24 ± 0.68, and 190 ± 18.5 μM, respectively.

The cytotoxicity of all four mixtures at IC50 was well predicted by both concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models, which confirmed additivity effects.

Such accumulation is often attributed to the scavenging of MPs by rising frazil ice crystals, but there is no direct evidence of such a process. Furthermore, nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm–1 μm) are suspected to be present, but their fate is unknown due to the lack of field measurements. Here micro- and nanoplastics’ (MNPs) enrichment by frazil ice was quantified using model particles and an experimental setup which generated realistic frazil ice. Particle size had a significant impact on behavior: on one hand, high-density MPs concentrations were 2.97 ± 1.13 times higher in the ice than in the underlying water, which is consistent with field observations. On the other hand, NPs were depleted to the same extent as sea salts, by a factor of 0.32 ± 0.13.  Like salts, NPs may be locally enriched in the brine channels and pockets of sea ice where microalgae thrive. Overall, this work shows that frazil ice plays an important role in the cycling of MNPs, as it can concentrate MPs in sea ice and concentrate NPs locally in brine channels and pockets."

This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 3,454,623 adults from January 2017 to December 2021, focusing on dyslipidemia and its subtypes. Residential greenness was assessed using vegetation indices and greenspace percentages. Cox regressions and generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze associations between greenness and dyslipidemia outcomes. Over a median follow-up period of 3.21 years, 744,732 cases of dyslipidemia were observed. Greener environments were associated with a reduced risk of dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperbetalipoproteinemia (hazard ratios ranged from 0.82 to 0.96) and an increased risk of hypoalphalipoproteinemia (hazard ratios were 1.12 to 1.15). Higher greenness levels were linked to lower serum lipids. These associations were stronger among older adults and those with higher education. Mediation analyses showed that lower air pollution, temperature, and higher physical activity accounted for 2.08–33.72% of the associations between greenness and dyslipidemia.

Kaushal,Disentangling the Effects of Global and Regional Drivers on Diverse Long‐Term pH Trends in Coastal Waters,"Unlike declines of pH in the open ocean on the total scale (pHT), coastal systems have shown complex long‐term trends in pHT due to a multitude of global and regional drivers. These drivers include changes in nutrient loading, human‐accelerated chemical weathering of watersheds, acid‐rain and land‐use changes, and ocean acidification due to atmospheric CO2 increase. We lack understanding of how these co‐occurring processes have influenced long‐term pHT changes in coastal waters. To address this knowledge gap, a coupled hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical‐carbonate chemistry model was used to conduct a hindcast simulation and scenario analyses of carbonate chemistry in the Chesapeake Bay between 1951 and 2010. Trend analysis reveals increasing pHT in the upper Bay due to river alkalinization but decreasing pHT in the bottom waters of the mid‐and lower Bay due to ocean acidification. No trend is detected in the surface waters of the mid‐ and lower Bay due to competition between the two drivers. The effect of river alkalinization on the acidic volume in the estuary is twice that of ocean acidification. Our findings show that river alkalinization provides an important buffer against acidification while eutrophication plays a secondary role. Our results also suggest ocean alkalinity enhancement could be effective in mitigating acidification in coastal waters."

A detailed quantitative comparison between observed and calculated microburst durations shows consistent ranges and similar correlations with L $L$ shell and magnetic local time (MLT). The most apparent trend is in MLT: microburst duration increases from midnight through the dawn sector but decreases after noon. These results highlight the primary role of chorus waves in driving microbursts. Furthermore, we build a constraint on the upper magnetic latitude boundary λ2 $\left({\lambda }_{2}\right)$ of chorus waves that can induce 1 MeV microbursts. The constraint is dependent on MLT. On the dayside, the optimal λ2 ${\lambda }_{2}$ typically exceeds 36° $36{}^{\circ}$, which is higher than on the nightside, suggesting ducted chorus propagation dominates.

A model trained on high‐resolution flow and concentration measurements from few locations accurately reconstructed nutrient concentration time‐series and annual loads at target sites spanning the Midwest region of the US. Optimal sampling times occurred in spring, while sampling locations were distributed across catchment area and flow.

Based on a large data set of manually identified shock crossings by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft, we present clear evidence that the enlarged bow shock location depends on the underlying crustal magnetic field location. This dependence is more pronounced for near subsolar shocks but becomes more dispersed for near terminator shocks. On average, the enlarged shocks are shifted tailward relative to the strongest crustal field location. These observations suggest that the mini‐magnetospheres formed by crustal fields can protrude beyond the induced magnetopause and stretch tailward, thereby shifting the enlarged Martian bow shock location."

However, current state‐of‐art microphysics schemes typically only consider the vertical motion of raindrops, ultimately failing to accurately simulate the collisional outcomes of raindrops and the associated raindrop size distributions (RSDs) under strong winds. For instance, the original bin microphysics scheme was unable to successfully reproduced the evolution of RSDs with decreasing height, as measured from the multi‐layer observations during the landfall of Typhoon Pakhar (2017). Thus, this study introduces a modified bin microphysics scheme that incorporates the influence of horizontal wind speeds, vertical wind shear and smaller‐scale turbulence on the total movement velocity (including horizontal and vertical components) of raindrops, and consequently on their collisional outcomes.

 Neuroimmune interactions—signals transmitted between immune and brain cells—regulate many aspects of tissue physiology1, including responses to psychological stress2–5, which can predispose individuals to develop neuropsychiatric diseases6–9. Still, the interactions between haematopoietic and brain-resident cells that influence complex behaviours are poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of genomic and behavioural screens to show that astrocytes in the amygdala limit stress-induced fear behaviour through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mechanistically, EGFR expression in amygdala astrocytes inhibits a stress-induced, pro-inflammatory signal-transduction cascade that facilitates neuron–glial crosstalk and stress-induced fear behaviour through the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F2 in amygdala neurons. In turn, decreased EGFR signalling and fear behaviour are associated with the recruitment of meningeal monocytes during chronic stress. This set of neuroimmune interactions is therapeutically targetable through the administration of psychedelic compounds, which reversed the accumulation of monocytes in the brain meninges along with fear behaviour. Together with validation in clinical samples, these data suggest that psychedelics can be used to target neuroimmune interactions relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and potentially other inflammatory diseases. Inflammatory monocytes in the brain meninges promote stress-induced fear behaviour, and the pathways involved can be modulated using psychedelic compounds."

 Several hydrogen-rich superconductors have been found to show unprecedentedly high critical temperatures1–4, stimulating investigations into the nature of the superconductivity in these materials. Although their macroscopic superconducting properties are established1,5–7, microscopic insights into the pairing mechanism remains unclear. Here we characterize the superconducting gap structure in the high-temperature superconductor H3S and its deuterium counterpart D3S by performing tunnelling spectroscopy measurements. The tunnelling spectra reveal that H3S and D3S both have a fully gapped structure, which could be well described by a single s-wave Dynes model, with gap values 2Δ of approximately 60 meV and 44 meV, respectively. Furthermore, we observed gap features of another likely H-depleted HxS superconducting phase in a poorly synthesized hydrogen sulfide sample. Our work offers direct experimental evidence for superconductivity in the hydrogen-rich superconductor H3S from a microscopic perspective. It validates the phonon-mediated mechanism of superconducting pairing and provides a foundation for further understanding the origins of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds.

 Will it ever be possible to sue anyone for damaging the climate? Twenty years after this question was first posed, we argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed. Here we detail the scientific and legal implications of an ‘end-to-end’ attribution that links fossil fuel producers to specific damages from warming. Using scope 1 and 3 emissions data from major fossil fuel companies, peer-reviewed attribution methods and advances in empirical climate economics, we illustrate the trillions in economic losses attributable to the extreme heat caused by emissions from individual companies. Emissions linked to Chevron, the highest-emitting investor-owned company in our data, for example, very likely caused between US $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses over the period 1991–2020, disproportionately harming the tropical regions least culpable for warming. More broadly, we outline a transparent, reproducible and flexible framework that formalizes how end-to-end attribution could inform litigation by assessing whose emissions are responsible and for which harms. Drawing quantitative linkages between individual emitters and particularized harms is now feasible, making science no longer an obstacle to the justiciability of climate liability claims.

 Intrinsically disordered regions within proteins drive specific molecular functions despite lacking a defined structure1,2. Although disordered regions are integral to controlling mRNA stability and translation, the mechanisms underlying these regulatory effects remain unclear3. Here we reveal the molecular determinants of this activity using high-throughput functional profiling. Systematic mutagenesis across hundreds of regulatory disordered elements, combined with machine learning, reveals a complex pattern of molecular features important for their activity. The presence and arrangement of aromatic residues strongly predicts the ability of seemingly diverse protein sequences to influence mRNA stability and translation. We further show how many of these regulatory elements exert their effects by engaging core mRNA decay machinery.

 Environmental thermal challenges trigger the brain to coordinate both autonomic and behavioural responses to maintain optimal body temperature1–4. It is unknown how temperature information is precisely stored and retrieved in the brain and how it is converted into a physiological response. Here we investigated whether memories could control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a thermal challenge. Mice were conditioned to associate a context with a specific temperature by combining thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning with engram-labelling technology, optogenetics and chemogenetics. We report that if mice are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a 4 °C cold challenge, they increase their metabolic rates regardless of the actual environmental temperature. Furthermore, we show that mice have increased hypothalamic activity when they are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory. Both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of cold-sensitive memory engrams in the hippocampus mimic the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. These ensembles are necessary for cold-memory retrieval. These findings show that retrieval of a cold memory causes whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis.

 Recent breakthroughs in ultrathin, single-crystalline, freestanding complex oxide systems have sparked industry interest in their potential for next-generation commercial devices1,2. However, the mass production of these ultrathin complex oxide membranes has been hindered by the challenging requirement of inserting an artificial release layer between the epilayers and substrates3,4. Here we introduce a technique that achieves atomic precision lift-off of ultrathin membranes without artificial release layers to facilitate the high-throughput production of scalable, ultrathin, freestanding perovskite systems. Leveraging both theoretical insights and empirical evidence, we have identified the pivotal role of lead in weakening the interface. This insight has led to the creation of a universal exfoliation strategy that enables the production of diverse ultrathin perovskite membranes less than 10 nm. Our pyroelectric membranes demonstrate a record-high pyroelectric coefficient of 1.76 × 10−2 C m−2 K−1, attributed to their exceptionally low thickness and freestanding nature. Moreover, this method offers an approach to manufacturing cooling-free detectors that can cover the full far-infrared spectrum, marking a notable advancement in detector technology5.

 Glacial cycles significantly influenced Earth’s surface processes throughout the Quaternary, impacting the climate, sea level, and seismic and magmatic activity1–3. However, the effects of glaciation and deglaciation (that is, glacial forcing) on lithospheric motion are unknown. To study these effects, we formulated high-resolution numerical models with realistic lithospheric structures, including weak plate margins, lithospheric thickness variations and crustal structure. Our results show that glacial forcing significantly altered lithospheric motion and the spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges situated near major ice sheets in the last glacial cycle. For example, deglaciation-induced motion in the North American plate had a rotational part that was up to around 25% of its tectonic plate motion over 10,000-year timescales. The deglaciation in Greenland and Fennoscandia caused up to 40% fluctuations in the spreading rates of the Iceland Ridge between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago, which may explain the Holocene volcanism in Iceland. Our modelling also indicates increased (decreased) rates of global sea-floor production during the deglaciation (glaciation) periods with implications for mantle degassing rates. These results underscore the critical dynamic interplay between glacial cycles, lithospheric motion, ridge spreading and climate during ice ages.

 Recent advances in quantum communications have underscored the crucial role of optical coherence in developing quantum networks. This resource, which is fundamental to the phase-based architecture of the quantum internet1, has enabled the only successful demonstrations of multi-node quantum networks2–4 and substantially extended the range of quantum key distribution (QKD)5. However, the scalability of coherence-based quantum protocols remains uncertain owing to the specialized hardware required, such as ultra-stable optical cavities and cryogenic photon detectors. Here we implement the coherence-based twin-field QKD protocol over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network spanning between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany, achieving encryption key distribution at 110 bits per second. Our results are enabled by a scalable approach to optical coherence distribution, supported by a practical system architecture and non-cryogenic single-photon detection aided by off-band phase stabilization. Our results demonstrate repeater-like quantum communication in an operational network setting, doubling the distance for practical real-world QKD implementations without cryogenic cooling. In addition, to our knowledge, we realized one of the largest QKD networks featuring measurement-device-independent properties6.

 Acute myocardial infarction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Clinical studies have shown that the severity of cardiac injury after myocardial infarction exhibits a circadian pattern, with larger infarcts and poorer outcomes in patients experiencing morning-onset events2–7. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diurnal variations remain unclear. Here we show that the core circadian transcription factor BMAL17–11 regulates circadian-dependent myocardial injury by forming a transcriptionally active heterodimer with a non-canonical partner—hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A)12–16—in a diurnal manner. To substantiate this finding, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, revealing structural rearrangements within BMAL1 that enable cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling. BMAL1 modulates the circadian hypoxic response by enhancing the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and stabilizing the HIF2A protein. We further identified amphiregulin (AREG)16,17 as a rhythmic target of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex, critical for regulating daytime variations of myocardial injury. Pharmacologically targeting the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway provides cardioprotection, with maximum efficacy when aligned with the pathway’s circadian phase. These findings identify a mechanism governing circadian variations of myocardial injury and highlight the therapeutic potential of clock-based pharmacological interventions for treating ischaemic heart disease.

 The coupling between electrons and phonons is one of the fundamental interactions in solids, underpinning a wide range of phenomena, such as resistivity, heat conductivity and superconductivity. However, direct measurements of this coupling for individual phonon modes remain a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce a new technique for mapping phonon dispersions and electron–phonon coupling (EPC) in van der Waals (vdW) materials. By generalizing the quantum twisting microscope1 (QTM) to cryogenic temperatures, we demonstrate its capability to map not only electronic dispersions through elastic momentum-conserving tunnelling but also phononic dispersions through inelastic momentum-conserving tunnelling. Crucially, the inelastic tunnelling strength provides a direct and quantitative measure of the momentum and mode-resolved EPC. We use this technique to measure the phonon spectrum and EPC of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with twist angles larger than 6°. Notably, we find that, unlike standard acoustic phonons, whose coupling to electrons diminishes as their momentum tends to zero, TBG exhibits a low-energy mode whose coupling increases with decreasing twist angle. We show that this unusual coupling arises from the modulation of the interlayer tunnelling by a layer-antisymmetric ‘phason’ mode of the moiré system. The technique demonstrated here opens the way for examining a large variety of other neutral collective modes that couple to electronic tunnelling, including plasmons2, magnons3 and spinons4 in quantum materials.

 Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) involves the gradual expansion of mutant pre-leukaemic haematopoietic cells, which increases with age and confers a risk for multiple diseases, including leukaemia and immune-related conditions1. Although the absolute risk of leukaemic transformation in individuals with CHIP is very low, the strongest predictor of progression is the accumulation of mutant haematopoietic cells2. Despite the known associations between CHIP and increased all-cause mortality, our understanding of environmental and regulatory factors that underlie this process during ageing remains rudimentary. Here we show that intestinal alterations, which can occur with age, lead to systemic dissemination of a microbial metabolite that promotes pre-leukaemic cell expansion. Specifically, ADP-d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose), a biosynthetic bi-product specific to Gram-negative bacteria3–5, is uniquely found in the circulation of older individuals and favours the expansion of pre-leukaemic cells. ADP-heptose is also associated with increased inflammation and cardiovascular risk in CHIP. Mechanistically, ADP-heptose binds to its receptor, ALPK1, triggering transcriptional reprogramming and NF-κB activation that endows pre-leukaemic cells with a competitive advantage due to excessive clonal proliferation. Collectively, we identify that the accumulation of ADP-heptose represents a direct link between ageing and expansion of rare pre-leukaemic cells, suggesting that the ADP-heptose–ALPK1 axis is a promising therapeutic target to prevent progression of CHIP to overt leukaemia and immune-related conditions.

 Beneath oceanic spreading centres, the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) acts as a permeability barrier that focuses the delivery of melt from deep within the mantle towards the spreading axis1. At intermediate-spreading to fast-spreading ridge crests, the multichannel seismic reflection technique has imaged a nearly flat, 1–2-km-wide axial magma lens (AML)2 that defines the uppermost section of the LAB3, but the nature of the LAB deeper into the crust has been more elusive, with some clues gained from tomographic images, providing only a diffuse view of a wider halo of lower-velocity material seated just beneath the AML4. Here we present 3D seismic reflection images of the LAB extending deep (5–6 km) into the crust beneath Axial volcano, located at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Cobb–Eickelberg hotspot. The 3D shape of the LAB, which is coincident with a thermally controlled magma assimilation front, focuses hotspot-related and mid-ocean-spreading-centre-related magmatism towards the centre of the volcano, controlling both eruption and hydrothermal processes and the chemical composition of erupted lavas5. In this context, the LAB can be viewed as the upper surface of a ‘magma domain’, a volume within which melt bodies reside (replacing the concept of a single ‘magma reservoir’)6. Our discovery of a funnel-shaped, crustal LAB suggests that thermally controlled magma assimilation could be occurring along this surface at other volcanic systems, such as Iceland. 3D seismic reflection images of the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary beneath Axial volcano show a magma assimilation front that focuses magmatism towards the centre of the volcano, controlling both eruption and hydrothermal processes."

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subsists in a nutrient-deregulated microenvironment, making it particularly susceptible to treatments that interfere with cancer metabolism1,2. For example, PDAC uses, and is dependent on, high levels of autophagy and other lysosomal processes3–5. Although targeting these pathways has shown potential in preclinical studies, progress has been hampered by the difficulty in identifying and characterizing favourable targets for drug development6. Here, we characterize PIKfyve, a lipid kinase that is integral to lysosomal functioning7, as a targetable vulnerability in PDAC. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we established that PIKfyve is essential to PDAC progression. Furthermore, through comprehensive metabolic analyses, we found that PIKfyve inhibition forces PDAC to upregulate a distinct transcriptional and metabolic program favouring de novo lipid synthesis. In PDAC, the KRAS–MAPK signalling pathway is a primary driver of de novo lipid synthesis. Accordingly, simultaneously targeting PIKfyve and KRAS–MAPK resulted in the elimination of the tumour burden in numerous preclinical human and mouse models. Taken together, these studies indicate that disrupting lipid metabolism through PIKfyve inhibition induces synthetic lethality in conjunction with KRAS–MAPK-directed therapies for PDAC.

 Mendel1 studied in detail seven pairs of contrasting traits in pea (Pisum sativum), establishing the foundational principles of genetic inheritance. Here we investigate the genetic architecture that underlies these traits and uncover previously undescribed alleles for the four characterized Mendelian genes2–7, including a rare revertant of Mendel’s white-flowered a allele. Primarily, we focus on the three remaining uncharacterized traits and find that (1) an approximately 100-kb genomic deletion upstream of the Chlorophyll synthase (ChlG) gene disrupts chlorophyll biosynthesis through the generation of intergenic transcriptional fusion products, conferring the yellow pod phenotype of gp mutants; (2) a MYB gene with an upstream Ogre element insertion and a CLE peptide-encoding gene with an in-frame premature stop codon explain the v and p alleles, which disrupt secondary cell wall thickening and lignification, resulting in the parchmentless, edible-pod phenotype; and (3) a 5-bp exonic deletion in a CIK-like co-receptor kinase gene, in combination with a genetic modifier locus, is associated with the fasciated stem (fa) phenotype. Furthermore, we characterize genes and alleles associated with diverse agronomic traits, such as axil ring anthocyanin pigmentation, seed size and the ‘semi-leafless’ form. This study establishes a foundation for fundamental research, education in biology and genetics, and pea breeding practices.

 Understanding the human de novo mutation (DNM) rate requires complete sequence information1. Here using five complementary short-read and long-read sequencing technologies, we phased and assembled more than 95% of each diploid human genome in a four-generation, twenty-eight-member family (CEPH 1463). We estimate 98–206 DNMs per transmission, including 74.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants, 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 65.3 de novo indels or structural variants originating from tandem repeats, and 4.4 centromeric DNMs. Among male individuals, we find 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. Short tandem repeats and variable-number tandem repeats are the most mutable, with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75–81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 16% of de novo single-nucleotide variants are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias, including early germline mosaic mutations. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map (~3.4 kb breakpoint resolution) and find no correlation between meiotic crossover and de novo structural variants. These near-telomere-to-telomere familial genomes provide a truth set to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.

 Somatosensory neurons encode detailed information about touch and temperature and are the peripheral drivers of pain1,2. Here by combining functional imaging with multiplexed in situ hybridization3, we determined how heat and mechanical stimuli are encoded across neuronal classes and how inflammation transforms this representation to induce heat hypersensitivity, mechanical allodynia and continuing pain. Our data revealed that trigeminal neurons innervating the cheek exhibited complete segregation of responses to gentle touch and heat. By contrast, heat and noxious mechanical stimuli broadly activated nociceptor classes, including cell types proposed to trigger select percepts and behaviours4–6. Injection of the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 caused long-lasting activity and thermal sensitization in select classes of nociceptors, providing a cellular basis for continuing inflammatory pain and heat hypersensitivity. We showed that the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 (ref. 7) has a central role in heat sensitization but not in spontaneous nociceptor activity. Unexpectedly, the responses to mechanical stimuli were minimally affected by inflammation, suggesting that tactile allodynia results from the continuing firing of nociceptors coincident with touch. Indeed, we have demonstrated that nociceptor activity is both necessary and sufficient for inflammatory tactile allodynia. Together, these findings refine models of sensory coding and discrimination at the cellular and molecular levels, demonstrate that touch and temperature are broadly but differentially encoded across transcriptomically distinct populations of sensory cells and provide insight into how cellular-level responses are reshaped by inflammation to trigger diverse aspects of pain.

 Patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer often succumb to systemic metastases1–3; however, the transcriptomic heterogeneity that underlies therapeutic recalcitrance remains understudied, particularly in a spatial context. Here we construct high-resolution maps of lineage states, clonal architecture and the tumour microenvironment (TME) using spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number variations in primary and metastatic loci in each patient highlight diverse patient-specific evolutionary trajectories and clonal dissemination. We show that multiple tumour lineage states co-exist in each tissue, including concurrent metastatic foci in the same organ. Agnostic to tissue site, lineage states correlate with distinct TME features, such as the spatial proximity of TGFB1-expressing myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) to aggressive ‘basal-like’ cancer cells, but not to cells in the ‘classical’ or ‘intermediate’ states. These findings were validated through orthogonal and cross-species analyses using mouse tissues and patient-derived organoids. Notably, basal-like cancer cells aligned with myCAFs correlate with plasma-cell exclusion from the tumour milieu, and neighbouring cell analyses suggest that CXCR4–CXCL12 signalling is the underlying basis for observed immune exclusion. Collectively, our findings underscore the profound transcriptomic heterogeneity and microenvironmental dynamics that characterize treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer.

 The maritime Phoenician civilization from the Levant transformed the entire Mediterranean during the first millennium bce1–3. However, the extent of human movement between the Levantine Phoenician homeland and Phoenician–Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean has been unclear in the absence of comprehensive ancient DNA studies. Here, we generated genome-wide data for 210 individuals, including 196 from 14 sites traditionally identified as Phoenician and Punic in the Levant, North Africa, Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and Ibiza, and an early Iron Age individual from Algeria. Levantine Phoenicians made little genetic contribution to Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean between the sixth and second centuries bce, despite abundant archaeological evidence of cultural, historical, linguistic and religious links4. Instead, these inheritors of Levantine Phoenician culture derived most of their ancestry from a genetic profile similar to that of Sicily and the Aegean. Much of the remaining ancestry originated from North Africa, reflecting the growing influence of Carthage5. However, this was a minority contributor of ancestry in all of the sampled sites, including in Carthage itself. Different Punic sites across the central and western Mediterranean show similar patterns of high genetic diversity. We also detect genetic relationships across the Mediterranean, reflecting shared demographic processes that shaped the Punic world.

 Understanding the relationship between antibiotic use and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is vital for effective antibiotic stewardship. Yet, animal models and in vitro experiments poorly replicate real-world conditions1. To explain how resistance evolves in vivo, we exposed 60 human participants to ciprofloxacin and used longitudinal stool samples and a new computational method to assemble the genomes of 5,665 populations of commensal bacterial species within participants. Analysis of 2.3 million polymorphic sequence variants revealed 513 populations that underwent selective sweeps. We found convergent evolution focused on DNA gyrase and evidence of dispersed selective pressure at other genomic loci. Roughly 10% of susceptible bacterial populations evolved towards resistance through sweeps that involved substitutions at a specific amino acid in gyrase. The evolution of gyrase was associated with large populations that decreased in relative abundance during exposure. Sweeps persisted for more than 10 weeks in most cases and were not projected to revert within a year. Targeted amplification showed that gyrase mutations arose de novo within the participants and exhibited no measurable fitness cost. These findings revealed that brief ciprofloxacin exposure drives the evolution of resistance in gut commensals, with mutations persisting long after exposure. This study underscores the capacity of the human gut to promote the evolution of resistance and identifies key genomic and ecological factors that shape bacterial adaptation in vivo.

 Bridge-like lipid-transport proteins (BLTPs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that localize to membrane-contact sites and are thought to mediate the bulk transfer of lipids from a donor membrane, typically the endoplasmic reticulum, to an acceptor membrane, such as that of the cell or an organelle1. Although BLTPs are fundamentally important for a wide array of cellular functions, their architecture, composition and lipid-transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here we present the subunit composition and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel of which the interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, one of which we have named Spigot and the other of which remains unnamed. Spigot interacts with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids are expected to enter the tunnel, and experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot has a conserved role in BLTP function. Our LPD-3 complex structural data reveal protein–lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3 complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provides a foundation for mechanistic studies of BLTPs.

 Earth’s atmosphere underwent permanent oxidation during the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.45–2.22 billion years ago (Ga) due to excess oxygen (O2) generated by marine cyanobacteria. However, understanding the timing and tempo of seawater oxygenation before the Great Oxidation Event has been hindered by the absence of sensitive tracers. Nitrogen (N) isotopes can be an indicator of marine oxygenation. Here we present an ~200 Myr nitrogen isotope oscillation recorded by Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic banded iron formations from the Hamersley Basin, Western Australia, that were deposited in relatively deep marine shelf environments. Paired with the Jeerinah Formation shale record, our data from the Marra Mamba Iron Formation suggest that oxic conditions expanded to banded iron formation depositional environments from ~2.63 to 2.60 Ga. Subsequently, a positive δ15N excursion occurred in the ~2.48 Ga Dale Gorge Member, marking a decline in seawater O2 and enhanced denitrification. This O2 deficit was followed by a second phase of increasing O2 levels as indicated by a gradual return to moderately positive δ15N values in the ~2.46 Ga Joffre Member and 2.45 Ga Weeli Wolli Iron Formation. These variations underscore a nonlinear history of marine oxygenation and reveal a previously unrecognized oscillation in seawater O2 levels preceding the Great Oxidation Event.

Here, the authors employ cryo-EM, fluorescent microscopy, and AlphaFold modelling to propose how a rotary mechanism of CpaF catalysis drives Tad pilus assembly. 
 The type IV pilus family uses PilT/VirB11-like ATPases to rapidly assemble and disassemble pilin subunits. Among these, the tight adherence (Tad) pilus performs both functions using a single bifunctional ATPase, CpaF. Here, we determine three conformationally distinct structures of CpaF hexamers with varying nucleotide occupancies by cryo-electron microscopy. Analysis of these structures suggest ATP binding and hydrolysis expand and rotate the hexamer pore clockwise while subsequent ADP release contracts the ATPase. Truncation of the intrinsically disordered region of CpaF in Caulobacter crescentus equally reduces pilus extension and retraction events observed using fluorescence microscopy, but does not reduce ATPase activity. AlphaFold3 modeling suggests that CpaF and other motors of the type IV filament superfamily employ conserved secondary structural features to engage their respective platform proteins. From these data, we propose that CpaF uses a clockwise, rotary mechanism of catalysis to assemble a right-handed, helical Tad pilus, a process broadly applicable to other single motor systems.

 The discovery of N6-methyladenine (6mA) in eukaryotic genomes, typically found in prokaryotic DNA, has revolutionized epigenetics. Here, we show that symmetric 6mA is essential in the early diverging fungus Rhizopus microsporus, as the absence of the MT-A70 complex (MTA1c) responsible for this modification results in a lethal phenotype. 6mA is present in 70% of the genes, correlating with the presence of H3K4me3 and H2A.Z in open euchromatic regions. This modification is found predominantly in nucleosome linker regions, influencing the nucleosome positioning around the transcription start sites of highly expressed genes. Controlled downregulation of MTA1c reduces symmetric 6mA sites affecting nucleosome positioning and histone modifications, leading to altered gene expression, which is likely the cause of the severe phenotypic changes observed. Our study highlights the indispensable role of the DNA 6mA in a multicellular organism and delineates the mechanisms through which this epigenetic mark regulates gene expression in a eukaryotic genome.

 Biological membranes are intrinsically dynamic entities that continually adapt their biophysical properties and molecular organisation to support cellular function. Current microscopy techniques can derive high-resolution structural information of labelled molecules but quantifying the associated viscoelastic behaviour with nanometre precision remains challenging. Here, we develop an approach based on atomic force microscopy in conjunction with fast nano-actuators to map the viscoelastic response of unlabelled supported membranes with nanometre spatial resolution. On fluid membranes, we show that the method can quantify local variations in the molecular mobility of the lipids and derive a diffusion coefficient. We confirm our experimental approach with molecular dynamics simulations, also highlighting the role played by the water at the interface with the membrane on the measurement. Probing ternary model bilayers reveals spatial correlations in the local diffusion over distances of ≈20 nm within liquid disordered domains. This lateral correlation is enhanced in native bovine lens membranes, where the inclusion of protein-rich domains induces four-fold variations in the diffusion coefficient across < 100 nm of the fluid regions, consistent with biological function. Our findings suggest that diffusion is highly localised in fluid biomembranes. The viscoelasticity of fluid membranes is challenging to quantify with nanometre precision.

 Wildfires cause large damage to natural and human systems. Despite the clear connection between human-induced climate change and increased fire weather risk, a global, systematic attribution of observed extreme fires to human-induced climate change is lacking. Here, we address this gap by first linking observed regional weekly burned area extremes (>85th percentile) to the fire weather index (FWI) during the fire seasons of 2002–2015 via a logistic regression model, and then using simulations from climate models to quantify the impact of human-induced climate change. Focusing on regions with good predictability of the statistical model, we find that human-induced climate change was responsible for a fraction equal to 8% (±4%, standard deviation across climate models) of the predicted probability of more than 700 regional fire extremes on average, thereby increasing the probability of experiencing a fire extreme across 15 out of 19 analysed regions. While higher temperature is the main driver of the increased fire extreme probability, shifts in precipitation, relative humidity, and/or wind speed substantially modulated fire changes across many regions. Mainly because of warming, the probability of extreme fires attributable to human-induced climate change increased by 5.2%/decade globally over 2002–2015, in line with an acceleration of the climate-driven enhancement of fire extremes over the last decades that may continue in the near future. These findings highlight the urgent need for sustainable fire management strategies."

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an important indicator of photosynthetic capacity. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is an optical signal emitted from the leaf interior, providing a unique technique for accurately estimating LCC. The far-red to red ratio of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fratio) has been used to empirically estimate LCC in some previous studies. While these studies support the use of the Fratio for LCC estimation, its theoretical underpinning remains less well-defined and its effectiveness across a wider range of scenarios remains unclear. In this study, we established the relationship between the Fratio and LCC using the light use efficiency (LUE)-based SIF model and spectral invariant radiative transfer theory. Firstly, the LUE-based SIF model demonstrates that the change in the leaf Fratio is controlled by the ratio of the fluorescence escape fraction (i.e., fesc from the photosystem to the leaf surface) at the corresponding bands. Secondly, a fesc modeling approach is presented using the spectral invariant theory and thus the fesc ratio is linked to LCC. Theoretical analysis shows that the Fratio has a strong correlation with LCC, which explains over 90 % of the variation in Fratio. Both experimental measurements and model simulations from a radiative transfer model Fluspect were used to validate the relationship between LCC and three Fratio (i.e., Fratio↑, Fratio↓ and Fratiotot), which were derived from the upward and downward SIF of leaves, as well as the total SIF observed from both sides. The Fluspect simulations were used to assess the sensitivity of the Fratio-LCC relationship to the leaf structure. Two types of experimental measurements, including the field measurements of three crops and the laboratory measurements of 20 tundra plants, were employed to examine the species dependence of the Fratio-LCC relationship. The performance of Fratio for LCC estimation was evaluated and compared with spectral indices and the PROSPECT model using the experimental measurements and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. Both the Fluspect simulations and the experimental measurements indicate that the Fratio is strongly correlated with LCC for a wide range of leaf scenarios. The Fratio-LCC relationship remains relatively stable across different leaf structures and plant species, since the relationship is almost consistent. The LOOCV of experimental measurements shows that the Fratio provides promising and robust LCC estimates, with the Fratiotot performing the best. The Fratiotot outperforms spectral indices, reducing the RMSE for LCC estimation by 19.5 %–93.9 %. Furthermore, compared to the PROSPECT model, the Fratio achieves a reduction in RMSE by 30.4 %–77.8 %. These results demonstrate that the Fratio is effective for estimating LCC of diverse plant species. This study advances our understanding of the relationship between the Fratio and LCC, supporting the use of SIF signals for remote sensing of LCC."

 The construction of wind-sensitive structures in the Tibetan Plateau requires detailed information about the near-ground wind. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), one-month numerical investigations on the boundary-layer wind and temperature were conducted considering the Yarlung Zangbo River Valley in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau. By comparing with site observation, WRF has proved accurate in surface winds over highly complex terrain using a relatively coarse grid. Range analysis is applied to compare model parameters including four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) option, reanalysis data, and planetary boundary layer scheme. FDDA option has the strongest impact on wind results. The combination of grid-point data nudging, high-precision reanalysis data, and Quasi–normal Scale Elimination Scheme is recommended. Typical valley wind is observed and successfully simulated, characterized by a diurnal change of near-ground wind and temperature. Stronger winds and neutral air occur around sunset, while weaker winds and stable air appear near sunrise. The wind direction is restricted along the valley. Strong synoptic weather events disturb the local climate, minimize the terrain effects, and produce uniform winds and temperatures.

 Land surface models (LSMs) play a crucial role in the characterization of land-atmosphere interactions by providing boundary conditions to a regional climate model (RCM). This is particularly true over the Iberian Peninsula (IP), a region where a water-limited regime governs most of the territory. This work aims to optimize the Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP) configuration for characterizing heat fluxes in the IP when the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.9.1 is used as RCM. To do that, a set of 70 experiments with a 1-year length has been completed using 35 combinations of Noah-MP parameterizations, both for a year with dry conditions in the IP (2005 year) and for a year with wet conditions (2010 year). Land surface heat fluxes and soil moisture simulated with Noah-MP coupled to WRF (WRF/Noah-MP) have been evaluated using as reference the available FLUXNET station data and CERRA-Land reanalysis data. In general, the results indicate that WRF/Noah-MP accurately simulates soil moisture and surface heat fluxes over the IP, especially for wetter climate conditions. The clustering method has presented an optimal configuration from 10 groups (Clusters from A to J), which showed that the WRF/Noah-MP parameterizations with the greatest influence on the simulation of surface heat fluxes over the IP are canopy stomatal resistance (CRS), surface exchange coefficient for heat (SFC), soil moisture factor controlling stomatal resistance (BTR), runoff and groundwater (RUN), and surface resistance to evaporation/sublimation (RSF). In addition, dynamic vegetation (DVEG) seems to influence simulations. Although several clusters/configurations showed reasonable results, experiment s27I in Cluster I with Jarvis CRS, Chen97 SFC, CLM-Type BTR, BATS RUN, and Adjusted Sellers to decrease RSURF for wet soil for RSF seem to be more adequate to simulate surface heat fluxes in the IP."

Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing also revealed neonatal Tregcells with an immunomodulatory signature distinct from adult. Neonatal Tregcell ablation resulted in a dysregulated immune response, failed tenocyte recruitment, and impaired regeneration. Adoptive transfer further confirmed the unique capacity of neonatal Tregcells to rescue functional regeneration.

SM/J mice, a poor healer inbred strain, presented a high incidence of age-associated lumbar disc herniations with neurovascular innervations. Transcriptomic comparisons of the SM/J annulus fibrosus with human tissues showed shared pathways related to immune cell activation and inflammation. Notably, aged SM/J mice showed increased pain sensitization and neuroinflammation with altered extracellular matrix regulation in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord. There were increased T cells in the vertebral marrow, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis showed increased splenic CD8+ T cells, nonspecific activation of CD8+ memory T cells, and enhanced interferon-γ production in the myeloid compartment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed more B cells, with lower proportions of T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes.

Thus, we hypothesized that this cell type also exhibits regional adaptations in dendritic signal processing and that these adaptations are advantageous for prey capture. Here, we measured dendritic signals from individual sONα RGCs at different retinal locations. We measured both postsynaptic Ca2+signals at dendrites and presynaptic glutamate signals from bipolar cells (BCs). We found that temporal sONα RGCs exhibit, in addition to sustained-ON signals with only weak surrounds, signals with strong surround suppression, which were not present in nasal sONα RGCs. This difference was also present in the presynaptic inputs from BCs. Last, using population models in an encoder-decoder paradigm, we showed that these adaptations might be beneficial for detecting crickets in hunting behavior."

We show that intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regulates axoplasmic viscosity and protein aggregation in mammalian neurons. Decreased intracellular ATP upon mitochondrial inhibition leads to axoterminal cytosol, synaptic vesicles, and active zone component condensation, modulating the functional organization of mouse glutamatergic synapses. Proteins involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) condensed and underwent ATP-dependent liquid phase separation in vitro. Human inducible pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons from patients with PD and ALS displayed reduced axoplasmic fluidity and decreased intracellular ATP. Last, nicotinamide mononucleotide treatment successfully rescued intracellular ATP levels and axoplasmic viscosity in neurons from patients with PD and ALS and reduced TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation in human motor neurons derived from a patient with ALS.

Elucidating the genetic underpinnings has been challenging owing to limitations with cellular models. As SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models mimic therapeutic responses, we perform genetic screens in chemosensitive PDX models to identify drivers of chemoresistance. cDNA overexpression screens identifyMYC,MYCN, andMYCL, while CRISPR deletion screens identifyKEAP1loss as driving chemoresistance. Deletion ofKEAP1switched a chemosensitive SCLC PDX model to become chemoresistant and resulted in sensitivity to inhibition of glutamine metabolism. Data from the IMpower133 clinical trial revealed ~6% of patients with extensive-stage SCLC exhibitKEAP1genetic alterations, with activation of a KEAP1/NRF2 transcriptional signature associated with reduced survival upon chemotherapy treatment.

A conventional monitoring approach, which quantifies impacts based on conservation-relevant actions (i.e., numbers of live releases), implies that the program was successful: a 71 and 4% reduction in wedgefish and hammerhead shark mortality, respectively.

Tungsten-182 and helium-3 anomalies in volcanic rocks from deeply sourced mantle plumes have been attributed to core-mantle exchange. Hydrogen (H) is potentially abundant in the core. Therefore, H may also be a sensitive tracer of core-mantle exchange. We measured2H/1H ratios (reported as δD) in olivine-hosted basaltic melt inclusions from a Baffin Island lava to test whether mantle plumes contain H from the core. The average δD value (−144 ± 24 per mil) is lower than some estimates for the average depleted upper mantle (δD ≈ −60 ± 20 per mil). The low δD composition likely derives from isotopic diffusion or H leakage from the core, not isotopic fractionation during magmatism or crustal contamination.

SVs filled with neurotransmitters preferentially undergo exocytosis, but it is unclear how this is achieved. Here, we show that during transmitter loading, SVs substantially increase in size, which is reversible and requires synaptophysin, an abundant membrane protein with an unclear function. SVs are larger when synaptophysin is knocked out, and conversely, liposomes are smaller when reconstituted with synaptophysin. Moreover, transmitter loading of SVs accelerates fusion in vitro, which is abolished when synaptophysin is lacking despite near normal transmitter uptake. We conclude that synaptophysin functions as a curvature-promoting entity in the SV membrane, allowing for major lateral expansion of the SV membrane during neurotransmitter filling, thus increasing their propensity for exocytosis."

The chemical negative strain in the local-ordering BiSmFe2O6double-perovskite films can be regulated by oxygen engineering to cause the effectively tunable bandgap. We markedly increased the switchable open-circuit voltage to ~1.56 V from ~0.50 V for Pt/BiSmFe2O6/Nb-SrTiO3devices, which is the highest in single-layer perovskite-based ferroelectric photovoltaic perpendicular devices under white light-emitting diode irradiation. The multifield composite action mechanism reveals the electrical cause of the large open-circuit voltage. The synergy of the optical fields and ferroelectric fields provides the possibility of multilevel storage. Structural characterizations indicate that the chemical strain offers a dual role of lattice distortion and vacancy migration.

However, slab devolatilization during subduction could prevent carbon from entering the deep mantle. Boron isotopes are excellent tracers of recycled volatiles, but correlations between boron isotopes and mantle heterogeneity indicators are rarely observed, thereby casting doubt that substantial amounts of volatiles and boron can be recycled into the deep mantle. Here, we show that boron isotopes in two different types of primitive continental intraplate basalts correlate well with mantle heterogeneity indicators, indicating contributions of various subducted crustal components. A common high-δ11B component shared by both types of basalts is best explained as recycled subducted carbonate rather than serpentinite.

Here, we assessed the response of AMO to climate change in a brackish coastal wetland using a 5-year field manipulation of warming and elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2). Sulfate (SO42−)–dependent AMO (S-DAMO) was the predominant AMO process at our study site due to tidal inputs of SO42−. However, SO42−dynamics responded differently to the treatments; warming reduced SO42−concentration by enhancing SO42−reduction, whileeCO2increased SO42−concentration by enhancing SO42−regeneration. S-DAMO rates mirrored these trends, with warming decreasing S-DAMO rates andeCO2stimulating them. These findings underscore the potential of climate change to alter soil AMO activities through changing SO42−dynamics, highlighting the need to incorporate these processes in predictive models for more accurate representations of coastal wetland methane dynamics."

Almost all patients with synovial sarcoma (SS) carry a characteristic gene fusion, SS18::SSX, which produces a disease-specific oncoprotein that is incorporated into the switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes and profoundly alters their functionalities. Targeting epigenetic dependency in cancers holds promise for improving current treatment. Leveraging on cancer cell dependency dataset, pharmacological tools, and genomic profiling, we find WDR5, a factor critical for depositing histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, to be an unexplored vulnerability in SS. Mechanistically, WDR5 and SS18::SSX interact and colocalize at oncogenes where WDR5 promotes H3K4 methylation and the chromatin association of SS18::SSX-containing chromatin-remodeling complexes. WDR5 degradation by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) not only suppresses the SS18::SSX-related oncogenic programs but additionally causes the ribosomal protein deregulations leading to p53 activation.

Biomimetic designs mimicking the musculoskeletal structure have shown promise yet face difficulties in preserving key kinematic and mechanical principles while reducing system complexity. Here, we present a biomimetic finger design that preserves these principles through coordinated rigid-soft interplay, achieving structural and control simplicity for constructing dexterous robotic hands. Our design distills complex anatomical structures into skeletal mechanisms with regular geometrics, strategically deployed soft ligaments, and elastic tendon actuation, enabling controllable multi–degree-of-freedom dexterity while providing resilience and compliance. We establish mathematical models to analyze finger kinematics, rigid-soft interplay principles, and controllable actuation. Building on these models, we integrate biomimetic fingers with a thumb to develop an anthropomorphic robotic hand. Our robotic hand experimentally demonstrates remarkable dexterity and versatility across various tasks, including piano playing, power and pinch grasping, and in-hand manipulation, confirming the design effectiveness."

These limitations hinder their use as reprogrammable structural materials in real-life applications. Here, we introduce a reprogrammable origami integrating curved and straight bistable creases to address both challenges: attaining rigidity while allowing reversible remorphability into numerous load-bearing shapes and generating 3D curved-plate lattices, delivering in a prescribed configuration of fixed dimensions continuously tunable elastic moduli spanning two orders of magnitude. Leveraging curved origami theories, differential geometry, paperboard models, and experiments, we construct the folded pattern, formulate its geometric mechanics, and quantify its mechanical performance.

The synergy between memory and creative thought is well-established, but neural dynamics of memory integration for creativity are understudied. Here, we extended the traditional memory paradigm. Participants read, recalled narratives, and wrote endings. Computational linguistic analysis showed that those integrating more noncentral events—those less semantically connected to other events within the narrative—wrote more original endings. Analyzing fMRI data captured during narrative encoding, we discovered that story ending originality can be predicted by shared event representation across participants in the right Brodmann area 25 (BA25) and stronger hippocampal event segmentation signal during noncentral event encoding. These results held across different narrative types (i.e., crime, romance, and fantasy stories).

To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model. This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying mixed inputs. Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process.

It has been proposed that the molecular evolution of such pathways must have required each step to increase the capacity of its product to condense and order phospholipids. Here, we carry out a systematic analysis of the ergosterol pathway that leverages the yeast vacuole’s capacity to phase separate into ordered membrane domains. In the post-synthetic steps specific to ergosterol biosynthesis, we find that successive modifications act to oscillate ordering capacity, settling on a level that supports phase separation while retaining fluidity of the resulting domains. Simulations carried out with each intermediate showed how conformers in the sterol’s alkyl tail are capable of modulating long-range ordering of phospholipids, which could underlie changes in phase behavior. Our results indicate that the complexity of sterol metabolism could have resulted from the need to balance lipid interactions required for membrane organization."

Using single-molecule electrophysiology, we investigate the biophysical properties that distinguish VDAC2 from VDAC1 and VDAC3. Unlike the latter, VDAC2 exhibits dynamic switching between multiple high-conductance, anion-selective substates. Using α-synuclein (αSyn)—a known VDAC1 cytosolic regulator—we found that higher-conductance substates correlate with increased on-rates of αSyn-VDAC2 interaction but shorter blockage times, maintaining a consistent equilibrium constant across all substates. This suggests that αSyn detects VDAC2’s dynamic structural variations before final binding. We explored the dependence of VDAC2’s unique amino-terminal extension and cysteines on substate behavior, finding that both structural elements modulate substate occurrence. The discovered conformational flexibility enables VDAC2 recognition by diverse binding partners, explaining its critical physiological role via dynamical adaptation to mitochondrial metabolic conditions."

Yet, many people who are able to evacuate remain in place during environmental disasters. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events that require evacuation, such as flooding and wildfires, warrant closer study of why some communities do not evacuate. This study seeks to explore the social phenomenon of non-evacuation through two central questions: Why do some communities ‘stay put’ during environmental disasters? And, how do governments view the non-evacuation of these communities? Investigating these two questions together allows for the consideration of differences in how local communities and governments understand evacuation. Better understanding this contrast benefits the development of effective environmental disaster policy which relies on coordination between local communities and governments. We answer these research questions by comparing cases in Indonesia, the United States, and Japan. These cases provide examples of non-evacuation during three types of environmental disasters in distinct geographic, cultural, political contexts. This study analyzes multiple forms of qualitative data including academic publications, popular media, policy documents, interviews, and fieldnotes taken during participant observation. This study presents two key findings. First, local communities and governments often differently perceive how environmental disasters unfold over time. Second, social processes influence these contrasting orientations toward time, by focusing attention—or not—on particular events and attributing meaning to these events according to one’s social role. Differing orientations toward time help to explain contrasting expectations about evacuation.

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), consisting of actual photosynthetic activity, is closely related to gross primary productivity. However, it is unclear whether paddy rice yield can be effectively estimated by SIF. Here, we used a mechanistic light reaction (MLR) model and SIF data coupled with rice phenology and climate information to estimate net primary productivity (NPP). Subsequently, we used a harvest index (HI) based on absorbed photosynthetically active radiation data in combination with NPP to estimate paddy rice yield in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from 2001 to 2019. The results showed that the MLR model coupled with SIF was excellent in estimating crop yield, showing a high correlation between simulated and actual yield (R2 = 0.71 on average, P < 0.01). NPP rather than HI was the predominant factor influencing paddy rice yield. Photosynthetically active radiation presents a more pronounced effect on paddy rice yield (early and single rice) than that of air temperature and precipitation.

In this case study for Atlanta, GA, heat stress is predicted for 2019 transit riders (using transit rider activity survey data) and for three future climate scenarios, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, into the year 2100. The ThermoRoute Analyzer and TransitSim 4.0 models were applied to predict cumulative heat exposure and trip-level risk for 35 999 trip equivalents for an average Atlanta area weekday in the summer of 2019. The analyses show that under 2019 weather conditions, 8.33% of summer trips were estimated to be conducted under extreme heat. With the projected future climate conditions, the percentage of trips under extreme heat risk grows steadily. By 2100, 37.1%, 56.1%, and 76.4% are projected to be under extreme heat risk for low, medium, and high future climate projections (scenarios SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585), respectively.

This has sparked calls for modellers to expand their visions of sustainable futures. One suggested approach is post-growth, which shifts the focus of the economy from economic growth to ecological stability, equality, human well-being and enhanced democracy. In this review, we examine current post-growth scenario modelling approaches, spanning national to global scales and single-sector to whole-economy approaches, to identify best practices and key gaps in representing a post-growth transition. We develop a framework for evaluating these scenarios along five key dimensions of post-growth theorisation: feasible technological change, scale-down of harmful production, good life for all, wealth redistribution, and international justice. We then explore current approaches to post-growth scenario modelling, focusing on the types of models used, the mechanisms employed to simulate post-growth scenarios and the representation of post-growth policies. Finally, drawing on the wider post-growth literature, we offer recommendations for improving post-growth model representation, focusing on five main areas: the energy-economy connection, spatial differentiation, sectoral differentiation, the inclusion of different provisioning systems and feasibility considerations."

However, most metrics struggle to accurately represent temperature change across different time scales, especially in response to short-lived GHGs such as methane (CH4). GWP* has been developed as a more accurate climate metric, but it has implementation challenges, such as its misuse to create the false impression of climate neutrality. We propose a new metric, Sum44, the 44 year lagged cumulative sum of methane, that can accurately predict temperature change without the implementation challenges identified for GWP*. Here, we compare the performance of Sum44 and GWP* in projecting temperature change under various emissions scenarios. We perform these comparisons using strictly CH4 emissions scenarios, although other GHGs could be included in the future. We show that for the wide range of scenarios considered here, Sum44 is comparable to GWP* as a temperature indicator, and frequently outperforms it. Given this, we suggest that there are substantial implementation advantages to using Sum44 when considering policy controls to meet near-term climate change targets."

Projections of vulnerability drivers, such as income distribution, are needed for assessing future climate risk. In Europe, existing studies typically rely on inadequate proxies, such as gross domestic product per capita, to account for future vulnerability associated with income levels. This study presents a novel top–down iterative methodology to produce decadal, high-resolution (1 km) maps of disposable income across Europe for the 21st century consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). More specifically, our method aligns with SSP narratives on future economic growth, income distribution, population dynamics and settlement expansion. We illustrate two possible applications of these projections by analysing future shifts in income distribution and estimating the evolution of the number of people at risk of poverty across different development pathways. In highly unequal pathways (SSP3 and SSP4), poverty levels across Europe are projected to increase significantly, with over 30% of the population at risk of poverty by 2100. On the other hand, pathways with high economic growth, specifically SSP1 and SSP5, result in a decrease in poverty rates. This dataset can serve as a resource for examining future vulnerabilities to climate change and socioeconomic inequalities, providing valuable insights for more effective climate risk assessments and targeted adaptation strategies."

Ice crystals from rime splintering form the lowermost layer of ice crystals around the updraft core. The majority of ice crystals in the anvil of the convective cloud stems from frozen droplets. Ice stemming from homogeneous and deposition nucleation was only relevant in the overshoot. 
 For pure ice clouds in the cold-temperature regime (T<235 K), two major formation pathways are possible. Liquid origin ice clouds stem from droplets that freeze close to water saturation. In-situ-formed ice clouds form directly from the vapor phase below water saturation. For a better investigation of these pathways, we developed a novel microphysics scheme. The new two-moment scheme distinguishes between five ice classes (“ice modes”) each with their own unique formation mechanism: homogeneous freezing of solution droplets, deposition nucleation, homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets and raindrops, immersion freezing, and secondary ice from rime splintering. The ice modes interact with each other, e.g., in competition for growth by deposition of water vapor and aggregation, but also with the other cloud particle classes, i.e., cloud droplets, rain, snow, graupel, and hail.This scheme was employed to investigate the liquid origin vs. in situ formation in the fully glaciated parts of an idealized convective cloud. The majority of the cloud ice in the deep convection cloud consisted of frozen droplets (liquid origin). This was caused by the high number concentration of cloud droplets available for freezing. In-situ-formed ice was only relevant for the overshoot where ice from both formation pathways mixed.The new scheme is also useful for investigation of the ice formation in the mixed-phase parts of the convective cloud. We find a vertical layering of ice modes in the cloud. The lowermost layer consists of secondary ice from rime splintering and occurs near the updraft core at temperatures around the Hallett–Mossop zone. At altitudes between 6 and 9 km, ice mostly stems from immersion freezing. We find a correlation between the abundance of ice from immersion freezing and snow. The majority of ice crystals above 9 km stems from homogeneously frozen cloud droplets since ice-nucleating particles (INPs) required for immersion freezing were quickly depleted."

There was also a county–level correlation between the total PFAS, PFOA, and PFBS concentrations in drinking water and beers. Given that approximately 18% of U.S. breweries are located within zip codes with detectable PFAS in municipal drinking water, our findings, which link PFAS in beer to the brewery water source, are intended to help inform data-driven policies on PFAS in beverages for governmental agencies, provide insights for brewers and water utilities on treatment needs, and support informed decision-making for consumers."

However, the risk of potential chemical leaching associated with physical enrichment items has been largely overlooked (i.e., artificial plants or shelter). Most enrichment items lack information on their chemical composition and have not undergone testing for plastic or metal leachates that can alter water chemistry and impair animal physiology. In fish and invertebrate research, these leachates have the potential to modify the health of aquatic animals or their reproductive processes. Moreover, in toxicology research, altered chemical exposure concentrations and interactive effects with leachates could invalidate toxicity assays and lead to misleading results. We identify key contaminants associated with common enrichment items and highlight the substantial lack of empirical research focusing on the confounding factors associated with aquatic enrichment. We explore the mechanisms through which relevant leachates can complicate experimental outcomes, detailing the pathways by which these substances may interact with both the experimental environment and the animals themselves. We conclude that there is widespread potential for serious complications to research outcomes and chronic toxicity from enrichment materials. Therefore, we advocate for the establishment of standardized regulations and a global certification system for aquatic enrichment items to ensure the validity of studies and to safeguard animal welfare.

In this study, we investigated the visual toxicity of triphenyl phosphate (TPHP, one traditional OPFR) and cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP, one emerging OPFR) on zebrafish larvae at environmentally relevant concentrations (3 and 30 nM). After 5 days of exposure, an opposite toxicity was found between the two OPFRs, manifested in the light perception and the gene expressions of visual opsins. CDP caused a weak reaction to light and overall inhibition of opsin expression (0.7- to 0.8-fold) in the larvae, while TPHP tended to stimulate these events (1.2- to 2.4-fold). Besides, we identified a key transcription factor, tbx2a, that was significantly disrupted in both OPFRs’ exposure.

However, recycling synthetic and blended (cotton and synthetic) textiles can contribute to the release of microplastic fibers (MPFs) into the environment. This study investigated MPF release across different stages of two chemical recycling approaches, acid and alkaline hydrolysis, of polyester/cotton-blended textiles. Recycling involves various stages, including dye removal, treatment stage, and product. In the treatment stage, acid hydrolysis breaks down cotton into cellulose, leaving the polyester (PET) intact, whereas alkaline hydrolysis degrades PET, allowing cotton recovery. Across all stages, dye removal generated the highest MPF count, averaging nearly 10,055 MPFs g–1 of textile waste. Statistical analysis confirmed that the recycling approach significantly affected MPF release (p < 0.05), whereas the fabric type did not (p > 0.05). Alkaline hydrolysis reduced MPF release during the treatment stage by 87.55% compared to acid hydrolysis, indicating that recovering cotton and chemically degrading PET can significantly minimize MPF emissions during recycling. Ridge regression analysis identified the reaction conditions as key factors in MPF fragmentation, with blend ratios influencing the number of released MPFs. Surface characterization revealed treatment-induced fiber alterations, raising concerns regarding MPF emissions throughout the process.

Hoek,Role of Transmembrane Pressure and Water Flux in Reverse Osmosis Composite Membrane Compaction and Performance,"This study explores the compaction behavior of thin-film composite reverse osmosis (TFC RO) membranes for different combinations of transmembrane pressure (TMP) and transmembrane water flux. Operating a crossflow system at constant feed pressure (60 bar) but different feed solution osmotic pressures enabled adjusting the TMP─the difference between hydraulic and osmotic pressure─and water flux. The extent of membrane compaction increases as TMP (and flux) increases. Both commercial and hand-cast TFC RO membranes showed substantial compaction at high TMP (up to 30% compaction at 50 bar TMP) compared to less than 10% at 10 bar TMP. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal a direct relationship between TMP and polysulfone (PSU) support layer compaction, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed decreased porosity and reduced thickness in the polyamide (PA) active layer as TMP increases. Combined findings from wet-testing and MD simulations confirm a hydraulic pressure drop occurs across both the PA active layer and the meso-to-macro-porous support layer; higher TMP exacerbates compaction in both layers resulting in lower water permeability but higher water flux, observed salt rejection, and salt permeability. Transitioning from high TMP to low TMP or vice versa did not notably alter the extent of membrane compaction. This observation is attributed to the highly cross-linked PA active layer’s ability to recover after pressure is released, whereas the compaction in the PSU support layer is largely irreversible. While TMP dictates the overall pressure gradient, our findings suggest that flux-induced frictional forces play a crucial role in compaction dynamics. Specifically, higher flux generates additional drag forces on the polymer matrix of both the PSU support layer and the PA selective layer, intensifying structural deformation. Overall, our findings offer critical insights into the mechanisms of membrane compaction, providing a foundation for optimizing RO membrane performance and advancing next-generation membrane technologies."

The estimated daily intake via inhalation/ingestion of Σ15 RDCs for climbers and employees in some of these facilities ranged from 1.7 to 48 ng/kg/day, exceeding known intake levels of RDCs from other sources. Abrasion powder resulting from friction between climbing shoes and footholds is the likeliest source of high concentrations of RDCs observed in aerosol particulate matter and settled dust. These findings reveal a previously unknown human exposure route of RDCs."

We also found that Mauna Loa's flows follow the volume‐limited regime, while Mt.

Flattening topography eliminates NH SSWs, while removing the ocean meridional overturning circulation reduces their frequency by half. The SSW response to boundary conditions is controlled by the hemispheric asymmetry of eddy heat flux. The reduction is driven by a decrease in amplitude of both eddy meridional wind and eddy temperature, as well as an increase in the cosine of the difference between their phases.

Three convective organization metrics that are positively correlated with the area of MCS, that is, convective organization potential, the area fraction of precipitating MCS, and the precipitation fraction of MCS, are used to indicate the degree of convective organization. Our results show that the contrast in the LW ACRE inside and outside an MCS is consistent across different MCS precipitation intensities throughout the life cycle of an MCS, typically 90–100 W/m2, and provides important positive feedback to the circulation of the given MCS. However, the LW ACRE inside and outside an MCS as well as their difference are not strongly related to the degree of organization, suggesting that the LW cloud radiative feedback may be supportive of MCS formation and maintenance without necessarily being a dominant factor for spatial organization of MCSs.

 Anti-viral immunity can vary tremendously from individual to individual but mechanistic understanding is still scarce. Here, we show that a defined, low complex bacterial community (OMM12) but not the general absence of microbes in germ-free mice leads to a more potent immune response compared to the microbiome of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice after a systemic viral infection with LCMV Clone-13. Consequently, gnotobiotic mice colonized with OMM12 have more severe LCMV-induced disease pathology but also enhance viral clearance in the intestinal tract. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of adoptively transferred virus-specific T helper cells and endogenous T helper cells in the intestinal tract reveal a stronger pro-inflammatory Th1 profile and a more vigorous expansion in OMM12 than SPF mice.

 Lithium-rich layer oxides are expected to be high-capacity cathodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, but their performance is hindered by irreversible anionic redox, leading to voltage decay, lag, and slow kinetics. In order to solve these problems, we regulate the Ni/Mn spin state in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 by Be doping, which generates the superexchange interaction and activates Ni-t2g orbitals. The activation of Ni-t2g orbitals triggers the reductive coupling mechanism between Ni/O, which improves the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox. The strong π-type Ni-t2g/O-2p interaction forms a stable Ni-(O–O) configuration, suppressing excessive anion oxidation. In this work, the Be modified cathodes have good cycle stability, 0.04 mAh/g and 0.5 mV decay per cycle over 400 cycles at 1 C (60 min, 250 mA g−1), with a rate performance of 187 mAh/g at 10 C (6 min, 2500 mA g−1), providing a strategy for stabilising oxygen redox chemistry and designing high performance lithium-rich cathodes. Li-rich oxides face challenges such as voltage decay and slow kinetics due to irreversible anionic reaction. Here, authors activated the Ni-t2g orbitals through generating superexchange interactions via Be doping. By triggering the reduction coupling mechanism, the reversibility and kinetics of the anionic reaction are effectively improved."

 A photodetector’s sensitivity is conventionally quantified by specific detectivity, which balances responsivity and noise. However, we reveal that the turn-on threshold power is fundamentally governed by photo-carrier injection rather than detectivity. In conventional phototransistors/diodes, incident light cannot generate photocurrent via thermionic injection until its intensity saturates the surface potential. To overcome this limit, we design a photo-tunneling transistor with a partially dual-gated black phosphorus channel. This device breaks the injection barrier, achieving a temperature-independent subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec up to 250 K and reducing the threshold power by over an order of magnitude. At 80 K, it detects mid-wave infrared light with a minimum power of ~35 pW, outperforming conventional phototransistors with higher detectivity by ~30-fold. Our work redefines the sensitivity criteria for photodetectors and highlights the potential of steep-slope transistors in low-power optoelectronics, offering a pathway to ultrasensitive infrared sensing and imaging technologies.

 Social norms effectively reduce household energy use, yet research often focuses on moderate climates. Extreme heat could hinder energy-saving behaviors, potentially requiring extra motivational triggers. Here, we examined whether eliciting attachment security—a psychological mechanism triggering bonding and empathy—combined with a social norm message is linked to reduced energy consumption in extreme heat. In a preregistered field experiment in the United Arab Emirates (100 households, 26,400 observations over 9 months, from September 2019 to May 2020), we compared a standard social norm message against one enhanced with secure attachment priming (vs a control group) in the campus housing of an international university. Results showed that households receiving the combined message saved more electricity (9.98%) than those receiving the standard message (6.11%), showed greater efficacy in already efficient households, had heightened effectiveness on hotter days, and the follow-up effect lasted twice as long post-intervention. During the study’s final months, the COVID-19 lockdown occurred, revealing no significant usage differences between experimental groups from lockdown onwards. Given that this study was conducted in only one location with particular characteristics, results may not be generalizable and should be interpreted with caution.

 Mountain regions are among the most sensitive and vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change. In this study, we systematically assess the observed impacts of climate change in the Andes and use expert review and model-based methods to identify the role of anthropogenic climate change. Impact detection and attribution assessments showed that anthropogenic climate change has had at least a minor role in the observed changes while non-climate factors also interfere. Our results confirm that the observed rapid melting of glaciers, increasing number of droughts and floods and reduced water availability in all Andean regions have led to a widespread cascading of impacts through natural and human systems and that these detected impacts can be attributed to human interference in the climate.

 Landfast ice, sea ice fastened to coastal land or ice shelves, generally undergoes distinctive thermodynamic growth and less active dynamic deformation due to its prolonged attachment to the land, resulting in a thicker and smoother surface compared to drifting pack ice. In 2019, large landfast ice floes were detached from the Ronne Ice Shelf, and the broken pieces started to drift into the Weddell Sea. This study employs a random forest (RF) machine learning model to detect these ex-fast ice floes using six key variables from the ICESat-2 ATL10 sea ice freeboard product: freeboard, Gaussian width of photon height distribution, standard deviation of freeboard, floe length, modal freeboard, and sea ice concentration. The RF model achieves an overall accuracy of 99 % in detecting ex-fast ice, effectively capturing the drift, freeboard distribution, and size distribution of ex-fast ice floes across the western Weddell Sea in 2019. Among six variables, freeboard, standard deviation of freeboard, and Gaussian width of photon height distribution contribute over 94 % to the model performance. Furthermore, the detection of ex-fast ice improves the quantification of sea ice topographical features derived from ICESat-2, including modal freeboard, ridge fraction, and surface roughness.

 Integrating passive microwave (PMW) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing to generate all-weather land surface temperature (LST) is essential for effective land thermal monitoring. Previous studies have attempted to adapt TIR-interactive kernel-driven downscaling techniques into the PMW-TIR integration process. However, large-scale spans often introduce significant uncertainties in the generated LST, potentially leading to spatial streaks. To address these challenges, it is critical to introduce a reliable temperature representation at the target resolution to generate accurate all-weather LST. In this study, we propose an integrated pre-temperature description model (ITDM) comprising three modules. The first module is a machine learning-based bias correction-driven generation module (BCDM), which generates relatively precise LST, particularly during the daytime, though it may smooth some spatial textures in certain regions. The second module, a spatial detail-aware generation module (SDAM), utilizes an annual temperature cycle model-based LST as a temperature description, ensuring spatial consistency in the generated LST. The third module integrates the two previous modules, addressing their differences to optimize the final output. Validation results based on MODIS LST indicate that the proposed method achieves a daytime root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.20 K and a standard deviation of bias (STD) of 3.08 K. For nighttime, the RMSE and STD are 2.24 K and 2.15 K, respectively. Additionally, ten in-situ measurements reveal an average RMSE of 3.90 K in the daytime and 3.34 K in the nighttime. Comparative results with two other advanced methods based on MODIS LST and in-situ LST show that the proposed approach reduces RMSE by 0.04–0.91 K and mitigates streaking phenomena more effectively. The study also discusses feature importance, module performance, and the extendibility of the method. The proposed model significantly contributes to the generation of high-quality all-weather LST."

 The coherence estimation errors in phase linking can be mitigated through the weighted alignment of interferometric pairs and the intermediate filtering of data subsets. The Sequential Estimator (SE) serves as a representative method. It divides the coherence-weighted matrix into smaller subsets, using image compression and recursive estimation to enhance phase linking. However, the SE method has inherent limitations due to its dependence on fixed subset size and manual parameter setting, which hinder its application in complex, natural scenarios. In such environments, the distributions of coherent and low-coherence signals are often unpredictable. To address such limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Sequential Estimator (ASE) method. First, an adaptive coherence-weighted matrix partitioning method is proposed. Utilizing Otsu’s algorithm and a local subset merging algorithm, it adaptively generates data subsets which are dynamically tailored to the coherence distribution. Second, a modified sequential estimator is proposed. It selects the optimal subsets from the list with multiple merging degrees, to guide image compression and recursive phase estimation. Based on these, the ASE method adaptively prioritizes coherent information while minimizing the impact of decorrelation noise, thereby improving phase estimation accuracy. Experimental evaluation is conducted using 30 Radarsat-2 SAR images with VV polarization, including the quantitative and visual comparisons between the ASE method and existing methods. The results indicate that the ASE method outperforms other methods, and is particularly well-suited to handling the variable coherence matrix in natural scenarios.

 Effective measurement and monitoring of habitat fragmentation are essential for achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, especially given the ongoing global expansion of urbanization. However, current researches primarily address habitat connectivity or landscape dissection separately, while neglecting the impact of landscape dissection on habitat pattern. In this study, we adopt Road network tiles (RNTs, created through the dissection of the landscape by road networks) as analytical units and develop an integrated index of effective habitat network area to assess habitat fragmentation (structural connectivity), with particular emphasis on landscape dissection. Furthermore, a connection efficiency index is proposed to quantify the ratio of current habitat connectivity to its maximum potential. Collectively interpreting these indices reflects both the adverse effects of road expansion on habitat patterns and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts in spatial planning. These indices were applied to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China. The results show that the effective area of habitat networks in the BTH region declined from 887.66 km2 to 488.50 km2 from 2007 to 2018, despite an overall increase in total habitat area. Nevertheless, connection efficiency for most cities in the BTH region has improved, suggesting that habitat connectivity in 2018 was more efficient and closer to its maximum value compared to 2007, potentially due to effective landscape management practices. By incorporating urban permeation into the joint analysis with RNTs, key zones for habitat conservation and restoration can be identified. This study offers a novel and efficient approach to quantifying habitat fragmentation, providing valuable insights for decision-making aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization on habitat pattern."

 Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is vital for the global carbon cycle, agricultural sustainability, and climate change. Process-based models like Rothamsted carbon model (RothC) simulate SOC dynamics, but their accuracy relies on revisited soil samples for calibration, which are often scarce, especially in environmentally heterogeneous regions. This study proposes a novel approach to generate pseudo revisited samples using environmental similarity, addressing the lack of revisited samples. For each intervening-year sample, pseudo SOC stocks in unsampled years were constructed by calculating environmental similarity with existing samples and applying weighted averaging. These pseudo SOC stocks served as revisited samples for model calibration. Bayesian optimization was used to adjust RothC’s microbial activity parameters. Validation results showed the approach significantly improved predictive accuracy, with an RMSE of 5.28 t/ha (31.6 % lower than global parameter optimization and 10.7 % lower than spatiotemporal Random Forest) and an R2 improved from 0.319 (spatiotemporal Random Forest) to 0.456. The approach enhances SOC model accuracy by leveraging environmental similarity and parameter optimization, offering a practical solution for regions lacking revisited samples and improving long-term SOC dynamics simulations. This approach not only addresses data scarcity but also provides more reliable predictions for climate and agricultural management."

 BackgroundThe evidence for the interactive effects of long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) with typical coagulation parameters which are widely used in clinical practices is limited.MethodsData on basic information and typical coagulation parameters from 40,338 ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients with their first admission records between January 1, 2018 and May 31, 2019 were obtained from Anzhen Hospital, Beijing. Multivariate linear regression model and stratified analysis were used to evaluate separate and interactive effects of annual PM2.5 and maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 exposures on typical coagulation parameters.ResultsWe found that both long-term PM2.5 and MDA8 O3 exposures were associated with increases in prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR), and decreases in prothrombin activity (PTA), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and D-Dimer. The effect estimates of both PM2.5 and MDA8 O3 on PTA, INR, and APTT were generally stronger at higher percentiles of co-pollutant strata (all Pdifference<0.05). For example, the percent changes in PTA associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 were −0.68 % (95 %CI: −0.97 %, −0.38 %), −1.04 % (95 %CI: −1.30 %, −0.78 %) and −1.36 % (95 %CI: −1.80 %, −0.91 %) in the low (≤25 %), medium (25 %–75 %) and high (>75 %) MDA8 O3 strata, respectively; and the percent changes in PTA associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in MDA8 O3 were −1.63 % (95 %CI: −1.96 %, −1.30 %), −1.67 % (95 %CI: −2.03 %, −1.30 %) and −2.30 % (95 %CI: −2.78 %, −1.82 %) in the low, medium and high PM2.5 strata, respectively.ConclusionsOur study provides novel evidence that long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposures synergistically impair the function of coagulation, which may lead to the adverse prognosis in IHD patients, highlighting the advantage of implementing integrated management approaches for both air pollutants."

In North America, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses related to the goose/Guangdong 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin phylogenetic clade have infected wild birds, poultry, and mammals. Our genomic analysis and epidemiological investigation showed that a reassortment event in wild bird populations preceded a single wild bird–to-cattle transmission episode. The movement of asymptomatic or presymptomatic cattle has likely played a role in the spread of HPAI within the United States dairy herd. Some molecular markers that may lead to changes in transmission efficiency and phenotype were detected at low frequencies. Continued transmission of H5N1 HPAI within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations."

We report the realization of a generalizedt-Jmodel with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods."

The biophysical properties that these polymeric scaffolds require for signal transduction are not clearly defined. Here, we engineered single-component DF signalosomes. We found that functionality depends on the stability provided by the DF polymer, which could also be achieved with a bacterial DF domain, a synthetic filament-forming domain, and amyloid-like sequences. This demonstrates the importance of polymer stability and inducibility irrespective of the motif’s origin. By varying the number of included TRAF6 interaction motifs, we demonstrate that avidity is a tunable property that can control the amplitude of signaling outputs. This work lays out a reductionist framework to elucidate the required signaling properties through polymeric scaffolds by adjusting their assembly kinetics, stability, and avidity."

However, both farming systems comprise highly variable management practices. In this study, we show that in organic and conventional arable fields, the multifunctionality of soils decreases with increasing agricultural management intensity. Soil organic carbon content and bacterial biomass, respectively, were the strongest abiotic and biotic predictors of soil multifunctionality. Greater soil multifunctionality was associated with less-frequent inversion tillage and higher frequency of grass-legume cover cropping, and organic farming did not outperform conventional farming. Our results suggest that reducing management intensity will enhance soil multifunctionality in both conventional and organic farming. This implies that, in contexts where high-yielding, high-intensity agriculture prevails, the paradigm of sustainable intensification should be replaced by “productive deintensification.”"

To investigate the basis for treatment failure, we examined spontaneous mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with either an inflamed T cell–rich or a noninflamed T cell–deprived tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) secreted by tumor cells determines tumor immunotype. Tumor-derived EPO autonomously generates a noninflamed TME by interacting with its cognate receptor EPOR on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). EPO signaling prompts TAMs to become immunoregulatory through NRF2-mediated heme depletion. Removing either tumor-derived EPO or EPOR on TAMs leads to an inflamed TME and tumor regression independent of genotype, owing to augmented antitumor T cell immunity. Thus, the EPO/EPOR axis functions as an immunosuppressive switch for antitumor immunity."

Whereas cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we reveal a bacterial antiphage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine triphosphates (dITPs) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates a downstream effector to mediate depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular deoxyadenosine monophosphate, the precursor of dITP messengers.

This capability allows animals to perform challenging tasks with minimal muscular or neural activities, a phenomenon known as embodied intelligence. However, realizing such robots remains challenging due to the lack of mechanically intelligent bodies with abundant tunable parameters—such as tunable stiffness—which is a critical factor akin to the programmable parameters of a neural network. We introduce an elastic rolling cam (ERC) with accurately inverse-designable rotational stiffness. The ERC can closely replicate 100,000 randomly generated stiffness profiles in simulation. Prototypes ranging from millimeters to centimeters were manufactured. To illustrate the mechanical intelligence encoded by programming the ERC’s stiffness response, we designed a bipedal robot with optimized ERC passive knees, achieving energy-efficient, open-loop stable walking across uneven terrain. We also demonstrated a quadcopter drone with ERC joints encoding an impact-activated, dual-state morphing."

With the demand of REE being met by a few giant deposits such as Bayan Obo, decoding controls of ore formation is vital. Yet, after nearly a century of study, the genesis of Bayan Obo remains debated. Here, we demonstrate that two stages of carbonatites emplaced at Bayan Obo at 1320 and 430 million years ago (Ma). The effusive nature of the 1320 Ma carbonatite suppressed brine/fluid exsolution; hence, mineralization at this stage is limited, but its subsequent deformation created an ideal environment for water-rock interaction induced mineralization. The 430 Ma carbonatites exsolved voluminous brine/alkaline fluids rich in REE, with mineralization being promoted as veins and along beddings of the deformed Mesoproterozoic carbonatites via metasomatism. This stage contributed >70% REE. Our study highlights that multistage carbonatites emplaced at one locality could be a controlling factor for REE mineralization and explains the scarcity of giant deposits."

However, the effects of recently frequent variabilities in spring precipitation on ecosystem productivity are still unclear. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and gross primary productivity (GPP) in the spring, as well as the impact of spring excessive precipitation on GPP over dryland ecosystems in northern China, based on remote sensing datasets of precipitation and GPP at eight-day intervals from 2000 to 2018. We also assess the sensitivity and stability of GPP to spring excessive precipitation. Spring excessive precipitation had a unidirectional driving effect on vegetation growth and an evident lag effect of an eight-day period across more than 87% of the drylands in northern China. This indicates that dryland ecosystems in northern China respond quickly to excessive precipitation in the spring. Vegetation sensitivity to excessive precipitation is the weakest at an aridity index of around 0.1. Drylands with high temperatures and large precipitation exhibit positive sensitivity, strong resistance, and high resilience of vegetation to excessive precipitation. There is a synchronous change between the resistance and resilience of GPP to excessive precipitation. Our results provide an innovative understanding of the interaction mechanism between precipitation variations and dryland ecosystems, offering theoretical support for ecological restoration, sustainable development, and carbon neutrality in dryland regions."

Here we show that the decrease in OHC is primarily due to the local subsurface cooling at depths of approximately 60–400 m. The increasing cyclonic surface wind stress in the TIO has intensified Ekman pumping locally, thereby enhancing vertical cold advection through upwelling processes. We further show that while the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation can drive similar changes in OHC and patterns of subsurface temperature through changes in surface wind stress, its effect is confined to decadal timescales and therefore does not leave evident imprints on this long-term trend. This study highlights the crucial role of local air–sea interactions and related oceanic dynamical processes in shaping the regional climate change response."

Here, we analyze agricultural drought with a crop water stress index (CSI) that incorporates plant and soil characteristics and soil moisture. The new index is evaluated against other standardized meteorological drought indices, such as the standardized precipitation index and the standardized soil moisture index. The results show substantial differences between the standardized indices and the CSI. To study future drought patterns, we use multiple future scenarios simulated by the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. In contrast to the standardized indices, the results of the CSI show an improvement in the future global mean drought conditions due to a greater increase in mean wet than dry conditions governed by soil moisture and precipitation, while both dry and wet extreme conditions increase in intensity. Nonetheless, the results suggest large cropland areas will be subject to intense drought conditions under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP-1.19 to SSP-5.85.

Using ERA5 data from 1960 to 2022, we examine AFD frequency, duration, intensity, trends, seasonality, life cycle, and the influence of land–atmosphere interactions. Historical crop data, spanning different time periods across SESA countries, are analyzed to assess how the spatiotemporal evolution and varying life cycles of AFDs affect crop yields. The highest AFD frequencies (3–8 events per decade) occur in the central portion of SESA. These rapidly intensifying events often evolve into seasonal droughts lasting 1.5–3 months. Although area-averaged AFD frequency shows no significant change in central SESA, positive trends are noticeable in southern Brazil and Uruguay. Towards the north of SESA, AFDs are less frequent, with 1–3 episodes per decade, although the frequency has significantly increased since 1970. AFDs tend to last over 3 months and reach higher intensity. Land–atmosphere feedback mechanisms are reflected in high positive vapor pressure deficit and temperature anomalies that exacerbate soil moisture deficits despite a relatively stable precipitation deficit, accelerating AFD intensification periods. AFDs typically impact smaller areas, while slow-evolving droughts affect larger regions. However, AFDs’ timing during the critical growth periods of the crops can lead to substantial yield losses. In central SESA, AFDs mainly occur between November and January, affecting both crops during their flowering and grain filling in December and January. In northern SESA, AFDs occur later, from February to April, primarily impacting second-season corn. The overall impact on crop yields depends on the duration, spatial extent, and intensity of the drought after its intensification."

The main sources were the screen and primary clarifier. 
 Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are substantial contributors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of the high production of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). A typical WWTP complex contains multiple functional areas that are potential sources of GHG emissions. Accurately quantifying GHG emissions from these sources is challenging due to the inaccuracy of activity data, the ambiguity of emission sources, and the absence of monitoring standards. Locating and quantifying WWTP emission sources using a measurement-based GHG emission  quantification method is crucial for evaluating and improving traditional emission inventories. In this study, CH4 mobile measurements were conducted within a WWTP complex in the summer and winter of 2023. We utilized a multi-source Gaussian plume model combined with a genetic algorithm inversion framework, designed to locate major sources within the plant and quantify the corresponding CH4 emission fluxes. We identified 13 main sources in the plant and estimated plant-scale CH4 emission fluxes of 68.78±17.40kgh-1 (603.33±152.66ta-1) for the summer and 47.76±21.39kgh-1 (418.95±187.59ta-1) for the winter. The predominant sources of CH4 emissions were the screen and primary clarifier, contributing 55 % and 67 % to the total emissions in summer and winter, respectively. The comparison revealed that summer CH4 emissions were 2.8 times higher than inventory estimates, while winter emissions were twice the inventory values. This study demonstrated that mobile measurements, combined with the multi-source Gaussian plume inversion framework, are a powerful tool to locate and quantify GHG sources at a complex site, with the potential for further refinement to accommodate different types of factories and gas species."

The deuterated α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2 were proven as effective surrogates in tracing these losses for some key monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The findings highlight the importance of selecting internal surrogates that closely match the adsorptive and reactive behaviors of target compounds for precise loss correction. 
 Accurately measuring the emissions of monoterpenes (MTs) and sesquiterpenes (SQTs) using dynamic chambers requires careful consideration of their adsorptive and reactive losses, which are often overlooked and difficult to assess in situ. This study evaluated the effectiveness of deuterated surrogates, α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, in tracing these losses in a dynamic chamber system. Using standard gas mixtures of 10 MTs and 10 SQTs, we characterized adsorptive losses across varying concentrations, temperatures, and humidity levels, as well as reactive losses with ozone. Results indicated that adsorptive losses were significantly influenced by concentration and temperature, with species-specific variations particularly under low concentrations and low temperatures, while relative humidity had negligible impact. Reactive losses with ozone exhibited substantial species-specific variability. Key MTs (α-pinene, β-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, and 1,8-cineole) and SQTs (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene) demonstrated consistent adsorptive and reactive behaviors with their respective deuterated surrogates α-pinene-d3 and β-caryophyllene-d2, suggesting that these surrogates are effective for correcting losses with in situ emission measurements using dynamic chambers. However, due to varied adsorptive and reactive losses, additional deuterated MTs and SQTs are recommended, particularly selected according to their O3 reactivities, to cover a broader range of MTs and SQTs for loss correction. A strong correlation between adsorptive capacity and ozone reactivity was observed, underscoring the need to carefully address losses of highly reactive MTs and SQTs during emission measurements. This study also emphasizes that ozone-free circulating air should be used for accurately measuring emissions of highly reactive SQTs, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, especially when loss correction methods are unavailable."

 Coastal moorings allow scientists to collect long-term datasets that are valuable in understanding shelf dynamics, detecting climate variability and changes, and evaluating shelf dynamics and climate variability and change impacts on marine ecosystems.

This updated dataset offers continuous daily temperature and current data with a 5 m vertical resolution, collected from six coastal Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) moorings at depths between 48  and 500 m. The self-organizing map (SOM) machine learning technique is applied to fill in the data gaps in the previous version. The data capture the Leeuwin Current variability on the shelf from intraseasonal to interannual timescales. The data also capture the variability of the Capes Current, a wind-driven northward current on the middle shelf. The usage of the in-filled data product is demonstrated by detecting extreme temperature events on the Rottnest Shelf. The data products can be used to characterize sub-surface features of extreme events such as marine heat waves and marine cold spells, which are influenced by the Leeuwin Current and the wind-driven Capes Current, and to detect decadal change signals along the WA coast."

This dataset fills the gap in remote sensing image-text datasets for farmland, alleviates the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in farmland segmentation, and provides valuable data to support large-scale farmland monitoring and mapping. 
 Understanding and mastering the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland is essential for accurate farmland segmentation. The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment. It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language, as a structured knowledge carrier, can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution, and surrounding environmental information. Therefore, a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland. However, in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland, there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction. To fill this gap, we introduced language-based descriptions of farmland and developed FarmSeg-VL dataset—the first fine-grained image-text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation. Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign caption to each image, ensuring high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction. Secondly, the FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics. In terms of the temporal dimension, it covers all four seasons. In terms of the spatial dimension, it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China, with a total area of approximately 4,300 km2. In addition, in terms of captions, FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, including its inherent properties, phenological characteristics, spatial distribution, topographic and geomorphic features, and the distribution of surrounding environments. Finally, we present a performance analysis of vision language models and the deep learning models that rely solely on labels trained on the FarmSeg-VL, demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation.

Key reasons include different coverage of gases and sectors, varying definitions of anthropogenic land use change emissions, and the Paris Agreement not covering all emission sources. The study highlights three main ways emissions data is reported, each with different objectives and resulting in varying global emission totals. It emphasizes the need for transparency in choosing datasets and setting assessment scopes. 
 We examine differences in global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates and highlight the important role of varying system boundaries and conceptual approaches in driving these variations. Despite consensus among assessments and datasets that GHG emissions continue to increase and are far from aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, estimates can differ significantly. Our review finds three main reasons for these differences. First, datasets vary in their coverage of gases, sectors and countries; second, there are different approaches to defining ‘anthropogenic’ emissions and removals in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector; and third, the Paris Agreement doesn’t cover all relevant sources of emissions, including the cement carbonation sink and ozone depleting substances. As different assessments have different objectives, they may deal with these issues differently. We highlight three assessment conventions that report or use emissions data: those focused on interpreting national progress, policies and pledges under the Paris Agreement; those consistent with integrated assessment modelling (IAM) benchmarks of emissions under different warming scenarios; and those consistent with climate forcing assessments. Considering annual average emissions over the period 2014 to 2023, we show global totals of 44.7 GtCO2e yr-1 [90 % CI ± 4.6], 53.1 GtCO2e yr-1 [90 % CI ± 5.2], and 54.9 GtCO2e yr-1 [90 % CI ± 5.2] for these three conventions, respectively.

In this study, we develop and apply a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system to a coupled climate model. The WCODA system improves simulations of ocean temperature and salinity across many global regions. This system is meant to advance our understanding of the ocean's role in climate predictability. 
 The development, implementation, and evaluation of a new weakly coupled ocean data assimilation (WCODA) system for the fully coupled Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) utilizing the four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar) method are presented in this study. The 4DEnVar method, based on the dimension-reduced projection four-dimensional variational (DRP-4DVar) approach, replaces the adjoint model with the ensemble technique, thereby reducing computational demands. Monthly mean ocean temperature and salinity data from the EN4.2.1 reanalysis are integrated into the ocean component of E3SMv2 from 1950 to 2021 with the goal of providing realistic initial conditions for decadal predictions and predictability studies. The performance of the WCODA system is assessed using various metrics, including the reduction rate of the cost function, root mean square error (RMSE) differences, correlation differences, and model biases. Results indicate that the WCODA system effectively assimilates the reanalysis data into the climate model, consistently achieving negative reduction rates of the cost function and notable improvements in RMSE and correlation across various ocean layers and regions. Significant enhancements are observed in the upper ocean layers across the majority of global ocean regions, particularly in the north Atlantic, north Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Model biases in sea surface temperature and salinity are also substantially reduced. For sea surface temperature, cold biases in the north Pacific and north Atlantic are diminished by about 1–2 °C, and warm biases in the Southern Ocean are corrected by approximately 1.5–2.5 °C. In terms of salinity, improvements are observed with bias reductions of about 0.5–1 psu in the north Atlantic and north Pacific and up to 1.5 psu in parts of the Southern Ocean. The ultimate goal of the WCODA system is to advance the predictive capabilities of E3SM for subseasonal to decadal climate predictions, thereby supporting research on strategic energy-sector policies and planning."

Results show that our method can accurately recover evolution details superior to other methods, reaching 53.7 % in the restoration rate. Our findings are important for advancing weather forecasting models and enabling more precise and reliable predictions to support disaster preparedness, agriculture, and sustainable development. 
 Numerical forecast products with high temporal resolution are crucial tools in atmospheric studies, allowing for accurate identification of rapid transitions and subtle changes that may be missed by lower-resolution data. However, the acquisition of high-resolution data is limited due to excessive computational demands and substantial storage needs in numerical models. Current deep learning methods for statistical downscaling still require massive ground truth with high temporal resolution for model training. In this paper, we present a self-supervised framework for downscaling atmospheric variables at arbitrary time resolutions by imposing a temporal coherence constraint. Firstly, we construct an encoder–decoder-structured temporal downscaling network and then pretrain this downscaling network on a subset of data that exhibit rapid transitions and are filtered out based on a composite index. Subsequently, this pretrained network is utilized to downscale the fields from adjacent time periods and generate the field at the middle time point. By leveraging the temporal coherence inherent in meteorological variables, the network is further trained based on the difference between the generated field and the actual middle field. To track the evolving trends in meteorological system movements, a flow estimation module is designed to assist with generating interpolated fields. Results show that our method can accurately recover evolution details superior to other methods, reaching 53.7 % in the restoration rate on the test set. In addition, to avoid generating abnormal values and to guide the model out of local optima, two regularization terms are integrated into the loss function to enforce spatial and temporal continuity, which further improves the performance by 7.6 %."

However, the mechanism underlying BTBPE-induced metabolic dysregulation remains unclear. In this study, molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis assays indicated that BTBPE binds to zebrafish liver X receptor α (LXRα). Subsequently, zebrafish embryos were exposed to BTBPE, an LXR antagonist (GSK2033), or coexposed to BTBPE with an LXR agonist (GW3965) for 120 h postfertilization (hpf). The results showed that BTBPE induced reduction in body weight and lipid levels, likely via inhibition of the LXR signaling pathway. Exposure of adult female zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentrations of BTBPE (0.01–10 μg/L) for 28 days induced developmental toxicity, evidenced by decreases in body weight, growth rate, and fat accumulation. Metabolomic analysis revealed that BTBPE-induced alterations in liver metabolites were primarily associated with LXR-mediated lipid metabolic pathways such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Additionally, BTBPE impaired the physical barrier and induced inflammation, resulting in gut microbiota dysbiosis, which is potentially linked to LXR activation. These effects were validated through the alterations of multiple biomarkers at various levels. Overall, our results suggest that BTBPE disrupts lipid metabolism and gut function via the LXR-mediated pathway."

In this study, we integrated indicators from peripheral blood single-cell transcriptome, behavior, and physiological indices in Chinese soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) to explore the impact of dual stress caused by bacterial infections and/or heatwaves on the turtles. Turtles were randomly divided into four groups based on constant temperature at 28 °C and heatwave exposure, as well as whether they were infected with bacteria (Bacillus cereus). Principal component analysis-based cell clustering revealed that the 14 cell clusters were classified into seven distinct cell types: erythrocytes, monocytes, thrombocytes, T cells, B cells, basophils, and heterophils. All cell types participated in the host immune response to heatwaves and bacterial infection, but these cells exhibited significant group-specific differences in their gene expression patterns. Bacterial infections and heatwaves altered turtle behavior and physiology indexes. The dual stresses inhibited the expression of antioxidant enzymes and immune genes, potentially jeopardizing turtle survival. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into peripheral blood cell profiles of Chinese soft-shelled turtles under different environmental conditions, enhancing the understanding of their immune responses and potential stressors."

However, the defense mechanisms of plants against different-sized N/MPs remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the interactions between polystyrene (PS) NPs (50 and 100 nm) and PS-MPs (200 and 500 nm) with taro (Colocasia esculenta). We found that PS particles of varying sizes exhibited differential root adsorption and penetration, with PS-NPs capable of penetrating the root epidermis, whereas PS-MPs were totally excluded. Notably, taro demonstrated the capacity to recognize different sizes of N/MPs and responded with varying degrees of resistance. In reaction to the more toxic and penetrating 50 nm PS-NPs, the roots mobilized a robust defense mechanism with three levels: molecular, compositional, and ultrastructural. This defense was achieved by activating lignin synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid transport, resulting in a doubling of the lignified region of the root and increases in cell wall thickness of 116%, 56.3%, and 22.5% in the epidermis, exodermis, and cortex, respectively. Consequently, roots excluded all four sizes of N/MPs outside the vascular tissue and prevented the contamination of the corms.

However, the effect of Mn oxide reduction in the Mn/Fe cycle on Tl mobilization is not clear. Herein, the influence of Mn oxide configuration, oxygen environment, and degree of reduction on MnO2 transformation and associated Tl species distribution is investigated. In oxic environments, both typical δ-MnO2 and α-MnO2 structures (i.e., layered and tunneled, respectively) can immobilize Tl(I) for a long time. In mild-to-moderate reducing anoxic environments, the drastic reductive transformation of δ-MnO2 results in Tl binding, mainly in an exchangeable form. In highly reducing environments, δ-MnO2 or α-MnO2 is converted to Manganite, resulting in the release of more Tl. Tl-LIII edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates that oxidized Tl(III) (54–62%) is converted to structural Tl(I) (67–80%) and bound to interlayer/tunnel centers during the reductive transformation of MnO2, which enhances Tl exchange in δ-MnO2 and leads to Tl immobilization in α-MnO2. Our results show that anoxic Tl(I)-/Mn(II)-/Fe(II)-induced MnO2 transformation can enhance Tl mobilization, and tunneled MnO2 may have a more sustainable Tl immobilization potential than layered MnO2, which improves the general understanding of the geochemical behavior of Tl in different Mn-related reducing environments."

Our findings indicate that PFOA leached 1–2 orders of magnitude more than PFOS across all GAC types and leaching procedures. In general, PFAS leaching was more notable for alkaline leaching conditions, especially for wood-based GAC. Additionally, real groundwater spiked with an 8 PFAS mixture was used to load GAC for leaching propensity demonstration, and similar conclusions were reached, where leaching was generally greater for shorter-chain and more hydrophilic PFAS.

This study examined the influence of DOM from various sources on the photodegradation of UV-328 under simulated daylight conditions. Experiments revealed that excited triplet DOM (3DOM*) is the primary factor enhancing the photodegradation of UV-328. Utilizing excitation–emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC) and seawater ultrafiltration experiments, it was demonstrated that high molecular weight DOM, particularly autochthonous DOM produced in seawater, could more rapidly photodegrade UV-328. Additionally, the photodegradation of UV-328 in suspended particulate matter (SPM) was influenced by DOM, inorganic ions, and organic acids, with DOM contributing to a positive feedback effect on the degradation process.

Most PFAS in AFFFs are fluorosurfactants, known to self-assemble into large supramolecular assemblies in the field of physical chemistry; however, the application of this phenomenon to understanding environmental fate has not been studied. We hypothesize that self-assembled PFAS likely enhance the long-term retention of PFAS in subsurface environments, acting as a continuous source of dissolved PFAS. Thus, characterizing these self-assemblies and understanding their aggregation dynamics are crucial for assessing the  fate and transport of PFAS. Despite the utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in studying surfactant behaviors, fluorosurfactants have been underexplored due to the lack of force field parameters. In this study, we developed coarse-grained (CG) force field parameters for fluorosurfactants based on the Martini 3 model and performed CG-MD simulations. These “computational microscope” simulations reveal the self-assembly behavior of selected PFAS, aligning with experimental cryo-transmission electron microscopy observations and providing mechanistic insights. Our work sheds light on the evolution of solvated PFAS self-assemblies over time and space.

Despite studies examining the spatial distribution of such events, there has been little work in examining if all relevant life threatening and damaging hazards are captured in existing hazard databases and by common hazard metrics. For example, local/regional flash flooding events are seldom captured by optical satellite instruments and are subsequently excluded from global hazard databases. Similarly, the heat hazard definitions most frequently used in multi‐hazard studies inherently fail to capture events that are life‐threatening but climatologically within an expected range. Our goal is to determine the potential for increasing multi‐hazard event detection capabilities by inferring additional hazard footprints from widely accessible satellite data. We use daily precipitation and temperature satellite data to develop an open‐source framework that infers additional hazard footprints that are not included in traditional methods. With the state of Texas as our study area, we detected 2.5 times as many flood hazards, equivalent to $320 million in property and crop damages. Furthermore, our expanded heat hazard definition increases the impacted area by 56.6%, equivalent to 91.5 million km2 ${\text{km}}^{2}$ over an 18 year period. Increasing hazard detection capabilities and expanding existing definitions of hazards using daily satellite data increases the temporal and spatial resolutions at which multi‐hazard events are detected.

To understand this volcanic history, we developed a 2‐D numerical model of magmatism and mantle convection; the effects of the PKT on lunar evolution are considered by initially imposing a region of localized radioactive enrichment. The calculated volcanism is driven by two different mechanisms. Early volcanism occurs when magma generated in the deep mantle by internal heating ascends to the surface as partially molten plumes. The basaltic blobs in the uppermost mantle formed by this magmatism then sink into the deep mantle, triggering further plumes that cause a resurgence of volcanism in its later history.

While the concurrent El Niño event and positive Indian Ocean Dipole may contribute to this process, their impacts were relatively modest compared to TSNA warming. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring and predicting TSNA SST anomaly to improve seasonal precipitation forecasts and develop effective adaptation strategies for Europe in the context of climate change."

Here we focus on how mantle wedge serpentinite may affect megathrust seismogenesis at Japan Trench—an end‐member cold subduction zone. Based on thermal modeling constrained by heat flow observations and serpentine frictional behavior reported in the literature, we hypothesize the presence of a lizardite‐rich soft barrier starting at the mantle wedge corner (MWC) and an antigorite‐rich seismic zone farther downdip. This soft‐barrier hypothesis can explain why two groups of megathrust events are roughly divided by the MWC yet the giant 2011 Tohoku‐oki earthquake ruptured through the MWC. Seismogenic antigorite patches embedded in semi‐viscous to viscous fault zone materials can explain other observed seismic phenomena of the deeper part of the megathrust such as aftershocks, persistent repeating earthquakes, and strong radiation of short‐period energy in great earthquakes."

England;Lennart T. Bach,Influence of Wave Action on Applications of Olivine‐Based Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement on Sandy Beaches,"Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is an emerging carbon dioxide removal approach that aims to store additional atmospheric CO2 as (bi)carbonate in seawater. OAE can be realized through a variety of pathways, one of which is the dispersal of alkaline mineral sand on beaches where wave energy shall accelerate alkalinity formation. Here, we built a “Beach‐Machine” to simulate a gradient of wave energy and test its effect on alkalinity formation by olivine, a widely considered mineral for OAE. We find that wave energy strongly (linearly) increases alkalinity formation from olivine when energy input is beyond a certain threshold. However, when olivine is mixed with organic‐poor sand, energy input also increases the loss of alkalinity possibly by promoting precipitation reactions thereby canceling out the benefits of waves on alkalinity formation. Our experiments show that the effects of wave energy on OAE efficiency are dependent on the sediment where olivine‐based OAE is applied."

Kongsfjorden, a fjord in Svalbard, serves as a natural laboratory for investigating climate‐driven shifts in high‐latitude fjord ecosystems and their broader implications for the Arctic. To examine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and cycling in Kongsfjorden, we collected samples of seawater, floating ice, and river water in June 2023 and analyzed 14C and 13C in DOC. Radiocarbon values of DOC (as in Δ14C) in fjord seawater ranged from −302‰ to −253‰, while values in the Bayelva River were higher, suggesting a contribution of younger, terrigenous DOC. However, stable carbon isotope results suggested rapid removal of riverine DOC after entering the fjord. Additionally, differences in Δ14C values between the inner and outer fjord reflected varying contributions from surface primary production and glacial meltwater inputs."

We combine satellite‐derived sea surface salinity (SSS), ocean currents, and river discharge rates to examine patterns of salinity distribution throughout the entire GoM basin. Saline waters were reported intruding up the Mississippi River during drought years, so a close examination of these years is conducted. The relationship between the Loop Current (LC) and freshwater distribution are further investigated using a stepwise linear regression model. The relative impacts of river discharge and surface advective freshwater fluxes are quantified, and it is concluded that basin‐wide SSS depends significantly on the discharge from the Atchafalaya River, which leads by 4 months. Interannual salinity variability in the GoM is found to depend on the combination of discharge magnitude and timing relative to the position of the LCS."

Deep propagation of gravity waves (GW) from the troposphere to the lower mesosphere is studied above the Southern Andes during two flights in September 2019. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a configuration for the simulations that has been validated in a previous study of this campaign. Strong orographic GW were detected during both flights that were conceived for different latitudes. The observational and numerical data reveal the presence of significant GW attenuation, breaking and secondary wave generation above the stratopause due to the development of convective and dynamic instability as well as conditions for wave evanescence. The GW generated by topography were not able to alter the stable structure of the stratosphere, but the scenario was quite different in the lower mesosphere. The disturbed zones in that layer were produced by the combined effect on lapse rate of the background temperature variation and the perturbations associated with GW, which together may induce large vertical gradients. As a consequence, areas of reduced stability (with low or even negative buoyancy parameter) emerge above the stratopause. The existence of these GW self‐induced attenuation layers in the mesosphere where temperature perturbations produce large negative gradients may lead to an amplitude growth control mechanism for the upward propagating waves."

The overall increasing trend in δ18Os indicates a weakening of Asian summer monsoon circulation over the last century, while the trace element ratios suggest a relatively stable precipitation trend. Notably, the correlation between δ18Os and trace element ratios has experienced a significant transition since the acceleration of global warming from the 1970s. Our findings reinforce the notion that the forcing of greenhouse gases weakened monsoon dynamics (circulation) over the past century, whereas the monsoon thermodynamic (precipitation) was essentially unchanged, thus highlighting the different influences of the greenhouse gases on the monsoon dynamics and thermodynamics, respectively."

Simulated wind speeds are compared with in‐situ measurements from 22 surface sites, grouped into six topographic categories: continental plain (CT), lakeside (LS), river valley (RV), Long Island (LI), Block Island (BI), and offshore ocean (OO). A quantitative evaluation based on Relative Euclidean Distance shows that wind speeds at the OO site are the most accurately reproduced, followed by those at LI sites, while the model performs less accurately for the remaining topographic groups. Wind speeds over CT sites tend to be overestimated by approximately 1 m/s, although their diurnal variability (DV) is well captured. In contrast, the model underestimates wind DV at LS, RV, LI, and BI sites, with the largest biases occurring at LI and BI, resulting in underestimated daytime wind speed and/or overestimated nighttime wind speed. The OO winds exhibit minimal diurnal variation, accurately captured by our WRF model. The surface wind diurnal variation is closely linked to PBL development. Among the indicators of PBL development, surface potential temperature biases most strongly correlate with wind speed biases. Our WRF model faces challenges in capturing the distinctions between winds influenced by local circulations and those over continental plains, and the significantly stronger winds at OO compared to BI. Potential causes for these biases are discussed, offering pathways for improving surface wind simulations in future."

We examine the IWC‐hydroclimate linkages throughout the Indian Ocean Basin during two study periods (instrumental era and the last millennium), using the ECHAM5‐wiso, iCESM‐iLME, and ERA5 global data products. We leverage the stable isotopic composition of precipitation (δ $\delta $18OP) as an integrative water cycle tracer to elucidate the link between large‐scale atmospheric processes and regional hydroclimate characteristics. We find a strong statistical relationship between the East African short rain δ $\delta $18OP and IWC in Eastern Africa and Horn of Africa. In Indonesia, the relationship is weaker due to the strong influence of the Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC). These patterns arise over multiple time scales and are consistent with the strong tie between the IWC and precipitation variability during the short rain season in Eastern Africa and Horn of Africa that had previously been reported in the instrumental era but not yet for the last millennium. We document strong fluctuations in the strength of the IWC during the last millennium, with periods of stronger or weaker interactions with the PWC that influenced δ $\delta $18OP variability. Finally, our study underscores the ability of δ $\delta $18OP to capture major atmospheric circulation signals, demonstrating its potential to examine the impact of interacting Walker Circulations on regional hydroclimate even during periods of low precipitation."

Yet, a tiny fraction of global wild fish catch comes from the High Seas, despite intensifying industrial fishing efforts. The paradoxically small fish catch could reflect economic barriers to exploiting the High Seas ‐ such as the difficulty and cost of fishing in remote ocean parts ‐ or ecological features resulting in a small biomass of commercial fish (10g–100 kg) relative to primary production. We use the coupled biological‐economic model BOATS to estimate contributing factors, comparing observed catches with simulations where: (a) fishing cost depends on distance from shore and seafloor depth; (b) catchability depends on seafloor depth or vertical habitat extent; (c) regions with micronutrient limitation have reduced biomass production; (d) the trophic transfer of energy from primary production to demersal food webs depends on water depth; and (e) High Seas biomass migrates to coastal regions. The dominant factor is ecological: commercial fish communities receive much primary production in shallow waters but less in deep waters, limiting exploitable biomass in High Seas. Other factors play a secondary role, with migrations having a potentially large but uncertain role, while economic factors have smaller effects. We estimate the High Seas hosted 25% $\%$ of a global 2.8 ± $\pm $ 0.7 Gt biomass in the early 20th century, changing to 47% of a global 1.5 ± $\pm $ 0.4 Gt of commercial fish biomass during the early 21st century.

 Colorectal cancer incidence rates vary geographically and have changed over time1. Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries2-5. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin6,7, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development.

Paulino,Modular chiral origami metamaterials,"A versatile origami-inspired modular chiral mechanical metamaterial structure facilitates dual-mode actuation, converting compression into rotational motion and torsion into extension or compression. 
 Metamaterials with multimodal deformation mechanisms resemble machines1,2, especially when endowed with autonomous functionality. A representative architected assembly, with tunable chirality, converts linear motion into rotation3. These chiral metamaterials with a machine-like dual modality have potential use in areas such as wave manipulation4, optical activity related to circular polarization5 and chiral active fluids6. However, the dual motions are essentially coupled and cannot be independently controlled. Moreover, they are restricted to small deformation, that is, strain ≤2%, which limits their applications. Here we establish modular chiral metamaterials, consisting of auxetic planar tessellations and origami-inspired columnar arrays, with decoupled actuation. Under single-degree-of-freedom actuation, the assembly twists between 0° and 90°, contracts in-plane up to 25% and shrinks out-of-plane more than 50%. Using experiments and simulations, we show that the deformation of the assembly involves in-plane twist and contraction dominated by the rotating-square tessellations and out-of-plane shrinkage dominated by the tubular Kresling origami arrays. Moreover, we demonstrate two distinct actuation conditions: twist with free translation and linear displacement with free rotation. Our metamaterial is built on a highly modular assembly, which enables reprogrammable instability, local chirality control, tunable loading capacity and scalability. Our concept provides routes towards multimodal, multistable and reprogrammable machines, with applications in robotic transformers, thermoregulation, mechanical memories in hysteresis loops, non-commutative state transition and plug-and-play functional assemblies for energy absorption and information encryption.

 Clinical pathogen diagnostics detect targets by qPCR (but with low sensitivity) or blood culturing (but time-consuming). Here we leverage a dual-stem-loop DNA amplifier to enhance non-specific collateral enzymatic cleavage of an oligonucleotide linker between a fluophore and its quencher by CRISPR-CasΦ, achieving ultrasensitive target detection. Specifically, the target pathogens are lysed to release DNA, which binds its complementary gRNA in CRISPR-CasΦ to activate the collateral DNA-cleavage capability of CasΦ, enabling CasΦ to cleave the stem-loops in the amplifier. The cleavage product binds its complementary gRNA in another CRISPR-CasΦ to activate more CasΦ. The activated CasΦ collaterally cleaves the linker, releasing the fluophore to recover its fluorescent signal. The cycle of stem-loop-cleavage/CasΦ-activation/fluorescence-recovery amplifies the detection signal. Our target amplification-free collateral-cleavage-enhancing CRISPR-CasΦ method (TCC), with a detection limit of 0.11 copies/μL, demonstrates enhanced sensitivity compared to qPCR.

Prakash and colleagues show cellular organisation results from differences in junction contractility, finding mechanics is sufficient to organise a hair cell mosaic that is planar polarised. 
 Tissue function depends on the precise organisation of the constituent cells. In the cochlea, the fidelity of hearing depends on mechanosensory hair cells being consistently surrounded by supporting cells. In addition to this positional order, auditory sensitivity depends crucially on planar cell polarity. This is characterised by the alignment of the orientation of eccentrically placed hair bundles on each hair cell. These two levels of order emerge simultaneously despite the cellular fluxes that occur during cochlear development. However, the link between tissue-scale cellular rearrangements and intrinsic cellular mechanisms remains unknown. By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we find a precise force patterning underpinning positional order and planar cell polarity. This occurs through the modulation of the levels and phospho-type of the regulatory light chain of non-muscle myosin II at specific cell-cell junctions of the auditory epithelium. We propose that the control of junctional mechanics is vital for the organisation of multi-cell-type epithelia. Sound is sensed in the cochlea through a precisely organised epithelium.

Here, the authors propose Sym-Q, an interactive reinforcement learning-based framework with a co-design mechanism that enables efficient and guided equation discovery. 
 Symbolic Regression holds great potential for uncovering underlying mathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast combinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for previous online search methods and pre-trained transformer models, which mostly do not consider the integration of domain experts’ prior knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network, an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous transformer-based SR approaches, Symbolic Q-network leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the Symbolic Q-network facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate Sym-Q performs comparably to existing pretrained models across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our experiments on real-world cases demonstrate that the interactive co-design mechanism significantly enhances Symbolic Q-network’s performance, achieving greater performance gains than standard autoregressive models.

 Many behavioral responses to climate change are carbon-intensive, raising concerns that adaptation may cause additional warming. The sign and magnitude of this feedback depend on how increased emissions from cooling balance against reduced emissions from heating across space and time. We present an empirical approach that forecasts the effect of future adaptive energy use on global average temperature over the 21st century. We estimate that energy-based adaptation will lower global mean surface temperature in 2099 by 0.07 to 0.12 °C relative to baseline projections under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. This cooling avoids 0.6 to 1.8 trillion U.S. Dollars ($2019) in damages, depending on the baseline emissions scenario. Energy-based adaptation lowers business-as-usual emissions for 85% of countries, reducing the mitigation required to meet their unilateral Nationally Determined Contributions by 20% on average. These findings indicate that while business-as-usual adaptive energy use is unlikely to accelerate warming, it raises important implications for countries’ existing mitigation commitments.

It occurs throughout diverse ecosystems and spans vast timescales, and could play an important role in shaping the co-evolution of Earth’s biosphere and geosphere. 
 Virtually all of Earth’s ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles are underpinned – and often driven – by the activity (or inactivity) of microorganisms. Dormancy, a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity, is ubiquitous among microbial communities in environments ranging from moderate to extreme. Dormancy enables microorganisms to withstand severe and widespread environmental changes. Here I argue that dormancy exerts a powerful influence on Earth’s ecological and biogeochemical architecture through space and time, and over vast scales. Dormancy manifests differently across taxonomically and functionally distinct microbial groups, and operates over timescales ranging from hours to millennia – enabling microorganisms to interact with the geosphere over geologically relevant timescales. As such, dormancy may play a crucial role in shaping ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles throughout the Earth system. Interdisciplinary, integrative geosphere-biosphere approaches will be essential for advancing our understanding of how microbial dormancy underpins the co-evolution of Earth, its biosphere, and their interactions.

Here, using super-resolution microscopy and immobilized influenza A virions enabling live imaging the authors show nanoscale receptor accumulation, endocytosis induction, and actin remodeling. 
 During infection, individual virions trigger specific cellular signaling at the virus-cell interface, a nanoscale region of the plasma membrane in direct contact with the virus. However, virus-induced receptor recruitment and cellular activation are transient processes that occur within minutes at the nanoscale. Hence, the temporal and spatial kinetics of such early events often remain poorly understood due to technical limitations. To address this challenge, we develop a protocol to covalently immobilize labelled influenza A viruses on glass surfaces before exposing them to live epithelial cells. Our method extends the observation time for virus-plasma membrane association while minimizing viral modifications, facilitating live imaging of virus-cell interactions. Using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, we investigate virus-receptor interaction showing that viral receptors exhibit reduced mobility at the virus-binding site, which leads to a specific local receptor accumulation and turnover. We further follow the dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the single-virus level and demonstrate the recruitment of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), previously thought to be uninvolved in influenza A virus infection. Finally, we examine the nanoscale organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the virus-binding site, showing a local and dynamic response of the cellular actin cortex to the infecting virus.

We present a new tracer-aided glacio-hydrological model constrained by multiple datasets for five major river basins of the Tibetan Plateau. We show that the contribution of glacier melt to the annual runoff is less than 5% in all the five basins at the outlets—much less than previous estimates. Our secondary finding is that the partitioning between surface runoff and groundwater flow varied greatly across the watersheds, with groundwater runoff contributing 35–75% of the annual runoff. The contribution of glacier melt has a strong spatial variability and scale dependency, but the population heavily dependent on it is limited, so a potential significant decrease in water resources due to glacier shrinkage is not a problem that should raise public worries in the Tibetan Plateau."

 The Arctic cryosphere is the epicentre of acute global change impact, with abrupt warming and amplification driving rapid sea ice decline and irreversible glacial ice loss. A key challenge is understanding how the cryosphere meltdown will impact Arctic marine carbon cycles and ecosystems. Here, we use organic geochemical biomarkers to trace the contribution of different planktonic groups to organic carbon in Arctic fjord sediments (Kongsfjorden, Svalbard) during past warmer and colder (than present) climate states.

 Global warming is increasing compound drought and heatwave events. This elevates vegetation loss probability. Despite spatial shifts in vegetation loss probability being crucial for predicting spatial redistribution patterns of vegetation vulnerability across terrestrial ecosystems, they remain poorly understood under compound drought and heatwave events. In this study, using a vine copula model, vegetation loss probability was quantified under compound drought and heatwave events. Spatial shift velocities of vegetation loss probability were examined using the concept of velocity change. Spatial shift velocities of vegetation loss probability would undergo substantial increase based on the satellite observations and future simulations. However, vegetation resistance to droughts buffers spatial shift velocities of vegetation loss probability (p < 0.01). These findings provide evidence that vegetation vulnerability patterns will undergo substantial spatial changes under compound drought and heatwave events, leading to a spatial redistribution of vegetation in disturbance-prone areas.

 Urbanization is revealed to cause more frequent and hotter day-night compound heatwaves, yet its impact on their onset remains unclear. This study compares summertime compound heatwaves in 722 urban-rural station pairs globally on an event-by-event basis during 1971-2017 and attributes their difference to numerous urbanization and climatological factors using interpretable machine learning methods. Here we find a discernible earlier onset (0.23 ± 0.04 days) of compound heatwaves in cities compared to rural areas. The magnitude of this influence is primarily determined by urban building volume and height rather than the artificial impervious surface fraction, and is exacerbated by climates characterized by warm night and ample daytime solar radiation. Taller buildings significantly advance onset in cloudy, warm, and humid climates, while larger building volumes lead to earlier onset of compound heatwaves across nearly all climates.

 Understanding what drives human migration in floodplains is critical for mitigating risks and enhancing resilience to floods. However, existing global analyses have not fully explored these complex dynamics. Here we introduce a metric, human-flood distance change, to track migration in floodplains from 2000 to 2018, exploring the interplay of climatic and anthropogenic influences. We find that in developing countries, including India, Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria, flood fatalities and displacement strongly influence migration decisions, often forcing populations to move away or toward flood-prone areas due to flood damage memory or resource needs. Conversely, regions with higher flood protection, such as the United States, show migration trends away from hazardous areas. Climatic drivers, like flood inundation area, exert stronger influences in Australia. Notably, in the Philippines and Kenya, the easing of drought-flood abrupt alternation has led to increased population movement toward flood-prone areas, underscoring the complex interactions between multiple hazards. In developing countries, flood fatalities and displacement impact people’s decision to migrate away, or toward flood zones, and in developed countries, people move away from flood areas, according to an analysis that uses a statistical approach and social and climate data."

 Quantifying the ocean’s ability to sequester atmospheric carbon is essential in a climate change context. Measurements of gravitational carbon export to the mesopelagic seldom balance the carbon demand or the oxygen consumption there, suggesting the potential presence of other mechanisms of carbon export. We deployed a biogeochemical Argo float in a cyclone in the Benguela upwelling system for five months, and estimated vertical carbon export and respiration in the eddy via particle imagery with an underwater vision profiler 6 in a quasi Lagrangian way. A sensitivity analysis shows that, under certain assumptions, oxygen consumption rates could match the carbon supply and carbon demand. We furthermore identified a mechanism of vertical particulate carbon export, the full eddy core submergence pump. Our analysis suggests that at 450 m depth, within this eddy, this pump exports about one fourth to half of the total carbon compared to the biological gravitational pump.

 According to few recent studies, exogenous organic matters (EOM) can be detectable on either emerging vegetation or bare soil using optical and radar remote sensing techniques. Nevertheless, these image processing approaches considered one single EOM, one season and/or year only and were limited to one surface condition prior to spreading. So far no method addressed the simultaneously tracking of both liquid and solid EOM applications using satellite imagery, for different years, seasons and surface conditions. Relying on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, this study aimed to track applications of both composted manure and liquid digestate over three seasons of successive years (late winter of 2019; spring of 2020 and 2021) in agricultural fields on a farm scale with distinct surface conditions (grassland, winter crop, bare soil). Within-field reference areas were delineated based on both the observed amendment practices, crops and soil map and randomly selected with replacement to train/ validate SVM with several iterations. Various feature sets composed of bands, signals and specific spectral indices from either Sentinel-2 and/or Sentinel-1 data served to compute SVM in a bootstrapping approach in order to produce a series of map results, to assess the final mode class and the uncertainty of map results. Classification performance was higher for pre- and post-application image pairs compared to post-application images alone and slightly improved when adding Sentinel-1 data. While the areal percentage of the highest uncertainty class covered less of 10% of the mapped area regardless of the year, the best models showed accuracies higher than 93% in 2020 and 2021. In 2019, the overall accuracy did not reach more than 79%, probably due to rainfall events and considerable time lags between the image pairs. This study underscores, not only the potential of Sentinel-2 and 1 for monitoring EOM applications, but also the requirement of better understanding the spectral behaviour of the EOM spreadings, in line with a thorough characterization of the sequence of crop technical management."

 Flood monitoring is a complex task involving multimodal data mining and multitask collaboration. In order to leverage the role of multimodal data in flood management, conducting visual-language pretraining (VLP) in the field of flood disaster monitoring and obtaining foundational pretraining models that are suitable for multiple downstream flood-related tasks is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. This paper introduces SLIP-Flood, an innovative VLP framework supporting flood image classification, image-text retrieval, and auxiliary text classification. To overcome the limitations of existing cross-modal models that rely on small datasets and lack robustness, we have constructed two specialized datasets for the first time: 1) FloodMulS for the Flood Image Classification Model (FICM), and 2) FloodIT for the Flood Text-Image Retrieval Model (FTIRM). Traditional models employ “Hard Categorization Strategy (HC)” for image classification, neglecting the impacts of “Categorization Ambiguity.” To improve performance, we propose a “Soft Categorization Strategy.” Furthermore, traditional models focus on unimodal (image) information, not fully utilizing joint image-text information. We address this with a “Soft Combination” to integrate FICM and FTIRM, termed SCSC. Experimental results show SCSC improves SLIP-Flood’s performance: a 7.62% increase in the F1 score on FICM compared to HC, and a 0.35% increase in FTIRM’s F1 score based on FICM. SLIP-Flood also achieves a maximum recall of 89.24% in image-text retrieval and shows promise in auxiliary flood text classification.

 The Valencian Anchor Station (VAS) (Spain) is an outstanding site operating as a central location for calibrating and validating numerous remote sensing instruments and products.

This research conducts a land cover classification within the VAS station (10 × 10 km2) and its surrounding area (30 × 30 km2) for 2021 using multi-temporal imagery from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI). Several aspects of land cover classification have been evaluated, including i) the feature selection, ii) the temporal resolution of time series (i.e., monthly, seasonal), iii) the performance of six Machine Learning algorithms (i.e., CART, GTB, k-NN, NB, RF, and SVM, alongside three deep learning models (FC-NN, MLP-ED, and ResCNN) and iv) the optimization of classifier tuning parameters. Furthermore, the study assesses the impact of reducing sample sizes on classifying similar areas, extending the classification to three buffers (1 km, 5 km and 10 km) without increasing reference data. ResCNN emerged as the best-performing model, yielding superior classification metrics (96 % overall accuracy and 95 % kappa score) in July, coinciding with the peak vineyard phenology. Producer’s and user’s accuracy values generally exceeded 90 % for most land cover classes, with some exceptions in more challenging categories such as artificial surfaces and non-irrigated arable land, which showed lower accuracies due to inter-class similarity. Overall, the findings underscore the robust performance of all models in land cover classification, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving high-quality classification with a robust methodology and limited training data."

Mass balance controls for marine and terrestrial ice sheets differ, and proxy data collected far from Antarctica provide valuable but limited insight into regional processes. We evaluate clast abundance data from Antarctic marine sedimentary records, observing a strong signal of eccentricity and precession coincident with a terrestrial ice sheet and a clear obliquity signal at the margins of a marine ice sheet. These analyses are integrated with a synthesis of proxy data, and we argue that high variance in obliquity forcing (mediated and enhanced by the ocean and atmosphere) can inhibit ice sheet growth, even when insolation forcing is conducive to glaciation. This “obliquity disruption” explains cryosphere variability before the existence of large northern hemisphere ice sheets."

Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasomes suppressed the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-13) and DTA. The NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated secretome reduced differentiation and migration of stem cells. Neutralizing IL-1β or replenishing docosatrienoic acid accelerated enthesis regeneration.

Consequently, an upconverted afterglow material was constructed with amazing luminescence performance albeit its moderate fluorescence emission property. The generality of this strategy was evidenced by the adaptation to similar emitters with varied emission wavelengths.

However, the specific role of leptin in OA severity and pain is not known. Using lipodystrophic (LD) mice, we show that fat-secreted factors are required for knee OA development, implicating a fat-cartilage cross-talk. Fat pad implantation or systemic leptin restoration in LD mice reintroduced structural OA and pain, whereas implantation of leptin-deficient fat pad did not change OA susceptibility. Isochronic parabiosis and spatial transcriptomics confirmed that a fat-joint cross-talk likely occurred via soluble mediators. Global unsupervised multiomics of conditioned media from fat implants revealed that leptin exerts a regulatory effect on adipsin (or complement factor D), the activity of which modulates the contrastive OA structural and pain phenotype. These findings suggest that adipokines influence OA pathogenesis, providing conclusive evidence of a fat-joint cross-talk and implicating OA as a systemic disease of adipose tissue."

Previous research has shown that the surface texture needs to break the spatial symmetry to enable self-propulsion. Here, we demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking in the gas-liquid flow above the texture generates substantial self-propulsion forces, driving drops on symmetric textured surfaces. Using a model of hydrodynamically coupled driven oscillators and computational fluid dynamic simulations, we show that drops are propelled by the pressure field of the vapor. We analyze the influence of drop size, temperature, and structural parameters of the substrate on the propulsion velocity. Furthermore, we observe similar self-propulsion in liquid nitrogen, ethanol, and liquid rings, indicating broad applicability. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic symmetry breaking of the gas-liquid interface in driving large-scale liquid motion and provide a potential path for efficient thermal-mechanical energy conversion."

The noncovalent immobilization of ZnR2molecules within the resultant crystalline networks allows their structural characterization in a new confined environment. The great potential of the reported assemblies is demonstrated by efficient separation of ZnMe2from a mixture of ZnMe2/ZnEt2.

Many pathologies arise due to disruptions in tissue-specific G0, yet little is known about the temporal-spatial mechanisms that establish G0and its signaling hub, primary cilia. Mechanistic insight is limited by asynchronous model systems and failure to connect context-specific, transient mechanisms to function. To address this gap, we developed STAMP (synchronized temporal-spatial analysis via microscopy and phosphoproteomics) to track changes in cellular landscape occurring throughout G0transition and ciliogenesis. We synchronized ciliogenesis and G0transition in two cell models and combined microscopy with phosphoproteomics to order signals for further targeted analyses.

Here, we present an efficient silicon-chip platform using bound states in the continuum to overcome these limitations. In addition to a low propagation loss of 0.5 ± 0.5 decibels per centimeter, our experiments demonstrate an order-of-magnitude enhancement in light absorption compared to previous traditional silicon hybrid designs.

Such PhC nanostructured WS2/WSe2hetero-bilayers not only provide new exciton states but also offer guided mode resonances that can self-couple to excitons to enable light manipulation at the atomic thickness scale. Moreover, leveraging the unique momentum dispersion of guided mode resonances, exciton emissions are selectively excited and separated in the energy-momentum space.

We observe its nonequilibrium phase diagram characterized by a second-order phase transition. Below a critical drive strength, the atoms quickly reach the so-called superradiant steady state featuring a macroscopic dipole moment; above the critical point, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations. At longer times, spontaneous emission transforms the second-order transition into a discontinuous first-order transition.

Notably, the dimethylamino group–decorated catalyst demonstrated stable and nearly 100% CO2-to-CO reduction selectivity over a wide potential range and high CO partial current densities up to 300 milliamperes per square centimeter. Theoretical and in situ spectroscopic analyses revealed the critical role of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in activating the metal center, which can be facilitated by the decoration of electron-withdrawing groups. Conversely, electron-donating groups, although requiring higher energy for protonation, enhance the synergy between metal centers and protonated sites, favoring the formation of key *COOH intermediates and improving CO selectivity at higher bias.

We experimentally validate that the concentration of inducer required to activateE. coli’slacoperon increases quadratically with growth rate when varying nutrients but is invariant when varying growth rate through translation inhibition. We further establish that this growth-coupled sensitivity (GCS) allows bacteria to implement concentration-dependent sugar preferences, in which a new carbon source is used only if its concentration is sufficient to improve upon the current growth rate. Using microfluidics in combination with time-lapse microscopy, we validate this prediction at the single-cell level using mixtures of glucose and lactose.

Transcriptional analysis enabled discrimination of bona fide Ag-specific T cells from cytokine-activated Tregand TH22 cells. CXCR4 down-regulation emerged as a hallmark of clonotypic expansion and TCR-dependent activation in memory CD4+T cells and cTfh. By tracking tetramer-binding cells upon Ag restimulation, we demonstrated that CXCR4−CD137+cells provided a more accurate measure of Ag-specificity than standard AIM readouts.

At the same time, mechanical stresses from the microenvironment and cellular shape changes compress and bend microtubules. Yet, centrosomes are membraneless organelles, raising the question of how centrosomes withstand mechanical forces. Here, we discover that centrosomes can deform and even fracture. We reveal that centrosomes experience deformations during navigational pathfinding within motile cells. Coherence of the centrosome is maintained by Dyrk3 and cNAP1, preventing fracturing by forces. While cells can compensate for the depletion of centriolar-based centrosomes, the fracturing of centrosomes impedes cellular function by generating coexisting microtubule organizing centers that compete during path navigation and thereby cause cellular entanglement in the microenvironment.

Therefore, interventions such as stress-hardening by thermal preconditioning could become crucial for their survival. This study aimed to systematically assess the effects of distinct thermal preconditioning regimes (stable-high at 29 °C, variable-high at 29 ± 1.5 °C, and stable-ambient control at 26 °C) on the baseline physiology and thermal tolerance of six stony coral species (Galaxea fascicularis, Porites rus, Acropora muricata, Montipora digitata, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Stylophora pistillata) to determine commonalities in the stress-hardening responses that transcend species-specific signatures. For this, we quantified changes in photosynthetic efficiency and bleaching intensity before and after a short-term heat stress assay and up to 30 days later. Stress-hardening was successful in all preconditioned corals, with the variable-high regime slightly outperforming the stable-high regime. Preconditioning reduced the heat stress response by up to 90%, yet species differed in receptiveness. It also improved resilience (survival and recovery), and corals with high inherent thermal tolerance recovered better than susceptible species.

In this study, based on a simple one-step pyrolysis method, we designed a Cu single-atom catalyst with high active site exposure and a locally electron-deficient environment (HE Cu1–N4) to achieve maximum utilization efficiency in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR). Using advanced characterization techniques, we confirmed that its unique 3D structure enhances Cu atom exposure and reduces nitrate (NO3–) mass transfer resistance. Synchrotron radiation and DFT calculations showed that adjusting the coordination environment induces a local electron-deficient effect in Cu atoms, increasing the electrostatic attraction to NO3–. HE Cu1–N4 achieved 100% NH3 selectivity across a wide range of NO3– concentrations, with an NH3 yield (5.09 mg h–1 mgcat–1) nearly 7-fold higher than that of the conventional unmodified Cu single-atom catalyst (Cu1–N2, 0.73 mg h–1 mgcat–1). Under pilot-scale conditions, HE Cu1–N4 demonstrated strong resistance to interference and excellent stability in complex water systems. A simple modification method enhanced the utilization efficiency of single atoms in single-atom catalysts, significantly improving the catalytic activity of the material. Moreover, this straightforward synthesis strategy holds promise for the large-scale production of single-atom catalysts, paving the way for practical engineering applications."

Here, a cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the associations of PFAS with genotoxic biomarkers. We recruited a cohort of 453 residents in 2021 in Zhejiang, China. Thirty PFAS in serum were quantified, alongside seven indicators of genomic stability [five rDNA copy numbers (rDNA-CN), mitochondrial DNA copy numbers (mtDNA-CN), and relative telomere length (RTL)] in whole blood. Results showed that PFUnDA, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), 6:2 Cl-PFESA, and PFO5DoDA were positively correlated with rDNA-CN, while PFHpA, PFOA, and PFMOAA showed inverse associations.

However, mechanisms of its survival in such environments remain seldom explored. In this study, the acute toxicity of selenomethionine (Se-Met) in a variety of species (four oviparous and four ovoviviparous species) was evaluated, followed by the chronic effects of Se-Met on G. affinis and on zebrafish (Danio rerio (D. rerio)), focusing on Se accumulation in the gonads and offspring, reproductive biology, and offspring development. Our results showed that the LC50-96h of Se-Met was the largest in G. affinis among the eight fish, confirming its elevated resistance to Se. Meanwhile, the transcripts of genes related to selenoproteins and sulfoproteins showed opposite responses between G. affinis and D. rerio to Se-Met exposure, along with the altered levels of total selenoproteins in oviparous but not in ovoviviparous fish. The chronic exposures showed that Se levels in the gonads, effects on gonadal development and embryonic and early larval development, and Se efflux in the embryos and larvae were apparently different between G. affinis and D. rerio. Finally, differentially expressed genes (particularly antioxidant and inflammation) were mostly stimulated in G. affinis but inhibited in D. rerio. This study has demonstrated that the Se efflux capacity of the offspring and genes related to Se metabolism and antioxidant physiology can help partially explain the survival of G. affinis in Se-contaminated ecosystems."

However, the precipitation response to this recent forest cover change remains unclear. Here, we examined biophysical effects of forest cover change in the Brazilian Amazon on dry season precipitation using a regional coupled climate model with embedded water vapor tracers. We find that the 3.2% mean reduction in forest cover that occurred in Rondônia and Mato Grosso during 2002–2015 caused a 3.5 ± 0.8% reduction in evapotranspiration and a 5.4 ± 4.4% reduction in precipitation. The reduction in evapotranspiration warmed and dried the lower atmosphere reducing convection and precipitation. Reductions in incoming moisture, dominated by reduced moisture inflow in the mid‐troposphere, accounted for 25% of the total reduction in moisture and amplified the precipitation response to forest loss. The reduction in precipitation efficiency explains 84.5% of the reduction in precipitation with the remainder due to reductions in precipitable water. The reduced precipitation sourced from water vapor inflow accounts for 76.9% of the simulated precipitation reduction, with the remaining 23.1% due to reduced local evapotranspiration.

To our knowledge, no soil carbon model accounts for the inputs of OCpetro to soils, resulting in significant gaps in our understanding about the roles OCpetro plays in soils. Here, we call for cross‐disciplinary research to investigate the transport and stability of OCpetro across the bedrock–soil continuum. We pose four key questions as motivation for this effort.

We find that initial pore structure significantly influences the dissolution pattern, with reaction rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than batch conditions, given solute and fluid‐solid boundary constraints. Flow unevenness determines the location and rate of dissolution. We propose two models describing expected dissolution patterns and effective reaction rates based on dimensionless metrics for flow, transport, and reaction. Finally, we analyze feedback between evolving flow and pore structure to understand conditions that regulate/reinforce dissolution hotspots.

Model runs initialized with two independent reanalyses show significant and systematic differences in MJO circulation amplitude that emerge rapidly and persist over the 15‐day forecast period. Additional analysis suggests the reason is due to differences in the initial atmospheric static stability. Specifically, the reanalysis that is initially less stable is associated with enhanced large‐scale vertical motion and divergent winds throughout the forecast. Notably, a convection‐based MJO index shows less sensitivity to initial conditions, suggesting that the differences in MJO circulation amplitude arise through mechanisms other than changes in convection or diabatic heating."

Butterfly distributions are formed due to pitch‐angle scattering and the combined effect of the loss processes. For the observed spectrum of oscillations, it is estimated that Alfvénic turbulence drives order of magnitude depletions of outer radiation belt electron fluxes at relativistic energies over a period of a few hours. On the other hand, at lower energies, energization in transverse Alfvénic electric fields leads to enhancements of the electron spectrum to provide a source population for subsequent acceleration to higher energies and, in concert with the loss processes, provides exponential spectral form as a function of energy."

Freshwater budget analysis suggests that future LFWC changes are strongly influenced by sea ice melt. The conversion from solid to liquid phase provides more liquid freshwater into the ocean. Meanwhile, sea ice loss enhances the efficiency of air‐sea momentum transfer, leading to increased wind‐driven freshwater convergence and its variability.

 Recent advances in our understanding of cyanobacterial photoacclimation have the potential to improve photosynthetic efficiency in crops. Whereas oxygenic photosynthesis typically relies on visible light, some cyanobacteria acclimate to absorb far-red light, thus expanding the absorbance cross-section of their photosystems. This expanded absorbance range, via the implementation of red-shifted chromophores, could be bioengineered into crops to enhance yields by capturing more light energy and boosting photosynthetic efficiency in light-limited environments.

Here, the authors report that p53 protein degradation triggered by the MYC/URI axis, is an early event essential for tumor initiation in Wnt activation-based CRC models. 
 Incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing likely due to different mechanisms driving initiation and progression. The initial model proposed by Fearon and Vogelstein posits it as a multi-hit neoplasia, originating from adenomatous-polyps induced by WNT activation, ultimately progressing to aggressiveness through p53 loss. Integrating human data with mouse genetics, we redefine this paradigm, highlighting pivotal roles of MYC, oncogenic URI and p53 degradation to initiate CRC. Early APC loss activates MYC to transcriptionally upregulate URI, which modulates MDM2 activity, triggering p53 proteasomal degradation, essential for tumour initiation and mutation burden accrual in CRC mice. Remarkably, reinstating p53 levels via genetic URI depletion or p53 super-expression in CRC mice with WNT pathway activation prevents tumour initiation and extends lifespan. Our data reveal a “two-hit” genetic model central to APC loss-driven CRC initiation, wherein MYC/URI axis intricately controls p53 degradation, offering mechanistic insights into transitional mutation acquisition essential for CRC progression.

 Single atom and nanocluster catalysts are extensively investigated in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high catalytic activity and atomic utilization, while their coexisting properties and potentially synergistic effect are yet to be clarified. Herein, we construct three systems of atomic-scale catalysts (xNi/Mo2TiAlC2, x = 0.5, 1, and 1.5) for bio-ethanol reforming, which correspond to single atoms, single atoms mixed with nanoclusters, and nanoclusters. The respective hydrogen utilization efficiency of mixed-form catalyst increases by 43.7% and 29.3% compared to single atom and nanocluster catalysts. Results demonstrate that the adjacent Ni single atom facilitates electron transfer from Mo2TiAlC2 to Ni-Mo interface and raises the d-band center, thus enhancing bio-ethanol adsorption and activation; while the existence of Ni nanoclusters contributes to lowering the energy barriers of CH3CHO* dehydrogenation.

While APB interacts with the N-terminal photosensory module of phyB (phyBPSM), it remains unclear whether APA interacts with phyAPSM. We report that both phyA and phyB interact with APA through C-terminal output module of phy (phyOPM), while phyB interacts additionally with APB through phyBPSM.

The full-length phy-APA interaction is light-dependent, whereas the underlying phyOPM-APA interaction is not. We show that the Pr form, not the Pfr, of phyPSM competes with APA for phyOPM binding, explaining how the light-dependent phy-APA interaction arises from the light-independent phyOPM-APA interaction.

 As the ocean absorbs over 90% of excess radiative heat, recent ocean warming is shaped by a combination of anthropogenic surface heat gain and dynamical processes redistributing heat. To distinguish these contributions, we introduce a novel framework that decomposes temperature changes into three components: ‘spice’ (density-compensated variability) and ‘heave’ (density-contributing variability), with heave further divided into ‘passive’ (net warming) and ‘dynamic’ (redistribution) contributions. Passive heave captures anthropogenic warming subducted along isopycnals, while spice and dynamic heave, which globally sum to zero, represent heat redistribution. Observations and climate models demonstrate general agreement on passive heave, establishing it as a key oceanic fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change. In contrast, dynamic heave, driven by interannual-to-decadal variability, exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity, with notable discrepancies between models and observations. This framework links ocean heat uptake to sea-level change, with passive heave driving global thermosteric rise and dynamic heave contributing to regional dynamic sea level changes."

 The world’s largest diversion-type hydropower system will be created on the Yarlung-Tsangpo Grand Canyon. The canyon, a critical region for hydropower development and ecological conservation, faces challenges under climate change. Here we evaluate the water-energy-ecosystem nexus in this hydropower system using the Water and Energy Transfer Processes in Large River Basins model and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III model. Key findings reveal that reservoir operations with medium replenishment flow (1000 m³ s−1) during dry periods achieve an optimal balance among hydropower generation annually (2231 × 108 kWh), flood mitigation (peak clipping rate 22.8%), and minimal ecosystem impact (eco-index 0.45). Hydropower development stabilizes runoff regimes, enhances flood control capacity under climate scenarios (e.g., 29.2% peak reduction under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 126), and mitigates downstream flood risks while supporting dry-season irrigation and navigation. Notably, under low-forcing climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 126), ecosystem stability is sustained primarily through the gradual and consistent replenishment of water resources from stabilized snowpack and glacial reserves. Transboundary cooperation is strengthened through adaptive reservoir management, ensuring energy security for China and flood protection for downstream nations.

 Understanding the impacts of glacier change on riverine ecosystems is limited by a lack of multi-year studies in glacierized mountain catchments quantifying the magnitude and stoichiometry of riverine biogeochemical yields. Here we evaluate riverine concentration-discharge relationships using the power function between daily runoff and element yields and stoichiometry across 10 catchments of varying glacial coverage within two climatically distinct regions in the Gulf of Alaska. Our multi-year study showed that biogeochemical stoichiometry and concentration-discharge relationships for dissolved carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus varied significantly with catchment glacier coverage across both regions. This stoichiometric variability could drive regional differences in proglacial riverine food webs given that high trophic levels in low productivity rivers are generally driven by bottom-up controls. The coherence of our findings across the Gulf of Alaska suggests that observed patterns in concentration-discharge relationships are likely globally generalizable to catchments in which discharge is dominated by glacier ice and/or snowmelt.

 Intertidal zones are transitional areas between marine and terrestrial systems and are significant for ecological systems, socio-economic activities, and coastal erosion mitigation. However, intertidal topography is often degraded and lost by natural coastal processes and anthropogenic impacts. Accurate and frequent mapping of intertidal topography is essential for effective coastal management. Previous studies have relied on ground-based surveys or shoreline method using satellite imagery to measure intertidal topography, but these approaches are often limited in spatial extent and temporal resolution. To address these limitations, we propose LogiTide2DEM, a novel method for reconstructing intertidal topography. This method uses logistic regression to determine optimal tide heights for water-land differentiation as surface elevation using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. The advantages of LogiTide2DEM include: a pixel-based approach rather than shoreline methods, elevation constraints using tidal height records, adaptive elevation estimation using logistic regression, and integrated quality assessment of topographic data. We applied and validated LogiTide2DEM on the Changhua coast in central-western Taiwan, reconstructing 22 years (2002–2023) of intertidal topography. Results show root-mean-square differences in elevation ranging from 0.24 m to 0.59 m, with the ratio of mean absolute error to the DEM elevation range between 11 % and 13 %, and correlation coefficients of 0.69 to 0.81.

 Crop yield estimation is vital for agricultural management but often struggles with predicting extreme values that can significantly impact operations and markets. Traditional models face challenges with these extremes, leading to biased and inaccurate predictions. To address this challenge, our study introduces two innovative strategies. First, we propose a cost-sensitive loss function, ExtremeLoss, designed to better capture and represent less frequent yield values by giving greater importance to extreme cases during training. Second, we develop a conditional deep learning model that enhances feature representation by conditioning on a binned yield observation map. This approach encourages smoother and more coherent input feature maps across different segments of the yield value range by leveraging similarities within and across yield bins, ultimately improving the model’s ability to generalize and distinguish between subtle variations in yield. This approach creates ”yield zone maps,” grouping yields into classes (e.g., low extreme, common, high extreme) to improve the identification of yield variability, which can be removed during inference. Our model was tested on a comprehensive grape yield dataset from 2016 to 2019, covering 2,200 hectares and 42 blocks of eight cultivars. We compared its performance against advanced techniques such as Focal-R loss, label distribution smoothing, dense weighting, and class-balanced methods under two validation scenarios: block-hold-out (BHO) and year-block-hold-out (YBHO). Our approach outperforms existing models in R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, it reduces MAE by +2.98 and +14.45 (t/ha) for low and high extremes in the BHO scenario and by +7.18 and +11.05 (t/ha) in the YBHO scenario. It also significantly decreases MAPE by +19.09% and +23.94% in the BHO scenario and by +33.76% and +19.61% in the YBHO scenario.

 The increased demand for forest management, particularly thinning, in Japan is a direct consequence of aging planted forests. However, forest inventories (FI) in Japan lack crucial details regarding the developmental stage or ecological status of forests, often only providing tree species, age, and owner information. The relative yield index (Ry) is a forest density index widely used in the forestry industry in Japan. It can be combined with tree height data to calculate tree density, diameter at breast height, timber volume, and basal area at breast height as the stand scale. Although Ry is a valuable indicator for forest management, no studies have been reported on its estimation over a large spatial scale. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to estimate the Ry of planted Japanese cedar and cypress forests at the stand scale over a large area by combining satellite imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, which offer excellent vertical resolution.Data on surface temperature, which is sensitive to differences in forest density, was obtained from Landsat8 satellite imagery. Considering that surface temperature is highly dependent on topography, we developed a topography-aware normalized surface temperature index (ΩST) using surface temperature data and a digital elevation model. The leaf area index (LAI), which was positively correlated with Ry, was estimated from the enhanced vegetation index obtained from Landsat. A normalized LAI (ΩLAI) was developed to address differences in LAI attributable to tree height. The Ry estimation index (Ry_estimated) calculated using ΩST and ΩLAI was correlated with the Ry estimated from LiDAR data (correlation coefficient; r = 0.61–0.65), confirming its high accuracy (root mean square error; RMSE = 0.07–0.11). By applying this method to a 3,650 km2 area of planted Japanese cedar and cypress forests in the Kanto region of Japan, large-scale and detailed information on various forest characteristics was obtained. This method derives tree height data from LiDAR and extracts forest density information from satellite imagery. The combination of LiDAR data and satellite imagery potentially enhances the accuracy of forest-based estimates, reduces data acquisition costs, and improves the efficiency of creating and updating FIs."

Macroscopic and microscopic perspectives were employed to determine the contents of 11 heavy metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba, and Pb) and one metalloid (As). The results revealed that the total average mass concentrations of the 12 metal elements followed the order: chimney (9598.64 ng·m−3) > workshop (7332.94 ng·m−3) > factory area (3104.31 ng·m−3) > control point B (2073.21 ng·m−3) > control point A (1004.74 ng·m−3). Fe, Ti, Zn, and Ni were the primary contributors to total metal content at each sampling site. Seasonal variations in heavy metal concentrations were minimal. Fe had the highest mass concentration among the metals at all sites (>60 %), whereas the Cr (VI) and As concentrations significantly exceeded the permitted levels. The particle types with a relatively high number in single particles emitted from chimney were mineral particles (31.58 %), iron-containing metal oxides (26.32 %), and soot aggregates (23.68 %). Mixed particles are primarily present as external mixtures. The AERMOD model simulation indicated significant regional dispersion of PM2.5 within 10 km, which was corroborated by sample analysis at the nearby control point. Indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio modeling demonstrated that heavy metal concentrations were generally higher in workshops than in factory areas, suggesting the potential diffusion of some heavy metals from workshops to the factory atmosphere. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis showed that Fe was highly enriched (EF > 3000) at all sampling sites, with EFs at the control points exceeding 1000. These findings suggest that industrial emissions from the foundry industry in Handan contributed significantly to the ambient atmospheric Fe levels. Health risk assessment indicated a substantial non-carcinogenic risk (CR; hazard index >1) and a moderate CR (10−4 ≤ CR < 10−3) for the study area. Co, Cr (VI), Mn, and Pb pose significant non-CR, whereas Cr (VI) and As have been identified as key contributors to CR."

 Bioaerosols and associated health risks are increasingly scrutinized amid improving air quality and recurrent public health crises in China. However, the response of bioaerosols to the process of improving air quality remains unclear. Consequently, multi-year (2015–2023) bioaerosol samples were collected at two sampling sites (Yanta and Weishui) and analyzed using fluorescence counting combined with high-throughput sequencing to investigate long-term trends in bioaerosol concentrations and bacterial communities. Additionally, Prophet and XGBoost-SHAP models elucidated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bioaerosol concentrations and identified key drivers of bioaerosol fluctuations. Results showed that, unlike the decreasing trends in PM2.5 concentrations, bioaerosol concentrations initially decreased from (3.71 ± 0.88) × 105 cells/m3 to (0.7 ± 0.36) × 105 cells/m3 during 2015–2019, but rebounded to (7.54 ± 3.75) × 105 cells/m3 following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022), highlighting the complex interplay between policy interventions and public health disruptions. Notably, increases in bioaerosol concentrations correlated with influenza incidence rates, reflecting its potential health risks. Bacterial diversity was higher during the Blue Sky Defense War (2018–2020) than in other periods, while the dominant phylum (Proteobacteria, relative abundance range 32 %–89 %) were relatively stable. Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Paucibacter were the dominant genera during the observation period, and COVID-19 pandemic changed the structure of bacterial communities. Additionally, O3 correlated more significantly with long-term trends of bioaerosols than SO2 and RH.

This study finds that the seasonal delay of tropical rainfall is much more pronounced under spatially patterned sea surface temperature (SST) warming compared to uniform SST warming. Through the lens of the atmospheric energetic framework, we show that the enhanced seasonal delay is primarily driven by the interhemispheric contrast in SST warming between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, which intensifies the inter‐seasonal difference in cross‐equatorial atmospheric energy transport between transition seasons. The SST warming features are found to be crucial, characterized by both its seasonal cycle and annual mean. The former is closely related to the seasonal delay of SST, especially in the northern high latitude, while the latter is further demonstrated by an atmospheric model forced with the annual‐mean spatially patterned SST warming."

These records, along with diatom environmental indicators, suggest the Bølling‐Allerød had high silicic acid availability related to a shift from stratification to seasonal upwelling dynamics. We thus propose the primary cause of the high productivity event was increased macronutrient supply from vertical exchange that injected old, nutrient‐rich, CO2‐rich waters into the surface.

We investigate infiltration at two scales, near‐surface and deep crustal. We estimate infiltration timescales, revealing that near‐surface water loss enhances aeolian erosion over short periods (hours to days). Deep crustal recharge, which requires decades to centuries, affects the deep aquifer response and the water budget. Martian crustal heterogeneity influences infiltration dynamics and runoff production making them dependent on the duration of precipitation. This interaction suggests that the responses of the aquifers to recharge events and groundwater upwelling likely lag behind climate optimum conditions.

Frictional heterogeneity is imposed through alternating velocity‐strengthening and velocity‐weakening (VW) patches, over length scales spanning from those representative of basement relief (several km) to the entrainment of contrasting lithologies (100s of m). The resulting fault behavior is controlled by: (a) the average frictional properties of the fault, and (b) the size of VW blocks relative to a critical length scale.

Results show that WRF‐CPM captures the observed MCS frequency and precipitation patterns but overestimates them in most areas, which might be related to the overestimated moisture and CAPE. The model also reproduces the eastward propagation of MCSs, albeit at a slightly faster speed and longer duration. MCSs in WRF‐CPM exhibits realistic life cycles in terms of cloud top temperature, convective core area, and precipitation. WRF‐CPM tends to overestimate rainfall frequency over 20 mm/hr while underestimates rainfall per MCS, possibly due to an overestimated number and area. The model captures the diurnal cycle of MCSs well in most of East China, though it shows a 2‐hr delay in southeast China and produces the peak a few hours earlier to the east of Tibetan Plateau. Total column water vapor (TCWV) and wind shear are well‐established factors controlling MCS behavior and rainfall, yet capturing the effects remains a challenge for CP models.

Additionally, CMTBH-30 is consistent with the 3D-GIoBFP dataset, achieving RMSEs ranging from 5.34 m to 8.95 m across ten cities. Our findings reveal an increase in average built-up heights in China from 10.28 m in 2005 to 10.92 m in 2020, reflecting an upward trend in urban development. Additionally, the standard deviation of built-up heights rises from 5.16 m in 2005 to 7.71 m in 2020, indicating increased height variation nationwide. Regional analysis from 2005 to 2020 highlights notable vertical growth in newly expanded built-up areas in Macau (+14.4 m), Hong Kong (+12.3 m), and Guangdong (+12.3 m), while Qinghai (+3.8 m) and Chongqing (+3.0 m) also experienced significant growth in stable built-up areas. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, and Taiwan exhibited minimal growth. The CMTBH-30 dataset effectively captures fine-grained built-up heights, addressing the gap in multi-temporal built-up height estimation. This study provides a new dimension for urban research and is valuable for a multitude of applications such as urban planning, disaster management, and sustainable development.

 This study analyzes the PM2.5 and Black Carbon (BC) concentrations, along with changes in spectral absorption and Brown Carbon (BrC) characteristics between residential and urban background sites in Athens, Greece, during intense wintertime pollution events occurring in the festive period (25 December 2023–6 January 2024). It aims to examine the magnitude of differences in PM2.5, BC concentrations and spectral absorption properties between the residential area and an urban background site, due to different aerosol emission rates from various sources and mixing processes in the urban atmosphere, with emphasis on intense pollution events generated by recreational activities. The results show excellent inter-site correlations for PM2.5, BC, BrC and absorption properties during most of the examining period, suggesting mainly common source and well-mixing processes in the Athens area. However, during the evening and night hours of 24, 25, 31 December and 1st January, the BC levels, BrC absorption at 370 nm and PM2.5 concentrations were up to 3 times higher at the residential site, reflecting the enhanced direct emissions from residential wood burning (RWB), increased nighttime traffic for recreational purposes at neighborhoods at Christmas and New Year nights. Alarming BC concentrations reaching up to 25–29 μg m−3 were observed during the night hours at the residential site (PM2.5 and BC means of 28.1 and 6.3 μg m−3, respectively), which highly deteriorate the atmospheric environment, being responsible for urban haze and harmful effects on human health. The high light absorption coefficients at 370 nm by BC (66 Mm−1) and BrC (51.3 Mm−1) may modulate atmospheric chemistry and contributes to regional atmospheric warming, while there is evidence of well-mixing processes regarding the aerosol concentrations and spectral absorption during daytime in the Athens atmosphere."

 Lightning data monitored by a very low frequency/low frequency (VLF/LF) three-dimensional lightning detection and position system were assimilated using a mesoscale numerical model and its three-dimensional variational assimilation system. A case study was conducted on a double rainband weather event in Fujian, China, on 7 May 2018, which included both shear-line precipitation and warm-sector rainfall. The impact of assimilating lightning data at cloud resolving scales was investigated through a series of comparative experiments, involving situations with and without lightning data assimilation, assimilation at different times, and assimilation under various parameter combinations. The results showed that assimilating lightning data significantly improved the simulation of the southeastward-moving shear-line rainband in inland Fujian and the northeastward-moving warm-sector rainband along the Fujian coast. The simulation of the warm-sector rainstorm was improved greatly. This improvement in simulating the coastal warm-sector rainstorm through lightning data assimilation was attributed not only to the increases in the relative humidity and cloud microphysical quantities, but also to the enhancement of wind convergence along the southwest jet in the ultra-low-level layer over the Fujian coastal region. The simulation of heavy rainfall in the double rainband was improved both in the individual assimilation of lightning data at 0200 and 0800 BT (Beijing Time), as well as in the simultaneous assimilation of lightning data at these two times. The modelling with assimilating lightning data at 0200 BT produced a greater improvement than that at 0800 BT. Moreover, the results from the simultaneous assimilation at both times were superior to those from individual assimilation at a single time. The simulation of the double rainband was also improved when assimilating lightning data under various parameter combinations, each yielding distinct improvements. The threat scores (TS) for 12-h rainfall were increased greatly, with the missing and empty report rates heavily reduced. The simulation accuracy for moderate rain, heavy rain, rainstorm and heavy rainstorm all improved obviously. Additionally, the TS for 1-h rainfall also increased, with a positive effect extending to 12–18 h."

 Meteorological droughts have magnitude and migration characteristics due to their spatiotemporal construction. A comprehensive identification of these characteristics and quantification of their dominant factors are crucial for drought risk mitigation and forecasting efforts. However, migration characteristics have often been overlooked in previous studies, and the dominant factors affecting drought remain ambiguous. In this study, migration characteristics was described by a series of indicators, e.g., migration trajectory and drought speed (DV). We also proposed the rate of expansion (RE) for overall drought areas to quantify the evolution of the outmost shape boundary, based on 3-dimensional droughts. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), a unified method to interpret the predictions of complex machine learning models, was used to quantify the importance of driving factors on characteristics. The results showed that: (1) severe meteorological droughts were predominantly concentrated in east region of the Yangtze River Basin, characterized by prolonged duration, high severity, rapid DV, and extensive affected areas along with high RE; (2) RE was large in March and April, ranging from 2.0 to 7.37, while negative RE frequently occurred in August, indicating contractions of affected area (DA); (3) soil moisture emerged as the primary driving factor influencing drought characteristics, with an average relative importance of 21.3 %, followed by vertically integrated water vapor flux (16.1 %) and temperature (15.6 %); and (4) while human activities exerted weaker impacts compared to climate factors, they demonstrated increasing trends in DA and RE. Overall, this study shed three-dimensional insights into meteorological drought evolution and driving mechanism exploration, which provided strategies for drought prediction and proactive prevention."
